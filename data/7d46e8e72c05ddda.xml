			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys overreact to everything that happened in a wild week 5 of the NFL season including how the Bills look to be unstoppable, a tale of two halves in London as the Packers looked terrible in the second half as the Giants got a massive win, which makes us wonder, are the Giants for real? The Cowboys getting another huge win over the Rams, if the Cardinals are ever going to figure things out and whether or not Kyler and Kliff Kingsbury hate each other, the Patriots beating the hell out of the Patriots, the Jets potentially being a team to be reckoned with, go around the internet to look at some overreactions from the public, and everything else that happened in another great week of NFL action, before previewing tonight’s Monday Night Football game between the Raiders and Chiefs.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat joins AJ Hawk and the boys live from the set of College GameDay in Lawrence, Kansas to chat about last night's Thursday Night Football game between the Colts and Broncos that went to overtime and saw no touchdown's scored, why there isn't much to be excited about if you're a Colts fan, or a Broncos fan, if the Broncos can figure things out and why they seemingly seem broken with Russell Wilson, if we know who these teams are moving forward, and how that was possibly the most boring football game of all-time, before Pat and AJ go through the entire week 5 NFL slate and make their picks and predictions against the spread (1:25:36-1:42:03). Make sure you subscribe to <a href="http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show, and tune in to ESPN tomorrow from 9-Noon Eastern for College GameDay.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today&apos;s show, Pat and the boys chat about last night&apos;s Monday Night Football game between the Colts and Ravens, Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews having an unbelievable night, and where the Colts go from here. They also cover the news coming out of Las Vegas as Jon Gruden has officially resigned as Head Coach of the Las Vegas Raiders following emails that were leaked between him and former President/GM of the Washington Football Team, Bruce Allen. Joining the program for his weekly installment of Aaron Rodgers Tuesday fresh off a thrilling win in Cincinnati against the Bengals is the Quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about this weekend&apos;s game, what he told Joe Burrow after the game, what he thinks about the whole Jon Gruden situation, if he talked to Mason Crosby during the game at all, what Packers/Bears week means, and much more (23:06-1:06:44). Next, GM of the LA Chargers, Tom Telesco joins the show to chat about the Chargers incredible start, how much of a difference maker Brandon Staley has been, Justin Herbert continuing to get better and better, what his duties as a GM are like during the season, and where he thinks the NFL needs to go from here in response to the Jon Gruden situation (1:06:48-1:19:19). Later, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, former record holder of the longest FG in NFL, and K for the Arizona Cardinals, Matt Prater, joins the program. Pat, Matt, and AJ chat about how things are in Arizona, when he knew that locker room was special, if the longest field goal will be able to be much further than 66 yards, what he would tell young kicker&apos;s trying to get out of a rut, and much more (1:19:21-1:33:50). To close out the show, Pat and AJ dive deeper into last night&apos;s Monday Night Football game and Lamar Jackson&apos;s brilliance, the Colts looking much better than they have, and Pat having to donate a whole bunch of crab cakes after losing a bet to Jimmy&apos;s Seafood in Baltimore (1:35:53-1:51:17).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 513 - OVERREACTION MONDAY, NFL Week 5 Recap With Darius Butler & AJ Hawk]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys overreact to everything that happened in a wild weekend of NFL Football as they wrap up week 5 of the NFL season and look ahead to tonight's Colts v. Ravens Monday Night Football game. They cover the Packers wild win in Cincinnati, a horrendous day #ForTheBrand league wide, the Buffalo Bills being an absolute wagon, if there is major cause for concern with the Chiefs and their defense, the Cardinals staying undefeated is a tight game against the 49ers, the Pittsburgh Steelers potentially being all the way back, if the Cowboys are potentially the best team in the NFC, the issues in New York with the Giants, and everything else from a great weekend of football. Joining the program to chat about all his takes from the weekend and what he was most impressed and disappointed with is AJ Hawk (47:42-1:05:52). Later, joining Pat and AJ Hawk is 9 year NFL vet at DB, host of the Man-To-Man podcast, Everything DB, Darius Butler. Pat, Darius, and AJ discuss whether or not the Chiefs are dead and if they can turn things around, why Darius thinks the Chargers are a real threat with Justin Herbert and Brandon Staley, what things are like down in South Florida as the Dolphins seem to getting worse each week and if the Deshaun Watson buzz is heating back up, why he isn't impressed with Dan Campbell crying at his press conference, and all his other big takeaways from week 5 of the NFL season (1:05:56-1:32:01).

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about 4/20 and how even though it has been vilified for years, more people than you would realize actually participate in 4/20 festivities, plus they chat about different draft scenarios as we get closer to the NFL Draft, and chat about the picture floating around that suggests the Packers are preparing to trade Jordan Love, the 29th pick, and another late round pick, for the Patriots 15th pick (definitely not real). Joining the program is friend of the show, former teammate of Pat and AJ Hawk, member of the US House of Representatives serving Ohio's 16th Congressional District, United States Congressman, Anthony Gonzalez. Pat, AJ, and Gonzo chat about the bill he's trying to pass for the NCAA's name, image, and likeness, when he anticipates marijuana will become legalized in more states, how crazy the last year has been for him, what he thinks the problem with politics these days are, how you trust what you see in the news and where to look, when he expects Ohio to legalize mobile sports betting, if he'll ever run for President, and if he would consider making two footed driving illegal (22:59-56:56). Later, Pat and AJ chat about the shift in defensive line play and how this is the thinnest year for defensive line prospects, if AJ thinks that trend will continue in the future with the way football is changing, Laremy Tunsil dropping in the draft despite having potentially the best lung capacity of any player in NFL history, the death of the European Super League which was gaining steam and losing steam yesterday, and much much more (59:22-1:36:39).

Next, 3x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, the highest paid Safety in NFL History, Budda Baker joins the program to chat about his playing style, not being afraid of anything, why he thinks he might get fined or flagged more than others, what offense is difficult to prepare for, if he&apos;s ever been to Kliff Kingsbury&apos;s house, and getting caught by DK Metcalf (1:06:26-1:30:41). Later, Hall of Famer, 6x Pro Bowler, 5x All-Pro, one of the greatest WR&apos;s to ever play the game, Terrell Owens joins the program to chat about his career and how the media had a fair say in how he&apos;s perceived, his new wine company, 81Vino, if he ever tried to battle his persona, where he thinks he ranks all-time, who the greatest of all-time is, what kind of numbers he&apos;d put up today, and much more (1:32:53-2:00:15).

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys overreact to everything that happened during the Divisional Round of the playoffs including Patrick Mahomes potentially being injured for their showdown against the Bills, the Packers taking care of the Rams and looking very good in the process, Tom Brady and the Bucs eliminating the Saints and potentially ending Drew Brees' career as they look ahead at the NFC and AFC Championships. Joining the show after catching 4 passes for 96 yards and a touchdown, is WR for the Green Bay Packers, Allen Lazard. Pat and Allen chat about this Packers team that seems to be peaking at the right time, how good Davante Adams is, what it's like catching passes from Aaron Rodgers, his juice preferences, being nick named the Lizard King, and much more (21:50-38:11). Next, NFL Network Insider and friend of the program Ian Rapoport joins the show to chat about the different coaching hires, who could still potentially end up where, if the DeShaun Watson news is accurate, and everything else we need to know heading into Conference Championship weekend (41:27-1:03:04). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk chat about Urban Meyer's first hire in Jacksonville, the games this weekend and give an early indication of who they like in the Conference Championships, chat about Jack Easterby's meteoric rise throughout the NFL and the expose written about him in SI, and have a lengthy discussion about team chaplains, pastors, and priests (1:24:58-2:06:13).

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today&apos;s show, Pat and the boys react to the news broken by friend of the program Michael Lombardi that Urban Meyer to Jacksonville is essentially a done deal, who he might bring in to fill out his coaching staff, if Shad Khan is going to retain roster control, if Trevor Lawrence will be his QB, and everything else going on in the league as we approach the Divisional Round of the playoffs. Joining the show is a man who broke the rookie receiving record, Pro Bowler, All-Pro, potential Rookie of the Year and friend of the program, Justin Jefferson. Pat and Justin chat about his first season in the NFL, what he&apos;s working on this offseason, if he trains with other top WR&apos;s, his relationship with Kirk Cousins, how he was so successful this year, and whose Griddy is worse, Kirk or Adam Thielen (21:36-45:09). Next, 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, CB for the Philadelphia Eagles, Darius Slay joins the show to chat with Pat and AJ about his time in Detroit, what it was like coming to Philadelphia, if the locker room was aware of everything going on behind the scenes, who the toughest WR in the league to defend is, playing against Aaron Rodgers for 7 years, and much more (48:25-1:06:20). Lastly, Pat and AJ chat about a declassified document that brings to light some new alien news, who the Eagles next Head Coach might be, and look ahead to this weekend&apos;s games (1:20:39-1:37:03).

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat recaps the events that happened last night on WWE NXT on how he was bamboozled into eating a boot from Adam Cole, his entrance into War Games, and everything else about the trip. First, 9 year NFL vet at Defensive Back, friend of the program, co-host of the Man-To-Man Pod and Everything DB, Darius Butler, joins the show to chat about his locks for tonight's Cardinals vs. Seahawks game, what he likes for over/unders, QB passing yards, and who he thinks is going to win the game (21:30-40:03). Next, current WR for the New York Football Giants, Darius Slayton joins the program to chat about the fight that heard round the country between a couple of coaches, if he thought he was going to be drafted higher after playing at Auburn, his relationship with Danny Dimes, and who he looks up to (43:35-56:22). Later, Super Bowl Champion, 5x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, 2013 AFC Defensive Player of the Year, Colts Ring of Honor member, future Hall of Famer, Robert Mathis joins the show. Pat and Robert chat about why he and Dwight Freeney don't get as much love for being arguably the best DE duo ever, his thoughts on this Colts team, why playing defensive end is like a game of chess, and how you deal with a QB like Aaron Rodgers (59:53-1:14:54). Lastly, on another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ chat about last night's events, and preview tonight's Thursday Night Football game and give their picks.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys recap last night's game between the Packers and 49ers and how incredible the Aaron Rodgers/Davante Adams connection, and they look ahead to some of the juicy matchups in week 9 of the NFL season. Joining the show for an Aaron Rodgers Friday is the man himself, one of the greatest throwers of the football of all-time, fresh off a huge victory over the 49ers, Green Bay Packers QB, Aaron Rodgers. Pat and Aaron chat about last night's game and how good it feels to come out on fire, how special Davante Adams is, why he was excited Marques Valdez-Scantling got going, his thoughts on the defenses effort, what time he got home, and much more (3:36-37:19). Next, a man coming off one of the most athletic accomplishments of all-time, a 2x touchdown scorer last Sunday, Running Back for the Indianapolis Colts, Nyheim Hines joins the program.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss watching the election coverage last night and how impressed they were with John King, Bill Hemmer, & Steve Kornachi's talent with their boards and touch screens, and how difficult of a job that must be. Pat also gives out his exactly halfway through the NFL season awards and takes a look at Thursday night's game between the 49ers and Packers. Joining the show is a Pro Bowler, a man coming off having 226 total yards and 4 touchdowns against the Packers, Running Back for the Minnesota Vikings, Dalvin Cook. Pat and Dalvin chat about his special day on Sunday and if he knew things were going to go that way when he got on the field, if it's tough playing in the cold being from Florida, what it is about being from that area in Florida that produces so many NFL players, his running style, and how tough this season has been with the Covid protocols (24:12-38:51). Later, VP of Vayner Sports, host of the Business of Sport podcast, former VP of Finance for the Green Bay Packers, and friend of the show, Andrew Brandt, joins the program. Pat and Andrew discuss why the Packers didn't make a move at the deadline, why that is typically not a strategy in Green Bay, what he thinks will ultimately happen with Stephon Gilmore, and why he thinks a lot of marquee players will be released this offseason with the cap going down drastically (54:02-1:07:20). To close the show, Pat and AJ Hawk discuss the Packers not making any moves at the deadline, if he thinks they're angling to put Jordan Love in a position to play, his thoughts on the Thursday Night Game, and more (1:09:40-1:31:24).

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys recap last night's Thursday Night Football game, and look ahead to the week 8 slate and wonder which games will potentially be swayed by the weather as Tropical Storm Zeta moves through the United States. Joining the show is the reigning NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, 4x Pro Bowler, 6x All-Pro, friend of the program and The Brand, LA Rams P Johnny Hekker. Pat and Johnny chat about his unreal game against the Bears, the banana ball he's been kicking, if he's currently trying any other type of ball, how long he thinks he'll player, and much more (20:58-36:25). Next, former Head Coach of the Oakland Raiders and the Cleveland Browns, Hue Jackson joins Pat and AJ Hawk to discuss what it's like being in the AFC North ahead of this weekend's tilt between the Ravens and Steelers, his thoughts on Baker Mayfield not being able to beat the good team's, how the tequila business is going, and more (41:13-1:08:05). Later, 2x Masters Champion and 14x PGA Winner, Bubba Watson joins the show. Pat and Bubba chat about what it's like winning the Masters, teaching himself how to swing a golf club, his battles with anxiety and what he did to get out of that funk, if he still has the hover golf cart, and if golf was always his first choice (1:11:15-1:34:43). Plus Pat and AJ give their picks on the Sunday slate.

Pat, AJ, and Aaron chat about last weekend&apos;s game against the Texans and whether or not he knew Davante Adams was going to have a massive game, his thoughts on the local media getting under his skin, if it&apos;s true that he stinks at beer pong, the QB exams that give him the most difficulty, and much more in another fantastic conversation (20:31-56:11). Later, former GM of the Cleveland Browns and Special Assistant to the coaches for the New England Patriots, host of the GM Shuffle pod, co-host of HammerDAHN, accomplished author, writer for The Athletic and creator of the Daily Coach, Michael Lombardi joins the program. Pat and Michael chat about last night&apos;s game, and his concerns with the Bears and Matt Nagy, his biggest takeaways from the NFL season thus far, what the problem in New England is, and which teams he thinks will make a play for assets at the trade deadline (58:38-1:23:11).

To get more information on the Tyrod Taylor situation, Pat welcomes The Insider Of All Insiders, ESPN NFL Insider and originator of the Adam Bomb, Adam Schefter.

Next, CBS NFL color commentator, one of the voices of Madden, and NFL Network analyst, Charles Davis joins the show. Pat and Charles chat about how things have been differently calling games so far this year, his thoughts on why the NFL has gone off without a hitch and why it's much more of a struggle in college football, what it's like being one of the voices of Madden and how painstaking of a process it is, his thoughts on the Ravens and why he thinks they got better, and his thoughts about Mitchell Trubisky in Chicago (30:19-51:36). Later, Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and member of the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame, Deuce McAllister joins the program. Pat and Deuce chat about what he's seen from the Saints so far and what he thinks they need to do better, if he's heard anything on Michael Thomas' status for Sunday Night, and how difficult swallowing his pride was when the Saints drafted Reggie Bush (53:44-1:08:25).

			<itunes:summary>On today&apos;s show, Pat and the boys react to the news that Tyrod Taylor didn&apos;t play due to a collapsed lung from an injection into the ribs by the team doctor. To get more information on the Tyrod Taylor situation, Pat welcomes The Insider Of All Insiders, ESPN NFL Insider and originator of the Adam Bomb, Adam Schefter. Pat and Schefty discuss all the developments with Tyrod Taylor and how common this is in the NFL, how difficult it was to keep getting texts of players being out for the season on Sunday, and how his in-laws still don&apos;t have any idea about what he does for a living (17:17-26:02). Next, CBS NFL color commentator, one of the voices of Madden, and NFL Network analyst, Charles Davis joins the show. Pat and Charles chat about how things have been differently calling games so far this year, his thoughts on why the NFL has gone off without a hitch and why it&apos;s much more of a struggle in college football, what it&apos;s like being one of the voices of Madden and how painstaking of a process it is, his thoughts on the Ravens and why he thinks they got better, and his thoughts about Mitchell Trubisky in Chicago (30:19-51:36). Later, Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and member of the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame, Deuce McAllister joins the program. Pat and Deuce chat about what he&apos;s seen from the Saints so far and what he thinks they need to do better, if he&apos;s heard anything on Michael Thomas&apos; status for Sunday Night, and how difficult swallowing his pride was when the Saints drafted Reggie Bush (53:44-1:08:25).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 254 - OVERREACTION MONDAY. NFL Week 2 Recap, Harrison Butker, Matt Hasselbeck & Charles Robinson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys overreact to everything that happened this weekend in the NFL, including Russell Wilson being incredible at football, the Chiefs clawing back to a victory with Harrison Butker's game-winning kick after Justin Herbert's effort, plus Pat gives his worst three teams in the NFL as opposed to his top three, and everything else that was noteworthy. Joining the show to overreact to everything is 17 year NFL QB, 3x Pro Bowler, co-host of Sunday NFL Countdown, and friend of the program, Matt Hasselbeck. Pat and Matt overreact to this weekend of football, including whether or not Russell Wilson is the best QB ever, whether or not Josh Allen is for real, Justin Herbert's big day in LA, if the Vikings should be concerned with Kirk Cousins' play, what it's like feeling the rush in the pocket, and who he likes for tonight's game between the Raiders and Saints (1:40-27:53). Next, Super Bowl Champion, the man who hit multiple 50+ yard field goals against the Chargers including a 58 yard game winner (which was also a franchise record), Chiefs Kicker, Harrison Butker. Pat and Harrison chat about his mentality leading up to the kick, what he's done in the offseason to strengthen his leg, why he felt good from 70 on Sunday, and his thoughts about the onside kick by Greg Zuerlein in the Cowboys v. Falcons game (27:55-47:30). Lastly, Yahoo Sports NFL Insider and friend of the show, Charles Robinson joins the program. Pat and Charles chat about all the injuries from Sunday and Charles gives an update on many of the players and how serious he thinks the injuries may be, what he's hearing about who's on the coaching hot seat, and what San Francisco is going to do after being hammered by the injury bug (49:30-1:06:29).

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today&apos;s show, Pat and the boys overreact to everything that happened this weekend in the NFL, including Russell Wilson being incredible at football, the Chiefs clawing back to a victory with Harrison Butker&apos;s game-winning kick after Justin Herbert&apos;s effort, plus Pat gives his worst three teams in the NFL as opposed to his top three, and everything else that was noteworthy. Joining the show to overreact to everything is 17 year NFL QB, 3x Pro Bowler, co-host of Sunday NFL Countdown, and friend of the program, Matt Hasselbeck. Pat and Matt overreact to this weekend of football, including whether or not Russell Wilson is the best QB ever, whether or not Josh Allen is for real, Justin Herbert&apos;s big day in LA, if the Vikings should be concerned with Kirk Cousins&apos; play, what it&apos;s like feeling the rush in the pocket, and who he likes for tonight&apos;s game between the Raiders and Saints (1:40-27:53). Next, Super Bowl Champion, the man who hit multiple 50+ yard field goals against the Chargers including a 58 yard game winner (which was also a franchise record), Chiefs Kicker, Harrison Butker. Pat and Harrison chat about his mentality leading up to the kick, what he&apos;s done in the offseason to strengthen his leg, why he felt good from 70 on Sunday, and his thoughts about the onside kick by Greg Zuerlein in the Cowboys v. Falcons game (27:55-47:30). Lastly, Yahoo Sports NFL Insider and friend of the show, Charles Robinson joins the program. Pat and Charles chat about all the injuries from Sunday and Charles gives an update on many of the players and how serious he thinks the injuries may be, what he&apos;s hearing about who&apos;s on the coaching hot seat, and what San Francisco is going to do after being hammered by the injury bug (49:30-1:06:29).

			<description><![CDATA[Today's show is anchored by a couple of great guests. First, on another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ welcome 8x Pro Bowler, San Diego Chargers 50th Anniversary Team Member, a man currently ranked 6th all-time in passing yards and touchdowns, the Quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts, Philip Rivers. Pat, AJ, and Phil discuss his time in San Diego/LA, when he thought it might be time to move on, if there was ever serious consideration to him retiring, why the Colts seemed like the perfect fit, how hard it is to adjust to a new locker room after being in San Diego/LA for 16 years, his plans for after football, and how excited he is to get the season started (:20-25:00). Plus Pat and AJ break down Leonard Fournette signing with the Bucs, their thoughts on the Alvin Kamara situation, Kirk Cousins saying if he dies he dies (from the coronavirus), and everything else in the NFL as we close in on the start of the 2020 season (:20-55:56). Next, former Head Coach of the Oakland Raiders, Tennessee Volunteers, USC Trojans, Florida Atlantic Panthers, and current HC of Ole Miss, Lane Kiffin joins the program. Pat and Lane chat about what he's been doing to prepare his time during covid, if there was ever a thought the the SEC wouldn't play games, why he likens his time at Alabama like going to rehab, if he ever considered going back to the NFL, and how much he has to give up in terms of calling plays and trying to control things being a Head Coach as opposed to a coordinator (56:00-1:18:16). To close out the show, 2x Super Bowl Champion, Super Bowl MVP, NFL MVP, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, member of the 1990's All-Decade Team and Denver Broncos Ring of Fame, friend of the program, Terrell Davis stops by. Pat and Terrell chat about the Leonard Fournette situation, the current running back market and why it's a tough time to be wanting a contract extension as a RB in the NFL, his thoughts on the season as we get closer to kickoff, his thoughts on the Broncos and why he thinks Drew Lock is going to take them to the next level, and what his plans are for the upcoming NFL season (1:18:18-1:41:40). We can't thank you enough for listening and letting us penetrate your eyes every week. Have the greatest weekend ever. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

Pat and Terrell chat about the Leonard Fournette situation, the current running back market and why it&apos;s a tough time to be wanting a contract extension as a RB in the NFL, his thoughts on the season as we get closer to kickoff, his thoughts on the Broncos and why he thinks Drew Lock is going to take them to the next level, and what his plans are for the upcoming NFL season (1:18:18-1:41:40). We can&apos;t thank you enough for listening and letting us penetrate your eyes every week. Have the greatest weekend ever. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 244 - PACKED SHOW. Washington President Jason Wright, Dallas Clark, Ariel Helwani, General Bob Carpenter, & Legend AJ Hawk.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat is joined by former NFL Running Back and current President of the Washington Football Team, Jason Wright. Pat and Jason discuss how difficult of a challenge it has been taking everything over in the midst of what seems like a firestorm, how he's been trying to build and establish the culture with Ron Riveria both in the building and the locker room, what made him feel like he was prepared for the job, and how he isn't naive about how difficult of a challenge it will be (1:01-21:34). Next, Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, All-Pro, Pat's former teammate, and Iowa Football legend, Dallas Clark joins the program. Pat and Dallas chat about everything you could imagine from their time as teammates together, some hilarious stories about one another, why he never wore gloves, how he's one of the most competitive human beings on the planet, and why he ultimately decided to move back to Iowa (23:07-56:21). Next, on another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ are joined by former 1st round pick of the Dallas Cowboys, Ohio State Legend, General of the Big Ten Army, Gen. Bob Carpenter. Pat, AJ, and the General discuss everything going on in the Big Ten right now, what Bob is hearing from his sources on the battlefield, why he doesn't want football to become a bipartisan issue, what needs to happen to resume the season, and if he's confident that it will get done in time (57:04-1:18:41). To close out the show, ESPN MMA Insider and friend of the program, Ariel Helwani joins the show. Pat and Ariel discuss the possibilities of Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz meeting again for the BMF belt, whether or not he thinks Brock Lesnar will ultimately end up in the UFC to fight Jon Jones, his relationship with Dana White, and why it is that people hate him (1:18:43-1:34:54). We appreciate you all for letting us penetrate your ear holes. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

First, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, NFL rushing leader in 2011, former Jacksonville Jaguars great, Maurice Jones-Drew joins the program to chat about what the hell is going on in Duval.

Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ chat about everything going on in NFL training camp as we close in on the start of the regular season. They discuss Alvin Kamara missing three days of practice in a row in search for a contract, how that will impact the Saints this year, Derwin James needing knee surgery and how the Chargers will respond to that, some of the new pieces arriving in Tampa, whatever is going on in Jacksonville, along with everything else in training camp (22:23-1:28:20).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 242 - Darius Butler, Shams Charania, Ian Rapoport, & Legend, Eddie George Join Us For Some Insightful And Incredible Conversation. Let's Go.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat discusses the monumental shift in sports right now as it pertains to social justice reforms, and how the Milwaukee Bucks led the way in putting the sporting world in a position it hasn’t been in for a very long time. Joining the show from the NBA bubble is NBA Insider for The Athletic and Stadium, friend of the program, Shams Charania. Pat and Shams discuss everything that was talked about in the players meeting on Wednesday night, speculate about what was said during the Board of Governor’s meeting (we now know that the NBA will resume the playoffs), what the ultimate goal will be moving forward, and whether or not the players would hurt their ability to shine light on the changes they want to see if they were to abandon the season and leave the bubble (7:18-17:08). Next, friend of PMI, 9 year NFL veteran at DB, co-host of the Man-To-Man Pod, creator of Everything DB, maybe the smoothest athlete to ever walk the face of the earth, Darius Butler joins the show. Darius breaks down the plight of being a black athlete in America and why things are so much different now than they were 4 years ago when Colin Kaepernick decided to take a knee. He explains the ramifications of trying to make societal changes, why more guys feel more comfortable being a part of this movement now, and ultimately what needs to be done so we can see this change enacted (19:56-29:02). Later, NFL Insider from NFL Network, Ian Rapoport joins the program to chat about all the different NFL teams that have decided to postpone or cancel practices, how hands on Roger Goodell is in this whole situation, what he’s seen from the different Covid protocols and whether or not they seem to be working, his thoughts on kind of getting body bagged by Jerry Jones in relation to Earl Thomas potentially going to the Cowboys (Ian doesn’t believe so), and who he is hearing may be interested in Earl Thomas (31:06-50:15). To close out the show, 4x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, NFL Rookie of the Year, Heisman Trophy winner, member of the Tennessee Titans/Houston Oilers Ring of Honor, and Ohio State legend, Eddie George joins the program. Pat and Eddie chat about the current situation with Ohio State, and what Eddie thinks top prospects will ultimately do when faced with not having a fall season, what he thinks they’ll do with all the awards, why the RB position is so undervalued now, his thoughts on the upcoming NFL season, how his financial planning business is going, and his thoughts about playing golf at the AAC Challenge in Lake Tahoe (51:20-1:09:39). We appreciate the hell out of all of you for listening, have an incredible weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

Pat and Shams discuss everything that was talked about in the players meeting on Wednesday night, speculate about what was said during the Board of Governor’s meeting (we now know that the NBA will resume the playoffs), what the ultimate goal will be moving forward, and whether or not the players would hurt their ability to shine light on the changes they want to see if they were to abandon the season and leave the bubble (7:18-17:08). Next, friend of PMI, 9 year NFL veteran at DB, co-host of the Man-To-Man Pod, creator of Everything DB, maybe the smoothest athlete to ever walk the face of the earth, Darius Butler joins the show. Darius breaks down the plight of being a black athlete in America and why things are so much different now than they were 4 years ago when Colin Kaepernick decided to take a knee. He explains the ramifications of trying to make societal changes, why more guys feel more comfortable being a part of this movement now, and ultimately what needs to be done so we can see this change enacted (19:56-29:02). Later, NFL Insider from NFL Network, Ian Rapoport joins the program to chat about all the different NFL teams that have decided to postpone or cancel practices, how hands on Roger Goodell is in this whole situation, what he’s seen from the different Covid protocols and whether or not they seem to be working, his thoughts on kind of getting body bagged by Jerry Jones in relation to Earl Thomas potentially going to the Cowboys (Ian doesn’t believe so), and who he is hearing may be interested in Earl Thomas (31:06-50:15). To close out the show, 4x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, NFL Rookie of the Year, Heisman Trophy winner, member of the Tennessee Titans/Houston Oilers Ring of Honor, and Ohio State legend, Eddie George joins the program. Pat and Eddie chat about the current situation with Ohio State, and what Eddie thinks top prospects will ultimately do when faced with not having a fall season, what he thinks they’ll do with all the awards, why the RB position is so undervalued now, his thoughts on the upcoming NFL season, how his financial planning business is going, and his thoughts about playing golf at the AAC Challenge in Lake Tahoe (51:20-1:09:39). We appreciate the hell out of all of you for listening, have an incredible weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 241 - A Unifying Thursday With Jeff Fisher, Dan Orlovsky, & Legend, AJ Hawk]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat addresses the events that have unfolded in Kenosha, Wisconsin with Jacob Blake and where things go from here, as we attempt to bring you a unifying, feel good show with some good messages. First, Super Bowl Champion, 22 Year NFL Head Coach, a man who possesses one of the greatest mustaches alive, Jeff Fisher joins the program. Pat and Jeff chat about a FanDuel fantasy football contest that he's excited to be a part of and how it differs from traditional fantasy football. They also discuss the impact an NFL locker room can have and why they both think society needs a little bit more of that right now. Jeff also tells some hilarious stories from his time coaching, and chats about whether or not he has the itch to get back on the sideline (3:28-30:13). Next, 12 Year NFL veteran at Quarterback, ESPN NFL analyst, and one of the newest co-hosts of NFL Live, friend of the show, Dan Orlovsky joins the program. Pat and Dan chat about Mike Tannenbaum's recent comments on Get Up! that Ben Roethlisberger is the 4th best QB in the AFC North, why Dan doesn't think the Patriots are a playoff team despite acquiring Cam Newton, what the new cast of NFL Live will bring to the table, why he has some concerns with the 49ers, and why Pat inspires him (31:37-47:03). Lastly is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ cover everything going on around the NFL including the Cowboys potentially landing Earl Thomas, how much the different gameday atmospheres will potentially affect the players, whether or not the Big Ten is still officially dead, and much much more (48:07-1:34:13).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 240 - NXT, Ryan Clark, Field Yates, & Legend, AJ Hawk... HELL OF A SHOW ON A TUESDAY. Let's Gooo]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat recaps his incredible match from Saturday night with Adam Cole at NXT Takeover: XXX and all the memorable moments, how it's been something he's thought about for the last twenty years or so, and how sore his body is after the match. Joining the show is Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, 12 Year NFL veteran and current ESPN NFL Analyst, Ryan Clark. Pat and Ryan chat about everything going on with the Earl Thomas situation in Baltimore, why something doesn't seem right about it, how Ryan thinks Earl has been playing in a scheme that doesn't favor him in Baltimore, whether or not Ryan thinks Earl has lost a step, and he gives some interesting anecdotes about Ben Roethlisberger and why he isn't portrayed as elite in the eyes of the media (9:53-32:29). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk as Pat and AJ rehash Saturday night and have great of an experience it was for both of them, they chat more about the Earl Thomas situation, training camp fights and how common they are, Aaron Rodgers absolutely torching the defense at Packers camp, and AJ miserably attempts to dumb down and explain how to identify what the strong side is in certain defenses (34:11-1:15:48). Later, ESPN NFL Analyst Field Yates joins the program to cover everything going on in NFL training camp. Pat and Field chat about the financial ramifications of Earl Thomas getting released, where Field thinks he may wind up, whether or not Lamar Jackson's groin injury is cause for concern, and the issues with the 77 false positive tests coming from the lab in New Jersey, and how the NFL is preparing to remedy that situation (1:15:50-1:35:22). Pat and the boys also take some time to shine a light on the NBA bubble and give props to breakout and rising star, Luka Doncic, after his absolutely insane OT game winner coming on top of a 40+ point triple double. Don't forget to send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat and make sure you subscribe to youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow as we continue our climb to a MASSIVE giveaway when we reach 1 million subscribers.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today&apos;s show, Pat recaps his incredible match from Saturday night with Adam Cole at NXT Takeover: XXX and all the memorable moments, how it&apos;s been something he&apos;s thought about for the last twenty years or so, and how sore his body is after the match. Joining the show is Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, 12 Year NFL veteran and current ESPN NFL Analyst, Ryan Clark. Pat and Ryan chat about everything going on with the Earl Thomas situation in Baltimore, why something doesn&apos;t seem right about it, how Ryan thinks Earl has been playing in a scheme that doesn&apos;t favor him in Baltimore, whether or not Ryan thinks Earl has lost a step, and he gives some interesting anecdotes about Ben Roethlisberger and why he isn&apos;t portrayed as elite in the eyes of the media (9:53-32:29). Next is another installment of McAfee &amp;amp; Hawk Sports Talk as Pat and AJ rehash Saturday night and have great of an experience it was for both of them, they chat more about the Earl Thomas situation, training camp fights and how common they are, Aaron Rodgers absolutely torching the defense at Packers camp, and AJ miserably attempts to dumb down and explain how to identify what the strong side is in certain defenses (34:11-1:15:48). Later, ESPN NFL Analyst Field Yates joins the program to cover everything going on in NFL training camp. Pat and Field chat about the financial ramifications of Earl Thomas getting released, where Field thinks he may wind up, whether or not Lamar Jackson&apos;s groin injury is cause for concern, and the issues with the 77 false positive tests coming from the lab in New Jersey, and how the NFL is preparing to remedy that situation (1:15:50-1:35:22). Pat and the boys also take some time to shine a light on the NBA bubble and give props to breakout and rising star, Luka Doncic, after his absolutely insane OT game winner coming on top of a 40+ point triple double.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys are live from Orlando, FL as it is officially #FightWeek as Pat prepares for his upcoming match at NXT Takeover against Adam Cole which will be Saturday on the WWE Network. Joining the show is the face of college football, one of the smoothest guys around, friend of the program, Kirk Herbstreit. Pat and Kirk discuss the current state of college football and if he thinks there is anyway teams from the Big Ten will play any type of college football this year, if he's okay with the protocols given that his sons both attend Clemson, why he isn't optimistic that there will be college football at all, and Kirk breaks a little NFL news as well (1:01-20:34). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk as Pat and AJ discuss everything that #FightWeek involves, whether or not AJ will be making the trip down to help Pat prepare, their thoughts on the NFL training camps going to full padded practices, a full UFC 252 recap, and everything else going on in the sports world (22:41-1:09:56). Lastly, NBA Insider from The Athletic, friend of the program, Shams Charania joins the show. Pat and Shams discuss the NBA playoffs and why he doesn't think the Blazers have enough firepower to take out the Lakers, the status of Russell Westbrook, when he will be arriving at the bubble, players families and close friends eventually being let into the bubble, and everything else we need to know about the NBA playoffs (1:11:17-1:27:26).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 235 - The Future Of Golf, PGA Champion Collin Morikawa, Plus Legends AJ Hawk & Darius Butler Stop By For Some Great Conversation]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat is joined by NFL Legends AJ Hawk and Darius Butler live from Florida. They discuss the fallout from the Big Ten and Pac-12 postponing their fall football seasons, and what that means for players in those conferences, why we probably won't be getting a super conference after all, and whether or not they think that teams in these conferences will actually try and play a spring season. They also recap the wild 5 Overtime hockey game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Columbus Blue Jackets and if there should be changes made to the NHL overtime format so that games don't need to be pushed back, whether that game is good or bad for the sport of hockey, and Darius could possibly become the NHL's new biggest fan. The guys also cover the premiere of Hard Knocks and why they think this season with the Chargers and the Rams will be much better than last years lackluster version with the Raiders. They cover Jalen Ramsey and why he's so good, whether or not Jared Goff has the it factor to lead the Rams to the Super Bowl, how each team is handling coronavirus in training camp, and why they're excited for the upcoming weeks (1:12-34:38). Also joining the show is the future of golf, becoming just the 4th golfer to win a PGA Championship before the age of 24 (alongside Tiger, Jack, and Rory) in just his 2nd major, newly crowned PGA Champion, Collin Morikawa. Pat and Collin chat about his incredible weekend at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco, whether or not he can feel when he's in the zone on the golf course, if he had any idea where anybody else on the leaderboard was at on Sunday, his thoughts on Brooks Koepka's comments going into the final round, if he has any superstitions while playing, what his favorite courses to play so far have been, how heavy the Wanamaker trophy actually is, and what is next for him (37:16-54:11).

The guys also cover the premiere of Hard Knocks and why they think this season with the Chargers and the Rams will be much better than last years lackluster version with the Raiders. They cover Jalen Ramsey and why he&apos;s so good, whether or not Jared Goff has the it factor to lead the Rams to the Super Bowl, how each team is handling coronavirus in training camp, and why they&apos;re excited for the upcoming weeks (1:12-34:38). Also joining the show is the future of golf, becoming just the 4th golfer to win a PGA Championship before the age of 24 (alongside Tiger, Jack, and Rory) in just his 2nd major, newly crowned PGA Champion, Collin Morikawa. Pat and Collin chat about his incredible weekend at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco, whether or not he can feel when he&apos;s in the zone on the golf course, if he had any idea where anybody else on the leaderboard was at on Sunday, his thoughts on Brooks Koepka&apos;s comments going into the final round, if he has any superstitions while playing, what his favorite courses to play so far have been, how heavy the Wanamaker trophy actually is, and what is next for him (37:16-54:11).

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss the recent developments coming from the college football world where reports indicate that the Big Ten and Pac-12 are considering postponing their fall seasons, while the SEC seems to be trying to move full steam ahead. To discuss the situation, 12 year NFL Quarterback, current ESPN analyst, one of the sharpest football minds around, and friend of the show, Dan Orlovsky joins the program. Pat and Dan discuss everything going on with the college football climate and the players asserting that they want to play. They chat about what will happen if certain conferences postpone their fall seasons while some schools still decide they want to play football, why they think this could be a fracturing point for the NCAA and major conferences, what other information would need to come out to firmly cancel football at colleges, why not playing the season would be a major detriment to a lot of players who are forced to go home and lose the daily structure of a football season, and whether or not Dan thinks we'll see a lot of players being poached by schools who are trying to play (16:45-35:40). Also joining the show is friend of the program and ESPN MLB Insider, Jeff "Jett" Passan. Pat and Jett discuss how the MLB has been handling their COVID outbreaks and what is being done to make sure that games can still be played, how serious teams are about sending players home if they ignore rules and decide to go out in cities, if teams that have had several games canceled due to positive tests are going to play a full slate, whether or not he thinks the baseball season will finish, and Jett weighs in on everything happening in the NCAA with a great take that may surprise you (37:26-51:13).

First, 8th Overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft, 2013 NBA Slam Dunk Champion, and current guard for the Orlando Magic, Terrance Ross joins the program. Pat and Terrance discuss what the day to day is like in Orlando, if the food situation is as bad as people originally thought, if guys are still doing extra curricular activities, how he feels about the Magic's chances, and what he does to pass the time in between practices and games (1:11-16:01). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss Pat's wedding and what his expectations should be going in, whether or not he should be nervous, what to look for, and what to remember to make it as memorable as possible.

Lastly, NBC NHL Analyst and friend of the program, Pierre McGuire joins the show live from Edmonton. Pat and Pierre discuss the quarantine situation upon arrival in Canada, what the players have thought of the experience thus far with air conditioning going out at one of the hotels recently, how the NHL managed to pull this off, and who he thinks has the most realistic shot at taking home the Covid Cup (1:29:23-1:42:37).

			<description><![CDATA[Today's show is absolutely LOADED. First, ESPN MLB Insider Jeff Passan joins the show to discuss almost half of the Marlins roster testing positive for covid-19, what that means for the MLB going forward, if they have their farm teams close and ready to add players, what Rob Manfred might do, and how the handling of this will have impacts across the American sports landscape (:42-11:07). Next is another installment of McAfee and Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ welcome former President of the Marlins and host of the Nothing Personal podcast, David P. Samson. Pat, AJ, and David discuss where baseball goes from here, if the Marlins were doing the same practices with social distancing and staying safe as other MLB teams, how he would've handled this situation publicly if he were still Team President, and why he doesn't suspect this hiccup will be the end for the MLB season (15:45-31:45). Pat and AJ also react to the Jamal Adams trade, Pat's sick dangles, and everything else currently going on in the sports world (13:14-1:07:57). Later, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, member of the Denver Broncos 50th Anniversary Team and friend of the program, Mark Schlereth joins the show. Pat and Mark discuss how they think Roger Goodell will take what is happening in the MLB and use it for this upcoming football season, his thoughts on everything that is happening with the Washington football team, a franchise he knows very well, his thoughts on the Jamal Adams trade and the reasons behind it, and how he still has 25" biceps (1:10:11-1:27:47). Lastly, Executive Vice President of Global Talent Strategy and Development for the WWE, and founder and senior producer of NXT, Triple H. Pat and Triple H clear the air in the wake of last week's Adam Cole debacle, and how Triple H thinks it was an honest mistake that was blown out of proportion, and extends an offer for Pat and Adam Cole to meet with no cameras present to hash out their differences (1:27:50-1:41:36).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 228 - Calais Campbell, Ike Taylor, Charles Robinson, & Legend, AJ Hawk. Packed House On A Tuesday]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat is joined by a few incredible guests to chat about the NFL's return to play policy. First, Senior NFL writer at Yahoo Sports and friend of the program, Charles Robinson joins the show. Charles lays out for Pat what he is hearing to be the four main things that players want in order for them to return to training camp, his thoughts on the players #WeWantToPlay movement and what he thinks was the moment that they decided something had to be said, and if he ultimately thinks negotiations will get done on time (1:56-15:46). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss everything that's going on in the sports world with whether or not NFL teams will report to camp on time, if we're going to have football this year, why we need to remember that if Rob Manfred could get the baseball season to go off, then Roger Goodell should be able to get the NFL on track, how Pat is looking YOKED, Pat and AJ's thoughts on the anniversary of the moon landing, and why AJ's fingers are so messed up (15:48-1:29:21). Later, 5x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, member of the 2010's All-Decade Team, 2019 Walter Payton Man of the Year, and member of the NFLPA executive committee, Calais Campbell joins the program. Pat and Calais chat about him landing in Baltimore after thinking he might finish his career in Jacksonville, why he's excited about the opportunity to bring some veteran leadership to the locker room, if things were truly as bad in Jacksonville as some people like to make them out to be, and what he thinks about returning to play, how he thinks the negotiations between the NFL and NFLPA will go, and why he ultimately thinks that although it might get close to the deadline, a deal will get done (1:31:59-1:52:04). Lastly, 2x Super Bowl champion, Pittsburgh Steeler legend, and friend of the show, Ike Taylor joins the program. Pat and Ike discuss why Ike thinks some of the players are uneasy about going back to training camp, what he thinks needs to be done in order to put some of their minds at rest, why he doesn't think a lot of players will opt out, how he tried using his Madden ratings in negotiations, and an incredible story about how he used to listen to music on the field during games (1:53:46-2:08:08). Don't forget to send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. We appreciate you letting us penetrate your ears.

			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat reacts to the Washington Post article detailing the sexual harassment and misogynistic behavior exhibited by the Washington Football Team Name TBD. Pat is also joined by former General Manager of the Cleveland Browns, former NFL Scout, assistant to Bill Belichick while with the New England Patriots, 3x Super Bowl Champion and friend of the program, Michael Lombardi. Pat and Michael chat about the relationship between Cam Newton and Bill Belichick and why Michael thinks it’s going to be successful. He also drops the bomb that Deshaun Watson is likely to get a massive extension here within the coming days, and gives his thoughts on why the deal with Dak didn’t get done in Dallas. Pat and Michael also cover the AFL, and who he likes gambling wise for the Memorial Golf Tournament (3:23-20:38). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ speculate on what could potentially happen in Washington (before the Washington Post article came out) if they think Dan Snyder is going to lose the team, Zion having to leave the NBA bubble for a family emergency, Tiger surging at the Memorial Tournament in AJ’s backyard, and everything else going on in the sports world (22:24-1:32:35). To close out the show, 2x Pro Bowl, 2017 Defensive MVP of the Pro Bowl, All-Pro, former Linebacker for the Buffalo Bills, and current NFLPA Vice President, Lorenzo Alexander joins the program. Pat and Lorenzo chat about the upcoming discussions between the NFL and NFLPA and where he thinks they stand with return to play protocol, if he thinks teams will report by the July 28th date, what kind of things he expects the NFL and NFLPA to negotiate about, why he thinks the Bills are still the team to beat in the AFC East this year even with the Patriots addition of Cam Newton, and why he wants the Bills front office to know that he’ll be ready to sign if they’re going to make a deep run into the playoffs (1:34:40-1:46:01). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch and be on the lookout for the winners of the end of pod squad which will be announced shortly.

Next is another installment of McAfee &amp; Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ speculate on what could potentially happen in Washington (before the Washington Post article came out) if they think Dan Snyder is going to lose the team, Zion having to leave the NBA bubble for a family emergency, Tiger surging at the Memorial Tournament in AJ’s backyard, and everything else going on in the sports world (22:24-1:32:35). To close out the show, 2x Pro Bowl, 2017 Defensive MVP of the Pro Bowl, All-Pro, former Linebacker for the Buffalo Bills, and current NFLPA Vice President, Lorenzo Alexander joins the program. Pat and Lorenzo chat about the upcoming discussions between the NFL and NFLPA and where he thinks they stand with return to play protocol, if he thinks teams will report by the July 28th date, what kind of things he expects the NFL and NFLPA to negotiate about, why he thinks the Bills are still the team to beat in the AFC East this year even with the Patriots addition of Cam Newton, and why he wants the Bills front office to know that he’ll be ready to sign if they’re going to make a deep run into the playoffs (1:34:40-1:46:01). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch and be on the lookout for the winners of the end of pod squad which will be announced shortly.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 226 - Golf Legend David Feherty, Packers RB Aaron Jones, & Legend, AJ Hawk Stop By For A Great Conversation. Let's. Go.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat is joined by former professional golfer on the European and PGA Tour, 1989 Ryder Cup Champion, current golf broadcaster, host of the TV show “Feherty,” which will be airing it’s 10th season soon, the legend from Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland, David Feherty. Pat and David chat about how his career as a broadcaster and Tiger’s career have been about the same length so he’s gotten to ride the Tiger wave, whether or not Tiger has a chance to win this weekend at The Memorial, what he thinks about the next generation of golfers, and why he thinks golf is the greatest sport in the world. David also tells Pat and the boys a couple of hilarious stories from his time as a professional (1:43-19:40). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports talk as AJ is officially back from Lake Tahoe. Pat and AJ discuss everything going on with different players having to sign the franchise tag, where the Cowboys are at with Dak Prescott’s longterm extension, and how the Chiefs have money to pay everyone. Pat and AJ also describe what it’s like to be in a pile or scrum in an NFL game, and Pat chats about what went into recovering his own onside kick against the Texans, plus Pat, AJ, and the boys get into a heated discussion about whether or not meatball sub’s are good sandwiches (22:01-1:44:51). Later, 2019 NFL rushing touchdown co-leader, one of the most underrated players in the NFL, current Running Back for the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Jones joins the program. Pat and Aaron chat about why the Packers seem to be disrespected so much by the media, what Aaron is focused on going into a contract year, what he has heard about the return to play and whether or not he thinks they’ll be in camp by July 28th, his thoughts on the Packers drafting a RB in the 2nd round, why he doesn’t really care about the Madden ratings, and why he thinks he and Aaron Rodgers may be primed to have their best years yet (1:44:53-1:59:36).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 225 - LOADED Tuesday With Legends Dominick Cruz, Ozzie Guillén, & Pierre McGuire. LET'S GO.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat reacts to the news that the Washington football team will officially “retire” the name and logo of the Redskins and move on to something else and what that potentially means moving forward for sponsors, fans, and the NFL in general. Pat and the boys also react to everything going on between Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, and why Nick will not take shots at him while everyone else is. Also joining the show is ESPN MMA analyst, the last Bantamweight Champion of the WEC, 2x UFC Bantamweight Champion, The Dominator, Dominick Cruz. Pat and Dom chat about this past weekend’s fights on Fight Island in Abu Dhabi, whether or not he’s gearing up for another title run, the importance of having a knowledgeable referee with big fight experience, why the judging is so hit or miss, how difficult it is taking a fight on 6 days rest, what the day of the fight is like for him, his strategy for assessing bouncers once getting into a bar, and if he ever goes into the Octagon thinking that he just doesn’t have it (10:00-35:51). Next, former 2x World Series Champion, 3x All-Star, AL Rookie of the Year, Gold Glove Winner, 2005 AL Manager of the Year, former manager of the Chicago White Sox and Miami Marlins, Ozzie Guillen joins the program. Pat and Ozzie discuss his disdain for the media while in Chicago and what he thinks the problem is, his thoughts on the upcoming shortened MLB season, how he would manage differently this year and what he would do strategically, his thoughts on how to handle umpires (he’s not a big fan), whether he thinks more players will be prone to using steroids this year, and why his attitude and mindset wouldn’t change regardless of the number of games being played (37:58-58:17). Lastly, NBC Sports Hockey Analyst and friend of the program, Pierre McGuire joins the show. Pat and Pierre discuss the NHL gearing up to return to play as training camps are starting to begin, how the NHL has been the benchmark of good faith negotiating throughout this whole ordeal, what he’s hearing about the intensity of the lockdown in the NHL bubble, what the Canadian government is doing to help the situation, and whether or not Pierre himself will be traveling to one of the two bubble cities for the duration of the playoffs (1:04:27-1:19:29).

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today’s show, Pat reacts to the news that the Washington football team will officially “retire” the name and logo of the Redskins and move on to something else and what that potentially means moving forward for sponsors, fans, and the NFL in general. Pat and the boys also react to everything going on between Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, and why Nick will not take shots at him while everyone else is. Also joining the show is ESPN MMA analyst, the last Bantamweight Champion of the WEC, 2x UFC Bantamweight Champion, The Dominator, Dominick Cruz. Pat and Dom chat about this past weekend’s fights on Fight Island in Abu Dhabi, whether or not he’s gearing up for another title run, the importance of having a knowledgeable referee with big fight experience, why the judging is so hit or miss, how difficult it is taking a fight on 6 days rest, what the day of the fight is like for him, his strategy for assessing bouncers once getting into a bar, and if he ever goes into the Octagon thinking that he just doesn’t have it (10:00-35:51). Next, former 2x World Series Champion, 3x All-Star, AL Rookie of the Year, Gold Glove Winner, 2005 AL Manager of the Year, former manager of the Chicago White Sox and Miami Marlins, Ozzie Guillen joins the program. Pat and Ozzie discuss his disdain for the media while in Chicago and what he thinks the problem is, his thoughts on the upcoming shortened MLB season, how he would manage differently this year and what he would do strategically, his thoughts on how to handle umpires (he’s not a big fan), whether he thinks more players will be prone to using steroids this year, and why his attitude and mindset wouldn’t change regardless of the number of games being played (37:58-58:17). Lastly, NBC Sports Hockey Analyst and friend of the program, Pierre McGuire joins the show. Pat and Pierre discuss the NHL gearing up to return to play as training camps are starting to begin, how the NHL has been the benchmark of good faith negotiating throughout this whole ordeal, what he’s hearing about the intensity of the lockdown in the NHL bubble, what the Canadian government is doing to help the situation, and whether or not Pierre himself will be traveling to one of the two bubble cities for the duration of the playoffs (1:04:27-1:19:29).

			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat reacts to the news that the Ivy League has officially canceled their football season and whether or not he thinks this will have widespread ramifications for the rest of the NCAA. Pat and the boys also discuss an anonymous poll of 50 executives, coaches, and scouts for the top 10 QB’s currently in the NFL, and get excited for Tiger Woods’ announcing he will be playing in The Memorial. Joining the show is former Green Bay Packers executive VP of Finance, current VP of Vayner Sports, host of the Business of Sports podcast and friend of the program, Andrew Brandt. Pat and Andrew discuss the upcoming war between the NFLPA and NFL over this years salaries and what holding a percentage of their contracts in escrow really means. Andrew also gives his take on whether or not we’ll get an NFL season this year and how he’s not 100% confident that they’ll finish once it starts. Pat and Andrew also dive into the Patrick Mahomes contract, and why Andrew believes it is a very team friendly deal, how surprised he is that Mahomes was so accommodating, and whether or not he thinks QB’s like Deshaun Watson and Dak Prescott will sign similar long term deals (6:31-21:37). Next, ESPN MMA Insider, Host of Ariel & The Bad Guy, DC & Helwani, and The People’s MMA Show, friend of the program, Ariel Helwani.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 222 - Patrick Mahomes Is Getting All The Monies + The Legend Herm Edwards & Charles Robinson. Let's Have A Tuesday.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat reacts to Patrick Mahomes' new deal which is reportedly for 10 years and up to 503 MILLION DOLLARS. Pat and the boys also cover the tentative training camp schedule and the questions raised by Phil Rivers around if a player tests positive for COVID19 during Super Bowl week, will they have to quarantine and potentially miss the game even if said player is asymptomatic. Pat also reacts to the news that BMF title holder Jorge Masvidal is stepping in to face UFC Welterweight Champion Kamaru Usman on Fight Island this Saturday, chats about Bryson Dechambeau's body transformation which has proven to be successful, Pat and the boys discuss where everyone in the office is on the AFL ladder with their respective squads, and pays his respects to the greatest eater on the planet, Joey Chestnut, after winning his 13th Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Championship. Also joining the show is former NFL defensive back and Head Coach for the New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs, and current head coach of the Arizona State Sun Devils, Herm Edwards. Pat and Herm chat about what it was that he missed about football after being away from the game, and what drew him back to the college level, how he's been handling coaching during the quarantine, what he thinks about this upcoming college football season, who the best player he's ever seen is, him still getting residuals off "you play to win the game," and what he picked up by being away from coaching that he has taken with him while at Arizona State in an electric conversation (4:52-22:29). Later, Yahoo Sports Senior NFL writer and friend of the program, Charles Robinson joins the show. Pat and Charles discuss the potential negotiations between the NFL and NFLPA leading up to the preseason and how he thinks it's going to be a knockdown dragout, the mess in Washington DC right now with Daniel Snyder having to change the name of the team and what kind of timeline they're working with, and the latest developments in the Jadeveon Clowney situation with the Browns reportedly offering him close to $20 million for 1 year and what Charles thinks will ultimately happen with Clowney (42:59-58:09). Don't forget to send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. Also be on the lookout for a big announcement today. We appreciate you all letting us penetrate your ears on a daily basis. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<itunes:summary>On today&apos;s show, Pat reacts to Patrick Mahomes&apos; new deal which is reportedly for 10 years and up to 503 MILLION DOLLARS. Pat and the boys also cover the tentative training camp schedule and the questions raised by Phil Rivers around if a player tests positive for COVID19 during Super Bowl week, will they have to quarantine and potentially miss the game even if said player is asymptomatic. Pat also reacts to the news that BMF title holder Jorge Masvidal is stepping in to face UFC Welterweight Champion Kamaru Usman on Fight Island this Saturday, chats about Bryson Dechambeau&apos;s body transformation which has proven to be successful, Pat and the boys discuss where everyone in the office is on the AFL ladder with their respective squads, and pays his respects to the greatest eater on the planet, Joey Chestnut, after winning his 13th Nathan&apos;s Hot Dog Eating Championship. Also joining the show is former NFL defensive back and Head Coach for the New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs, and current head coach of the Arizona State Sun Devils, Herm Edwards. Pat and Herm chat about what it was that he missed about football after being away from the game, and what drew him back to the college level, how he&apos;s been handling coaching during the quarantine, what he thinks about this upcoming college football season, who the best player he&apos;s ever seen is, him still getting residuals off &quot;you play to win the game,&quot; and what he picked up by being away from coaching that he has taken with him while at Arizona State in an electric conversation (4:52-22:29). Later, Yahoo Sports Senior NFL writer and friend of the program, Charles Robinson joins the show. Pat and Charles discuss the potential negotiations between the NFL and NFLPA leading up to the preseason and how he thinks it&apos;s going to be a knockdown dragout, the mess in Washington DC right now with Daniel Snyder having to change the name of the team and what kind of timeline they&apos;re working with, and the latest developments in the Jadeveon Clowney situation with the Browns reportedly offering him close to $20 million for 1 year and what Charles thinks will ultimately happen with Clowney (42:59-58:09). Don&apos;t forget to send in a picture of where you&apos;re listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 219 - How Do The Patriots Always Do This? Lot Of Football Talk With Lombardi, Curran, Brandt, & Legend, AJ Hawk. Let's Go.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s show is loaded with reaction and conversation dealing with the Patriots somehow doing it again and signing Cam Newton to a 1 year deal. First, former General Manager/VP, 3x Super Bowl Champion, best selling author, host of the GM Shuffle Podcast and friend of the show, Michael Lombardi joins the program. Pat and Michael chat about how Cam Newton eventually ended up a Patriot and why it shouldn’t be very surprising, how he thinks the Patriots will use Cam in the offense, what he thinks Cam and Bill Belichick’s relationship will be like, and what this means for the Patriots moving forward (:34-19:42). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss the Cam Newton signing and why neither one of them are surprised, they discuss their respective relationships with the media while they were still playing, they break down everything else going on in the sports world, and Pat recaps his bachelor party weekend in Michigan (21:48-2:04:58). Next, former VP of Finance for the Green Bay Packers, Executive VP at Vayner Sports, host of the Business of Sports Podcast, and friend of the program, Andrew Brandt joins the show. Pat and Andrew discuss what Cam Newton’s contract might be looking like, and where all the incentives go if he does or does not reach them. They also chat about why it took so long for Cam to get signed, and the NFLPA and the players currently being at odds with whether or not they should be training together, and how that hurts the NFLPA from a leverage stand point (2:06:03-2:21:14). Lastly, Tom Curran from NBC Sports Boston joins the show to give Pat and the guys an idea of the pulse of Boston, whether or not he thinks Jarrett Stidham has any chance to be the starter, how successful he thinks the Pats will be with this transaction, and why people in Boston will still be cynical about this (2:21:16-2:35:45). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat to potentially win some free merch, and be on the lookout for another possible giveaway. We appreciate you letting us penetrate your ears. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 217 - BIG SHOW TUESDAY. Robert Mathis, Kordell "Slash" Stewart, Andrew Brandt, & Legend, AJ Hawk Stop By.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s show is a great one. First, Pro Bowler, 2001 AFC Offensive Player of the Year, former 2nd round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers out of Colorado, Kordell “Slash” Stewart joins the program. Pat and Kordell chat about if he ever thinks he was before his time as a quarterback when he see’s what the current NFL QB’s are doing, why the stigma of being an athletic quarterback always bothered him, Kordell tells some hilarious stories about his time in Pittsburgh, and chats about his son carrying on his legacy (1:01-26:47). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk as Pat and AJ are joined in studio by Super Bowl Champion, 5x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, 2013 AFC Defensive Player of the Year, member of the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor, and future Hall of Famer, Robert Mathis. Pat, AJ, and Robert chat about his time with the Colts, and why the changing of the culture was what killed the team, Robert breaks down the art of pass rushing and the different techniques he used to become one of the most feared pass rushers in NFL history, he chats about what Pat was like as a teammate and how he tried to buy stock in him early, his time at Alabama A&M and what being in the HBCU Hall of Fame means, and what he’s been doing now with his Gridiron Gang camps trying to teach players how to correctly pass rush in an incredible conversation (28:43-1:38:44). Lastly, former Green Bay Packers VP of Finance, Executive VP at Vayner Sports, host of the Business of Sports podcast, and friend of the show, Andrew Brandt joins the program. Pat and Andrew discuss the business of baseball and how he’s not sure if the result of the proposal is good lawyering or bad lawyering, why he and Pat both agree that the NFL will probably go off without a hitch given some sort of waiver that players will have to sign, they discuss how the salary cap will be affected by everything happening with Covid, and if that is why Dak Prescott is ultimately agreeing to the franchise tender, and why with the current climate of things, Andrew would not negotiate extensions with big name players like Patrick Mahomes because of all the variables (1:41:55-1:57:34).

			<itunes:summary>Today’s show is a great one. First, Pro Bowler, 2001 AFC Offensive Player of the Year, former 2nd round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers out of Colorado, Kordell “Slash” Stewart joins the program. Pat and Kordell chat about if he ever thinks he was before his time as a quarterback when he see’s what the current NFL QB’s are doing, why the stigma of being an athletic quarterback always bothered him, Kordell tells some hilarious stories about his time in Pittsburgh, and chats about his son carrying on his legacy (1:01-26:47). Next is another installment of McAfee &amp; Hawk Sports Talk as Pat and AJ are joined in studio by Super Bowl Champion, 5x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, 2013 AFC Defensive Player of the Year, member of the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor, and future Hall of Famer, Robert Mathis. Pat, AJ, and Robert chat about his time with the Colts, and why the changing of the culture was what killed the team, Robert breaks down the art of pass rushing and the different techniques he used to become one of the most feared pass rushers in NFL history, he chats about what Pat was like as a teammate and how he tried to buy stock in him early, his time at Alabama A&amp;M and what being in the HBCU Hall of Fame means, and what he’s been doing now with his Gridiron Gang camps trying to teach players how to correctly pass rush in an incredible conversation (28:43-1:38:44). Lastly, former Green Bay Packers VP of Finance, Executive VP at Vayner Sports, host of the Business of Sports podcast, and friend of the show, Andrew Brandt joins the program.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show Pat is joined by Hall of Famer, Super Bowl Champion, 6x Executive of the Year, former GM of the Bills, Panthers, and Colts, the man who drafted Pat, Bill Polian. Pat and Bill chat about what the most important ingredient in building a winning culture is and how things can start to go sideways if teams don't have that, Bill walks Pat through the moments leading up to finding out Peyton Manning would need season ending spinal fusion surgery, the perception that the Colts were "sucking for Luck," despite the fact that Bill was fired after the season, and where he thinks Colin Kaepernick and Cam Newton could potentially end up (:41-28:58). Next, on another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ are joined by 7x World Champion, the longest tenured wrestler in the history of the WWE, holder of one of the most impressive streaks in the history of sports with 21 consecutive wins at Wrestlemania, one of the greatest wrestlers to ever live, The Undertaker. Pat, AJ, and Taker discuss what it's been like finally peeling back the curtain after all these years of avoiding media to support the character, how the wrestling business has changed before his eyes, his presence in the locker room, his relationship with Vince McMahon, and he tells a few legendary drinking stories from his earlier days in a can't miss interview (31:51-1:11:25). Pat and AJ also discuss AJ's apparent hatred for Aussie Rules Football, and they judge the breakdown of best conferences by QB in the NFL, and everything else happening in the sports world (31:12-1:41:46). Lastly, Pro Bowler, current starting Running Back for the Pittsburgh Steelers, and now author, James Conner joins the program. Pat and James discuss his new book, "Fear Is A Choice," which chronicles his battle with cancer and ultimately defeating it, and staying and playing for his hometown team in the Steelers. James also details his workouts this offseason that has him looking like the Hulk, and gives Steelers fans some hope as he gives an outlook on Big Ben's progress through his Tommy John injury (1:44:57-1:58:55). As always, don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. Have an incredible weekend, we appreciate you guys. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[Today’s show is absolutely LOADED. First, NBA Insider for The Athletic and friend of the show, Shams Charania joins the program to discuss the memo sent to NBA teams about returning to play. Pat and Shams discuss what it all means, what the quarantining will look like, who has issues with it, and what repercussions (if any) there will be if some players decide they don’t want to go play in the bubble (:38-17:50). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk as Pat and AJ welcome former President of the Florida/Miami Marlins and current podcaster for CBS Sports, David Samson. They discuss everything going on in the MLB currently, and David lets Pat and AJ know how teams used the media to get whatever narrative they wanted into the public and that most of the time it was a complete misdirection in a conversation that you do not want to miss (19:36-35:43). Pat and AJ also discuss everything going on in the sports world currently, and how hopefully things are starting to move along in the process of bringing sports back (19:36-1:28:05). Next, ESPN MLB Insider and friend of the program, Jeff Passan joins the show. Jeff gets Pat caught up on everything going on with the MLB negotiations and why he thinks we are getting closer to having a baseball season, despite it not really being what either side wants. They also discuss how MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred seemingly needs to put his foot in his mouth every time he speaks (1:30:00-1:47:57). Lastly, NBC Sports hockey analyst and former coach and scout in the NHL, Pierre McGuire joins the show. Pat and Pierre chat about the NHL going full steam ahead with their original plan to restart, what roadblocks still stand in the way, and how the NHL seems to be leading the charge for getting back to sports as the league and players association have been on the same page to get the game back (1:47:59-2:02:11). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free march. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Today’s show is absolutely LOADED. First, NBA Insider for The Athletic and friend of the show, Shams Charania joins the program to discuss the memo sent to NBA teams about returning to play.

Next is another installment of McAfee &amp;amp; Hawk Sports Talk as Pat and AJ welcome former President of the Florida/Miami Marlins and current podcaster for CBS Sports, David Samson. They discuss everything going on in the MLB currently, and David lets Pat and AJ know how teams used the media to get whatever narrative they wanted into the public and that most of the time it was a complete misdirection in a conversation that you do not want to miss (19:36-35:43). Pat and AJ also discuss everything going on in the sports world currently, and how hopefully things are starting to move along in the process of bringing sports back (19:36-1:28:05).

Jeff gets Pat caught up on everything going on with the MLB negotiations and why he thinks we are getting closer to having a baseball season, despite it not really being what either side wants.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat is joined by former Tennessee Titan safety, Rhodes Scholar, and current neurosurgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Dr. Myron Rolle. Pat and Dr. Rolle chat about what things are currently like with the coronavirus and if we are in a better position now then we were when Pat and Dr. Rolle first spoke to one another a couple of months ago. Dr. Rolle also gives his take on what needs to be done to keep us moving in the right direction, if the coronavirus is something we're always going to need to be worried about like the flu, and some of the conflicting information that is out there currently about Covid19 (:49-15:19). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat has some big breaking NFL news for AJ, they chat about what it's like getting ready to play in the Hall of Fame game, they cover the start of the AFL season in Australia, chat about the PGA Tour's Charles Schwab Challenge, AJ's excellent gift giving abilities, and everything else going on in the sports world (17:45-1:37:19). Later, Super Bowl Champion, 7x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, member of the 2000's All-Decade Team, member of the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor, and Pat's former teammate, Dwight Freeney joins the program. Pat and Dwight discuss his relationship with Michael Jordan and the Jordan brand, what he thought of The Last Dance, his relationship with Michael and how they golf 3-4 times a week together, his thoughts on the Jadeveon Clowney situation and why he thinks going to Cleveland would be a dream given Dwight's success alongside Robert Mathis in Indy, and his thoughts on the Jordan brand donating $100 million over the next 10 years for racial equality, social justice, and access to education (1:40:09-1:55:41). To close out the show, ESPN Baseball Insider and friend of the program, Jeff Passan joins Pat and the boys to give an update on what is going on with the MLB. Pat and Jeff discuss the likelihood that a season gets played, what's holding everything up, why the players couldn't strike even if they wanted to, where he thinks this thing might end up, what ramifications it could have for the future of baseball, and tells a few stories about being a massive WWF fan when he was growing up (1:55:43-2:17:09).

			<itunes:summary>Today&apos;s show is headlined by a couple more great interviews. First, 2x World Series Champion, 3x All-Star, Gold Glover, and member of the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame, Kevin Youkilis joins the program. Pat and Youk chat about his career and how he landed on his unique batting stance, why a 48 game season isn&apos;t really baseball in his opinion and why he thinks most players will agree, his thoughts on the Houston Astros cheating scandal, and what it was like playing for the Yankees after playing for the Red Sox for almost his entire career (:45-25:33). Next is another installment of McAfee &amp; Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss what&apos;s going on in the MLB, Fight Island being a sure thing and how they think it is going to be received, their thoughts on the Netflix Garth Brooks documentary, and everything else that is happening around the sports world (26:57-1:37:45). Later, NBA Champion, NBA Defensive Player of the Year, All-Star, and 4x All-NBA Defensive team, one of the most interesting men on the planet, Metta World Peace joins the program. Pat and Metta chat about his thoughts on the protests and what that whole experience has been like for him, he recounts his time in Indiana and the Malice at the Palace, he looks back on a few of the regrets in his career, his time playing with Kobe, and what he thinks about the NBA tournament that is going to finish out this season in one of the most introspective and thoughtful conversations we&apos;ve ever had (1:40:30-2:03:22). Lastly, former Oklahoma State basketball player, and current Ruckman/Forward for the Collingwood Magpies of the AFL (Aussie Rules Football), friend of the program, Mason &quot;Coxzilla&quot; Cox joins the show. Pat and Mason chat about the AFL returning (this morning), why he thinks the AFL will catch on with NFL fans, what some potential bets to keep in mind are, who some of the toughest teams in the league this year will be, how Australia is dealing with the coronavirus right now, and why he&apos;s hoping to be back from injury very soon in an incredible conversation (2:06:33-2:27:57). Don&apos;t forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you&apos;re listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. We appreciate you rocking with us. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[Today's show is highlighted by a couple of incredible conversations. First, 9x MMA Journalist of the Year at the World MMA Awards, ESPN MMA Insider, Ariel Helwani joins the program. Pat and Ariel chat about some of the top fighters in the UFC not being happy and whether a union is possible after Conor McGregor announced his retirement for the third time in three years, they cover what he has heard about fight island and where it potentially could be at, and breaks down the different situations for fighters like Jorge Masvidal, Jon Jones, Justin Gathje, and Khabib (:42-18:55). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ chat about if they've ever felt like they lost a game when seeing the other team get off the bus, their different pregame rituals and warmups, the PGA Tour coming back this weekend and Pat trying to rent AJ's house for a couple of weeks for some upcoming PGA Tour action in Columbus, and why they think baseball might be officially dead (20:50-1:22:19). Later, former 2nd round draft pick of the New England Patriots and former Colts Defensive Back, host of the Everything DB Show, friend of the program, Darius Butler. Pat and Darius chat about everything that has been happening in the world and where Darius sees things going from here, his thoughts on the whole Drew Brees situation and ensuing fallout, and Darius also giving a few examples of what it's like to be a black man living in America in an incredible conversation that everyone needs to listen to (1:24:01-1:43:20). Lastly, 2x Super Bowl Champion, friend of the show and one of the most entertaining dudes around, Ike Taylor joins Pat and the boys. They discuss how he feels about Roger Goodell addressing the video the young stars of the NFL put out in response to the protests of the last two weeks, whether it caught Ike off guard or not, why he thinks this next generation will be a big part of the movement for change, his days of playing flag football in college which got him noticed by the actual football team, and what his coach told him before he switched positions going into his senior year, plus more, all while Ike runs a workout program from his garage (1:45:48-1:57:50).

Next is another installment of McAfee &amp; Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ welcome in ESPN MLB Insider, Jeff Passan to discuss whether or not there is going to be an MLB season this year, what Jeff is hearing from the players and why they're pissed at the MLB's proposal, how much power super agent Scott Boras wields in negotiations, and gives a peek behind the curtain when he explains his ESPN backdrop (47:05-1:11:45). Pat and AJ chat about the repercussions of no MLB season, whether or not they buy the report that Jadeveon Clowney turned down a lucrative offer from the Browns, and everything else happening around the world of sports (21:22-1:49:03). To close out the show, Super Bowl Champion with the Green Bay Packers, 2012's receiving TD's leader in the NFL, and friend of the program, James Jones joins the show. Pat and James chat about why he thinks Aaron Rodgers is going to win the MVP this year, his thoughts on the Packers' draft, why he thinks Mike McCarthy is going to be successful in Dallas, his thoughts on the Dak Prescott situation, and why Derek Carr is a special QB that doesn't get the recognition that he deserves (1:52:12-2:03:20).

			<description><![CDATA[Today’s show is highlighted by an incredible interview with arguably the most successful person to ever come on the show as billionaire, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and one of the main characters of Shark Tank, Mark Cuban joins the program. Pat and Mark chat about the NBA continuing its season, what he’s heard on the conference calls about opening sports back up and when he anticipates fans returning to stadiums. They also chat about whether or not Mark has any interest in buying any other professional sports teams, if he’s at all considering a presidential run, and if he would’ve done everything in his power to keep Tom Brady if he was Robert Kraft (00:00:40-24:14). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk with AJ coming to us live from a closet in Jordy Nelson’s house. Pat and AJ discuss the Mark Cuban interview and what it means for fans coming back into stadiums, whether or not the NFL should try and construct a tier system for quarterback’s that doesn’t count against the team’s salary cap, Pat and AJ each recount some old hunting stories, give their thoughts on Pete Rose, and react to the news (that ended up being BS) that Dak Prescott was reportedly offered a 5 year, $175 million contract by the Cowboys (24:16-2:04:25). Lastly, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, member of the Patriots’ All-2000’s team and 50th Anniversary Team, Matt Light, joins the show. Pat and Matt discuss the raffle he is conducting to send fans to the Bucs/Saints game next year, what he expects Tom Brady to bring to the Tampa Bay locker room, his thoughts on Jarrett Stidham and why no one from the Patriots organization has had any glowing reviews for him, and Tom Brady requiring his center to wear a specific towel to eliminate any sweat transfer (2:04:27-2:18:55).

			<itunes:summary>Today’s show is highlighted by an incredible interview with arguably the most successful person to ever come on the show as billionaire, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and one of the main characters of Shark Tank, Mark Cuban joins the program. Pat and Mark chat about the NBA continuing its season, what he’s heard on the conference calls about opening sports back up and when he anticipates fans returning to stadiums. They also chat about whether or not Mark has any interest in buying any other professional sports teams, if he’s at all considering a presidential run, and if he would’ve done everything in his power to keep Tom Brady if he was Robert Kraft (00:00:40-24:14). Next is another installment of McAfee &amp; Hawk Sports Talk with AJ coming to us live from a closet in Jordy Nelson’s house. Pat and AJ discuss the Mark Cuban interview and what it means for fans coming back into stadiums, whether or not the NFL should try and construct a tier system for quarterback’s that doesn’t count against the team’s salary cap, Pat and AJ each recount some old hunting stories, give their thoughts on Pete Rose, and react to the news (that ended up being BS) that Dak Prescott was reportedly offered a 5 year, $175 million contract by the Cowboys (24:16-2:04:25). Lastly, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, member of the Patriots’ All-2000’s team and 50th Anniversary Team, Matt Light, joins the show. Pat and Matt discuss the raffle he is conducting to send fans to the Bucs/Saints game next year, what he expects Tom Brady to bring to the Tampa Bay locker room, his thoughts on Jarrett Stidham and why no one from the Patriots organization has had any glowing reviews for him, and Tom Brady requiring his center to wear a specific towel to eliminate any sweat transfer (2:04:27-2:18:55). Don’t forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you’re listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch, and keep an eye out for a Memorial Day merch sale with 20% off everything in the store. Stay safe this weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat is joined by former Packers VP of Finance, Executive VP at Vayner Sports, and host of the Business of Sports Podcast, Andrew Brandt. Pat and Andrew discuss how a potential salary cap reduction of 30-$80 million dollars would change the NFL, what the situations are like for the MLB and NBA to come back, and Andrew also breaks down the debt ceiling being raised as well what he thinks will need to be done between the NFL and NFLPA to get everyone on the same page (1:22-18:18). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss everything going on in the sports well and chat some more about The Last Dance and how unusual it is for players’ personal trainers and staff to travel with the team, a future plan is cooked up to hold PMI yacht week in Tampa Bay for the Super Bowl, Gilbert Arenas winning $300,000 in the lottery, and Pat’s new weight lifting regimen (20:04-1:52:34). Also joining the show is 5x Pro Bowler and new member of the LA Chargers by way of the Carolina Panthers, Trai Turner. Pat and Trai chat about what he’s been doing during quarantine to get ready for the season with a new team, if he had any contact with Matt Rhule or any members of the Panthers coaching staff before he was traded, why he’s excited to be playing in LA, if he needs to force weight on himself to stay in playing shape, and how difficult it is to learn a new offense as an offensive lineman (1:52:36-2:00:59). Lastly, Super Bowl Champion and current kicker for the Denver Broncos, Brandon McManus joins the program. Pat and Brandon chat about the many changes he’s seen at coordinator, long snapper, and holder while being a member of the Broncos, Brandon helping Pat move into his second home when they were teammates together in Indianapolis, why Pat believes he will break the longest field goal record, what he’s been doing to stay in shape for the season, a couple of television show ideas he has, and what his relationship with Special Teams Coach Tom McMahon is like (2:01:01-2:11:35).

			<description><![CDATA[Today’s show is a loaded one. First, Pat welcomes Buffalo Bills General Manager Brandon Beane to the program. Pat and Brandon discuss the Bills attempting to trade for a WR last year, and why they eventually made a move to bring in Stefon Diggs, deciding to empower Josh Allen as their starting QB by not bringing in someone like Cam Newton, establishing the type of culture he desired in Buffalo and why it was difficult at first, and what it was like seeing Vontae Davis retire at halftime of a game (00:00:43-25:21). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk. Pat and AJ discuss everything from The Last Dance and discuss the documentary at length, Pat and Aaron Rodgers becoming texting buddies, Sebastian Janikowski giving Pat life advice, AJ tries to figure out how long Pat would survive in the Octagon against Francis Ngannou, Pat demonstrates the hard count he would use to try and get defenses to jump offsides, they discuss the golf event from this past weekend, and cover everything else that is going on in the world (27:17-2:11:18). Later, former Raiders and Browns Head Coach and friend of the program, Hue Jackson joins the show. Pat and Hue chat about the rumors that the Browns almost traded the #1 pick in 2018 to the Seahawks for Russell Wilson, how his tequila company has been doing, how teams address players getting arrested in the offseason given the recent circumstances, and whether he thinks it’s essential for young QB’s to have a veteran presence in the Quarterback room (2:11:20-2:26:17).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 201 - Brian Westbrook, Ted Ginn Jr., ESPN MLB Insider Jeff Passan, & Legend, AJ Hawk Stop By For A Nice Little Feel Good Friday]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s show is the definition of a Feel Good Friday as Pat sits down with a couple of great guests. First, ESPN MLB Insider, Jeff Passan joins the program. Pat and Jeff chat about the MLB’s plans to start the season and what they look like, Jeff reacts to Rays pitcher Blake Snell saying that he won’t play for a reduced salary, what opening Arizona and Florida for professional teams could mean for teams like the Yankees and Dodgers, and if the coronavirus is going to end up being the thing that sweeps the Houston Astros’ transgressions under the rug (00:00:40-20:25). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ dive into the things happening in the MLB and try to decide whether or not Blake Snell is making any good points, they discuss Pat as a potential major league ballplayer, the NFL deciding to pipe in crowd noise to the games and whether that would benefit the product on the field, and everything else going on in the sports world (22:36-1:59:57). Next, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, member of the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame, Brian Westbrook joins the show. Pat and Brian chat about his thoughts regarding people saying that Clyde Edwards-Helaire was a better version of him, and having to clear that up with Andy Reid, how he’s been handling quarantine on his horse farm, what he thought of the Eagles drafting Jalen Hurts, and Pat and Brian create potentially the most electric punt return game of all-time (2:00:00-2:17:45). Lastly, 13 year NFL veteran and newest member of the Chicago Bears, Ted Ginn Jr. joins the show. Pat and Ted chat about how he eventually landed on the Bears, why he believes in Coach Nagy, if he’s ever played with someone that is faster than him, and why track speed doesn’t necessarily translate to football speed (2:17:47-2:28:12). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re watching the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat. Come and laugh with us, and enjoy your weekend.

Pat and Marshal talk about how much weight he's dropped since he retired, and how he understands that he was essentially forcing himself to stay as big as he was, they look back on his career as a whole, look at what he wants to do next, he chats about what it is like blocking for Lamar Jackson, why the injuries were the main cause for retirement, how the locker room changed during the course of his career, and keeping young bucks in line when they were talking too much crap in an incredible conversation(1:08-29:08). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss everything that happened with the UFC 249 card and what some of the biggest takeaways were and why it was so huge for sports in not only the United States, but the world. They also give their reactions to episodes 7 and 8 of The Last Dance and continue to realize why Michael Jordan was such a unique specimen, discuss the NCAA decision to not play college football if no students are back on campuses, and everything else that has been circulating around the sports world (31:15-2:12:57). Lastly, friend of the show, former GM for the Cleveland Browns, 3x Super Bowl Champion, and host of the GM Shuffle Podcast, Michael Lombardi joins the program. Pat and Michael chat about Stephen Jones' comments about Dallas not spending too much money on Dak Prescott and whether that is a leverage play, why Bill Belichick hasn't openly said anything about his quarterback competition and why he doesn't think it'll be a big deal, where he ultimately thinks Cam Newton will end up (potentially the Patriots?), and what he thinks about Big Ben's outlook heading into this season (2:14:52-2:35:03). Today's show is a good one. Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch.

They also give their reactions to episodes 7 and 8 of The Last Dance and continue to realize why Michael Jordan was such a unique specimen, discuss the NCAA decision to not play college football if no students are back on campuses, and everything else that has been circulating around the sports world (31:15-2:12:57). Lastly, friend of the show, former GM for the Cleveland Browns, 3x Super Bowl Champion, and host of the GM Shuffle Podcast, Michael Lombardi joins the program. Pat and Michael chat about Stephen Jones&apos; comments about Dallas not spending too much money on Dak Prescott and whether that is a leverage play, why Bill Belichick hasn&apos;t openly said anything about his quarterback competition and why he doesn&apos;t think it&apos;ll be a big deal, where he ultimately thinks Cam Newton will end up (potentially the Patriots?), and what he thinks about Big Ben&apos;s outlook heading into this season (2:14:52-2:35:03). Today&apos;s show is a good one. Don&apos;t forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you&apos;re listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch.

			<description><![CDATA[Today's show is highlighted by a couple of incredible interviews. First, friend of the show, and current Head Coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Bruce Arians joins the show. Pat and Bruce chat about the state of his golf game currently, how it was actually Tom Brady's idea to bring Gronk to Tampa Bay, at what point Bruce realized that getting Tom Brady was a real possibility, and whether or not he's worried Jameis knows his playbook now that he is a member of the Saints (2:14-18:43). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss the importance of the schedule release, and what players are typically looking at when they first see it. They also cover Earl Thomas' nightmare of a situation with his wife, and chat about Andy Dalton not being able to do any press because he doesn't want to piss off anyone for the Cowboys, plus much more (20:57-1:25:46). Next, reigning Sun Belt Conference Coach of the Year, Head Coach of the Louisiana Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns, Billy Napier joins the show. Pat and Billy chat about what it was like working on the staffs of both Dabo Swinney and Nick Saban and what he has taken from those programs into his own, how teams are trying to stop the current offenses that are taking flight in college football, and how he competes with bigger schools when it comes to recruiting (1:25:48-1:40:20). Lastly, Super Bowl Champion, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, and new member of the Los Angeles Chargers, Chris Harris Jr. joins Pat and the boys. They discuss the story of the Broncos suggesting he fire his agent during the season, why he landed on the Chargers and what is appealing to him, and how the competitiveness between cornerbacks and safeties has changed since he was first in the league (1:40:22-1:50:32).

They also discuss Alex Smith's Project 11 and how remarkable of a story it is, and Matt gives his take on the Aaron Rodgers situation and relays a similar experience he had with Pete Carroll his last season in Seattle (1:47-21:30). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss everything with the Andy Dalton situation, a potential massive guest they are booking for the show, they take another look back at the Packers draft as Mad Mel Kiper makes an appearance, discuss episodes five and six of The Last Dance, and cover everything else that is going on around the world of sports and in the NFL (24:42-1:32:25). Lastly, 3x National Sportswriter of the Year, publisher of Football Morning in America, and NBC Sports contributor, Peter King joins the show via FaceTime. Pat and Peter chat about who some of Andy Dalton's other options may have been, why he thinks the Cowboys may have signed him as a precaution in case Dak Prescott gets Covid19, the NFL planning to release their schedule this week with no international games and the regular season starting on time (with the assumption that it is subject to change), why this is such a weird market for Cam Newton, and if he has any memories from covering Michael Jordan (1:32:27-1:49:21).

			<description><![CDATA[We've got a PACKED show today. First, SB Champion, Pro Bowler, and 6th pick of the 1994 NFL Draft, Trent Dilfer joins the show. Pat and Trent put to rest some disparaging comments Trent has made about The Brand in the past, Trent walks us through his training with Tua and why he knew he was going to be successful, what kind of involvement he had in pitching Tua to prospective NFL teams, and whether he plans to continue this type of training in the future (00:00:38-17:01). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where AJ and Pat discuss everything going on in the NFL including the market for Jadeveon Clowney, this potentially being Drew Brees' last year, Jameis Winston getting Lasic and whether or not the Saints envision him as their potential quarterback of the future, if selecting your number is a big deal in the NFL, and their thoughts on Mike Tyson coming out of retirement to potentially box in some exhibition matches and who the ideal opponents would be (19:13-1:33:05). Next, National Champion and the 22nd pick of this year's NFL Draft, new Minnesota Vikings WR, Justin Jefferson joins the show. Pat and Justin chat about what his experience was like at LSU, if the perception of Coach O is the same as the reality, what he's looking forward to in Minnesota, his workout plans to stay in shape during quarantine, and what he thinks his first purchase will be with his new money (1:35:19-1:45:49). Closing out the show is Pittsburgh radio stalwart and host of The Mark Madden Show on 105.9 The X, former WCW color commentator, Super Genius, and the best heel in the business, Mark Madden. Pat and Mark chat about why he thinks sports won't be coming back for a long time, and it might be a different reason than you think. They also discuss his time in WCW and whether or not he would entertain offers from the WWE or AEW, his thoughts on the report that Jameis Winston was offered a more lucrative contract with the Steelers that he turned down, and what Mark would do if he were in Aaron Rodgers' shoes (1:48:14-2:12:16).

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Los Angeles Chargers GM, the man who was instrumental in drafting Pat to the Colts, Tom Telesco joins the show. Pat and Tom chat about how he thinks the draft went given all the potential for failure, how the Chargers liked both Justin Herbert and Tua and were more than happy to take whoever was available, whether or not Cam Newton was ever potentially apart of the plan for the Chargers, and Tom breaks down the rest of the Chargers draft class (3:42-18:01). Also included is the newest installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ still try to make sense of the Packers draft class (it still makes no sense), they dive into the government declassifying the UFO videos even though we've already all seen them, and AJ starts to come around to Pat's side as he declares that Roger Goodell is in fact, his commissioner (19:01-1:36:10). To close out the show, Senior NBA writer and analyst for The Athletic and Stadium, Scoops McGee himself, Shams Charania joins the show. Pat and Shams discuss the new developments in the NCAA allowing student athletes to make money off their names and likenesses and what that means for the future and whether or not it is a direct response to the top 3 players in the nation decommitting from college and deciding to go to the G League, how Shams ended up getting into breaking NFL draft picks on draft night, and what he is hearing about the NBA season starting to open up facilities for players and how it seems like we still might be a ways away from the season starting (1:36:12-1:50:07).

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today&apos;s show, Los Angeles Chargers GM, the man who was instrumental in drafting Pat to the Colts, Tom Telesco joins the show. Pat and Tom chat about how he thinks the draft went given all the potential for failure, how&amp;nbsp;the Chargers liked both Justin Herbert and Tua and were more than happy to take whoever was available, whether or not Cam Newton was ever potentially apart of the plan for the Chargers, and Tom breaks down the rest of the Chargers draft class (3:42-18:01). Also included is the newest installment of McAfee &amp;amp; Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ still try to make sense of the Packers draft class (it still makes no sense), they dive into the government declassifying the UFO videos even though we&apos;ve already all seen them, and AJ starts to come around to Pat&apos;s side as he declares that Roger Goodell is in fact, his commissioner (19:01-1:36:10). To close out the show, Senior NBA writer and analyst for The Athletic and Stadium, Scoops McGee himself, Shams Charania joins the show. Pat and Shams discuss the new developments in the NCAA allowing student athletes to make money off their names and likenesses and what that means for the future and whether or not it is a direct response to the top 3 players in the nation decommitting from college and deciding to go to the G League, how Shams ended up getting into breaking NFL draft picks on draft night, and what he is hearing about the NBA season starting to open up facilities for players and how it seems like we still might be a ways away from the season starting (1:36:12-1:50:07). Don&apos;t forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you&apos;re watching the show for a chance to win some free merch. As always, hang in there and stay safe, we&apos;re all in this together. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat sits down with the most interesting man in sports, Andrew Brandt, who was the Vice President of Finance for the Green Bay Packers and formerly an agent working with David Falk, and who represented several NFL stars. Pat and Andrew chat about his career path and what made him want to get into the business, he chats about repping Adam Vinatieri and how he nearly got him to the Packers, David Falk's involvement in creating the Air Jordan moniker, and why the Packers drafting Aaron Rodgers when he was in charge is much different than what they did this year with Jordan Love (00:00:42-13:43). Also included is another segment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, where Pat and AJ recap this year's draft and still try to make sense of what the Packers are doing, and why it seems like they're moving in the wrong direction. They also discuss episodes 3 & 4 of The Last Dance and how much differently things would be if they were to happen today, and discuss what it was like on their respective team planes after wins in the NFL (16:11-1:34:55). Later, Pro Bowler, former cornerback for the Chiefs and Chargers, and friend of the show, Brandon Flowers joins the program. Pat and Brandon discuss the NFL Draft and which teams he thinks got better over the weekend and which teams left him scratching his head, what he thinks about Cam Newton playing for the New England Patriots, why Bill Belichick drafted players become dominant within his system, and what he thinks the Chargers are ultimately going to do at Quarterback (1:36:51-1:46:27).

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Oregon Quarterback and potential top 5 pick in tonight's NFL Draft, Justin Herbert joins the show. Pat and Justin chat about what this process has been like for him, which teams he has been in contact with the most, if he has signed a Nike contract yet, what he has been doing to prepare during quarantine, and what he plans to wear on draft night (00:00:50-14:57). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, as Pat and AJ react to the Gronk news, and AJ gives his best guess as to how teams will try to defend the Buccaneers. Plus WWE commentator and Pittsburgh native, Corey Graves joins the show to give his thoughts on Gronk coming back, whether anyone in the WWE thought he was staying there for good, and what he hopes the Pittsburgh Steelers will do in tonight's draft (18:08-1:20:49). Later, former #1 overall pick in the 2003 NFL Draft, 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and friend of the program, Carson Palmer calls in. Pat and Carson chat about his relationship with Joe Burrow and whether he has given him any advice, why he thinks Burrow has the chance to be very successful in Cincinnati, his thoughts on being linked with Burrow potentially not wanting to play in Cinci, and what he sees for the Bucs offense this year with Brady at the helm (1:24:00-1:41:32). Lastly, the 13th pick in the 1998 NFL Draft, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and host of the Behind The Mask Podcast, Takeo Spikes joins the show via FaceTime. Takeo chats about why he thinks Joe Burrow is going to be successful, what he looked at in a rookie quarterback to see whether or not they were going to be any good, which is more important to draft in his opinion, a stud defensive lineman/end or a cornerback, and who some of the toughest running back's he ever had to tackle were (1:41:34-1:58:01).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 191 - The Last Dance Reaction + Mark Schlereth, Tim Hasselbeck, & Legend, AJ Hawk Stop By For Some Great 4/20 Chatter]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys react to the first two episodes of The Last Dance as Pat is finally realizing how ruthless and incredible Michael Jordan was. They chat about the most interesting parts of the first two episodes, what surprised them, and what they're looking forward to. Three incredible guests also join the show. First, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and friend of the show, Mark Schlereth stops by. Pat and Mark discuss The Last Dance, and whether that killer instinct and the drive to succeed is something all elite athletes possess, Mark gives his thoughts on the upcoming draft and why he thinks it will really showcase who the good GM's in the NFL are, which lineman he thinks will be the most successful in this year's class, and why he thinks the NFLPA should look to outlaw players taking the Wonderlic (12:25-34:44). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk, Sports Talk. Pat and AJ discuss The Last Dance, and what it would be like to play on a team where players openly mock the GM, and how Jerry Krause is really taking it in the shins. They also look ahead to their draft special on Thursday night, and discuss how they will both be compiling mock drafts for the show in order to show who can accumulate the most points. The guys also cover Leonard Fournette being just about done in Jacksonville, Yannick Ngakoue getting in a twitter war with Tony Khan, the owner of the Jaguars' son, and they react to the news that the NFL Draft technology test did not go well and try to figure out what things will look like on Thursday (36:58-1:58:54). Lastly, ESPN NFL Analyst Tim Hasselbeck joins the show to give his opinions on this years draft, why he doesn't think Tua's Wonderlic score is that big of a cause for concern, why every comparison doesn't need to be with a Hall of Famer, and what it will take for the Bengals to consider Joe Burrow to be a success (1:58:56-2:08:52). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're watching the show for the chance to win some free merch. As always, stay safe out there. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<itunes:summary>On today&apos;s show, Pat and the boys react to the first two episodes of The Last Dance as Pat is finally realizing how ruthless and incredible Michael Jordan was. They chat about the most interesting parts of the first two episodes, what surprised them, and what they&apos;re looking forward to. Three incredible guests also join the show. First, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and friend of the show, Mark Schlereth stops by. Pat and Mark discuss The Last Dance, and whether that killer instinct and the drive to succeed is something all elite athletes possess, Mark gives his thoughts on the upcoming draft and why he thinks it will really showcase who the good GM&apos;s in the NFL are, which lineman he thinks will be the most successful in this year&apos;s class, and why he thinks the NFLPA should look to outlaw players taking the Wonderlic (12:25-34:44). Next is another installment of McAfee &amp; Hawk, Sports Talk. Pat and AJ discuss The Last Dance, and what it would be like to play on a team where players openly mock the GM, and how Jerry Krause is really taking it in the shins. They also look ahead to their draft special on Thursday night, and discuss how they will both be compiling mock drafts for the show in order to show who can accumulate the most points. The guys also cover Leonard Fournette being just about done in Jacksonville, Yannick Ngakoue getting in a twitter war with Tony Khan, the owner of the Jaguars&apos; son, and they react to the news that the NFL Draft technology test did not go well and try to figure out what things will look like on Thursday (36:58-1:58:54). Lastly, ESPN NFL Analyst Tim Hasselbeck joins the show to give his opinions on this years draft, why he doesn&apos;t think Tua&apos;s Wonderlic score is that big of a cause for concern, why every comparison doesn&apos;t need to be with a Hall of Famer, and what it will take for the Bengals to consider Joe Burrow to be a success (1:58:56-2:08:52). Don&apos;t forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you&apos;re watching the show for the chance to win some free merch. As always, stay safe out there. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 190 - Lane Johnson, Dustin Colquitt, Ryan Leaf, & Sam Roberts Stop By For A Damn Good Friday (Considering The Circumstances)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys dive into Jay Glazer's big news and the blowback he received on Twitter for reporting that Rams Center Brian Allen had tested positive for coronavirus, and are joined by a couple of great guests. First, Super Bowl Champion, 3x Pro Bowler and All-Pro Tackle, Lane Johnson joins the show. Pat and Lane chat about that Eagles Super Bowl team and what made them so special, Jason Kelce putting him on the spot at the Super Bowl parade, what things were like with Carson Wentz and Nick Foles/what makes Carson Wentz so special, and what he's been doing to get through the quarantine (9:14-20:21). Next, Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, a member of The Brand, Chiefs Punter Dustin Colquitt joins the program. Pat and Dustin chat about his 16 years in Kansas City and how he has seen things change during his time there, why he knew they were going to be special with Andy Reid at the helm, what it's like getting to experience having Patrick Mahomes as your quarterback, why having a juggernaut of an offense actually puts more pressure on him, and how he's been handling the quarantine with his five kids (20:23-40:24). Next, former #2 overall pick of the 1998 NFL Draft and friend of the show, Ryan Leaf joins Pat and the boys via FaceTime. They discuss his top quarterbacks in this years draft, why Tua's injury history gives him reason for concern, what it was like trying to deal with the pressure of being anointed the franchise quarterback, what he expects to happen on draft night, and where he thinks a good landing spot for Jalen Hurts might be (43:35-59:18). To close out the show, friend of the program, co-host of The Jim & Sam Show on SiriusXM, host of the Notsam Wrestling podcast, and Pat's co-host on the NXT preshows, Sam Roberts calls in from his home studio. Pat and Sam discuss the recent WWE layoffs and how that impacts the company, what he's hearing from some of the current wrestlers, what he thinks this means for WWE in the future, and how he got his wife to be okay with people constantly taking digs at him on social media (59:20-1:09:50). We hope everyone has a safe and relaxing weekend. Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat is joined by 8 year NFL veteran and Joe Burrow's QB Coach, Jordan Palmer. Pat and Jordan discuss the different prospects that he has been working with for this class, his thoughts on both Joe Burrow and Jordan Love, and how the quarantine will affect both the teams involved in the draft, and how some players will be affected by having no pro day or being able to sit down with GM's and coaches (00:00:49-21:09). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss their upcoming NFL Draft special that will be airing in prime time, and everything else that is happening in the sports world (21:11-1:48:28). Next, 3x Super Bowl Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, the NFL All Decade Kicker of the 2010's and current free agent, Stephen Gostkowski. Pat and Stephen chat about how his hip is feeling after having surgery this year, what it was like playing for Coach Belichick, which teams have been interested in him since the start of the offseason, how he anticipates his next stop being different, and what he's been doing to entertain his kids during the quarantine (1:41:30-2:02:14). Lastly, Pro Bowler, the NFL leader in tackles in 2017, and newly paid Jacksonville Jaguar, Joe Schobert, joins the program. Pat and Joe chat about why he ultimately chose the Jaguars, what it was like being in the locker room after the Myles Garrett incident, what it was like being a walk-on at Wisconsin and at what point he knew he belonged, how he's staying in shape during the quarantine, and he breaks down some of the things that an NFL linebacker looks at to know what the offense is trying to do (2:02:16-2:20:36).

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today&apos;s show, Pat is joined by 8 year NFL veteran and Joe Burrow&apos;s QB Coach, Jordan Palmer. Pat and Jordan discuss the different prospects that he has been working with for this class, his thoughts on both Joe Burrow and Jordan Love, and how the quarantine will affect both the teams involved in the draft, and how some players will be affected by having no pro day or being able to sit down with GM&apos;s and coaches (00:00:49-21:09). Next is another installment of McAfee &amp;amp; Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss their upcoming NFL Draft special that will be airing in prime time, and everything else that is happening in the sports world (21:11-1:48:28).

Lastly, Pro Bowler, the NFL leader in tackles in 2017, and newly paid Jacksonville Jaguar, Joe Schobert, joins the program. Pat and Joe chat about why he ultimately chose the Jaguars, what it was like being in the locker room after the Myles Garrett incident, what it was like being a walk-on at Wisconsin and at what point he knew he belonged, how he&apos;s staying in shape during the quarantine, and he breaks down some of the things that an NFL linebacker looks at to know what the offense is trying to do (2:02:16-2:20:36).

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat is joined by a couple of great guests. First, Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and friend of the program, Roman Harper FaceTimes into the show. Pat and Roman chat about his thoughts on Tua and what he thinks is in store for him not only in the NFL draft, but what he thinks of his injury history, and his career at Alabama, and how he thinks Covid19 is going to affect the draft process for scouts, general managers, and coaches, and why getting a guy into the building or having a face to face conversation is so beneficial in learning more about them (2:33-18:55). Next, it's another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk. Pat and AJ discuss ESPN's HORSE broadcast and whether or not they were entertained, NASCAR driver Kyle Larson making a monumental mistake on a racing livestream with other drivers, what their plans are for the NFL Draft and their reactions to the news coming out about the draft.

Lastly, Super Bowl Champion and Pro Bowler, former defensive end for the Detroit Lions and Seattle Seahawks, Cliff Avril joins Pat and the boys. They discuss his experiences on winning a Super Bowl and also being on the 0-16 Lions and some of the differences he noticed between the two, his thoughts on the NFL Draft and why he thinks we should expect fireworks with all the tech issues, what the Seahawks need to do in the offseason/draft in order to get back on top of the NFC, what he thinks is going to happen with Jadeveon Clowney and what kind of player he is, and his approach to playing rookie quarterbacks during the season (1:31:20-1:44:17).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 187 - Rhodes Scholar & NFL Alum, Dr. Myron Rolle, Clay Matthews, & Ike Taylor Stop By For Incredible Convos.. Also, Legend, AJ Hawk]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat is joined by Rhodes Scholar, former Florida State Legend and Tennessee Titan, and current neurosurgeon, Dr. Myron Rolle.

Dr. Rolle also explains what things have been like at Mass General in Boston during the covid19 pandemic, and he chats about where we are currently at with it, where he sees it going over the next few months, and answers some common misconceptions about the virus (00:00:56-26:40). On another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ welcome on Super Bowl Champion, 6x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, 2010 PFWA NFL Defensive Player of the Year, former Green Bay Packer and Los Angeles Ram, Clay Matthews. Clay chats with the guys about being snubbed by the all-decade team, and why he thinks he may have been overlooked, his recent tweets about the Rams being late on payments to both he and Todd Gurley, and Clay reminisces on his time at USC and remembers meeting Pat when they were at the Rookie Symposium together (1:15:30-1:38:28).

They discuss what it was like playing against Aaron Rodgers in Super Bowl XLV, and describes what it is like when a quarterback enters "the matrix," and Ike gives his thoughts on Tua's injury history and how he thinks that translates to the NFL, and whether or not playing in the SEC is in anyway similar to being in the NFL (1:57:31-2:17:16).

			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat is joined by recent Super Bowl Champion, 4x All-Pro, the man who protects Patrick Mahomes, Right Tackle Mitchell Schwartz. Pat and Mitchell talk about the Chiefs returning most of their team, and how he thinks their success last year will help them going into next season with so much unknown. They also cover what it’s like being on that dynamic of an offense, whether or not he actually gets to see what Patrick Mahomes was doing, what kind of guy Andy Reid is to play for, the differences between the Browns, who drafted him, and the Chiefs, and what he’s been doing with his time during the quarantine (3:53-23:17). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, as Pat and AJ Hawk welcome in new WWE Heavyweight Champion of the World after winning the title at Wrestlemania, Drew McIntyre. They chat about what the experience was like wrestling in front of no one and whether it was tough to perform, his thoughts on the product as a whole, and why being a champion with what is currently going on in the world is so important to him (40:47-58:33). Pat and AJ also discuss the matchup between Tiger/Peyton & Phil/Tom Brady and what whether they think it would be successful, chat about golf pushing all the majors back into the fall and potentially into NFL Sunday’s, among many other things (23:19-1:53:45). To close out the show, last year’s starting Quarterback for the Carolina Panthers, recently acquired by the Washington Redskins, Kyle Allen joins the show via FaceTime. Kyle and Pat chat about what it was like being around Cam Newton that often, what he learned from him, and what he think Cam has left in the tank, why he feels confident going into the year with the Redskins and having the same playbook, getting kicked out of his house in California amid the pandemic and having to figure out where he was going to go, and some of the things he’s been doing to stay in shape during his downtime (1:53:47-2:03:46).

Next, on another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ welcome Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, AJ's former teammate in Green Bay, and 10 year NFL veteran, TJ Lang.

The guys discuss what it&apos;s like trying to create an opportunity for yourself in the NFL as an offensive lineman and the moment TJ really had to make a decision in order to become great. TJ also chats about his recent burials on Twitter, what his time in Detroit with the Lions was like after leaving the Packers and his thoughts on Matt Patricia. TJ and AJ also tell Pat about what it was like hearing a pregame speech from Mike McCarthy and how it always got them ready to run through a wall, and everything else you could imagine in an incredible conversation (34:22-1:42:04). To close out the show, Pro Bowler and 2x Super Bowl Champion, Damien Woody FaceTimes in. Pat and Damien chat about his thoughts on Tom Brady going to Tampa Bay, what it was like being a teammate of Tom Brady, why he thinks Cam Newton hasn&apos;t been picked up by anybody yet and who he thinks makes the most sense going after him, his entrance into the TikTok game, and what he thinks about the idea that certain teams may rescind free agent offers if they can find a player in the draft and aren&apos;t able to get a player in for a physical or see them due to the coronavirus (1:42:06-2:04:20).

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today&apos;s show, Pat and the boys are joined by Head Coach of the Minnesota Golden Gophers, one of the most inspirational humans on the planet, the creator of the Nekton mentality, PJ Fleck. They chat about what it&apos;s like being the Head Coach of a major college football program during this pandemic, what he&apos;s having his kids do to get better this offseason despite not being able to do a lot of the things they normally would be doing, how he&apos;s handling everything with his staff, and Coach Fleck gives an inspirational speech for everyone to find a little light in all of the darkness that we care currently facing (3:19-17:26). Later, AJ Hawk is back for another edition of McAfee &amp;amp; Hawk Sports Talk as AJ and Pat chop it up about everything going on in the world, try to figure out where Cam Newton is going next and if he&apos;s going to have a major resurgence, they each talk about their recruiting process, and get into everything else you could imagine, whether&amp;nbsp;it&apos;s related to football or general life stuff (18:55-1:42:59). Don&apos;t forget to tweet the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for a chance to win some free merch and keep an eye out for the Office Olympics on &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 180 - Antonio Gates, Ted Ginn Jr., & AJ Hawk Join Us For Three Incredible Conversations. LET'S GO.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss where Cam Newton may eventually wind up and what makes the most sense for him, and why Chicago decided to go with Nick Foles instead after it was reported that Carolina tried to engage in talks with the Bears. Pat also runs through the Patriots 2020 schedule and the Bucs 2020 schedule and gives his predictions game by game. Joining the show is 13 year NFL veteran, 9th overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, one of the fastest WR's to ever play the game, Ted Ginn Jr. Ted and Pat chat about his high school days playing defensive back and running track, where many thought he could qualify for the Olympics. He chats about what he thinks Cam Newton has left in the tank, the difference between playing on good and poor teams, how he doesn't care about the accolades or the money and just wants to play football next year, and who some of the toughest cornerbacks he has faced during his career (7:55-26:45). Next, 8x Pro Bowler, 5x All-Pro. Member of the NFL 2000’s All-Decade Team and San Diego Chargers 50th Anniversary Team, one of the greatest Tight End’s in the history of the sport and eventual Hall of Famer, Antonio Gates, stops by. They chat about his career as a whole and how he saw the locker room dynamic change over time, what it was like playing with Phil Rivers and what Indianapolis is getting in him as a QB. He also explains what it was like when the Chargers moved to LA and how that process went, why he loves how the current TE’s play the game, what it was like being a trailblazer for basketball players jumping to the NFL, and what he’s doing now as he looks to move into a bigger role with the Chargers (37:49-54:43). Later, AJ Hawk is back for another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk. Pat and AJ chat about everything else happening around the NFL including DeShaun Watson liking tweets that make it seem like he wants out of Houston, where AJ thinks Cam Newton is going to wind up, the Colts not being interested in Tom Brady, and AJ shares the story about the first (and probably last) time he met Michael Jordan, and riding around with the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds (1:15:46-2:39:52). Today’s show is fun one. As always, stay safe out there and be smart.

			<description><![CDATA[Today's show is bookended by two great interviews, with another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk in the middle of the show. First, 16 year NFL veteran, Super Bowl Champion, former Tight End for the Patriots, Ravens, and Saints, among others, Benjamin Watson, joins the show to discuss everything going on with Tom Brady and whether he is shocked with his decision to go to Tampa Bay, what it was like playing with him, and what the differences are between a franchise with a winning culture and one that doesn't necessarily have that (3:20-17:03). Next, AJ Hawk joins Pat again for some McAfee Hawk Sports Talk where they discuss everything happening with free agency thus far, react to Brady going to Tampa Bay, Phillip Rivers going to the Colts, and the comments from Bill O'Brien to DeAndre Hopkins on his way out of Houston, among many other topics (17:05-1:26:38). To end the show, 3x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, defensive lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cameron Heyward joins the program. They chat about the Steelers outlook next year with Big Ben coming out, his thoughts on the CBA situation, what he's been doing during the quarantine, and what it's like to play for Mike Tomlin (1:30:26-1:46:29) Today's show is a fun one.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys effectively find a way to fix the NFL Draft amid the Coronavirus outbreak, as they have already decided that there will no be fan involvement whatsoever. Also, to beat the quarantine, Pat welcomes on Super Bowl Champion, former middle linebacker for the Green Bay Packers, friend of the show, AJ Hawk. AJ and Pat react to all the craziness of the start of NFL free agency. Which teams are interested in Brady, where is he potentially going? How did the Cardinals manage to fleece the Texans so bad in sending DeAndre Hopkins to Arizona, which teams are getting better? Which teams are getting worse? Pat and AJ break down all the above, plus much, much more (9:15-1:39:41). As always, stay safe out there, and try to make the best out of this quarantine situation.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 175 - The Coronavirus Is A Rather Large Deal. Also, ESPN's Dan Orlovsky & The Athletic's Senior NBA Insider Shams Charania Stopped By To Talk About Life]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat reacts to the expanding news of how serious the coronavirus pandemic is and further looks at how it is going to impact sports for the foreseeable future as the NCAA just announced they are canceling March Madness, the NBA is suspending it's season, and more leagues are looking into doing the same. Also joining the show is 12 year NFL Quarterback, current NFL analyst at ESPN, and friend of the program, Dan Orlovsky. Dan chats about just getting back from Disney World and going through the anxiety of making sure his family is okay as people are starting to be quarantined and go into lockdown. Dan and Pat also chat about Tom Brady's free agency, why the coronavirus won't inhibit teams from going after Brady, and why Dan thinks the Bucs are a very interesting and promising destination for Brady to end up (14:39-28:53). Also joining the show is Senior Lead NBA Insider and Analyst for The Athletic and Stadium, Shams Charania. Shams discusses breaking the news that Rudy Gobert was the first NBA player to test positive for coronavirus, what the next steps and precautions are for the NBA as a whole, when he sees the NBA resuming its season, and what it was like interviewing Gobert in person just two weeks before he tested positive for coronavirus (28:55-34:24). Lastly, Oklahoma City Thunder beat writer for The Athletic, Erik Horne stops by to chat about what it was like being in the arena as the Jazz/Thunder game was cancelled, the pulse of the fans in the stadium and whether they knew exactly what was going on, and what he's hearing around the league in terms of when teams will resume practicing and playing, and what teams are doing in terms of trying to stop the virus from spreading. At times like these, it's important for all of us to stick together and find a way to persevere through this. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

Also joining the show is Senior Lead NBA Insider and Analyst for The Athletic and Stadium, Shams Charania. Shams discusses breaking the news that Rudy Gobert was the first NBA player to test positive for coronavirus, what the next steps and precautions are for the NBA as a whole, when he sees the NBA resuming its season, and what it was like interviewing Gobert in person just two weeks before he tested positive for coronavirus (28:55-34:24). Lastly, Oklahoma City Thunder beat writer for The Athletic, Erik Horne stops by to chat about what it was like being in the arena as the Jazz/Thunder game was cancelled, the pulse of the fans in the stadium and whether they knew exactly what was going on, and what he&apos;s hearing around the league in terms of when teams will resume practicing and playing, and what teams are doing in terms of trying to stop the virus from spreading. At times like these, it&apos;s important for all of us to stick together and find a way to persevere through this. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 173 - 17 Year NFL QB Josh McCown & 3 Time, 3 Time Super Bowl Champion Mark Schlereth Stop By. NIT Podcast Bracket Is Out, Let's GO!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about Charlie Weis going on record and stating that he and "Tommy" Brady have been texting one another and that Tom doesn't know where he's going and neither does anyone else, so he wants everyone to slow down. Pat discusses Charlie Weis being Tom Brady's mouthpiece and what that means, as well as the implications league wide if Brady signs with the San Francisco 49ers. Also joining the show is 3x Super Bowl Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, chili mogul, and friend of the show, Mark "Stink" Schlereth. Pat and Mark chat about his thoughts on Tom Brady and how he sees a very real possibility that Brady doesn't end up back in New England, what he thinks about Charlie Weis being Tom Brady's new spokesman, his take on the CBA negotiations and what he thinks will happen there, and details why health insurance is so important to retired players as he has had 20+ surgeries, and whether or not he is still punking kids in the weight room (17:08-34:43). Pat also gives his thoughts on last weekend's Lakers/Clippers game and the guys chat about why LeBron is so great, whether or not the Lakers are the team to beat this year, and why that brand of basketball is so fun to watch, and Pat reacts to the Podcast NIT bracket being released and what he thinks about PMI's chances. Also included is a Youtube question to Pat about what his greater achievement was, the hit on Trindon Holliday, or recovering his own onside kick in Houston. Later, 17 year NFL veteran, a man who has played Quarterback for 11 teams most recently with the Eagles, and incredible basketball player, Josh McCown joins the program. Josh and Pat chat about him tearing the hamstring off the bone in the Eagles playoff loss to the Seahawks and what that rehab process is like, how he finished the game, and how badly it hurt. Josh also gives his take on the CBA negotiations as he went through it last time around, chats about his basketball game, being a high school football coach during the season, how he keeps his hair looking so good, and what's in store for his future (50:36-1:07:21). Today's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about The Boston Herald report that Tom Brady and Bill Belichick had a phone conversation that did not go well, and what that means for Brady's upcoming decision.

Also joining the show is the starting Running Back for the Green Bay Packers, last year's league leader in rushing touchdowns, Aaron Jones. Pat and Aaron chat about his relationship with Aaron Rodgers and what their relationship is like, what his offseason has consisted of thus far, why he thinks he took such a big jump on the field this year, and what the Packers need to do in order to reach the Super Bowl (28:28-37:35).

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today&apos;s show, Pat and the boys chat about The Boston Herald report that Tom Brady and Bill Belichick had a phone conversation that did not go well, and what that means for Brady&apos;s upcoming decision.

Later, 2x Pro Bowler, one of the best Tight Ends in the NFL, friend of the show and current Minnesota Viking, Kyle Rudolph. He explains to Pat whether or not he pushed off against the Saints in New Orleans in the playoffs this year, how things are going to be different in Minnesota after losing their OC, his relationship with Kirk Cousins, and his thoughts on the 450 page document that the NFLPA is sending players to sift through ahead of their vote on March 12 (12:49-27:01). Also joining the show is the starting Running Back for the Green Bay Packers, last year&apos;s league leader in rushing touchdowns, Aaron Jones.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 171 - TOM BRADY CONTROLS THE WORLD.. OT Nate Solder Stops By & Incredible Chatter About Life. Let's Have A Thursday]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the guys react to the news that the 49ers are making a late push to bring Tom Brady to the Bay, a scenario which would see the Patriots trading for Jimmy Garoppolo, and reiterate the fact that Tom Brady has played free agency like an absolute genius. Pat and the guys also look at the plethora of quarterbacks that will be hitting the open market within the next few weeks and try to figure out where some of them will wind up, despite the fact that many teams are waiting for the Tom Brady domino to fall. Also joining the show is 2x Super Bowl Champion, #17 overall pick of the 2011 NFL draft by the New England Patriots and current offensive tackle for the New York Giants, Nate Solder. Pat and Nate talk about his positive thoughts towards the CBA and why he is going to vote yes, and how he is trying to be more of a voice for some of the core players who don't have as big of a social media following as some of the other players who have been vocal. He explains his thoughts on the whole process and what he's been hearing in his locker room. Nate also sheds some light on what it's like to be teammates with both Tom Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo and what their relationship was like, and whether or not he has any clue as to where Brady is going this offseason (34:05-46:16). Also included is News with Nick to round out what else we missed in the sports world. As always, send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat when listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch, and enjoy today's closing song by our very own Boston Connor. Today's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat and the boys are joined by seven year NFL veteran and now Quarterbacking Guru for QB Summit in which he gets college players ready for the NFL Draft, and aids in current NFL quarterback’s progression in the league, Jordan Palmer in studio. He chats about his process with Joe Burrow this year, and how they build a plan of attack in order to get him ready for his rookie season in the NFL, and not on being drafted by a specific team. He gives his idea for a new combine drill that will help dispel the small hands narrative, and talks about some of the other QB prospects in this year’s draft who he’s coached or watched film of (4:59-24:14). Next, all-time legend of a comedian, the best impressionist to ever walk this earth, friend of the show, Frank Caliendo joins Jordan Palmer on the couch. Pat and Frank have a heartfelt conversation on Frank coming along with his social media game to reintroduce himself to fans, Frank shares a hilarious story about performing at a corporate event for Tony Robbins, and of course Frank crushes impression after impression (26:30-01:11:43). Also included is Pat reacting to more from the CBA negotiations that now has some very elite players publicly voicing why they voted no, and a lot of the middling players on the roster voting yes, and where that leaves us now moving forward. Today’s show is a good time. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

Pat and Frank have a heartfelt conversation on Frank coming along with his social media game to reintroduce himself to fans, Frank shares a hilarious story about performing at a corporate event for Tony Robbins, and of course Frank crushes impression after impression (26:30-01:11:43). Also included is Pat reacting to more from the CBA negotiations that now has some very elite players publicly voicing why they voted no, and a lot of the middling players on the roster voting yes, and where that leaves us now moving forward. Today’s show is a good time. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 168 - No CoronaVirus Yet. General Manager Of The Los Angeles Chargers, Tom Telesco, Stops By... AND LEGEND, NICK MANGOLD Joins Us. Let's Go.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat sits down with Los Angeles Charges General Manager, Tom Telesco. Tom tells Pat the story of how he watched Pat at his bowl game Senior year and went back and told Bill Polian that he thought he had just found the Colts new punter. Tom also explains what it’s like being a General Manager during combine week, including all the things the Chargers are looking for, what the process is like, and whether he’s a best available, or biggest need guy. Pat also grills Tom about Tom Brady potentially landing in Los Angeles with the Chargers and if they’re in the market for a veteran Quarterback after the departure of Phillip Rivers. It’s a great interview into the mind of one of the 32 decision makers during the NFL Combine (2:58-21:46). Also joining the show is 7x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, former center for the New York Jets and friend of the show, Nick Mangold. Nick and Pat discuss the new reports coming out about the CBA and Nick gives his stance on where he stands, and what he thinks certain players are rejecting, why the process took so long the other night, and what things may be holding it up from being passed. Nick and Pat also chat about his love for barbecue, and getting into the barbecue sauce game (39:04-55:06). Pat and Digs also discuss Pat winning the Heisman Trophy of radio, dive a little bit deeper into the CBA negotiations as certain things are now starting to be reported and some big name players still have massive issues with the deal, and they do a deep dive into Zion Williamson and LeBron’s first matchup, and why it is impossible not to be impressed with what Zion has done in his first handful of games in the NBA and why LeBron is still so tough. Don’t forget to use the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for your chance to win some free march. Today’s show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat reacts to the new proposed CBA which was reported by Adam Schefter a couple of nights ago. Pat tries to break down and make sense of all of the mathematics, and dives into what it means, why the players will take issue with certain parts, and what the owners are probably thinking as they try to navigate their way through the whole thing. Pat and the boys also discuss the proposed addition of one more playoff team in the AFC and NFC, and why players like Richard Sherman are very vocal about making their decisions regarding the CBA very carefully. Later, Tom Pelissero of the NFL Network and NFL.com joins the show to give a more in depth breakdown of what he is hearing from owners and players regarding these CBA negotiations, where he thinks the potential snags will be, and where some more of the discussions and challenges will lead over the course of the next few days as owners and the NFLPA representatives meet. Tom also gives Pat his take on Tom Brady and whether or not he will actually spurn New England for free agency (20:10-36:06). Pat also takes a couple of calls from around the nation and dives into the Titans current situation and whether or not they should give Derrick Henry a max contract and resign Ryan Tannehill or if they should let them go and try to tank for Trevor Lawrence, and looks ahead to Tyson Fury/Deontay Wilder II and gives his prediction for what will happen in the highly anticipated rematch.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 165 - Feels Great To Be Back. Kyle “Juice” Juszczyk & Kyle “Legend” Williams Stop By For Fantastic Conversations. Let’s Go.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Pat is back from Hawaii and today’s show is a good one. Pat and the boys break down Drew Brees announcing that he’ll be coming back for a 20th season, and what that means for Taysom Hill and Teddy Bridgewater. They also speculate on where some of the other free agent Quarterbacks may end up going this offseason. Also joining the show is 4x Pro Bowler, the first Harvard man to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl, 49ers Fullback Kyle Juszczyk. Pat and Kyle chat about the Super Bowl and what Coach Shanahan’s message was going into the offseason, what it’s like having Jimmy G in the huddle and how he responds to the criticism, how his game differs at FB, what it was like going to Harvard, and they chat about his apparel line Juice 44 (14:46-30:29).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 164 - Brian Westbrook, Carson Palmer, And More On This Beautiful Feel Good Friday]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys look at the free agency landscape for players now, and look how guys like Mookie Betts and Tom Brady are the perfect example for what athletes worth tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars are doing now when exploring their next moves. Pat and the guys also look at both Jason and Travis Kelce's Super Bowl parade speeches which were both incredible in their own regard and ultimately decide which one they think is better, and Pat looks ahead to this weekend's XFL slate and has a few more thoughts on the league as we are on the precipice of the rebranded leagues inaugural season and how it will be different than the first iteration of the XFL, and what changes will separate it from the NFL and what the NFL could potentially adopt from the XFL like the skycam. Also joining the show is 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, member of the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame, former Running Back and friend of the program, Brian Westbrook stops by. Brian chats about Andy Reid's legacy and why he is so happy for him after winning his first Super Bowl title. They also discuss Dak potentially holding out if he gets franchise tagged by the Cowboys and whether or not that is the right idea, and Brian gives some insight as a guy who formerly held out going into the season. Brian also gives his thoughts on the potential new CBA and on the possibility of a 17 game season (20:58-34:14). Also joining the show is 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, Heisman Trophy winner, and former Quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders, and Arizona Cardinals, Carson Palmer stops by. Carson chats about what he thinks Jameis will do in his second season in a Bruce Arians led offense, and how Carson's interception numbers went way down in his 2nd season under Arians. Carson also gives his thoughts on Troy Polamalu being a 1st ballot Hall of Famer and what it was like playing against guys like him and Ed Reed and the differences in their styles of play. Carson also lets Pat know who the best guy he ever played with was, and who his favorite center he ever took snaps from was, he gives his thoughts on Larry Fitzgerald and how he has been the model of consistency for the last 15+ years (36:28-48:00). Today's show is a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

They chat about whether or not his knife training in the offseason was with real knives, what it&apos;s like getting double and triple teamed on almost every single play, what he did to become such a massive human being, and which offensive lineman, if any, he has beef with (16:39-28:22). Also joining the show is former Head Coach of the Oakland Raiders and Cleveland Browns, Hue Jackson. Hue and Pat chat about the Super Bowl and where each team will go from here, Hue gives his thoughts on what the Bengals should do with the first pick in the NFL draft, whether or not it is beneficial for rookie Quarterback&apos;s to sit behind veterans in order to learn the ropes of the NFL, &amp;nbsp;what he thinks Baker needs to do to be more successful next season, and looks at the Rooney Rule in the NFL and whether or not it is actually doing what it is intended to do (30:48-47:26). Pat also looks at which team drafting in the top 10 is most likely to have a 49ers type turnaround next season, and gives his thoughts on the newest members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, including his old nemesis, Troy Polamalu.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 162 - Drew Brees, Matt Patricia, Michael Lombardi, & A Full Super Bowl Conversation. Let's GOOOO]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys give a full breakdown of the Chiefs gritty comeback victory in Super Bowl LIV. Pat discusses who he thinks the blame falls on as most media pundits are either pointing to Kyle Shanahan or Jimmy G, and chats about how scary the Chiefs are, who seemingly still did not play a complete game in the playoffs. Pat also discusses the NFL Honors handed out this year, and why he is very excited for the potential Patrick Mahomes/Lamar Jackson matchup for years to come. Also included is an incredible interview from Radio Row with Super Bowl Champion/MVP, 13x Pro Bowler, 5x All-Pro, 2x Offensive Player of the Year, Walton Payton Man of the Year Winner, and the man who holds almost every passing record in NFL history, New Orleans Saints Quarterback, Drew Brees. Pat clears the air with Drew and chats about the last time they were in Miami together for Super Bowl XLIV, and if that feeling is what keeps him going, what his plans are for next year as some signs may be pointing to retirement, if being left off the NFL All 100 team adds fuel to the fire, and why he excluded kickers and punters from his motivational speech in the locker room at Purdue earlier this year (13:39-24:37). Later, former GM and VP of the Cleveland Browns, member of the New England Patriots coaching staff, author, host of the GM Shuffle podcast and the Lombardi Line on the Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSIN), friend of the show, Michael Lombardi stops by to recap the Super Bowl. Pat and Michael discuss the game, and what the big takeaways were, including Kansas City not being called for one holding penalty, who deserves the most blame for the 49ers blowing a 10 point lead in the 4th quarter, why the 49ers abandoned the run, which few plays decided the game, and where the Chiefs and 49ers go from here. Pat and Michael also discuss Tom Brady's future plans, and how the NFL CBA could put a hold on that and Patrick Mahomes' new contract for the time being (26:31-41:49). Lastly, 3x Super Bowl Champion and current Head Coach of the Detroit Lions, Matt Patricia joins Pat and the boys from Radio Row. He breaks down what it's like coaching in the Super Bowl and how your preparation and mindset going into the game is unlike anything else, how excited he is to be coming back for another year in Detroit and why he still thinks he can be successful there, whether or not he has had any communication with Calvin Johnson recently and if he would entertain trying to bring him back, and his thoughts on the NFL changing into a more offensive minded league (51:04-1:03:11). Make sure you tweet your favorite moments of the NFL season to @PatMcAfeeShow for a chance to be featured on the year end NFL recap video. Enjoy today, it's our last taste of the NFL for a long time. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 160 - BIG TRUSS, Mark Ingram & Miles Sanders Join Us Live From The Super Bowl... And A Life Perspective Chat]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat gives a deep introspective monologue on whether or not professional athletes at the top of their craft will start retiring more when considering their careers given the tragic death of Kobe Bryant, and why it's important to always remember which things are most important in people's lives. Also joining the show live from Radio Row at the Super Bowl is 2009 National Champion and Heisman Trophy Winner, 3x Pro Bowler, and current Running Back for the Baltimore Ravens, Mark Ingram. Mark gives his thoughts on the Baltimore Ravens' season this year, what that locker room is like, why he expects their offense to have even more success next year despite defense's planning new ways to stop them, how he's managed to find success everywhere he has gone, his thoughts on Drew Brees potentially retiring, and Mark gives his prediction for Super Bowl LIV (5:38-18:09). Pat and the boys also discuss Gronk's recent comments about how he thinks Tom Brady should test the free agency waters, and Boston Connor is left in the lurch trying to deal with the fallout. Pat also explains why he thinks Patrick Mahomes is a lock for Super Bowl MVP if the Chiefs win, and why he's tired of hearing all the Jimmy G slander. Later, newly christened member of the All-Rookie team, and nominee for Rookie of the Year, former Penn State Nittany Lion and current Philadelphia Eagles Running Back, Miles Sanders joins the show from Radio Row. He chats about what it was like expecting to be apart of a running back by committee at Penn State with Saquon Barkley, and whether he'd go back and change things now, what Carson Wentz leadership style is like and what some common misconceptions the public may have about him are, chats about his relationship with his mother, whether or not he prepared a speech if he wins Rookie of the Year, and gives at insight into what offseason plans are now that he has time off for perhaps the first time in his life (29:48-39:08). It's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<itunes:summary>On today&apos;s show, Pat gives a deep introspective monologue on whether or not professional athletes at the top of their craft will start retiring more when considering their careers given the tragic death of Kobe Bryant, and why it&apos;s important to always remember which things are most important in people&apos;s lives. Also joining the show live from Radio Row at the Super Bowl is 2009 National Champion and Heisman Trophy Winner, 3x Pro Bowler, and current Running Back for the Baltimore Ravens, Mark Ingram. Mark gives his thoughts on the Baltimore Ravens&apos; season this year, what that locker room is like, why he expects their offense to have even more success next year despite defense&apos;s planning new ways to stop them, how he&apos;s managed to find success everywhere he has gone, his thoughts on Drew Brees potentially retiring, and Mark gives his prediction for Super Bowl LIV (5:38-18:09). Pat and the boys also discuss Gronk&apos;s recent comments about how he thinks Tom Brady should test the free agency waters, and Boston Connor is left in the lurch trying to deal with the fallout. Pat also explains why he thinks Patrick Mahomes is a lock for Super Bowl MVP if the Chiefs win, and why he&apos;s tired of hearing all the Jimmy G slander. Later, newly christened member of the All-Rookie team, and nominee for Rookie of the Year, former Penn State Nittany Lion and current Philadelphia Eagles Running Back, Miles Sanders joins the show from Radio Row. He chats about what it was like expecting to be apart of a running back by committee at Penn State with Saquon Barkley, and whether he&apos;d go back and change things now, what Carson Wentz leadership style is like and what some common misconceptions the public may have about him are, chats about his relationship with his mother, whether or not he prepared a speech if he wins Rookie of the Year, and gives at insight into what offseason plans are now that he has time off for perhaps the first time in his life (29:48-39:08). It&apos;s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 159 - A Tribute To Kobe Bryant, A Deep Convo About The GOAT.. Also, Brian Westbrook Stops By For Football Chatter]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat reflects on what Kobe Bryant meant to him as the world tries to come to grips with Kobe and his daughter Gianna's death in a tragic helicopter crash on Sunday in Calabasas, California. Pat recounts some of his favorite on court moments from Kobe's career, looks at how his impact transcended basketball and he became a global icon, and looks at the mark Kobe made on current players and coaches careers, as we celebrate the life of one of the greatest basketball players of all-time, who perhaps had his greatest chapter of life ahead of him, and is gone too soon in a day the world will never forget. Later, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and member of the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame, Brian Westbrook joins the show. Brian chats about the Donovan McNabb/TO beef and gives his thoughts on the whole situation, breaks down what it's like to play in Andy Reid's offense and discusses the complexities within it, and dives into what he expects to see from both the Chiefs and 49ers as we gear up for Super Bowl LIV (53:49-1:05:54). Cherish each moment, and remember which things are most precious in life, because tomorrow is never guaranteed. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat and the boys do a full break down of Zion Williamson’s NBA debut and Pat explains why he doesn’t think Pelicans Head Coach Alvin Gentry handled the situation correctly and why Zion looked so lost at the start of the game, when he looked like the most unstoppable player on the court in the 4th quarter.

Darius also gives his Super Bowl LIV prediction (30:07-43:45). Pat also gives his thoughts on Donovan McNabb’s recent comments about Terrell Owens being the reason that their Eagles team broke up after the 2005 Super Bowl loss, and Pat reads a statement sent to him by TO regarding the situation.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 157 - Super Bowl Champions Chase Daniel & Ike Taylor Stop By. A Basketball Brawl Reaction & More Life Chatter. Let's GO.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat is joined by 2x Super Bowl Champion, former Pittsburgh Steelers great, and friend of the show, Ike Taylor. Ike and Pat discuss the Darrelle Revis/Richard Sherman beef, and Ike breaks down the differences in both of their styles, and gives his thoughts on what made Revis so upset with Sherman. Ike also discusses why he thinks the 49ers may be too much for the Chiefs to handle, he chats about the Chiefs weapons and what San Francisco needs to do to defend them, gives his thoughts on whether or not Joe Burrow will have typical rookie struggles when he enters the league, and gives his prediction for the Super Bowl (9:11-24:25). Also joining the show is Super Bowl Champion, former Heisman finalist, and one of the best backup Quarterbacks in the NFL, Chase Daniel. Chase gives his thoughts on the Bears' season this year and why he thinks things didn't go the way they expected. He also touches on Mitchell Trubisky's struggles and why he thinks he was one of the most important elements in keeping the locker room together when things started to go sour for the Bears. Chase also gives his thoughts on the Super Bowl matchup after having a couple of weeks to watch the Chiefs and 49ers play, and gives his thoughts on the futures of Tom Brady and Drew Brees while considering his own options for his next backup role (26:22-40:11). Pat also gives his thoughts on the NFL Draft being in Las Vegas this year and asks his agent if the different locations for the NFL Draft have been a success, how he thinks the logistics will play out with players being driven by boat to a floating red carpet on the Bellagio fountain. Pat also goes to bat for Jimmy G and for those who are saying he is nothing more than a system Quarterback, and breaks down the bench clearing brawl between Kansas and Kansas State that spilled into the crowd and has resulted in some harsh suspensions for each team thus far. Don't forget to send your Super Bowl predictions in with the hashtag #PatIPredict. If you correctly guess, you'll be entered into  a drawing for a chance to win $1,000. Today's episode is fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

Ike and Pat discuss the Darrelle Revis/Richard Sherman beef, and Ike breaks down the differences in both of their styles, and gives his thoughts on what made Revis so upset with Sherman. Ike also discusses why he thinks the 49ers may be too much for the Chiefs to handle, he chats about the Chiefs weapons and what San Francisco needs to do to defend them, gives his thoughts on whether or not Joe Burrow will have typical rookie struggles when he enters the league, and gives his prediction for the Super Bowl (9:11-24:25). Also joining the show is Super Bowl Champion, former Heisman finalist, and one of the best backup Quarterbacks in the NFL, Chase Daniel. Chase gives his thoughts on the Bears&apos; season this year and why he thinks things didn&apos;t go the way they expected. He also touches on Mitchell Trubisky&apos;s struggles and why he thinks he was one of the most important elements in keeping the locker room together when things started to go sour for the Bears. Chase also gives his thoughts on the Super Bowl matchup after having a couple of weeks to watch the Chiefs and 49ers play, and gives his thoughts on the futures of Tom Brady and Drew Brees while considering his own options for his next backup role (26:22-40:11). Pat also gives his thoughts on the NFL Draft being in Las Vegas this year and asks his agent if the different locations for the NFL Draft have been a success, how he thinks the logistics will play out with players being driven by boat to a floating red carpet on the Bellagio fountain. Pat also goes to bat for Jimmy G and for those who are saying he is nothing more than a system Quarterback, and breaks down the bench clearing brawl between Kansas and Kansas State that spilled into the crowd and has resulted in some harsh suspensions for each team thus far. Don&apos;t forget to send your Super Bowl predictions in with the hashtag #PatIPredict. If you correctly guess, you&apos;ll be entered into  a drawing for a chance to win $1,000. Today&apos;s episode is fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat does a deep dive on everything that happened in this weekend's championship games. He breaks down why the Chiefs might be a buzzsaw that cannot be stopped despite the fact that they still shoot themselves in foot from time to time, and why Patrick Mahomes is so damn good. Pat also looks at the 49ers wire to wire domination of the Packers and why they are so special defensively, and why he thinks Jimmy Garappolo is more than capable of making the big plays that it will take to beat the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIV. Joining the show to break down both games and look ahead to the Super Bowl matchup is 2x Super Bowl Champion, former Defensive End/Linebacker for the Patriots, and friend of the show, Rob Ninkovich. Rob chats about his big takeaways from both conference championships, and why he thinks the Super Bowl will be a very tight matchup. He also gushes about both the Chiefs weapons, and the 49ers dominant defense and run game, and gives explains what he thinks the keys will be for both teams to win in Miami. Rob also gives his thoughts on the Darrelle Revis/Richard Sherman Twitter beef (17:52-33:57). Pat also tips his cap to both the Packers and Titans and looks ahead at what each team needs to do in the offseason in order to get back into the positions they put themselves in this year. Pat also gives his thoughts on the Conor McGregor vs. Cowboy Cerrone tilt, and why he wants to see a McGregor vs. Masvidal matchup next, plus Pat gives his take on what it means that Tom Brady was seen talking with Raiders owner Mark Davis and what that means for the other teams in the league interested in Brady.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss the new Aaron Hernandez documentary on Netflix and try to process all the information that was presented, and find it hard to break down the situation other than finding it to be very sad and tragic amongst other things. Also joining the show is 2x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, member of the 2000's All Decade Team, the man known as the X-Factor and the Human Joystick, former Chiefs great Dante Hall, joins the show. He and Pat discuss this weekend's Conference Championship games and Dante explains why he thinks despite the Titans having the kind of attack that is poised to win in the playoffs, the Chiefs might have too much firepower. Dante also breaks down the NFC Championship game and whether or not the Packers have enough on the offensive side to challenge the 49ers elite defensive and their dominant front 4. Dante also chats about who some of his favorite returners in the league are right now, and what he thinks of the XFL rules that will allow for more explosive plays on punt and kickoff returns (21:04-36:55). Also joining the program is 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, recently retired Linebacker for the Buffalo Bills, and friend of the show, Lorenzo Alexander. Lorenzo and Pat chat about his retirement and when he first made the decision to hang up his cleats. Lorenzo also discusses Luke Keuchly's retirement and whether or not he was surprised by the move. They also cover each Conference Championship, and Lorenzo explains why it is so hard to tackle Derrick Henry, and what Aaron Rodgers needs to do to try to exploit San Francisco's explosive front 4. Lorenzo also gives his thoughts on how the Buffalo Bills are poised to make a big step starting next year (39:23-48:04). Also included is the new segment, "Dumb Questions Asked on Sports Shows," with topics including Joe Burrow vs. Tua, Russell Wilson attempting to make a "comeback" next year, and whether or not Patrick Mahomes will be considered a failure if the Chiefs don't win the Super Bowl. Today's show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 154 - MLB ConTROVersy Chat w/ Gold Glove Tucker Barnhart. Also, Legends Jeff Garcia & Thomas Morestead Stop By]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat reacts to the shocking news of Luke Kuechly's retirement from the Carolina Panthers after 8 seasons as arguably the best linebacker in the game. Pat reflects on some of the thoughts he had when announcing his retirement and looks back on what will undoubtedly be a Hall of Fame career for Kuechly. Pat and the boys also discuss what comes next for Matt Rhule and the Carolina Panthers as they lose Kuechly and hire LSU passing game coordinator Joe Brady, and what that means for their Quarterback situation and if they are now in a position to trade up to try and draft Joe Burrow. Next, Gold Glove winner and current Catcher of the Cincinnati Reds, Tucker Barnhart stops by to discuss the controversy surrounding the cheating scandal that has rocked the Houston Astros, Boston Red Sox, and the rest of the MLB. Tucker explains why he doesn't necessarily like what is happening with the punishments, gives his take on the whole situation, and explains his opinions on the entire situation, as a guy who is intimately involved with giving signs every game (20:33-31:54). Next, 4x Pro Bowler, Grey Cup Champion, and legend of an NFL Quarterback, Jeff Garcia joins Pat and the boys to discuss the NFL Conference Championships. Jeff gives his thoughts on Green Bay vs. San Francisco, and why he thinks the game will be closer than most people think, and what he sees as the keys to the game are for both the Packers and the 49ers. Jeff also dives into the AFC Championship and explains why it is so hard to stop a guy like Patrick Mahomes, but why a team like the Titans might have the perfect formula for doing so (33:33-44:10). Lastly, Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, All Pro, and current Punter for the New Orleans Saints, Thomas Morestead joins the show live from LA. Thomas and Pat discuss where things are currently at with the NFLPA discussions and if he thinks things are moving in the right direction. He gives his thoughts on the state of the Saints after another crushing defeat in the playoffs and whether or not he thinks Drew Brees will return to New Orleans for another season, and what makes him so special. Thomas also reacts to Luke Kuechly's retirement and discusses whether or not he thinks this will become more of a norm moving forward with elite players retiring during what most would consider the prime of their careers. Pat and Thomas also reflect on the PFF Punter of the decade and Pat shares the story about how Thomas taught him how to punt after he got drafted (46:18-59:43). Today's show is a loaded one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 153 - Josh Sitton & All Of The Football]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys recap everything from a wild and exhilarating Divisional Round weekend in the NFL Playoffs. They discuss Kansas City's miraculous comeback and why it is hard to count them out of any game when Patrick Mahomes starts to get things cooking. They also discuss a few of Bill O'Brien's coaching blunders during the game and decide whether or not he deserves the blame for blowing a 24 point lead on the road. The guys also dive into the Titans vs. Ravens matchup and chat about why they think this Titans team has a team of destiny feel to them, discuss why they haven't offered Derrick Henry a massive contract extension yet, give praise to Ryan Tannehill, who despite mediocre stats, has done everything the Titans have asked of him in order for them to be successful, and chat about why they think Mike Vrabel has been a HUGE difference maker for the Titans. Later, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, and Super Bowl Champion, Josh Sitton joins the show to discuss the Packers' huge win over the Seahawks at Lambeau on Sunday and looks ahead to the Conference Championship against San Francisco. Josh and Pat discuss the Jimmy Graham catch on 3rd down to seal the game for the Packers and how it is inexcusable that the NFL didn't have an additional camera angle to help the refs give an exact spot. Josh also recalls some stories about Aaron Rodgers from their Super Bowl run together, and why he thinks the media bashing Rodgers all year did nothing but add fuel to his fire. Josh and Pat also look ahead to the matchup with the 49ers and discuss what the Packers need to do to be successful against a very dominant, consistent football team (29:25-41:31). Pat also has some thoughts on the Browns deciding to hire Vikings OC Kevin Stefanski as Head Coach and whether or not that was the right decision, when 9ers Defensive Coordinator and other candidate for the Browns HC job, Robert Saleh dominated the coaching matchup between the two on Sunday. Pat also breaks down his thoughts on the Browns' potential GM candidate, and if all of this will equate to success in Cleveland. Lastly, Digs attempts to rework the College Football Playoff to 16 teams in order to maximize the amount of games that people will care about during Bowl Season. Today's a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 152 - AJ Hawk, Eddie George, And $1000 GIVEAWAY.. Let's Go]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s show is highlighted by two incredible interviews. First, Pat welcomes 4x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, former Heisman Trophy winner, NFL Offensive ROY, and Titans/Oilers Ring of Honor member, Eddie George. Pat and Eddie chat about this weekend’s Titans/Ravens game and why he thinks that Mark Ingram is the key to getting the Ravens going, and why he has hope for the Titans with Ingram being hobbled by a calf injury. Eddie also explains why he loved running the football in snow and cold weather, and if he thinks the terrible weather in Baltimore this weekend is going to play a factor. Eddie also talks a little bit about his time in Dallas and whether he thinks the Cowboys will ever be able to be successful again with Jerry being more important than the Head Coach, and Eddie gives his College Football Playoff championship game pick (2:40-19:55). Also joining the program is Super Bowl Champion, 5th pick of the 2006 NFL Draft for the Green Bay Packers, friend of the show, and one of the most hilarious humans on the face of the earth, AJ Hawk. Pat gets the pulse of the Packers from AJ who has had contact with Aaron Rodgers very recently and see’s where his head is at going into this weekend against the Seahawks at Lambeau. AJ breaks down what we should be looking for in that game, and why exactly Rodgers ramps it up during these types of games when everyone in the media is taking shots at him. Pat and AJ also catch up and take a few shots at one another in the process (24:39-39:38). Pat and the boys also react to Mike McCarthy’s first press conference as Head Coach of the Dallas Cowboys and also chat about Matt Rhule being introduced as the newest Head Coach of the Carolina Panthers and whether his coaching style will translate to the NFL. Pat also takes a phone call from someone who has a very interesting take on where Tom Brady may end up. Stick around to learn how you can potentially win $1,000 in another massive giveaway. Today’s show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s show is highlighted by two incredible interviews. First, Pat welcomes 4x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, former Heisman Trophy winner, NFL Offensive ROY, and Titans/Oilers Ring of Honor member, Eddie George. Pat and Eddie chat about this weekend’s Titans/Ravens game and why he thinks that Mark Ingram is the key to getting the Ravens going, and why he has hope for the Titans with Ingram being hobbled by a calf injury. Eddie also explains why he loved running the football in snow and cold weather, and if he thinks the terrible weather in Baltimore this weekend is going to play a factor. Eddie also talks a little bit about his time in Dallas and whether he thinks the Cowboys will ever be able to be successful again with Jerry being more important than the Head Coach, and Eddie gives his College Football Playoff championship game pick (2:40-19:55). Also joining the program is Super Bowl Champion, 5th pick of the 2006 NFL Draft for the Green Bay Packers, friend of the show, and one of the most hilarious humans on the face of the earth, AJ Hawk. Pat gets the pulse of the Packers from AJ who has had contact with Aaron Rodgers very recently and see’s where his head is at going into this weekend against the Seahawks at Lambeau. AJ breaks down what we should be looking for in that game, and why exactly Rodgers ramps it up during these types of games when everyone in the media is taking shots at him. Pat and AJ also catch up and take a few shots at one another in the process (24:39-39:38). Pat and the boys also react to Mike McCarthy’s first press conference as Head Coach of the Dallas Cowboys and also chat about Matt Rhule being introduced as the newest Head Coach of the Carolina Panthers and whether his coaching style will translate to the NFL. Pat also takes a phone call from someone who has a very interesting take on where Tom Brady may end up. Stick around to learn how you can potentially win $1,000 in another massive giveaway. Today’s show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 151 - Steve-0, Steve Smith Sr., & No Other Steve's, But A Damn Good Time]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat and the boys break down the cryptic Instagram post that Tom Brady put up yesterday thanking the fans in New England for all of their support over the last decade. The guys decide whether or not this means that the dynasty is over and that Brady is out of New England and dive into a couple of Brady’s options moving forward that are being reported including potentially landing in powder blue to become the face of the Chargers in LA, pairing with Jon Gruden in Las Vegas for the Raiders with Derek Carr potentially on his way out, or perhaps coming to Indianapolis for a young team with a great line and formidable defense. Also joining the show is 5x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor member, future Hall of Famer and current NFL Network analyst, Steve Smith Sr. He explains why he decided to leave social media, gives his thoughts on Matt Rhule being hired by the Panthers and whether or not he thinks Cam Newton will be apart of his plans moving forward, his thoughts on playing for John Harbaugh in Baltimore and if his hiring up there opened the door for a guy like Joe Judge in New York, as they are both experienced with coaching special teams units. Steve also dives into this weekend’s divisional round matchups in the NFL and explains what he thinks the keys will be and some other interesting nuggets to look into (1:48-19:01). To close out the show, the guys welcome standup comedian, stuntman, and Jackass icon, Steve-O into the studio. They discuss his career and all the different moments that have led him to where he’s at now, including enrolling in clown college, some of the craziest stunts he’s done throughout his career, what his standup shows are like, and he gives some exclusive, never before heard news about the new Jackass movie. Steve-O also opens up about his sobriety, and reflects on what his undoubtedly be a crazy life in an incredibly entertaining and honest conversation (52:57-1:13:00). Today’s episode is good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 149 - The Next Coach Of The Cleveland Browns. Cowboys Delaying The Dump Jason Garrett Party? Plus Other Above Average Stuff]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat and the boys look ahead to this weekend’s Wild Card games and chat about how tough it will be to actually bet against the Patriots despite the Titans looking like a team that could give them some trouble, and revisit the Rose Bowl game and why it has lost some of it’s luster being after the CFB Playoff games. The guys also talk Oregon QB Justin Herbert and whether or not he is going to be a successful Quarterback in the NFL, discuss Tua Tagovailoa’s upcoming decision on whether he will stay in college or make the jump for the NFL and if he has anything left to prove in college or if declaring for the draft would be the wise move. Also joining the show is 10x Pro Bowler, 9x All-Pro, future Hall of Famer, cohost of the ThomaHawk Show podcast and friend of the show, former Cleveland Browns Tackle, Joe Thomas. Joe and Pat discuss the Browns coaching search and what he thinks about the report that Urban Meyer is who Cleveland is eyeing to be the next coach of the Browns, what the issues with the Browns are and if hiring a new coach will solve some of those, what it takes to be a successful coach in the NFL, he throws a surprise name into the coaching search, and gives out his Super Bowl pick (22:49-33:53). Also joining the show is Cowboys beat writer for The Athletic, Jon Machota. He dives into all the Jason Garrett drama in Dallas and why it has been so difficult for Jerry to part ways with Jason Garrett, who he thinks the next coach could potentially be, and whether or not most of the staff will be let go or retained (46:19-51:31). Pat also dives into what he thinks will happen next NFL season in terms of the CBA which involves a 19 week season with 2 byes, and gives a pretty easy solution for dealing with potentially adding international teams. The guys also go through some notable news with Nick to see what’s making waves around the world. It’s the first weekend of the new decade, come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat and the boys look ahead to this weekend’s Wild Card games and chat about how tough it will be to actually bet against the Patriots despite the Titans looking like a team that could give them some trouble, and revisit the Rose Bowl game and why it has lost some of it’s luster being after the CFB Playoff games. The guys also talk Oregon QB Justin Herbert and whether or not he is going to be a successful Quarterback in the NFL, discuss Tua Tagovailoa’s upcoming decision on whether he will stay in college or make the jump for the NFL and if he has anything left to prove in college or if declaring for the draft would be the wise move. Also joining the show is 10x Pro Bowler, 9x All-Pro, future Hall of Famer, cohost of the ThomaHawk Show podcast and friend of the show, former Cleveland Browns Tackle, Joe Thomas. Joe and Pat discuss the Browns coaching search and what he thinks about the report that Urban Meyer is who Cleveland is eyeing to be the next coach of the Browns, what the issues with the Browns are and if hiring a new coach will solve some of those, what it takes to be a successful coach in the NFL, he throws a surprise name into the coaching search, and gives out his Super Bowl pick (22:49-33:53). Also joining the show is Cowboys beat writer for The Athletic, Jon Machota. He dives into all the Jason Garrett drama in Dallas and why it has been so difficult for Jerry to part ways with Jason Garrett, who he thinks the next coach could potentially be, and whether or not most of the staff will be let go or retained (46:19-51:31).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 148 - 1st Show Of The New Decade. Darius Butler, A Rather Large Announcement, & Some Life Talk]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss what they did on New Years Eve, and try to get to the bottom of the people who go to New York and stand in Times Square to see the ball drop live, and discuss whether or not Steve Harvey and Gronk hate each other. Pat also dives into the coaching carousel and starts to have some second thoughts on whether or not Jason Garrett will actually be let go by the Cowboys, after he's survived multiple meetings with Jerry Jones. Joining the show is former 2nd round pick of the New England Patriots, Defensive Back with the Indianapolis Colts, Pat's former teammate, one of the smoothest athletes to ever walk the planet and host of the Everything DB Show, Darius Butler. He and Pat chat about some of the different intricacies of playing defensive back in the NFL, including how infuriating it is when commentator's misidentify who blew a coverage, why certain DB's enjoy wearing certain color gloves, which WR's gave him the most trouble during his 9 year career, and Darius and Pat go through each NFL playoff game this weekend and give their thoughts on who they like and why (22:26-44:13). Also included is some notable news with Nick that covers the US Government banning soldiers from using Tik Tok, fireworks being replaced by drones for celebrations, and a few other news items that are making waves throughout the world. Lastly, the saga of Foxy trying to add some money to the 2020 accountability bank by hitting an NBA 3 during the show, and suffice to say, it did not go as expected. Don't forget that "Pat McAfee: Professional Baseball Player," is now available for free at youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 147 - Chris Johnson, WILD Week In The Football, Punter Of The Decade? And A Rather Large Giveaway At The End]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys break down everything that happened in a very wild week 17 of the NFL as the AFC and NFC playoff fields are now set. They discuss whether or not the Patriots loss to the Dolphins spells the eventual demise of their dynasty, and why this Patriots team feels so much different heading into the playoffs than teams of the past. They also cover the Packers being a half yard shy of earning the #1 seed in the NFC, and whether or not they're a team to be reckoned with. Pat also goes down the list of coaching vacancies and gives his thoughts on where certain guys will end up, including his thoughts on Lincoln Riley to the Cowboys, Mike McCarthy to the Browns, Ron Rivera to the Redskins, and why he thinks now might be the time for Matt Rhule to make the jump to the NFL. Later, 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, NFL record holder for most scrimmage yards in a season (2,509), friend of the show and former Titans and Cardinals running back, CJ2K, Chris Johnson joins Pat and the guys to preview this weekend's Titans/Patriots matchup. Chris gives his thoughts on Derrick Henry, and why he thinks this Titans team has been so successful this year. Chris also breaks down the importance of running back's getting touches early in a game in order to get into a flow before the start of the 4th quarter, why he thinks this Titans team is long overdue to beat the Patriots, whether he thinks their dynasty is done, and why you can never count out Tom Brady (39:10-52:07). Also included is Pat's reaction to being named PFF's punter of the decade, and the guys all react to the College Football Playoff semifinal games, and look ahead to Trevor Lawrence vs. Joe Burrow in the National Championship. Today's show is a good one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 146 - HUE JACKSON... Yes, That Hue Jackson Joins Us. FSU Coach Norvell.. & More Life Chatter]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys are joined by former Oakland Raiders and Cleveland Browns Head Coach, Hue Jackson. Hue chats about why it is so difficult to win in Cleveland and what he thinks it comes back to. He also gives his thoughts on Freddie Kitchens and whether or not he thinks he has what it takes to be a successful Head Coach in the NFL, breaks down the Colin Kaepernick workout situation in Atlanta which Hue was supposed to lead, discusses what his next coaching stop might be and looks at a couple of situations that he might be interested in, and chats about his time on Hard Knocks and his interesting take on the whole experience (21:28-41:32). Next, former Head Coach of the Memphis Tigers and newly christened HC of the Florida State Seminoles, Mike Norvell calls into the show. He chats about his philosophy for landing recruits and how that job starts immediately upon being hired, how leaving Memphis was one of the toughest decisions he's ever made in his life, why he thinks he'll be successful at Florida State despite the ACC being Clemson's playground for the last several years, and what his involvement will be in the Seminoles bowl game (42:43-59:03). Also included is Pat's takes on all the Saturday NFL games this week (despite not being able to watch them as he'll be a field analyst for the Boca Raton Bowl), and how each and every game has playoff implications. They break down whether or not the Bucs should give Jameis a huge extension, if he would be willing to take a paycut, why this might be the week that the Bills finally take down the Patriots in Foxborough, and how the 49ers and Rams both still have plenty to play for. Pat also reacts to the announcement that Johnny Knoxville is back in the saddle for another Jackass movie that will be released in March of 2021. Today's show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

He also gives his thoughts on Freddie Kitchens and whether or not he thinks he has what it takes to be a successful Head Coach in the NFL, breaks down the Colin Kaepernick workout situation in Atlanta which Hue was supposed to lead, discusses what his next coaching stop might be and looks at a couple of situations that he might be interested in, and chats about his time on Hard Knocks and his interesting take on the whole experience (21:28-41:32). Next, former Head Coach of the Memphis Tigers and newly christened HC of the Florida State Seminoles, Mike Norvell calls into the show. He chats about his philosophy for landing recruits and how that job starts immediately upon being hired, how leaving Memphis was one of the toughest decisions he&apos;s ever made in his life, why he thinks he&apos;ll be successful at Florida State despite the ACC being Clemson&apos;s playground for the last several years, and what his involvement will be in the Seminoles bowl game (42:43-59:03). Also included is Pat&apos;s takes on all the Saturday NFL games this week (despite not being able to watch them as he&apos;ll be a field analyst for the Boca Raton Bowl), and how each and every game has playoff implications. They break down whether or not the Bucs should give Jameis a huge extension, if he would be willing to take a paycut, why this might be the week that the Bills finally take down the Patriots in Foxborough, and how the 49ers and Rams both still have plenty to play for. Pat also reacts to the announcement that Johnny Knoxville is back in the saddle for another Jackass movie that will be released in March of 2021. Today&apos;s show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 145 - My Pro Bowl Thoughts, Ryan Leaf Tried To Help Josh Gordon, & More]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys go through the Pro Bowl selections and give their thoughts on all the snubs, who made it that maybe shouldn't have, and whether or not players seriously care if they're selected to a Pro Bowl. Pat also breaks down the difference between Pro Bowlers and All-Pro's, and why he thinks after a certain point, most players will see through the facade and realize that for the most part, it's a bunch of malarkey. Later, Heisman Trophy finalist, #2 pick in the 1998 NFL Draft, and friend of the show, Ryan Leaf calls in. He explains how he tried to help out Josh Gordon, but he wasn't in the mindset at the time to actually open up to help. Ryan explains his current situation and chats about the moment where he actually started to realize he needed to change, and gives a quick recap of his life for those who aren't aware of his situation. Pat and Ryan also chat about the Cheez-It Bowl and how they'll get to interact down there, and a challenge is issued for each man. If you are unaware of Ryan Leaf's life story, this is a can't miss conversation (23:48-36:56). Also covered in today's show is Zion Williamson's knee injury and whether or not he'll be the same player when he comes back, Congress cracking down on e-cigs, Charlotte wanting $325 million for a new expansion MLS team and why that seems a little absurd, and Josh Allen getting one of his selfies hung in a museum after beating the Steelers last Sunday night. Today's show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 144 - A 2x Super Bowl Champ & A 3x Super Bowl Champ Stop By.. GREAT CONVO]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today's show is anchored by two incredible interviews. First, 2x Super Bowl Champion and friend of the show, Ike Taylor calls in. Ike and Pat chat about the Steelers/Bills tilt on Sunday Night Football and whether or not this Bills team has the pieces to make a deep run into the playoffs. They also cover Ike's thoughts on Spygate 2.0 and while it might not mean much, the Patriots are the only team that ever gets caught doing things like this. Ike also gives a few thoughts on the coaching carousel and whether or not he thinks Urban Meyer would be successful if he were to get the Cowboys Head Coaching job, if the 49ers recent defensive struggles is a cause for concern or is just something that happens during a long NFL season, and Ike gives his thoughts about guys getting into snowball fights during pregame (3:13-20:42). Next, 2x Pro Bowler, 3x Super Bowl Champion, chili connoisseur and friend of the show, Mark Schlereth stops by. They discuss if it is time to finally close the book on this Patriots dynasty, how big of a fan Stink is of the Ravens brand of smash mouth, old school football, and why it works so well. Mark also gives his thoughts on the success of the Watt family, and who he thinks the best teams are in the AFC and NFC after another crazy weekend in the NFL (25:23-42:01). Pat and the boys also break down everything else that happened in week 15 of the NFL including why he thinks the Cowboys will clinch the NFC East next week against the Eagles, why he is a little bit concerned about the 49ers recent defensive performance, Pat has more issues with the Al Riveron Gang after Mike Vrabel almost came to blows with a ref at the end of the Titans/Texans tilt, explains why he thinks the Chiefs are heating up at just the right time and might be poised to make a Super Bowl run, and Digs calls in to give his take on the Bills and Steelers after watching the Sunday Night game in person at Heinz Field. It's another great overreaction Monday. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 143 - Willis McGahee, There's A Kleptomaniac In The Office, & The Business Inside The Game]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat reacts to ESPN’s like of five most attractive expecting coaching vacancies at the end of the season and he has a few questions about which ones are seen as much better than the others and if he thinks that is accurate or not. Pat and the guys also dive into some World News with Nick as they discuss Clinton Portis and a few other players accused of defrauding the NFL’s league health program with false claims amounting to around $4 million, and OBJ telling everyone that he can that he wants out of Cleveland and for certain teams to come get him. Later, 2x Pro Bowler, 2002 Heisman Trophy finalist, and former Running Back for the Bills, Ravens, and Broncos, Willis McGahee, joins the show. He gives his opinion on players sitting out bowl games in college in hopes of avoiding an injury that will derail their NFL draft stock, as no one is more intimate with that situation that anyone else. Willis also gives his thoughts on Lamar Jackson, why he is so dangerous, and what makes him such a threat. Willis and Pat also chat about his time in Buffalo and the story behind why he had an ugly exit from Buffalo, and who he thinks is going to win the Super Bowl (36:13-46:33). Pat also reacts to Roger Goodell’s comments about no changes coming to the playoff structure in the near future, and what Pat was trying to do to help get retired NFL players benefits, gives his thoughts on Jacoby Brissett and why he has started to slow down a little bit in the back half of this season, and what he thinks Chris Ballard will do for the Colts’ roster in the offseason. Lastly, the guys chat about the hottest issue in the office right now.. there is a snack kleptomaniac in the building, and Pat gets to the bottom of it. Today’s show is a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, 3x Pro Bowler, 17 year NFL veteran, former Quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, Seattle Seahawks, Tennessee Titans, Indianapolis Colts, and friend of the show, Matt Hasselbeck calls in to clear some things up about Spygate 2.0. Matt and Pat discuss why he doesn’t think it is really that big of a deal with the way teams in the NFL make most of their calls through headsets now, why it would be a much bigger deal if it were being done in college, and what repercussions, if any, he thinks will come of the whole situation (4:14-9:49). Later, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, 2005 Defensive Rookie of the Year, and member of the LA Chargers’ 50th anniversary team, Shawne “Lights Out” Merriman joins the show. Shawne and Pat chat about Phillip Rivers going viral recently with his on field trash talk, and Shawne breaks down who Phillip Rivers is on and off the field and goes through their long history together. He also gives his thoughts on the next stage of Rivers’ career, which quarterback he’s played with that he would prefer led a team he was on, what needs to be done in order to contain Lamar Jackson and the Ravens offense, and his take on Spygate 2.0 (20:13-37:15). Also included are a couple of calls from the radio show dealing with Pat’s thoughts about the Chiefs chances heading into the playoffs after an impressive win in Foxborough, and Pat breaks out his new duck call when talking about the Steelers playoff chances with arguably the biggest budding superstar in the league, Duck Hodges. Pat also explains why he’s bummed out and depressed with the newest developments in the Antonio Brown saga, and breaks some For The Brand news dealing with long snappers going to the Pro Bowl. Today’s show is a good one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[Today’s show is loaded with everything you need to know following a massive weekend in the NFL. First, Pat welcomes 3x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, one of the most freakish athletes to ever walk the face of the earth, friend of the show, LaVar Arrington. LaVar discusses his thoughts on Dwayne Haskins, if he sees progress in his game this year, and whether or not he thinks the Redskins will ever be a good football team. LaVar and Pat also chat about the Patriots and why he’s not ready to throw the towel in on them just yet, despite another mediocre performance this past week, and LaVar explains how he would attack defending Lamar Jackson (3:23-16:39). Pat and the boys also cover whether or not it’s time for the Patriots to panic, and why despite all the issues surrounding them, they’re still not a team people want to see in the playoffs. They discuss whether or not they think the Packers have a legitimate shot to make a deep playoff run, how tough the NFC looks this year, they take some time to gush about how incredible of a football player George Kittle is and why this 49ers team is humming right now, break down the AFC playoff picture and give some love to the scorching hot Tennessee Titans. Pat also reacts to the news that Adam Vinatieri will be having season ending knee surgery and how that has impacted his game this entire year. Plus, Digs calls in to chat about the Steelers’ big win over the weekend and why he thinks Duck Hodges is the best quarterback in the NFL and where he see’s the Steelers at as the playoffs are right around the corner. To close out the show, Pat chats about his first experience at an SEC game, and why it just matters more down there. He also gives his thoughts on the CFP finalists, why he thinks Joe Burrow is so good and why he’ll make all the monies in the NFL. Today’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 140 - Justin Tucker, Mike Florio, & More NFL Chatter]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat and the boys are joined by friend of the show, owner and creator of Pro Football Talk, Mike Florio. They discuss Florio’s bombshell on Twitter a few days ago that he has an inkling that Andrew Luck will be the Las Vegas Raiders Quarterback to start the 2020 season, and what the Raiders would potentially have to give up in order to get his rights. Pat also asks Mike whether or not another coach will get fired before the end of the season, and where a possible landing spot for Ron Rivera might be, when Jason Garrett will be fired, and addresses the idea of Tom Brady potentially playing for a different team next year (1:57-12:07). Next, 4x All-Pro, 3x Pro Bowler, Super Bowl Champion, the most accurate kicker in NFL history, Baltimore Ravens Kicker, Justin Tucker calls in. Justin and Pat discuss his game winning kick against the 49ers in the miserable conditions in Baltimore this past weekend, what his mindset and ritual is before he lines up to kick, what he has seen in Lamar Jackson over the last two years and if there is anything he can point that has led to his massive success. He also chats about his relationship with Matthew McConaughey, his potential career as an opera singer, and why this Ravens team has bonded so quickly (12:09-32:40). Pat also reacts to the news that Adam Vinatieri has been dealing with a knee injury for some time and the Colts having to bring in a kicker and what that process is like, and why it magnifies how important having a great kicker is, and gives a couple of thoughts on some of the early lines from this weekend’s NFL games. Also included are a few calls from the radio show including questions about why Browns fans are having a hard time hating Duck Hodges, and whether or not the Chiefs have a shot to knock off the Patriots this weekend in Foxborough. Today’s show is a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 139 - Michael Franzese, Life As A Made Man In The Mafia. Matt Rhule, Glover Quin & MORE]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat and the boys sit down with former Capo of the Colombo crime family, a man who spent a large majority of his life as a made man in the mafia, Michael Franzese. They chat about what it was like growing up in the mob and at what point did he make the decision he was going to get in the life. He chats about the different rackets he had his hands in and what he did to become a major earner for the Colombo crime family. They also cover what kind of involvement the mafia has had in sports gambling and if he recalls any of those situations. Michael also gives his thoughts on The Irishman as he was intimately involved in the situation and was close with many of the people involved in the story, and tells Pat and the guys which mafia movies, in his opinion, are most accurate to the way things really are. He also covers how he is still alive, what his time in prison was like and if he was given any special privileges, what some of his favorite nicknames of associates were, and he dives into how he turned his life around to put himself into the position he is currently in. This is one of the most fascinating and interesting conversations that you’ll ever hear and something you definitely don’t want to miss (2:27-57:23). Later, Head Coach of the Baylor Bears and potential college football coach of the year, Matt Rhule, stops by the show. Pat and Matt cover where his teams’ head is at heading into the Big 12 Championship against Oklahoma, what people should expect to be different about this upcoming game his mentality as a head coach and what he tries to instill in his players, and his relationship with his defensive coordinator, Phil Snow (1:00:55-1:16:26). Also included is a snippet of the conversation between Pat and former Pro Bowler and All-Pro for the Houston Texans and Detroit Lions, Glover Quin. They chat about Glover playing against Peyton Manning and how he had to learn how to disguise his coverage pre-snap because if he didn’t, Peyton would know exactly what he was doing and how to exploit it (1:16:28-1:19:55), and to close out the show, Pat breaks down his candidates for NFL Coach of the Year. Today is a great show, come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 138 - Ryan Fitzmagic Is BACK.. Brian Westbrook, Eddie George, & Pep Hamilton Stop By To Talk The Football]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat covers the entire weekend slate in the NFL including all the marquee matchups. He discusses whether or not the Patriots offense will eventually turn it around after Tom Brady looked as visibly frustrated as he ever as Sunday night in Houston, whether or not the Packers defense will prevent them from making a run in the playoffs, the potential Super Bowl preview in this past weekend’s 49ers/Ravens game in Baltimore and why Baltimore continually shows how tough of an out they will be. Pat also dives into why the NFC East stinks, and the guys chat about the Cowboys still potentially getting a home playoff game after the Eagles lost to the Dolphins in Miami after a magical performance from Fitzmagic himself.. Later, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and member of the Eagles Hall of Fame, former running back, Brian Westbrook, joins the show. They discuss what the problem with the Eagles is and whether or not they can turn it around in time, why certain players have difficulty scoring touchdowns on the goal line, he chats about the work he’s doing with his foundation, and talks about which teams he sees making a run in the NFC and AFC (32:00-43:47). Next, 4x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, former Offensive Rookie of the Year and Heisman Trophy winner, Eddie George, joins the program. Eddie and Pat discuss their bet on the Colts/Titans game this past weekend, and why Eddie thinks the Titans may have the formula to be successful in the playoffs. They also chat about Ohio State mollywhopping Michigan on Saturday, and give their takes on the Dr. Pepper tuition giveaway halftime show in a hilarious interview (43:49-57:43). Lastly, one of Pat’s offensive coordinators while he was with the Colts, a man who has coached nearly everywhere in college and the NFL, and now current Head Coach and General Manager of the DC Defenders of the XFL, Pep Hamilton, joins the show. Pep and Pat chat about their time together while at the Colts, why Pep thinks the XFL is going to be successful with some of the rule changes that make it different than the NFL, the allure of being a Head Coach and General Manager, what it’s like coaching in the Ohio State/Michigan rivalry, and Pat helping his son diversify The Brand (1:00:56-1:11:47). Today’s show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today’s show, Pat covers the entire weekend slate in the NFL including all the marquee matchups. He discusses whether or not the Patriots offense will eventually turn it around after Tom Brady looked as visibly frustrated as he ever as Sunday night in Houston, whether or not the Packers defense will prevent them from making a run in the playoffs, the potential Super Bowl preview in this past weekend’s 49ers/Ravens game in Baltimore and why Baltimore continually shows how tough of an out they will be. Pat also dives into why the NFC East stinks, and the guys chat about the Cowboys still potentially getting a home playoff game after the Eagles lost to the Dolphins in Miami after a magical performance from Fitzmagic himself.. Later, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and member of the Eagles Hall of Fame, former running back, Brian Westbrook, joins the show. They discuss what the problem with the Eagles is and whether or not they can turn it around in time, why certain players have difficulty scoring touchdowns on the goal line, he chats about the work he’s doing with his foundation, and talks about which teams he sees making a run in the NFC and AFC (32:00-43:47). Next, 4x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, former Offensive Rookie of the Year and Heisman Trophy winner, Eddie George, joins the program. Eddie and Pat discuss their bet on the Colts/Titans game this past weekend, and why Eddie thinks the Titans may have the formula to be successful in the playoffs. They also chat about Ohio State mollywhopping Michigan on Saturday, and give their takes on the Dr. Pepper tuition giveaway halftime show in a hilarious interview (43:49-57:43). Lastly, one of Pat’s offensive coordinators while he was with the Colts, a man who has coached nearly everywhere in college and the NFL, and now current Head Coach and General Manager of the DC Defenders of the XFL, Pep Hamilton, joins the show. Pep and Pat chat about their time together while at the Colts, why Pep thinks the XFL is going to be successful with some of the rule changes that make it different than the NFL, the allure of being a Head Coach and General Manager, what it’s like coaching in the Ohio State/Michigan rivalry, and Pat helping his son diversify The Brand (1:00:56-1:11:47). Today’s show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 137 - Kyle Van Noy, Tony Dungy, & Roman Harper]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s show is highlighted by 3 incredible interviews. First, 2x Super Bowl Champion, current linebacker for the New England Patriots, and friend of the show, Kyle Van Noy stops by. He and Pat chat about New England’s most recent win over the Cowboys, why he thinks Lamar Jackson is so difficult to stop, the wizardry of Bill Belichick, and his Youtube cooking show on his channel, Vibin’ with the Van Noy’s (3:34-22:00). Next, Hall of Famer, 2x Super Bowl Champion, member of the Indianapolis Colts and Tampa Bay Buccaneers Ring of Honor, and current studio analyst for Football Night in America, Tony Dungy, joins the show. They chat about his role in selecting the NFL all-time time in celebration of the league’s 100th season and how difficult that process was and what it was like sharing a round table with Bill Belichick. Pat and Tony also discuss the league as a whole as we get closer and closer to the playoffs, and why he thinks Lamar Jackson has been so dominant and why he has been very impressed with the 49ers defense, and if this Patriots offense will get it figured out, or if the current formula is their new identity (23:36-35:36). Lastly, Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, former safety for the Saints and Panthers, Roman Harper stops by while on vacation in Paris. He discusses what exactly double coverage looks like in the NFL, and why trying to stop a guy like Michael Thomas is so difficult. He also chats about why rivalry games can be much tougher on players if one of the teams has a bad record, and he chats about his alma mater Alabama, and why he thinks they should get into the College Football Playoff, and what he thinks the best formula for success is in order to be one of the final 4 teams selected (40:05-54:55). Also included is Pat’s story of his fake punt pass on Thanksgiving against the Steelers, and his instant reaction of this week’s CFP rankings as we get ready for rivalry weekend. Don’t forget, everything at store.patmcafeeshow.com is still 20% off! Don’t wait as most of the items will sell out. Hope your Thanksgiving was incredible. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[Happy Thanksgiving! On today’s show, Pat and the boys sit around and discuss the NFL slate on Thanksgiving as well as who they are thinking about betting on. They discuss whether or not people in Detroit hate Thanksgiving because it usually comes during a time of the year where Lions fans have nothing to be positive about, if the Bills have enough to beat the Cowboys in Jerry World or if the Cowboys will respond after Jerry Jones had a couple of choice comments for the Good Morning Football crew after being asked about Dak’s contract and the Jason Garrett situation. Pat also announces the Thanksgiving Giveaway Extravaganza Stupendous as each of the guys picks an ungoogleable question and a hashtag that you can try to answer to win anything from gift cards to the store, a free pair of shoes, a VISA gift card, or special items from the store. The guys also cover the “Thanksgiving Thank You” sale that started last night at midnight and will run through the end of the weekend. EVERYTHING in the store at store.patmcafeeshow.com is 20% off.

			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat and the guys record live from 4 World Trade Center in New York City. They break down everything that happened this past weekend and all the marquee games including what it means for the Packers after getting absolutely mollywhopped by the 49ers and what they have to do to get back on the correct course, and why the 49ers might be the scariest team in football. They also break down the Cowboys rough game against the Patriots and why it might have spelled the end of Jason Garrett’s tenure after Jerry Jones’ comments. They also chat about how the Pats might not need to get their offense right in order to win a Super Bowl. Later, Super Bowl Champion, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, and friend of the show, Josh Sitton’s joins to recap everything that happened this weekend. He breaks down the Packers/49ers game and why he still thinks the NFC championship might go through Green Bay, what teams need to do in order to stop the 49ers pass rush, the best way to neutralize Lamar Jackson and why he would be so fun to block for, and gives his keys for the Packers getting back on the right track (38:27-52:43). Pat and the boys also break down the rest of the NFL slate including Dwayne Haskins winning his first NFL game and missing the final snap to take selfies with fans, the Seahawks potentially being the best team in the NFC, the Saints and Panthers debacle that may have been a direct shot at Sean Payton from Al Riveron and everything else that happened over a crazy NFL weekend. Also, Wednesday night at midnight, EVERYTHING at store.patmcafeeshow.com will be 20% off for our Black Friday Sale. Today’s episode is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today’s show, Pat and the guys record live from 4 World Trade Center in New York City. They break down everything that happened this past weekend and all the marquee games including what it means for the Packers after getting absolutely mollywhopped by the 49ers and what they have to do to get back on the correct course, and why the 49ers might be the scariest team in football. They also break down the Cowboys rough game against the Patriots and why it might have spelled the end of Jason Garrett’s tenure after Jerry Jones’ comments. They also chat about how the Pats might not need to get their offense right in order to win a Super Bowl. Later, Super Bowl Champion, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, and friend of the show, Josh Sitton’s joins to recap everything that happened this weekend. He breaks down the Packers/49ers game and why he still thinks the NFC championship might go through Green Bay, what teams need to do in order to stop the 49ers pass rush, the best way to neutralize Lamar Jackson and why he would be so fun to block for, and gives his keys for the Packers getting back on the right track (38:27-52:43). Pat and the boys also break down the rest of the NFL slate including Dwayne Haskins winning his first NFL game and missing the final snap to take selfies with fans, the Seahawks potentially being the best team in the NFC, the Saints and Panthers debacle that may have been a direct shot at Sean Payton from Al Riveron and everything else that happened over a crazy NFL weekend. Also, Wednesday night at midnight, EVERYTHING at &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.patmcafeeshow.com/&quot;&gt;store.patmcafeeshow.com&lt;/a&gt; will be 20% off for our Black Friday Sale. Today’s episode is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 134 - Joe Thomas, Cliff Avril, & Cardale Jones]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s show is loaded with a couple of great guests. First, 10x Pro Bowler, 9x All-Pro and arguably the greatest offensive lineman in the history of the NFL, former Cleveland Brown tackle, Joe Thomas, joins the show. He and Pat chat about the Myles Garrett situation and Joe gives his take as he’s known Myles for a long time, they cover his transition from the league into media, his thoughts on Dwayne Haskins’ offensive lineman blowing him off on the sidelines on video, and Joe admits that he was wrong about whether or not Lamar Jackson was going to be successful in the NFL (2:34-23:41). Next, former Pro Bowler and Super Bowl Champion with the Seattle Seahawks, Cliff Avril joins the show. He chats about being in London with Sky Sports and what he’s trying to do in the next phase of his career, what defensive lineman can do in order to try to stop a guy like Lamar Jackson and why it is proving to be so difficult, and he gives his thoughts on the potential of the new CBA and if he thinks a 17 game season would benefit everyone (25:36-32:26). Later, former National Champion for the Ohio State Buckeyes and current starting Quarterback for the DC Defenders, Cardale “12 Gauge” Jones, joins the show. He and Pat talk about the differences between the NFL and XFL and why some of these changes will help the game be more explosive, he looks ahead to this weekend’s Ohio State/Penn State clash and explains what it’s like playing in the Horseshoe on Saturday’s, and gives some clarity to his now infamous tweet about being in school to play football and not to study (32:28-44:24). Also included is Pat’s take on why moving the Chargers to Mexico City could make sense, but why it will be tough to ever execute, and the guys wonder why NBA ratings are down so much this season and what may be causing it. It’s a good one today. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat and the boys record from the back of the box truck in beautiful Atlanta, Georgia.They are joined by 6x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, former Bills defensive tackle and friend of the show, Kyle Williams. They discuss his thoughts on the Colin Kaepernick situation and how it seems to be getting worse for everyone, what defensive linemen can try to do to neutralize Lamar Jackson (if that’s possible), Kyle gives his thoughts on the Bills season so far, what coach Sean McDermott is like, whether or not they have a legitimate shot to make a run in the playoffs, and chats about life from his duck hunting camp in Louisiana (3:16-16:48).

Kyle and Pat discuss what has fundamentally changed for the Vikings since the big public meltdown early in the season, what Kirk Cousins demeanor is like in the huddle, locker room, and sidelines, how big of a threat the Vikings are moving forward when they’re healthy, whether Mike Zimmer has relented in his coaching style at all over the course of the season, his plans for the bye week, and if he’s gotten to pay much attention to the other elite teams in the NFC that the Vikings may face down the road (16:50-29:35). Pat also discusses the College Football Playoff Committee’s new rankings and how he sees everything shaking out, breaks down the 4 primetime games in the NFL this week which are some of the marquee matchups of the season, reacts to Le’Veon Bell being drug tested for HGH multiple times by the NFL over the last few weeks, and with Christmas being right around the corner, the guys get into a heated debate about what their top 3 Christmas movies of all-time are.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat and the boys are joined by the Voice of College Football, one of the most handsome men working in sports today, friend of the show, Kirk Herbstreit. They discuss this past Saturday’s installment of College Gameday and when pat knew that he was going to bellyflop into the Brazos, the CFB playoff committee’s mindset when selecting their top 4 teams, why he thinks Alabama is on the outside looking in, Kirk chats about which quarterback’s he likes watching in the NFL and who he thinks is in that tier.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 131 - He Hit Him With His Own Helmet.. WILD TIMES In The NFL + Ike Taylor & Brandon Flowers]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat reacts to Myles Garrett trying to cave Mason Rudolph’s head in with his own helmet moments after they land back in Indiana from Pittsburgh, and Pat throws to Tone Digz’ incredible Steelers/Browns rant from yesterday’s radio show before the game. Pat also talks more about the Colin Kaepernick situation and what to expect from this weekend’s workouts, what that entails, and which teams could potentially be interested outside of the teams who said they would be in attendance. Pat also dives into the proposals for the new CBA and whether or not players will like the proposed changes, and if it could actually work for both parties involved. Also included are interviews with 2x Super Bowl champion and friend of the show, Ike Taylor. He talks about which teams he think could use Kaepernick, whether or not he’s still got it, what he thinks of this maturing Steelers defense and what he see’s in Minkah Fitzpatrick, and he sheds some light on what he thinks of Tim Tebow (21:17-33:46). Later, former Pro Bowler and Cornerback for the San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs, Brandon Flowers calls into the show. He explains why he doesn’t like the idea of another game being added in the new CBA, what he thinks of defensive units currently in the NFL especially the back end, talks about what it was like being a smaller guy and having to get chippy with WR’s in order to prove a point, and who he’s got in the Super Bowl this year (44:41-57:04). Today’s show is fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<itunes:summary>On today’s show, Pat reacts to Myles Garrett trying to cave Mason Rudolph’s head in with his own helmet moments after they land back in Indiana from Pittsburgh, and Pat throws to Tone Digz’ incredible Steelers/Browns rant from yesterday’s radio show before the game. Pat also talks more about the Colin Kaepernick situation and what to expect from this weekend’s workouts, what that entails, and which teams could potentially be interested outside of the teams who said they would be in attendance. Pat also dives into the proposals for the new CBA and whether or not players will like the proposed changes, and if it could actually work for both parties involved. Also included are interviews with 2x Super Bowl champion and friend of the show, Ike Taylor. He talks about which teams he think could use Kaepernick, whether or not he’s still got it, what he thinks of this maturing Steelers defense and what he see’s in Minkah Fitzpatrick, and he sheds some light on what he thinks of Tim Tebow (21:17-33:46). Later, former Pro Bowler and Cornerback for the San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs, Brandon Flowers calls into the show. He explains why he doesn’t like the idea of another game being added in the new CBA, what he thinks of defensive units currently in the NFL especially the back end, talks about what it was like being a smaller guy and having to get chippy with WR’s in order to prove a point, and who he’s got in the Super Bowl this year (44:41-57:04). Today’s show is fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 130 - College Football Playoff Committee Bullshit... & Some Good Conversation]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's show comes from an ice cold box truck in Pittsburgh, PA as Pat and the boys battle the elements and try to stay warm. Pat breaks down the College Football Playoff rankings that were just released, and he is not pleased with how things are shaking out as Minnesota is still on the outset of the top 6 despite making the biggest jump in the history of the rankings, but Pat has a simple message for the committee. Also joining the show is the all-time leading rusher at Florida State, and current NFL rushing leader, Dalvin Cook. He tells Pat what the secret to his success so far has been, why the Vikings offensive line has been so successful this year, what happened in the locker room in order to turn everything around after the issues that plagued the locker room earlier in the season, and Dalvin gives his thoughts on Deion Sanders potentially being the next Head Coach for Florida State and whether or not he thinks that will result in a return to dominance (19:59-27:42). Also joining the show is 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, 2018 Built Ford Tough Lineman of the Year, LA Rams left tackle, Andrew Whitworth. He breaks down why he thinks LSU has been successful this year and what he thinks of Coach O, the issues with the Rams this year and why he thinks they can turn things around once Todd Gurley is worked back into the offense, how he builds trust with lineman who haven't been in the league for very long and are constantly changing, and what his plans are after retirement (27:45-35:55). Pat also dives into the Colin Kaepernick situation and what he thinks will come from it and reminds us that regardless of how people feel about the situation, it's the NFL's sandbox and ultimately their decision. Pat also chats about Elton John and the film Rocketman ahead the concert, the Astros being in hot water over taping signs during their 2017 championship run, and some other things that are happening right now in the world.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the boys do a DEEP dive into everything that happened this week in the NFL. They cover the heartbreaking loss the Colts suffered this weekend at the hands of Fitzmagic and the Dolphins, question whether there will ever be another player like Lamar Jackson, Pat reiterates his formula for winning Super Bowls which includes building a team around a quarterback on a rookie contract, they discuss why other teams can't do things like the Patriots, and look at Bill Belichick's potential successor. Pat also gives out his top 4 teams for the college football playoff. Also, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and friend of the show, Mark Schlereth drops by to chat about everything that happened this weekend in the NFL including why certain teams' offensive lines look incredible one week, and really bad the next, whether or not the Saints getting the doors blown off was a fluke, and why he thinks Lamar Jackson is succeeding (1:07:53-1:23:29). Later, Head Coach of the undefeated Minnesota Golden Gophers, PJ Fleck, calls into the show after a huge win against Penn State on Saturday. He discusses their mentality going forward now that the playoffs are in sight, what his message to the team was after the win and going into this week's game at Iowa, whether or not he has any fears on the football or otherwise, and as always, he gives Pat and the boys a little motivation (1:23:51-1:35:14). To close out the show, our very own Todd McComas shares some personal stories from his time in the Marines as he and the boys appreciate all past, present, and future veterans. Today's a fun one.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat recaps his insane weekend starting with commentating SmackDown Live! on FOX on Friday night which included being lucky enough to have Jim Irsay lend him his private jet so that he could get to Buffalo in time for the show, and ending with Pat heading to Memphis to be on College Gameday on Beale St. Pat and the boys also recap everything that happened this weekend in the NFL including the Steelers pulling out an impressive win over the Colts in Pittsburgh, the Seahawks starting to come on strong and why no one is really talking about them, Lamar Jackson looking incredibly against the Patriots on Sunday night, DeShaun Watson and Stefon Diggs marketing Popeye’s, and everything else that was important around the league. Pat also breaks down Vinny’s game winning kick opportunity and why it was an operational failure and not necessarily all Vinny’s fault, and breaks down the proper way to hold the football on a field goal attempt and what the holder, long snapper, and kicker’s individual responsibilities are. Also joining the show is arguably the greatest sportscaster in the business. You’ve heard him call the Super Bowl, World Series, and US Open, consummate professional and hilarious human, Joe Buck. Joe and Pat discuss his thoughts on a lot of the good team’s in the NFL laying an egg this past weekend, why people hate him and where he thinks that comes from, his thoughts on the NFL so far this season and his feelings on all the issues with the referees, whether or not he appreciates tanking in the NFL and if he thinks it will be a viable option moving forward, and what the most memorable moment from his career has been thus far (1:06:40-1:21:56).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 125 - PJ Fleck, Ike Taylor, & Kyle Van Noy]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys record pieces of the episode on the plane on their way back from Waco, Texas. The show is highlighted by three incredible interviews from this past week. First, Minnesota Head Football Coach PJ Fleck joins the program to talk about his undefeated Golden Gophers team, his relationship with holder Casey O’Brien and how his story has inspired him and the rest of the team. Coach Fleck also addresses the people who think his coaching style is phony or fake, all while giving one of the most incredible inspirational speeches you will ever hear and will have you eager to run through a brick wall. He also clears up the rumors that Minnesota didn’t agree to play a night game in next week’s tilt against Penn State, and talks about what it means to be ELITE in the Minnesota Gophers program (3:22-19:19). Next, 2x Super Bowl Champion and former Pittsburgh Steelers legend, Ike Taylor joins the show. Ike and Pat chat about everything currently going on in the NFL, who Ike likes moving forward as we get closer to the playoffs, why he doesn’t think Tom Brady is going anywhere this offseason, the mentality it takes to be a great football player, and why that sometimes doesn’t mesh with other people’s expectations, and what he makes of the Baker Mayfield/beat writer drama and whether or not he or his teammates had any situations like that while he was in Pittsburgh (22:29-33:34). Lastly, 2x Super Bowl Champion, and current linebacker for the New England Patriots, Kyle Van Noy joins the show for an incredible interview. He and Pat discuss what it’s like playing for the Patriots, how many people will never understand Bill Belichick’s sense of humor, the controversy surrounding Sam Darnold saying he was seeing ghosts against the Patriots, what makes their defense so special, and what Bill Belichick’s message is when they huddle together on the sidelines during games (35:23-51:45). It’s a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today’s show, Pat and the guys record pieces of the episode on the plane on their way back from Waco, Texas. The show is highlighted by three incredible interviews from this past week. First, Minnesota Head Football Coach PJ Fleck joins the program to talk about his undefeated Golden Gophers team, his relationship with holder Casey O’Brien and how his story has inspired him and the rest of the team. Coach Fleck also addresses the people who think his coaching style is phony or fake, all while giving one of the most incredible inspirational speeches you will ever hear and will have you eager to run through a brick wall. He also clears up the rumors that Minnesota didn’t agree to play a night game in next week’s tilt against Penn State, and talks about what it means to be ELITE in the Minnesota Gophers program (3:22-19:19). Next, 2x Super Bowl Champion and former Pittsburgh Steelers legend, Ike Taylor joins the show. Ike and Pat chat about everything currently going on in the NFL, who Ike likes moving forward as we get closer to the playoffs, why he doesn’t think Tom Brady is going anywhere this offseason, the mentality it takes to be a great football player, and why that sometimes doesn’t mesh with other people’s expectations, and what he makes of the Baker Mayfield/beat writer drama and whether or not he or his teammates had any situations like that while he was in Pittsburgh (22:29-33:34). Lastly, 2x Super Bowl Champion, and current linebacker for the New England Patriots, Kyle Van Noy joins the show for an incredible interview. He and Pat discuss what it’s like playing for the Patriots, how many people will never understand Bill Belichick’s sense of humor, the controversy surrounding Sam Darnold saying he was seeing ghosts against the Patriots, what makes their defense so special, and what Bill Belichick’s message is when they huddle together on the sidelines during games (35:23-51:45). It’s a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 124 - Adam Amin: A Muslim In A Non Muslim World. Also, Dwight Freeney]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys record from Waco, Texas ahead of tonight’s West Virginia vs. Baylor game. They are joined in the box truck by Pat’s Thursday Night Football play-by-play man, one of the most interesting men at ESPN, Adam Amin. They chat about what it was like growing up Muslim in the Chicagoland area, and the impact that 9/11 had on his life, he tells the story about how his father immigrated from Pakistan and had to save money for several years before he could bring the rest of his family over, and he dispels some common misconceptions about being Muslim. They also chat about how things have been going in the Thursday Night booth, what Adam’s dream job would be in terms of calling games, some of the most memorable games he’s called, and he tells a few hilariously stories about his career before he got to ESPN in a very deep and incredible interview (6:36-55:09). Also included is an interview in studio with Super Bowl Champion, 7x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, member of the NFL 2000s All Decade team, newly minted member of the Colts Ring of Honor, and Pat’s former teammate, Dwight Freeney. They discuss the change of the defensive end position throughout his career and why guys like him made such an impact in their careers, what he thinks of this years Indianapolis Colts team and why he thinks they are built for success, he remembers a few of his better gambling stories while with the Colts, and chats about the NFL trade deadline, and why he doesn’t believe the NFL trade market will explode the way fans want it to (57:55-1:20:36). Don’t forget to send pictures of your Halloween costumes to Pat and the guys using the hashtag <strong>#CoolCostumeCuz </strong>for a chance to win a $500 gift card to <a href="http://store.patmcafeeshow.com/">store.patmcafeeshow.com</a>.

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 123 - Adam Vinatieri, College Gameday, & NFL Chatter]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys sit down and chat about how awesome everything involved with the College Gameday process was, what some of his favorite moments were, what Coach Corso is like, how insane the crowd was in Brookings, South Dakota, and what it was like being apart of one of the longest running and most successful shows of all time. The guys also discuss everything that happened in this weekend’s NFL games including how good Aaron Rodgers and the Packers are after squeezing out a win at Arrowhead on Sunday night, why the Colts are still Super Bowl bound in Pat’s eyes, and how their win this weekend, albeit not pretty, was incredibly impressive. The guys also break down how the only obstacle in the AFC for the Colts is the Patriots, and how impressive they have been, including this weekend’s dominating win over the Browns. The guys also dive into the Mitch Trubisky situation in Chicago, and whether or not Buffalo is for real. Also joining the show is the GOAT of all GOATS, friend of the program, 4X Super Bowl Champion, and the NFL all-time points leader, Adam Vinatieri, joins the show. He and Pat talk about his game on Sunday and how he was relishing an opportunity to have a game winning kick, why he thinks this years Colts team is a little different, how impressed he’s been with Jacoby Brissett and why everyone in that locker room isn’t shocked by how successful he’s been, Bill Belichick earning win 300, and his thoughts on where this Colts team can go (1:05:32-1:22:26). Today’s episode is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

Included in today’s show are a couple of incredible interviews. First, Pro Bowler/Super Bowl Champion, and now analyst on ESPN, Ryan Clark, who covers all the big news happening in the NFL right now including Tom Brady potentially playing for a new team next year, Emmanuel Sanders and John Elway’s beef, and who his Super Bowl Contenders are in the AFC and the NFC (2:22-17:00). Next, All-Pro Linebacker and reigning Defensive Rookie of the Year, Colts standout, Darius Leonard joins the show. They chat about why this Colts team is clicking on all cylinders, what it’s like playing for Frank Reich, how Jacoby Brissett has performed so far, and what the expectations are for the Colts moving forward (20:32-32:44). Lastly, former All-Pro and Pro Bowl guard and friend of the show, Josh Sitton, stops by. They chat about the Packers success and if this is the happiest he’s ever seen Aaron Rodgers, whether or not the 49ers are for real, and his thoughts on Drew Brees potentially coming back from injury early (34:45-46:24). Also included is the wild story about how Pat and the boys were stranded outside of Minute Maid Park in Houston while trying to access their tickets for Game 2 of the World Series. It’s a good one.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys are joined by former NBA referee and member of one of the biggest betting scandals in recent sports history, Tim Donaghy. They discuss his role in the betting scandal that rocked the NBA and all of professional sports which eventually resulted in the FBI getting involved, what the process was like in terms of his job and what he was doing, the new film “Inside Man,” which is about the whole ordeal and what kind of involvement he had in the film, whether he thinks games are being fixed in other major sports leagues, where he thinks the next major betting scandal will come from, and what his time in prison was like. It’s an absolute roller coaster of an interview (3:05-26:24). Also included are Pat’s thoughts on the John Elway/Emmanuel Sanders situation, and who is in the right and what he thinks the atmosphere inside that locker room is currently like. Pat also gives his take on LeBron James and why he is becoming more and more unlikeable off the court. Today’s show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

They discuss how the Cardinals are quietly coming back to life, what his thoughts are on Kliff Kingsbury and what makes him so creative in terms of play calling. He chats about his budding relationship with Kyler Murray, and what he's starting to figure out about the NFL game which is leading him to more success. AQ also tells a couple stories from this past week in preparation for a tough game in New York against the Giants, including being singled out at practice by an authentic New York heckler, and also chats about what life is like as a new dad (3:01-35:50).

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 118 - Super Bowl Champ, AJ Hawk, Is All The Way Back & Some Phoners]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys are joined by Super Bowl Champion, 10 year NFL veteran, former Linebacker for the Green Bay Packers and Cincinnati Bengals, and good friend of the show, AJ Hawk. They discuss what he has been up too as of late, as he and Pat explain the difficulties with calling college football games and how their short term memory works. AJ also chats about his method for avoiding concussions his entire playing career from high school to college to the NFL, how impressed he has been with defenses so far this NFL season, who he thinks the best teams in the NFC are, and if the Colts are good enough to knock the Patriots off in the AFC. AJ and Pat also catch up and tell a few stories in an absolutely hilarious interview (2:33-54:35). Also included are some phone calls that didn't make it to live air from the radio show with topics including the issues with the NFL refs and how implementing a review system similar to tennis might be a viable option, whether or not the 49ers are the best team in the NFC, and what the chances of survival are for the XFL, and other leagues similar to it. It's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat records bits and pieces 38,000 feet in the air on the plane on the way back from Raleigh, North Carolina. The guys each pick some of their favorite moments from the past week including Pat’s story about having to take a bunch of edibles in the Heathrow Airport after playing the Jaguars in London and what that experience was like, his take on Dave Petersen, the moron who sent a disparaging letter to a Penn State football player for not “representing the school the way he should.” Also included are interviews with Green Bay Packers Running Back and newly minted NFC Offensive Player of the Week, Aaron Jones (2:25-12:48), and an incredibly insightful conversation with 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, Super Bowl Champion, and former Green Bay Pack, Chicago Bear, and Miami Dolphins Guard, Josh Sitton (24:47-36:18). It was a long week, but a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat throws to an interview from yesterday that was picked up by nearly every sports media outlet in existence. 4x Pro Bowler, 3x First Team All-Pro, Super Bowl Champion, and future Hall of Famer, Richard Sherman, joins the show to talk everything related to DapGate. He breaks down why he thinks he was disrespected by Baker Mayfield at the beginning of the Browns v. 49ers Monday Night Game, and everything surrounding the dap up. He also chats about the 49ers success so far this season, what it's like playing for Kyle Shanahan, and why he thinks things got blown out of proportion with the DapGate situation. Lastly, Sherman issues an apology to Baker Mayfield (1:51-18:41). Also joining Pat and the boys for the remainder of the show live from the box truck in Raleigh, NC, is Thursday cohost and friend of the program, Matt Hasselbeck. They chat about their "report card" thus far from ESPN for the Thursday Night Football games, Pat and Matt discuss how exhilarating it is to catch a foul ball at a baseball game as Pat recounts Foxy getting absolutely BODIED trying to get one while the boys were at the ALDS game between the Yankees and the Twins. Hasselbeck also gives his thoughts on some of the things happening in the NFL including Duck Hodges getting his first start, whether or not Dak stinks, if the 49ers are real or not, and delivers an interesting take on the referee situation in the NFL. And per usual, Matt tells a few incredible stories that you won't hear anywhere else (28:36-01:44:23). Today's a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 110 - Adam Vinatieri & Memphis Blues]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat is joined by the GOAT. 4x Super Bowl Champion, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x First Team All-Pro, and one of Pat's best friends, Adam Vinatieri joins the show. They discuss whether or not he ever actually considered retirement after hitting a rough patch earlier this year, why he was so excited to come back and play for this Colts team, what he thinks his problems were earlier this season and what he did to fix them, and Pat tries to figure out what luxury vehicle Vinny is calling from in an honest, open interview that you don't want to miss (1:55-20:46). Pat and the guys also record some quick hits about tonight's Packers/Eagles game and look ahead to this weekend in the NFL as they record the show into a cell phone inside Foxy's XL Suite, as the truck won't be operational until this morning before the radio show. Pat also dives into the fiasco of not having a hotel room when arriving in Memphis, and all the other hijinks that took place once he and the boys landed. Pat's running on very few hours of sleep and another late night recording results in he and the boys being a little slap happy. It's a fun one that you'll enjoy. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's show features three of our favorite interviews from this week's radio show (Live on Westwood One from 10 AM - Noon EST, and live streamed on DAZN) with some incredible guests. First, Pat is joined by friend of the show, 7x Pro Bowler, 2x First Team All-Pro, former center for the New York Jets, Nick Mangold. They discuss his new venture into sports betting, the problem with all the horrendous refs in the NFL, his thoughts on the bill being passed in California to pay college athletes for the use of their image and likeness, what the difference between skinny and fat Rex Ryan is, and why he isn't in the Hall of Fame at Ohio State (2:20-23:10). Next, 2x Super Bowl Champion, and current WR for the Detroit Lions, Danny Amendola, joins for a chat with Pat. They discuss the differences between Tom Brady and some of the other quarterbacks he has played with, what he likes about the culture being built in Detroit, how all the fallout from his social media affected him, and whether or not it was fabricated, and he and Pat reminisce about a crazy night they had together in New Mexico (23:45-38:42). Lastly, 2x Super Bowl Champion, 12 year NFL veteran, former QB for the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers, Charlie Batch, calls into the show. He and Pat discuss what his take is on Daniel Jones starting over Eli Manning, and how he was in a similar situation when he was in Detroit, and what the best way for Daniel Jones to have success will be. He also chats about the Big Ben situation with the Steelers and whether he thinks they'll be okay, and he dishes on what it was like being teammates with Barry Sanders, and whether or not his retirement was in any way similar to Andrew Luck's (41:39-1:01:07). Today's show is a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys are back from a 2 week hiatus with an exclusive interview with the newly christened QB1 of the Indianapolis Colts, as Jacoby Brissett joins the show live from the Colts’ indoor practice facility. They discuss everything stemming from the shock of Andrew Luck retiring, if his viral reaction on the sideline is when he first found out, and what his mindset was like coming into the building as the starter. They also chat about his preparation as we get closer to the start of the regular season, what is on his playlist during pregame, and how he wants people to view his game as starting quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts (3:24-31:36). Pat and the guys also discuss Brissett signing a $30 million extension twenty minutes after the end of their interview together, go over Andrew Luck’s retirement some more, they cover all the moves the Houston Texans have made in the last few days, and whether or not it makes them a better football team. They also do a deep dive into the AFC South, and react to Shady McCoy signing with the Chiefs. Pat also has a few thoughts on Jalen Hurts and some other things in the college football landscape, Dave Chappelle’s new standup special Sticks &amp; Stones, and breaks down his fall schedule in detail. It’s good to be back. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

Pat breaks down why Toronto might be his favorite city on the planet, what the Canadian hospitality is like, how going to a Blue Jays vs. Yankees game resparked his idea to have live betting available before every pitch at a baseball game and how it would improve the entertainment value, some of his favorite moments from the Watchalong event including his growing friendship/rivalry with Adam Cole, and his post NXT preshow run-in with Triple H on Saturday night and how he thought it might have been due to another dress code violation, and what it&apos;s like being dropped back into the WWE Universe after being gone for a few weeks and getting caught up with everything that is happened throughout the business. Today&apos;s episode is a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 096 - The Last Show Before Our Lives Are Changed Forever. Thank You All.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss everything happening around the NFL as training camp has started to heat up. They dive into Baker Mayfield shotgunning a beer at the Indians game this past weekend and proceeding to light things up on the practice field, which has Pat feeling like his Browns to win the Super Bowl pick was correct, discuss Freddie Kitchens and Bob Wylie's dust up with each other, and why all these things contribute to a different mentality for the Cleveland Browns. They also chat about Hard Knocks, which premieres tonight and how they're excited for Gruden and AB to be highlighted a bit, and they discuss Andrew Luck's bum calf which has Colts fans everywhere very concerned. Pat also covers some of the things that he watched this weekend, including trying to finish the new Avengers movie, and he has some recommendations for next years Hall of Fame speeches after watching all seven hours of them over the weekend. Pat also chats about going to his 5th Indiana State Fair with Sam, and covers everything they did, all the different foods available, what some of his favorite carnival games are (and some of the ones he despises the most), and tells the hilarious story about the caricature that he and Sam got of themselves and the artists interesting and aggressive decision for the final product. Lastly, Pat teases the big news which should be revealed in 48 hours or less that is certain to ramp things up even more this fall. It's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 090 - A Kendo Stick Changed My Life. Also, American Icon, Joey Chestnut]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat breaks down his weekend in Philadelphia for the WWE Watch Along as he is recovering from almost having his back broken in two by a kendo stick strike from WWE legend Matt Hardy. He and the boys also recap the Djokovic vs. Federer Wimbledon final and how tennis is easily forgettable as an incredibly entertaining sport. They also do a deep dive into some more conspiracy theory talk as Pat and the guys talk about people preparing to storm Area 51 and how they think they will fare, and the Bob Lazar documentary about aliens and UFO’s as well as the Joe Rogan interview that Lazar did, and how Pat is still all the way in on other lifeforms being out there. He also explains how he’s so in on the alien movement, that he no longer subscribes to Bigfoot being real and relives his story about going Bigfoot hunting. Pat also looks ahead a little bit as he prepares for a loaded schedule in the fall and what that may entail for him. To close out the show, we reair the Joey Chestnut interview after Kobayashi recently stated in the news that he’s personally seen Chestnut cheat. The interview covers their rivalry, and gives a look behind the curtain at America’s greatest eater (1:57:12-2:29:14). It’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 085 - Adam Pacman Jones, Ryan Shazier, & A Religious Convo For The Ages]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's show includes a couple of incredible interviews. First, former 6th overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, a first-team All-Pro and Pro Bowler, Adam Pacman Jones joins Pat live in Cincinnati. They chat about the airport situation, his time in the NFL, how he's trying to set a good example for his kids, his past, what song he would want to play at his funeral, and what NFL player from his tenure he'd like to fight the most. (2:27-32:00). Next, 15th pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, 2x Pro Bowler, one of the most inspirational guys on this planet and Linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ryan Shazier, joins Pat and the guys live in Pittsburgh. They chat about his road back to recovery, what the best parts about being a dad are, who he would want to play him in a movie about his life, and he gives his outlook on the Steelers 2019-2020 season (35:32-1:05:01). Later, the guys chat about the different vehicles in Pat's collection, and a conversation about the Amish leads to Pat calling one of his agents to ask a few questions in search of some answers about what it means to be &nbsp;Modern Orthodox Jew. It is perhaps, one of the most enlightening religious conversations you'll ever hear, and answers a lot of questions you may have about the different practices of being Jewish. Today's show is a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys talk about game 5 of the NBA Finals, and cover how heartbreaking it was to see Kevin Durant go down with perhaps a torn achilles. They cover their reactions to the whole the ordeal, the game in general, and what this means going forward. They also get into NHL Finals chatter, Justin Bieber making the colossal mistake of challenging Tom Cruise to a fight, and Pat and the guys do a deep dive into the Women’s World Cup to educate people that it’s going on right now, and to discuss the incredible soccer being played ahead of the US’s match today. They also chat about potentially becoming a baseball show during the dog days of summer, and what the MLB can do to get the average viewer excited about baseball games, and Pat and the guys give a shoutout for David Ortiz, as Big Papi is still recovering from surgery after an assassination attempt in the Dominican Republic. Also, at the end of the show, fresh off absolutely crushing America’s Got Talent, one of the funniest human beings in the world right now, and hopefully an eventual AGT champion, Indianapolis native, Ryan Niemiller joins the show. He and the guys discuss his road to where he’s at, why he thinks about the way he basically just blew up over night, he talks about the AGT process leading up to everything, what some of his favorite hobbies to do when not performing stand up comedy, and when to potentially see him in the future. It’s an incredible interview with someone who hopefully wins this season of America’s Got Talent, we’re pulling for him (1:18:46-2:34:06). Today’s a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat prepares something to honor the Greatest Generation as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of D-Day and the men that helped us continue to live in freedom in the greatest country on the planet. Pat is also starting to get the NFL itch again as the guys discuss what the chances are that Gronk is going to come out of retirement to play for the Patriots next year, discuss the possibility of the NFL going to an 18 game season, while Pat has different ideas in order to keep the players and owners both happy, and he discusses which job he would prefer: Executive Director of the NFL Players Association or Commissioner of the NFL. Later, friend of the show, arguably the most dominant player in the history of game shows, certified genius, and America's sweetheart, Jeopardy! James Holzhauer, joins the show again. He and Pat discuss whether or not being on the show last week brought upon the McAfee curse and ended his run, what's next for James and what different opportunities have come up since his Jeopardy! run ended, his overall thoughts on the whole experience, and what some of his most fond memories of his run were (35:52-55:37). The guys also discuss Aaron Rodgers being chug shamed and dive back into a conversation about the chug as a method of bringing people together, what some of their favorite buffets are, and the guys discuss the NBA Finals and try to decide if Kawhi Leonard is going to stay in Toronto or test the waters of free agency elsewhere. It's a fun one, come and laugh with us, cheers.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, perhaps the smartest man on earth, the most dominant Jeopardy! champion of all-time whose 29 day total has reached $2,254,938, the incomparable, James Holzhauer, joins the show for an incredible interview. They cover his strategy when it comes to Jeopardy and what he did to prepare before going into the show, what the taping process is like, how his career as a sports gambler has benefited him during his time on Jeopardy, whether or not his opponents respect his strategy or if he's gotten any blowback, what he considers some of his weaker categories, and ultimately, what comes next (2:25-35:32). Pat and the guys also talk more about one hit wonders and try to pin down what the actual last one hit wonder of all-time might be, and Pat recaps his trip to Fort Wayne for his speaking engagement at an event for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northeast Indiana, and how the evening had a bit of scary start to it, some of the memorable moments, and how his speech differed from some of the legends that have come before him at the event. Today's show is a great one, come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 073 - A Really Cool Journey With Frank Caliendo]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat is joined in studio by probably the world's greatest impressionist, actor and comedian, the man of 1,000 voices, Frank Caliendo. They have an incredible chat that ranges from Frank's career doing impressions, the life that he has lived to this point and what some of the seminal moments were to get him to this point in his career, some of the fears and anxiety's that he has trying to further his career in the digital age through Instagram and Twitter, what aspirations he still has for comedy, and some of the things he has learned from Pat trying to reinvent himself through podcasts and other forms of media. This is maybe one of the deepest and realest conversations we've ever had, and not one that should be missed (3:45-1:28:15). Pat also covers the Knicks being screwed out of the NBA draft lottery, gives a couple thoughts on the NBA playoffs now that we're down to the conference finals, and chats about Jamie Collins potentially going back to New England, as Pat remembers him jumping over Matt Overton to block an Adam Vinatieri extra point, which sends him down memory lane as to why he can't stand Walt Anderson. Today's show is a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat is joined by 16 year NFL vet, 2x Pro Bowler, ambassador For the Brand, and now a world renowned magician of <em>America's Got Talent</em> fame, Jon Dorenbos, joins the show. Pat and Jon have an incredibly entertaining, enlightening, and inspiring conversation that covers Jon's hardships growing up, his journey from junior college to being one of the most respected long snappers in the NFL, to his career after football being an accomplished magician. Jon leaves no page unturned, all while doing a couple of magic tricks along the way (2:44-57:15). Next, &nbsp;Pat's former teammate, 2nd round pick of the New England Patriots, and one of the smoothest athletes of all-time, Darius Butler, joins the show to give his reaction to the insanity of the last few days in the NBA playoffs. He recaps the games from this weekend, looks ahead to the Conference Finals, and gives his prediction for the NBA finals. He also gives his pick for a team to watch in the NFL this year, and talks about what he's been up to recently (1:02:12-1:18:21). We also have a NEW SEGMENT ALERT called, "I Have Some Thoughts." The guys also dive into a SPOILER HEAVY discussion about everything that happened on Sunday's penultimate episode of Game of Thrones, and try to make sense of it all &nbsp;while looking ahead to next week's series finale (1:37:01-1:52:34). Today's a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

Pat and the guys discuss the Kentucky Derby and it's unprecedented ending, as well as who they had money on, and the Gorms giving out "winners," to the whole office. Pat remembers the few times he's been to the Kentucky Derby and what the atmosphere is like in the infield, and imagines what that weekend is like being a guest of either Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers. The guys also chat about the 1st annual Pat McAfee Foundation golf outing and remember some of their favorite foursomes that helped make the day an incredible success. The guys also cover the NHL playoffs, the NBA playoffs, and chat a little bit about movies after the release of Zac Efron's Ted Bundy movie on Netflix, as well as Adam Sandler making a return to SNL to host, and of course recap the latest episode of Game of Thrones as we are nearing the home stretch for the series. Also joining the show, is a man who recently went viral for hilariously berating the players for his Little League team, Coach Scott Bergin. He chats about his initial idea to make the videos, whether he has received any blowback from any players' parents, or parents from other teams, what he has in store in the future, and he also tells the harrowing story about he and his wife being caught in the middle of the tragic shooting in Las Vegas from a couple years back in an incredible interview (1:25:14-1:46:46). It's a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 068 - Chris Ballard, Rich Eisen, & Behind The Scenes Of The "Greatest Draft Announcement Of All-Time"]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat breaks down his trip to Nashville for the NFL Draft. From shaking hands with Roger Goodell and sitting in a forum with Hall of Famers like T.O. and perhaps the most electric human on earth, Rayfield Wright, to hanging out with Shane Lechler and TJ Yates in the green room and getting a picture with Reggie Wayne, to delivering the most entertaining and hilarious draft pick in NFL history, Pat relives the entire day. Also joining the show to discuss his draft and what he thought of Pat’s performance, is GM of the Indianapolis Colts, Chris Ballard. He and Pat discuss the players the Colts picked up, and what the atmosphere was like in the Colts’ war room for pick 89 (33:24-37:51). Also joining the show is friend of the program, friend of The Brand, and the voice of the NFL, Rich Eisen. He and Pat discuss draft weekend, and what Rich thought of the weekend as a whole. They cover the headspace of Giants fans after drafting Daniel Jones and all the negative backlash, Mike Mayock's first draft as GM of the Oakland Raiders, Rich’s vendetta with the band at the draft, his enthusiasm when calling the first punter drafted, and what he thought of Pat’s performance (48:24-1:10:22). The guys also dive DEEP into Game of Thrones as they discuss the Battle of Winterfell and whether or not it lived up to everyone’s expectations, and they briefly get into Avengers: End Game (WITHOUT SPOILERS). It’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 067 - Incredible Insight From An NFL War Room On Draft Day With Chris Ballard]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys are joined by friend of the show, and General Manager of the Indianapolis Colts, Chris Ballard. They chat about his draft day strategy in terms of what types of players the Colts plan to go after, whether or not they will be trading the 3rd round pick that Pat is supposed to announce, what he makes of the Gruden situation with clearing scouts out of the war room, and answers whether or not he’s a top need or best available guy in an incredible interview into the NFL draft process (4:!6-24:31). The guys also discuss the night that was OCW: Straight to Hell and all the madness behind it, how the guys put it together, and they relive some of their favorite moments, and look ahead to next week’s installment. The guys also discuss Ben Roethlisberger’s new massive contract and how Yinzers are presumably feeling about it, Pat talks a little about being cursed after the Vegas Golden Knights blew a 3-0 lead to the San Jose Sharks, and Pat decides to place a few locks on some other NHL teams as the Stanley Cup playoffs keep rolling on. Be sure to tune in to either ESPN or the NFL Network on Friday night to watch Pat announce the Indianapolis Colts’ 3rd round selection live from Nashville, it should be memorable. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 066 - Draft Week Lies With Mike Florio]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat welcomes The Blogfather, owner and voice of Pro Football Talk, and dear friend of the show, Mike Florio, to chat about the upcoming NFL draft. They discuss who can be trusted during draft week and what certain teams' mindsets are going in. They also cover a few new ideas for prospects coming into the NFL to go to the draft and make a little money, Pat asks Florio to get to the bottom of the Gruden/Mayock/scouting debacle in Oakland and whether that is that common, what he's currently hearing about Kyler Murray and if he's still the #1 pick, and whether Mike has heard anything in relation to Pat in the Monday Night Football booth (4:13-23:32). Pat and the boys also discuss their upcoming comedy tour, "Pat McAfee Does America," which will be in six different cities this summer with tickets going on sale next Monday. They also cover Pat's weekend in Nashville and how he got mistaken for Jackson Maine, the boys have a little Hockey Talk as they check in on the NHL playoffs, and a little hoops talk as they all make a bet with Gorman about who will win the NBA championship. The guys also cover Game of Thrones, as Pat is now all the way in and arguably one of the biggest fans of the series. After the show, stick around as Todd goes Behind the Badge and breaks down some of the new breaks in the Delphi murders case in Delphi, IN from two years ago. It's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys record the show live from his backyard in what feels like an Indiana summer night. They discuss the NFL schedule release and highlight a couple of different games that they are looking forward to, including Packers vs. Bears to open the season on Thursday night, Steelers vs. Patriots on the first Sunday night, and a couple of the Thursday night and Monday night games that look to be good matchups. They squeeze in a little hockey talk as Pat has to respond to the city of Pittsburgh after the Pens got swept by the Islanders. They also discuss Russell Wilson's new contract, and whether or not any of his teammates in the locker room actually like him. They also discuss movie biopics, and how Pat see's the movie about his life unfolding. Also joining the show is 11 year NFL veteran, Pro Bowler, and the man who started the entire Deflategate situation by intercepting a Tom Brady pass, D'Qwell Jackson. He and Pat talk about their relationship as teammates, his video for The Uninterrupted about how all he wants is his playoff interception from the Deflategate game to be returned to him, and what he's been doing to enjoy his retirement thus far. (4:15-18:44) To close out the show, Zito makes a triumphant return trying to read and ad, and the guys each give their favorite summer banger to give you something to chew on heading into the weekend. It's a fun show, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 064 - John Daly, Dan Orlovsky, Tiger's Back, & The NFL Never Sleeps]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys break down one of the most memorable Sunday's in recent memory as they look back on Tiger Woods winning his 5th Green Jacket at the Masters and discuss his greatness, how much more he has in the tank, and why things were different this time around when they've looked promising before. To chat a little bit more about Tiger, Pat welcomes on friend of the show, 2X Major Champion, and one of the most electric human beings to ever walk the planet, John Daly. They chat about his week in Augusta at Hooters and how it differed from last year, how Little John has been performing on the course as of late, what he thought about Tiger winning his 5th Green Jacket and whether or not he's going to make a run at Jack Nicklaus' major record, and if there are any young players right now that can challenge the greatness of Tiger's career (22:47-27:47). Pat and the guys also welcome recurring guest, regular panelist on "Get Up," and 11 year NFL veteran, Dan Orlovsky, to chat about Russell Wilson giving the Seahawks a hard deadline for a new extension, and whether or not he could end up playing QB for the Giants. They also chat about which coaches from the Sean McVay mold will have successful season or if he is an anomaly, if Joe Flacco will resurrect his career in Denver, and Dan gives out a couple of his sleeper picks for the NFC and AFC next year (38:41-50:20). To close out the show, the guys discuss the premiere of Game of Thrones and try to convince Pat that getting on board with the show is worth his time, and Pat announces the upcoming live podcast tour which has 6 dates in 6 different cities this summer. It's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

To chat a little bit more about Tiger, Pat welcomes on friend of the show, 2X Major Champion, and one of the most electric human beings to ever walk the planet, John Daly. They chat about his week in Augusta at Hooters and how it differed from last year, how Little John has been performing on the course as of late, what he thought about Tiger winning his 5th Green Jacket and whether or not he&apos;s going to make a run at Jack Nicklaus&apos; major record, and if there are any young players right now that can challenge the greatness of Tiger&apos;s career (22:47-27:47). Pat and the guys also welcome recurring guest, regular panelist on &quot;Get Up,&quot; and 11 year NFL veteran, Dan Orlovsky, to chat about Russell Wilson giving the Seahawks a hard deadline for a new extension, and whether or not he could end up playing QB for the Giants. They also chat about which coaches from the Sean McVay mold will have successful season or if he is an anomaly, if Joe Flacco will resurrect his career in Denver, and Dan gives out a couple of his sleeper picks for the NFC and AFC next year (38:41-50:20). To close out the show, the guys discuss the premiere of Game of Thrones and try to convince Pat that getting on board with the show is worth his time, and Pat announces the upcoming live podcast tour which has 6 dates in 6 different cities this summer. It&apos;s a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 056 - March Is A Wild Month... Dan Dakich & Mike Florio Convos As Well]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's show is highlighted for two incredible interviews. First, friend of the show, ESPN college basketball analyst, former head coach, and current radio host, Dan Dakich calls into the show to break down the NCAA Tournament. They cover who some of the teams he likes going in are, why Zion Williamson is different than anyone else he's ever seen, who some of his sleeper upset picks, shares some of his favorite Bob Knight stories, and he answers questions from the around the room in another rendition of "The Room Wants To Know." It's everything you need to get ready for March Madness (2:53-36:02). Later, the Blogfather, friend of the show, and one of the smartest football minds around, Mike Florio calls into the show for a new segment called, "INTERNET BEEF," to discuss his recent war of words with Richard Sherman on Twitter. He breaks down why he was right in his argument with Sherman, what his logic was, and highlights a few more things around the league that carry importance and might try to steal some of the spotlight from the NCAA Tournament. They also do a little Hockey Talk, and discuss who Mike likes for March Madness (42:56-1:11:06). Pat and the guys also discuss their St. Patrick's Day together in Indianapolis and put some of the pieces back together, Pat gives a little wedding update and how he's finally convinced Sam to let Zito be involved in the wedding, the guys chat about their new Bro Bro Bro Bets podcast and what their mission is, and Digs got a new dog which leads to a discussion about Pat facing heat to add more animals to his farm, despite a written contract that says otherwise. Pat also takes to Instagram to answer questions from listeners in the first edition of new segment, "Chat With Pat." Today's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys discuss the grassroots guerilla campaign to get Pat into the Monday Night Football booth that started on Twitter yesterday and ended being a top 3 trend in the United States. They also discuss their thoughts on the NFL combine and how entertaining it was, and chat about some other NFL news as we get closer to free agency and the NFL draft. They also dive in Leaving Neverland, the HBO documentary about the Michael Jackson sexual abuse allegations and how disturbing it was, whether or not this effectively ends Michael Jackson, and how it seems to tap into the same formula that has been present in some of the most talked about documentaries of the year. To close out the show, Pat welcomes Super Bowl Champion, 1st and 2nd Team All-Pro, former AFC Defensive Player of the Year and 2013 sack leader, 5x Pro Bowler, future Hall of Famer and former teammate Robert Mathis to the show. They chat about his role with the Colts now as a pass rush consultant and what he's doing with Gridiron Gang, his own football training service. They also discuss some of the guys that impressed him at the combine, how he and Dwight Freeney pushed and made each other better, whether or not he thought Pat was a good teammate, which quarterback he hated the most, and he answers some questions in the "the room wants to know" (1:05:47-1:36:39). It's a great time. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 051 - Greatest Conversation With An NFL General Manager In History]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys sit down with Colts GM and friend of the show, Chris Ballard, for probably the best interview ever given by an NFL GM. He takes them through his draft and scouting process, and how much it changes during the week of the combine. He also discusses what some of the questions the Colts use for potential draft picks are, what he focuses on to put his team into a position to be successful, his thoughts on Frank Reich, and whether or not he’ll be making moves to bring in a guy like AB or Lev Bell in an absolutely hilarious and enlightening conversation (1:53-25:00). The guys also discuss The Pub sliding in to the number three spot in the St. Paddy’s march sale, what the combine week means, discuss old toys that probably killed a lot of kids, the allure of scuba diving which sprouts another oceans vs. space debate, wedding planning, what kind of questions Dr. Phil would ask NFL draft prospects, and what some of their favorite types of cookies are. It’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys do a deep dive into the Oscars as they recap the show, talk about Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, give some of their takes on the Academy Awards as a show and whether it suffered from having a host or not, and how Hollywood might as well be a different planet.

Pat also gives an outlook on combine week that is coming up as the NFL offseason is about to heat up again, and extends the St. Paddy's Day t-shirt sale for a limited time.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On today&apos;s show, Pat and the guys do a deep dive into the Oscars as they recap the show, talk about Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, give some of their takes on the Academy Awards as a show and whether it suffered from having a host or not, and how Hollywood might as well be a different planet. The guys also discuss the Robert Kraft saga and try to make sense of what he was thinking, and whether or not they think there are actually bigger names attached. Pat also gives an outlook on combine week that is coming up as the NFL offseason is about to heat up again, and extends the St. Paddy&apos;s Day t-shirt sale for a limited time. Later, one of the most electric humans on the planet, former Vice President of officiating for the NFL, and current rules analyst for FOX Sports, Mike Pereira, joins the show from Top Golf. They discuss his career as an official, some of the things he&apos;d like to see changed in order to makes the lives of the officials easier, who he has beef with, and what some of his hobbies are in an absolutely hilarious interview (1:07:53-1:35:56). It&apos;s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 049 - First Day On The Job With WWE, Nick Mangold, & Darius Butler]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Pat is in Orlando recording the show from his hotel room as he finds himself in his first full week as a WWE employee and the guys record a late, slap happy episode. They cover his travels down to Florida, his entire first day at the complex including commentating a dark match at the WWE NXT event, and him hitting a HUGE Frog Splash on a training dummy. They also cover Zion Williamson's shoe/knee exploding and whether or not it will affect Nike stock, some of the guys competing in a very hot and spicy chocolate eating contest, and break down the sale on St. Paddy's day shirts available now for 20% off (through Saturday at midnight) at store.PatMcAfeeShow.com. Also included are a couple of incredible interviews. First, 2nd round pick of the New England Patriots and Pat's teammate in Indianapolis, one of the smoothest athletes to ever play in the NFL, former defensive back, Darius Butler, joins the show. He and Pat chat about him being in the room with the owners when trying to end the Kaepernick situation, what he thinks about the way everything unfolded, what he's expecting from his new podcast, and he answers a few questions about Antonio Brown, one of his best friends (1:11:15-1:35:21). To close out the show, 7x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, former center for the New York Jets and hilarious human, Nick Mangold joins the show. He chats about what it was like playing for the Jets through the good and bad times, which version of Rex Ryan he prefers, what some of his hobbies are outside of football now that he's retired, some Ohio St. and Michigan rivalry stories, and whether or not he'll raise his son as a Jets fan (1:50:38-2:04:38). It's a hilarious one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 045 - Rex Ryan, Michael Cole, & A HUGE Life Announcement]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s episode is loaded with two incredible conversations. First, one of the most charismatic guys out there, former Head Coach of the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills and current ESPN analyst, Rex Ryan, joins the show. He and Pat talk about his defensive philosophy, what he thinks of the defenses playing in the NFL right now, whether or not he’s gotten the itch yet to get back into coaching, how being in the media is different than being a coach, his career as an actor, and he elaborates on the shots he took at Cody Parkey (4:43-21:35). Next, arguably the greatest play-by-play announcer in the world, one of the most accomplished men in the industry, the voice of the WWE, Michael Cole, joins the show for an in depth conversation. He and Pat discuss the big news that Pat has coming up, Michael recounts a career that has spanned from covering political campaigns, to covering the siege in Waco, to civil wars, and ultimately to finding his way working for the WWE. He also recounts some different stories about his career in wrestling and gives a little closer look inside the industry, and how he’s found himself in the position he’s in. The guys also get involved in another edition of, “The room wants to know,” as they fire some rapid fire questions at Michael (24:02-1:21:28). Pat also gives everybody an idea of what to expect from the show next week with him on vacation, and has another great giveaway opportunity to close the show. It’s a really fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 044 - Tim Tebow, Schefter, & Superb Owl Chatter]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s show is a great one. First, former Heisman Trophy winner, 1st round draft pick of the Denver Broncos, the greatest college football player of all-time and current outfielder in the New York Mets organization, Tim Tebow, joins the show from Top Golf in Atlanta for an incredible conversation. They discuss what it was like being Tim Tebow in college, his transition to the NFL and the most difficult part, talks a little bit about his perspective about life, chats more about his MLB aspirations and what his walkup song will be, and how he handles all the scrutiny every time he does something (4:51-27:37). Also joining the show is the king of scoops himself, one of the best in the game at his job, the creator of the “Adam Bomb,” Adam Schefter. They discuss what Super Bowl week is like for him, the guys dig for a couple updates on some scoops, what he thinks is going to happen with the Antonio Brown situation, and the stresses of having troll Twitter accounts make fake news with his name and having to deal with the repercussions (55:54-1:13:46). The guys also recap the entire Super Bowl week from Top Golf and who some of their favorite guests were and which people surprised them. They also recap the weight loss competition, and dive into their thoughts on the Super Bowl, the commercials, and Boston Connor chats about his experience seeing the Patriots win a Super Bowl in person. It’s a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys do a DEEP dive into the Divisional Round of the playoffs and cover everything else that happened in the NFL over the weekend. They chat about the Patriots not being dead, the Chiefs dominating victory over the Colts, the Rams looking like one of the best teams in the NFL, and Nick Foles seeing his magic run out. Gorms also talks a bit about his weekend going to the Colts/Chiefs game on the private jet with Jim Irsay. Later, friend of the show, Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk calls in for a nice hearty football discussion. They bounce around from the playoffs, his schedule now that the football season is almost over, and what he thinks about all the different coaching changes thus far. The room also fires several questions at Florio ranging from AB potentially playing in San Francisco or somewhere else, if the Packers made a good decision in Matt LaFleur, how he settled on Pro Football Talk, and who he thinks will win the Super Bowl (1:26:34-2:10:13). Pat also debuts a new segment, “Let’s Get Topical,” as he discusses who might be out to get The Rock after a UK magazine misquoted him in an interview, and the conspiracy behind the Instagram egg that took over Kylie Jenner for the most liked picture on the app. It's a really good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

Later the guys dive deeper into everything that happened on Wild Card weekend and what it means moving forward for the rest of the playoffs.

The guys also discuss the first few days of the weight loss challenge and how the participants are battling through it, dive into a little movie talk ranging from Kevin Costner’s athletic skills, to Avatar, to Goodfellas, which results in a conversation about the current state of the mafia, and if they still operate. They also cover all the drama going on in Pittsburgh with the Steelers and talk about a couple of the potential landing spots for AB if he is to get traded, chat about the NFL playoff games this weekend and who they’re leaning towards, get into a little bit of a fast food discussion, and question where the phrase "bless you," came from and if it should be extended to other things as well. It’s a hilarious one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[PMS 2.0 032 - NFL Defensive Rookie Of The Year]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On today’s show, Pat goes live from the Indianapolis Colts facility for an incredible interview with the NFL’s leading tackler, probable Defensive Rookie of the Year, and one of the biggest Pro Bowl snubs in recent memory, The Maniac, Darius Leonard. They cover his upbringing and how he overcame the odds being stacked against him, and who he’s looked to for advice. They also cover his thoughts on the Colts season, how all the slights thrown at him are just adding chips on his shoulder, and how he should take the NFL drug testing him as a compliment (6:37-21:09). Pat and Digs also give a touching tribute to Coach Sacco, their high school football coach who recently passed away, and the guys get into a conversation about Pat’s high school playing days. Later, sports handicapper, source material for the film Two For The Money, and friend of the show, Brandon Lang, calls in to give a couple of red hot NCAA basketball picks, chats a bit about his time caddying for Jim Irsay (and inadvertently takes a couple of shots at Gorman), and looks ahead to this weeks NFL slate while also giving some thoughts on the NCAA football playoff (1:02:17-1:25:45). The guys wrap up the show by diving a tad deeper into the NFL games, and give a few more thoughts on the weight loss competition. It’s a great one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat and the guys get a surprise call from AQ Shipley and they chat about the Cardinals' past game, his nightmare flight from New York to Phoenix with his baby and him trying to get her to stop crying, and if he has any questions for Joe Thomas (12:02-19:32).

The guys also discuss Pat's new three-legged cat, and dive into an NFL conversation about whether or not the Patriots are done, if the Steelers are back/Boz's woes, if the Colts have quietly become one of the best teams in the AFC, and their thoughts on some of the demands of retired players and HOFer's.

			<description><![CDATA[On today's show, Pat successfully formulates a plan to save the punt in the NFL, as it has come under attack in recent weeks. The guys also all head into the studio to talk more about their strategies for the weight loss competition. Also joining the show is Arizona Cardinals center, Penn State alum, and friend of the show AQ Shipley. He gives the guys some tips for cutting weight, discusses how his rehab coming off a torn ACL is going, gives his thoughts on the outlook of the future of the Cardinals, and chats a little bit about his career as a basketball player (16:00-48:30). Later, the guys discuss whether or not you need to tip bathroom attendants, and welcome in Jeffrey Gorman, a true five-tool specimen for Pat McAfee Inc. He gives away a couple of betting picks as he's riding a hot streak, talks about his previous career working for the Colts as one of Jim Irsay's right hand men, tells a couple of stories from his time working as tour manager for The Black Crowes, and navigates how to interact with the Pittsburgh guys in the office without getting into a fist fight. It's a fun show. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

			<itunes:summary>On today&apos;s show, Pat successfully formulates a plan to save the punt in the NFL, as it has come under attack in recent weeks. The guys also all head into the studio to talk more about their strategies for the weight loss competition. Also joining the show is Arizona Cardinals center, Penn State alum, and friend of the show AQ Shipley. He gives the guys some tips for cutting weight, discusses how his rehab coming off a torn ACL is going, gives his thoughts on the outlook of the future of the Cardinals, and chats a little bit about his career as a basketball player (16:00-48:30). Later, the guys discuss whether or not you need to tip bathroom attendants, and welcome in Jeffrey Gorman, a true five-tool specimen for Pat McAfee Inc. He gives away a couple of betting picks as he&apos;s riding a hot streak, talks about his previous career working for the Colts as one of Jim Irsay&apos;s right hand men, tells a couple of stories from his time working as tour manager for The Black Crowes, and navigates how to interact with the Pittsburgh guys in the office without getting into a fist fight. It&apos;s a fun show. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.

Also joining the show is three great guests. First, former Heisman Trophy winner and 1st overall pick, Carson Palmer, joins the show to chat about his upcoming Football Life on NFL Network, who the most special athlete he played with was, and what he's doing post retirement (42:51-59:06). Next, media mogul Gary Vee calls in to chat about his Jets, and his relentless pursuit to own them (1:01:23-1:18:36). Closing out the show is 4x Pro Bowler Richie Incognito to discuss mental health and his foundation (1:19:45-1:33:33). Cheers.
