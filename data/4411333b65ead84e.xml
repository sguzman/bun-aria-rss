Those essays got wildly popular and today, he has more than 350,000 subscribers.
However, he kept making shorts, embedded in his essays as narrative framing devices. In other words, he says, he &quot;trick[ed] the audience into watching short films that I also wanna make, but that normally would not get the views on YouTube or have sponsors on them.&quot;
Then, starting in early 2020, he began connecting those narrative shorts into a serialized story about an evil talking coconut named Charl. This so-called &quot;Charl saga&quot; culminated in June with the release of a feature-length film, https://nebula.app/videos/patrickhwillems-night-of-the-coconut (Night of the Coconut), which is available on the streaming platform Nebula.
Today, on the season one finale of Follow Friday, Patrick shared some of his favorite follow recommendations, while imposing some additional rules on himself: With &quot;one asterisk,&quot; he says, he picked favorite accounts run by people he doesn&apos;t know in real life: Kobe Eats (@kobeeats on https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCosJ16GN2g2tGsVQnGK9pvA (YouTube) and https://www.tiktok.com/@kobeeats?lang=en (TikTok), https://www.instagram.com/kobe_yn/ (@kobe_yn) on Instagram); Jackson Murphy (https://twitter.com/LCJReviews (@LCJReviews) on Twitter and https://www.youtube.com/c/lightscamerajackson (@LightsCameraJackson) on YouTube); Neil Cicierega (@neilcic on https://twitter.com/neilcic (Twitter) and https://www.youtube.com/c/neilcic (YouTube)); and the George Lucas Talk Show (https://www.youtube.com/c/TheGeorgeLucasTalkShow/ (@TheGeorgeLucasTalkShow) on YouTube).

And instead of learning to bake bread or speak Esperanto, she began curating weird and amusing things she found on Wikipedia.
Two years later, Depths of Wikipedia has more than 1.5 million followers combined across https://www.instagram.com/depthsofwikipedia/ (Instagram), https://twitter.com/depthsofwiki (Twitter), and https://www.tiktok.com/@depthsofwikipedia/ (TikTok). That success means walking a fine line: Annie wants to celebrate Wikipedia&apos;s oddities and encourage her followers to edit pages, but not to intentionally contribute false info or &quot;bad writing for the sake of humor.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes I&apos;ll post something and then it&apos;ll start getting vandalized a bunch,&quot; she says. &quot;Like when I posted the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mammals_displaying_homosexual_behavior (List of Mammals Displaying Homosexual Behavior) — don&apos;t do this, by the way — people started editing it to add in their name. It&apos;s funny, I guess, for two seconds, but then you just feel bad.&quot;
Today on Follow Friday, Annie shares some great follow recommendations: Meta-influencer Harry Hill (@veryharryhill on https://twitter.com/veryharryhill (Twitter), Instagram, and https://www.tiktok.com/@veryharryhill/ (TikTok)); Twitter bots such as https://twitter.com/NYT_first_said (@NYT_first_said), https://twitter.com/ResNeXtGuesser (@ResNeXtGuesser), and https://twitter.com/aceCourtBot (@AceCourtBot); post-ironic Catholic Instagram pages such as https://tilda.cc/page/ineedgodineverymomentofmylife (@ineedgodineverymomentofmylife) and https://www.instagram.com/praying/ (@praying); and TikTok aggregator Leia Jospe (@favetiktoks420 on Instagram).

That&apos;s a big and sometimes contentious field, and TANGOTI host Bridget Todd says it&apos;s important to make space for everyone to work through difficult conversations about inclusion, rather than expecting everyone to &quot;get it&quot; right away.
&quot;I&apos;ve been in social change movements for a long time and I do think we have this expectation that we expect people to show up with the right ethos and the right language and the right perspective,&quot; Bridget says. &quot;And I get that, but I also feel like it doesn&apos;t leave room to hear the messy conversations of how people become smarter, better, more nuanced, and more thoughtful.&quot;
Today on Follow Friday, she explains how to use social media when disinformation is circulating after a tragedy, how she has evolved her thinking about politics online, why she&apos;s optimistic about a new online platform for the first time in a while, and much more. 
She also shares four great follow recommendations: Early podcaster and co-host of https://uhhyeahdude.com/ (Uhh Yeah Dude) Jonathan Larroquette (@jonathanlarroquette on Instagram); political pundit and former The View co-host Meaghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain on https://twitter.com/MeghanMcCain (Twitter) and https://www.instagram.com/meghanmccain/ (Instagram)); comedy writer and Showtime TV star Ziwe (https://twitter.com/ziwe (@Ziwe) on Twitter); and Somewhere Good CEO Naj Austin (https://www.instagram.com/najaustin/ (@najaustin) on Instagram and https://twitter.com/najjmahal (@najjmahal) on Twitter).

And in 2020, after more than a decade of wanting to be an author, she published her first book — the bestselling sci-fi novel https://read.macmillan.com/lp/axioms-end/ (Axiom&apos;s End), which was informed by that same attentiveness to pop culture. After 9/11, she noticed,  popular alien invasion stories had shifted from &quot;goofy&quot; stories to &quot;dead serious&quot; ones, like  Steven Spielberg&apos;s War of the Worlds.
&quot;It&apos;s an alternate history that takes place in the late 2000s,&quot; she says of the first book, which is getting a sequel in October called https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250274540 (Truth of the Divine). &quot;Basically, it&apos;s what if first contact happened during the Bush administration? ... It&apos;s a thought experiment of how would we react if civilization has to keep on trucking the way we have, but now we have this great existential quandary that, at least in the universe of the book, is heavily politicized.&quot;
On today&apos;s podcast, Lindsay talks about four people she loves to follow on YouTube: A https://www.youtube.com/c/ToddintheShadows (pop music analyst) who breaks down one-hit wonders, band-breaking records, and more; a https://www.youtube.com/c/AmandatheJedi/ (prolific video essayist) who wears her enthusiasm on her sleeve; an https://www.youtube.com/c/DisasterBreakdown/ (aviation expert) who explains the history of air disasters; and a https://www.youtube.com/c/DrewGooden1/ (former Vine star) who cooks up brilliant video ideas like it&apos;s nothing.

He was a little early to the party: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2005/04/03/podcasting-catches-on/ (Six million) Americans had listened to a podcast back then, versus https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2022/ (177 million) today. 
But Jesse stuck with it, and then some. The Sound of Young America became the hit NPR series Bullseye, and he founded the comedy and culture podcast network Maximum Fun, which powers dozens of other podcasts, including Jesse&apos;s other shows — Judge John Hodgman and Jordan, Jesse, Go!
Today on Follow Friday, he explains why he got into podcasting, his passion for dad movies, feeling like an outsider inside NPR, and much more. He also shares four great follow recommendations: An adorable &quot;scruffy dog&quot; named Archie (https://www.instagram.com/archie.was.here/ (@archie.was.here) on Instagram); New York Times opinion columnist and podcaster and cereal critic Jamelle Bouie (@jbouie on https://twitter.com/jbouie (Twitter) and https://twitter.com/jbouie (Instagram)); comedian and roller derby commentator Blaine Capatch (https://twitter.com/blainecapatch/ (@blainecapatch) on Twitter); and Pop Culture Happy Hour host and author Linda Holmes (https://twitter.com/lindaholmes (@lindaholmes) on Twitter and https://www.instagram.com/lindaholmes97/ (@lindaholmes97) on Instagram).

Raphael (BioHacked: Family Secrets): Brooklyn moms, &quot;monogamish,&quot; T9 texting</itunes:title><description>When her college friend Amber invited her to the beach five years ago, T.J. Raphael had no idea that saying &quot;yes&quot; would change the course of her career.

When he&apos;s not writing about the media and running a PR agency, Ed Zitron is probably on Twitter, where he&apos;s curated a perfect experience for himself: He follows fascinating people who represent what he cares about, and aggressively mutes what he doesn&apos;t care for, including words like &quot;doge,&quot; &quot;stonk,&quot; and &quot;Gamestop.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s a melting pot of crap, just like my brain,&quot; he says.
On today&apos;s show, Ed puts talks about four of his favorite accounts on Twitter: A https://twitter.com/PitchingNinja (baseball analyst) who seems like a genuinely fun person to hang out with; a https://twitter.com/hokucurnan (talented videographer) who makes cool stuff look cooler; a https://twitter.com/drewtoothpaste (musician/webcomic artist) who might kick your ass (at the right place and right time); and a https://twitter.com/greengiant_es (corporate account) that posted the greatest tweet in the history of Twitter.
And on https://www.patreon.com/followfriday (our Patreon page), you can pledge any amount of money to get access to Follow Friday XL — our members-only podcast feed with exclusive bonus follows. We had recorded a bonus follow with Ed for the page, but it&apos;s already available to the public in https://followfridaypodcast.com/new-patreon (this episode).

After three years of reporting out stories that originated on Reddit, the WBUR podcast https://www.wbur.org/podcasts/endlessthread (Endless Thread) parted ways with the social app this year, and started asking, &quot;What else can we say about the internet?&quot;
&quot;Follow Friday is a great example of how there&apos;s so much out there, and we felt like we had more work to do,&quot; says Endless Thread co-host Amory Sivertson. &quot;So that&apos;s where we are now, telling stories that paint a broader picture of our online interactions and the communities that are formed.&quot;
And most recently, Amory and her co-host Ben Brock Johnson have been tackling the history of some of the internet&apos;s greatest memes, including Rickrolling, Scumbag Steve, and &quot;Woman Yelling At Cat.&quot;
&quot;A lot of times the image kind of speaks for itself, or at least it brings a vibe that — as long as people put a caption on it — is understandable to you, you can enjoy it and you can pass it on,&quot; Ben says. &quot;But there are multiple layers to memes.&quot;
Today on Follow Friday, Amory and Ben recommend four of their favorite accounts from across the internet: A https://www.youtube.com/c/cnliziqi/videos (cinematic and pastoral YouTube channel) about food in western China; a curated and approachable https://twitter.com/womensart1/ (collection of women&apos;s art) on Twitter; a https://twitter.com/kenyatta (pragmatic meme expert)  who&apos;s making the internet a better place; and a https://www.instagram.com/sheldricktrust/ (Kenyan nonprofit) protecting elephants, rhinos and more. Plus: What are their favorite memes?

After three years of reporting out stories that originated on Reddit, the WBUR podcast https://www.wbur.org/podcasts/endlessthread (Endless Thread) parted ways with the social app this year, and started asking, &quot;What else can we say about the internet?&quot;
&quot;Follow Friday is a great example of how there&apos;s so much out there, and we felt like we had more work to do,&quot; says Endless Thread co-host Amory Sivertson. &quot;So that&apos;s where we are now, telling stories that paint a broader picture of our online interactions and the communities that are formed.&quot;
And most recently, Amory and her co-host Ben Brock Johnson have been tackling the history of some of the internet&apos;s greatest memes, including Rickrolling, Scumbag Steve, and &quot;Woman Yelling At Cat.&quot;
&quot;A lot of times the image kind of speaks for itself, or at least it brings a vibe that — as long as people put a caption on it — is understandable to you, you can enjoy it and you can pass it on,&quot; Ben says. &quot;But there are multiple layers to memes.&quot;
Today on Follow Friday, Amory and Ben recommend four of their favorite accounts from across the internet: A https://www.youtube.com/c/cnliziqi/videos (cinematic and pastoral YouTube channel) about food in western China; a curated and approachable https://twitter.com/womensart1/ (collection of women&apos;s art) on Twitter; a https://twitter.com/kenyatta (pragmatic meme expert)  who&apos;s making the internet a better place; and a https://www.instagram.com/sheldricktrust/ (Kenyan nonprofit) protecting elephants, rhinos and more. Plus: What are their favorite memes?

Let&apos;s get one thing clear: Despite what some of her podcast critics might claim, Dana Schwartz is not a monarchist. 
&quot;The whole point of http://noblebloodtales.com/ (Noble Blood) is me pointing out that these royals are just normal people,&quot; she says. &quot;I think they&apos;re interesting people because they&apos;ve been given unchecked power often throughout history, but for the record, I don&apos;t think that that&apos;s the best system of government.&quot;
And after telling true stories of various monarchs for years on that podcast, Dana has turned her focus to Hollywood royalty in the new show https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-haileywood-88204299/ (Haileywood). In it, she chronicles Bruce Willis&apos; attempt to remake a small town in Idaho in his own image.
&quot;He wants to be anonymous, but also wants to be famous and have the power of fame, but only on his terms,&quot; she explains. &quot;As a character study, if nothing else, it&apos;s incredibly fascinating.&quot;
Today on Follow Friday, Dana talks about some other incredibly fascinating people, who she follows online: Absurdist comedian https://www.instagram.com/chrisflemingfleming/ (Chris Fleming); author and soothing TikTokker https://www.instagram.com/chrisflemingfleming/ (Victoria Aveyard); writer and comedian https://www.instagram.com/adamhess100/ (Adam Hess); and journalist/podcaster https://twitter.com/rottenindenmark (Michael Hobbes).

When he set out to make a podcast, Emmy-winning writer and TV producer Gavin Purcell thought about the last time he took a chance on a new medium, in the early days of blogging and YouTube.
&quot;I was really interested in Japanese TV,&quot; he says. &quot;YouTube was like this weird wild west where like all this stuff was getting uploaded, and I started paying attention to it. And then I started a blog and the blog got really successful and it almost became like a completely separate part of my life.&quot;
The blog didn&apos;t become his career, but creating it taught Gavin the value of following our passions, because &quot;they will open up so much more in our brains and introduce things that could be something, a bigger part of our lives.&quot; His podcast, https://waytoointerested.com/ (Way Too Interested), unites his friends and celebrity guests — the people who are &quot;way too interested&quot; in a passion or hobby — with experts who can answer all their burning questions about that obsession. 
Today on Follow Friday, Gavin talks about some of the fascinating people he follows online: Writer and poetry lover https://twitter.com/_zeets (Zito Madu); Twitch streamer and &quot;VTuber&quot; https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeMiko/videos (Code Miko); bestselling author and podcaster https://twitter.com/SheaSerrano (Shea Serrano); and NFT artist and educator https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman (Bryan Brinkman).

Samir Mezrahi&apos;s mind is on the gutters — not in the gutter. As the creator of the Instagram account https://www.instagram.com/zillowgonewild/?hl=en (Zillow Gone Wild) and the video series https://instagram.com/celebrityhomeshopping (Celebrity Home Shopping), he&apos;s seen a lot of gaudy McMansions (and proper mansions), which typically haven&apos;t been designed with water removal in mind.
&quot;They just stick out, and so many HOMEies — which is our squad in the show — will send me pictures of terrible gutters they see,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve awoken people to seeing bad gutters in their neighborhoods, around town, everywhere. So people are always sending me pictures or Insta posts or Reels. And it&apos;s always like, &apos;Why are you doing this to me?&apos;&quot;
On today&apos;s episode of Follow Friday, Samir talks about the sort of content he prefers to consume online, including posts from the HGTV stars https://www.hgtv.com/shows/property-brothers (The Property Brothers); Tesla Technoking (that&apos;s his real title) https://twitter.com/elonmusk (Elon Musk); mansion tour guide https://www.youtube.com/c/EnesYilmazer/featured (Enes Yilmazer); and musical comedian https://twitter.com/NickLutsko (Nick Lutsko).

https://poorlydrawnlines.com/ (Poorly Drawn Lines) creator Reza Farazmand thought he knew what to expect when adapting his popular webcomic as an animated TV show. After all, he had seen a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ytZ5DByr4w (documentary) about how South Park gets made.
&quot;That gave me the sense that making an animated show would be this wild process with late nights and a bunch of fast food,&quot; he says. &quot;But it was really more of a slow, gradual process with a lot of emailing and phone calls ... It was a lot slower than I thought, but it was also an extremely gratifying and fun process.&quot;

Some of New York Times writer Kara Swisher&apos;s favorite follows are people she has admired, crushed on, and befriended — and also people she has battled with, debated, and investigated. And that&apos;s no accident.
 &quot;I think people are dying for that in this incredibly partisan time. It&apos;s very hard to reach out to people you disagree with,&quot; she says, explaining why she comes to the table with people whom others might consider unpalatable. Pushing them away, she says, &quot;plays into all the malevolent people who are trying to take us apart.&quot;
Olive branches aside, the https://www.nytimes.com/column/sway (Sway) and https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot (Pivot) host also promises to pull no punches in her forthcoming memoir about covering Silicon Valley as a tech journalist for the Wall Street Journal, AllThingsD, Recode, and now the NYT.
&quot;I&apos;m burning it all down,&quot; she says. &quot;And then I&apos;m like, goodbye ... I have people, the richest people in the world, the most powerful people, [saying] &apos;You&apos;re so mean to me.&apos; I&apos;m like, &apos;Are you 12?&apos;&quot;
In this live episode of Follow Friday, recorded at https://welcometomannys.com/ (Manny&apos;s) in San Francisco, Kara explains what she likes (and, in some cases, hates) about her politically incorrect Pivot podcast co-host https://twitter.com/profgalloway (Scott Galloway); the actor and producer https://twitter.com/gemma_chan (Gemma Chan); Twitter and Square CEO https://twitter.com/jack (Jack Dorsey); newspaper columnist and &quot;Fire and Fury&quot; author https://twitter.com/MichaelWolffNYC (Michael Wolff); and &quot;Full Frontal&quot; host https://twitter.com/FullFrontalSamB (Samantha Bee).

Once upon a time, Dallas Taylor remembers, it was a compliment to call someone an &quot;audiophile.&quot;
&quot;Traditionally, audiophiles have been people who are super into Hi-Fi and putting together great systems. But over time, it turned into, at least the way that I hear it ...  It&apos;s kind of a snobbish thing.&quot;
But he says his &quot;mission,&quot; as professional sound designer and the host of a podcast that celebrates sound design, https://www.20k.org/ (Twenty Thousand Hertz), is to remind people that we are all audiophiles, even if we wouldn&apos;t call ourselves that.
&quot;You don&apos;t need extra permission to think and curate sound around you, just like you don&apos;t have to with all of your other human experiences and core senses.&quot;
And on today&apos;s Follow Friday, Dallas has curated four people he follows who represent his diverse tastes: A https://twitter.com/romanmars (famous design enthusiast) who privately helped him realize the purpose of his show; a https://www.instagram.com/starleekine/ (beloved ex-podcaster) who solved mundane mysteries in beautiful fashion; a https://www.youtube.com/user/melodysheep/videos (filmmaker and composer) who has taken his YouTube viewers to the end of time; and a https://meowwolf.com/ (group of off-the-wall artists) who are redefining the idea of an art installation.

Once upon a time, Dallas Taylor remembers, it was a compliment to call someone an &quot;audiophile.&quot;
&quot;Traditionally, audiophiles have been people who are super into Hi-Fi and putting together great systems. But over time, it turned into, at least the way that I hear it ...  It&apos;s kind of a snobbish thing.&quot;
But he says his &quot;mission,&quot; as professional sound designer and the host of a podcast that celebrates sound design, https://www.20k.org/ (Twenty Thousand Hertz), is to remind people that we are all audiophiles, even if we wouldn&apos;t call ourselves that.
&quot;You don&apos;t need extra permission to think and curate sound around you, just like you don&apos;t have to with all of your other human experiences and core senses.&quot;
And on today&apos;s Follow Friday, Dallas has curated four people he follows who represent his diverse tastes: A https://twitter.com/romanmars (famous design enthusiast) who privately helped him realize the purpose of his show; a https://www.instagram.com/starleekine/ (beloved ex-podcaster) who solved mundane mysteries in beautiful fashion; a https://www.youtube.com/user/melodysheep/videos (filmmaker and composer) who has taken his YouTube viewers to the end of time; and a https://meowwolf.com/ (group of off-the-wall artists) who are redefining the idea of an art installation.

For more than five years, Lindsay Ellis has been producing https://www.youtube.com/c/LindsayEllisVids (video essays on YouTube), analyzing everything from the Transformers movies to Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals to popular tropes in film and TV. 
Last year, after more than a decade of wanting to be an author, she published her first book — the bestselling sci-fi novel https://read.macmillan.com/lp/axioms-end/ (Axiom&apos;s End), which was informed by that same attentiveness to pop culture. After 9/11, she noticed,  popular alien invasion stories had shifted from &quot;goofy&quot; stories to &quot;dead serious&quot; ones, like  Steven Spielberg&apos;s War of the Worlds.
&quot;It&apos;s an alternate history that takes place in the late 2000s,&quot; she says of the first book, which is getting a sequel in October called https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250274540 (Truth of the Divine). &quot;Basically, it&apos;s what if first contact happened during the Bush administration? ... It&apos;s a thought experiment of how would we react if civilization has to keep on trucking the way we have, but now we have this great existential quandary that, at least in the universe of the book, is heavily politicized.&quot;
On today&apos;s podcast, Lindsay talks about four people she loves to follow on YouTube: A https://www.youtube.com/c/ToddintheShadows (pop music analyst) who breaks down one-hit wonders, band-breaking records, and more; a https://www.youtube.com/c/AmandatheJedi/ (prolific video essayist) who wears her enthusiasm on her sleeve; an https://www.youtube.com/c/DisasterBreakdown/ (aviation expert) who explains the history of air disasters; and a https://www.youtube.com/c/DrewGooden1/ (former Vine star) who cooks up brilliant video ideas like it&apos;s nothing.

On March 11, 2020, Dave Jorgenson posted a https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpost/video/6802974155944840453 (TikTok video of himself, dancing in his apartment). That isn&apos;t unusual for TikTok, but it was the first of hundreds he would produce at home while his employer — The Washington Post — tried to protect workers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Over the ensuing months, https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpost? (Dave&apos;s videos) have been a much-needed source of levity and absurdity, often mining the Post&apos;s straight news stories for hidden deposits of humor. The newspaper&apos;s already substantial audience on TikTok has more than doubled in that time, to over one million followers.
&quot;I thought it was going to be a three-week-long thread,&quot; he says, referring to https://twitter.com/davejorgenson/status/1237828994755592195 (the Twitter thread) where he has cross-posted all 727 TikToks (and counting). &quot;Now, we were just told yesterday that we&apos;re not coming back to the office until January, at least ... I have two minds about it. I don&apos;t want to be locked out. I don&apos;t want there to be a pandemic, but there&apos;s a part of me that&apos;s like, &apos;1,000 would be cool.&apos;&quot;
On today&apos;s podcast, Dave talks about a https://www.tiktok.com/@hellotefi (TikTok star and astrology lover) who turns celebrity gossip into exciting stories; a https://twitter.com/petridishes (hilarious Post colleague) who has secretly voiced one of the characters in his TikTok videos; a https://www.instagram.com/nathanwpylestrangeplanet/ (wholesome cartoonist) who has made the leap from internet virality to bestselling books; and a https://twitter.com/RobCesternino (former reality TV contestant) who now leads a podcasting empire.

On today&apos;s podcast, Dave talks about a https://www.tiktok.com/@hellotefi (TikTok star and astrology lover) who turns celebrity gossip into exciting stories; a https://twitter.com/petridishes (hilarious Post colleague) who has secretly voiced one of the characters in his TikTok videos; a https://www.instagram.com/nathanwpylestrangeplanet/ (wholesome cartoonist) who has made the leap from internet virality to bestselling books; and a https://twitter.com/RobCesternino (former reality TV contestant) who now leads a podcasting empire.

Dave Pell calls himself the &quot;managing editor of the internet,&quot; and for good reason: Every weekday, he combs through 75 different news sources and plucks out the 10 most important stories for his popular email newsletter https://nextdraft.com/ (NextDraft).
But it can be hard for anyone — even a voracious news reader — to put the news of the past couple years in context, which is why Pell is about to release a book about the 2020-2021 news cycle called https://nextdraft.com/scream/ (Please Scream Inside Your Heart).
&quot;As I had my friends or proofreaders go over my book, that was the number one response, like, &apos;Oh my God, I can&apos;t believe that happened in 2020. I thought that was another year. I don&apos;t remember that happening.&apos;&quot; he says.
On today&apos;s podcast, Dave talks about four of his favorite accounts to follow: A https://www.theatlantic.com/ (164-year-old magazine) that covered Trump and COVID better than anyone; a https://twitter.com/BillyCorben (self-proclaimed &quot;Florida Man&quot;) who documents the state&apos;s weird news and corrupt government; an https://www.instagram.com/chefjoseandres/ (inspiring celebrity chef) who has fed millions of people after natural disasters; and an https://daringfireball.net/ (old-school tech blogger) who&apos;s never afraid to &quot;shoot from the hip.&quot;

Over the past 18 months, internet culture has become, simply, culture. And one of the top writers documenting and explaining the latest trends is Mashable&apos;s Morgan Sung.
However, as she explained in one of her most-shared pieces — &quot;https://mashable.com/article/bimbo-tiktok-meme-feminism (Bimbos are good, actually)&quot; — Sung also sees the appeal of not being as savvy as she is.
&quot;As someone who&apos;s painfully online, I think if you&apos;re going to have any sort of online presence or even just engage with online culture at all, you&apos;re expected to be on top of the discourse,&quot; she says. &quot;You have to know everything at once. It&apos;s a lot of reading, and sometimes I&apos;m tired.&quot;
On today&apos;s podcast, Sung talks about four of the accounts that have defined the pandemic-era internet for her: A https://twitter.com/bettinamak (food writer and photographer) who understands how class and race intersect with our diets; a https://www.instagram.com/afffirmations/ (Dadaist meme account) that reminds you you&apos;re not crazy; a https://www.tiktok.com/@madeline_pendleton (34-year-old punk) who has become TikTok&apos;s cool aunt; and a https://www.instagram.com/blackforager/ (passionate forager) who wants nature to be celebrated, not avoided.

&quot;The beginning of the research process, it&apos;s like walking into a pitch black room,&quot; says https://www.youtube.com/c/TastingHistory/featured (Tasting History) host Max Miller. &quot;You don&apos;t even know what&apos;s there ... Finally, you click on the light and there&apos;s something interesting. And then it&apos;s like, oh, now I can go down that rabbit hole
Miller&apos;s YouTube channel, which releases new food history videos every Tuesday, has taken him down a lot of interesting rabbit holes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MAB-VVqjOE (Medieval mead), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6XvMKdD2tY (500-year-old pizza), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaYPEvDuo1I (Aztec chocolate), and even https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR7fywQ-vUE (parmesan cheese ice cream) (a must-watch for his reaction to the end-of-episode taste test).
On today&apos;s Follow Friday, he lets us into what he&apos;s watching and listening to in his limited downtime away from the kitchen: A https://www.youtube.com/c/CharlotteDobre/videos (reaction video star) with a knack for schadenfreude;  a https://www.youtube.com/c/vsauce1/videos (charismatic nerd) who answers big questions with energy and science; a https://www.youtube.com/c/EarlyMusicSourcescom/videos (music scholar) who explains the history of the art; and a &quot;boring in a good way&quot; https://www.youtube.com/c/GrahamStephan/videos (finance expert) who taught Miller how to succeed on YouTube.
You can get bonus episodes of Follow Friday every week — including an extra follow recommendation from Max, coming soon — when you https://www.patreon.com/followfriday (back Follow Friday on Patreon), starting at just $1 a month.

As a graphic novelist and cartoonist whose work regularly appears in The New Yorker, https://lianafinck.com/ (Liana Finck) mostly follows other artists and illustrators. But she makes an exception when the person she wants to follow has impeccable taste — and maybe a pet tortoise.
&quot;I feel very embarrassed to like stalk/follow people who aren&apos;t posting, to like peek into their lives,&quot; she says. &quot;I do it with a few people, and then I unfollow them repeatedly because I&apos;m embarrassed ... Instagram is kind of a little bit too close for comfort sometimes.&quot;
On today&apos;s Follow Friday, however, Liana opened up about four of her favorite follows: A https://www.instagram.com/weirdhelga/ (&quot;weird&quot; animator) whose cartoon sketches straddle the line between relatable and absurd; the https://www.instagram.com/hanyayanagihara/ (stylish editor in chief) of a prominent magazine; a https://www.instagram.com/lord_birthday/ (poet and artist) who calls Liana his &quot;Insta-foe&quot;; and a https://www.instagram.com/na_son/ (book cover designer) who can seemingly do everything.

&quot;One of my principles is that putting too much effort into things makes them funnier.&quot;
So says Alasdair Beckett-King, an award-winning comedian whose videos on YouTube and Twitter have repeatedly gone viral over the past year.

&quot;People keep saying, &apos;When are you doing Captain Picard again?&apos;&quot; he says on today&apos;s Follow Friday. &quot;And I&apos;m like, &apos;I&apos;m not!&apos; Because it took ages to do the bald head, and you&apos;ve seen it now.&quot;

Craven Moorhaus and Zak Koonce owe it all to Bane. Craven, an audio designer, and Koonce, a comedy writer, teamed up as the https://www.youtube.com/c/Auralnauts/videos (Auralnauts) in 2012 to dub over scenes from The Dark Knight Rises.
&quot;Because [Bane] had a mask on, and you could make him say https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkMPZ7WeDck (whatever we wanted), so we just changed the context of everything that was happening and we turned him into this weird fitness freak,&quot; Koonce says. &quot;And then he just raps to this audience who is clearly not expecting it, and is not into it.&quot;
Nine years later and 300,000 subscribers later, they&apos;ve made dozens of videos dubbing over https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-oK9mnTbyI (TV commercials), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAmyZP-qbTE (Boston Dynamics&apos; robot tests), and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU_Jdts5rL0 (many), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjuLcceCm-U (many) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSCm8yAxBr8 (Star Wars movies). On today&apos;s Follow Friday, the Auralnauts talk about four great accounts they follow online: A https://www.youtube.com/c/PopCultureDetectiveAgency/videos (YouTube essayist) who unpacks the hidden layers of pop culture; &quot;the https://twitter.com/Michael1979 (most wholesome troll) that exists in the world&quot;; a https://www.youtube.com/c/FredsVoice/videos (dorky ASMR expert) with a &quot;connected universe&quot; of characters; and an https://www.instagram.com/catatonicyouths/ (Instagram account) that curates &quot;so bad, it&apos;s so good&quot; music.

Today on Follow Friday, Freddie talks with Eric Johnson about why TikTok is funnier than any other social media app, a &quot;terrifying&quot; realization he had recently on Reddit, and four great accounts he follows online: A https://www.tiktok.com/@its557am (fascinating TikTokker) who appears to be able to float; an https://www.youtube.com/c/shiey/videos (anonymous travel vlogger) who believes in &quot;illegal freedom&quot;; the https://www.youtube.com/c/Worthikids/videos (most exciting animator) on the internet right now; and a brilliant https://www.youtube.com/user/MrChiCity3/videos (old-school YouTuber) whose original videos are now a kind of time capsule.
And you can get a fifth follow recommendation from Freddie — as well as https://followfridaypodcast.com/ann-reardon (Ann Reardon), https://followfridaypodcast.com/mark-chrisler (Mark Chrisler), and our future guests — when you https://www.patreon.com/followfriday (back Follow Friday on Patreon), starting at just $1 a month.

On https://www.constantpodcast.com/ (The Constant), Mark Chrisler chronicles &quot;a history of getting things wrong&quot; — the many ways that humans have misunderstood the world, or misled others about it. Over the past 100 (!) episodes, Mark&apos;s topics have ranged from death rays to forensic science to a submarine that was discovered at the bottom of the Chicago River. 
Today on Follow Friday, Mark talks about his years-long podcast feud with the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, his love/hate feelings about a https://twitter.com/Gladwell (prominent public intellectual), the https://twitter.com/JustinMcElroy (McElroy brother) he wants to be friends with, a https://twitter.com/frootoftheloom1 (fun Twitter account) documenting the &quot;Mandela effect,&quot; and a https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkBrownGMT (YouTube essayist) shaping the way we talk about video games.
And you can get a fifth follow recommendation from Mark later today if you https://www.patreon.com/followfriday (back Follow Friday on Patreon), starting at just $1 a month. Special thanks to our patrons of the week: Jon and Justin!

On her YouTube channel How to Cook That, Ann Reardon has shown viewers how to make desserts like an https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owmmCfKYZL4 (iPad cake), a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBoRfprAu-8 (giant Kit Kat bar), and even a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4sWHjzI9tQ (chocolate book). But she&apos;s also well-known for https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPT0YU_0VLHxJMqHBC2_OMTYWwQ5z_iP4 (debunking viral food videos) that purport to show amazing life-hacks, and are often just disinformation. 
&quot;If your end goal is simply to get the most views so that you get a bonus, then making up stuff that doesn&apos;t actually work is really not an issue,&quot; she says. &quot;If that&apos;s your mindset, then it&apos;s quite a dangerous world, really.&quot;
Today on Follow Friday, Ann talks about the debunking series, her new cookbook https://www.howtocookthat.net/public_html/cook-crazy-sweet-creations-cookbook-ann-reardon/ (Crazy Sweet Creations), and  four fascinating people she follows: A https://www.instagram.com/amauryguichon/ (chocolate sculptor) whose creations look completely real; a https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkRober/videos (former NASA engineer) who has turned squirrel mazes and glitterbombs into YouTube stardom; a https://www.youtube.com/c/TheBiteShot/videos (food photographer) who can teach you how to take better photos with just your phone; and a https://mastersofscale.com/ (Silicon Valley investor) whose podcast unlocks the secrets of business success.

If you want to know what&apos;s going to win an Oscar in a couple years, you should talk to film and TV producer Franklin Leonard. Since 2005, he and his team at https://blcklst.com/ (The Black List) have circulated an annual list of the best screenplays floating around Hollywood that haven&apos;t yet been made into movies. But films that make it to the Black List — such as Argo, The King&apos;s Speech, and Promising Young Woman — often find later success.
When he&apos;s not making movies or helping screenwriters win trophies, however, Franklin is a soccer obsessive, a student of history, and a leader trying to educate himself about good allyship.

Washington Post humorist and avowed pun enthusiast Alexandra Petri writes columns with headlines like, &quot;Are you a https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/01/are-you-brood-x-cicada-or-just-someone-emerging-pandemic-isolation/ (Brood X cicada), or just someone emerging from pandemic isolation?&quot;; &quot;We must get https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/09/we-must-get-everyone-america-yacht-protect-them-gun-violence/ (everyone in America a yacht) to protect them from gun violence!&quot;; and &quot;I do not wish to learn anything more about https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/05/19/jan-6-commission-republicans-wealthy-husband-near-death/ (my wealthy husband&apos;s near demise) (which would have been sad).&quot;
Her interests extend far beyond comedy and wordplay, however. Today on Follow Friday, she talks about being a diehard fan of newspaper comics, what she learned from visiting a UFO convention, why philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a &quot;nightmare person,&quot; and more.
Alexandra also talks with Eric Johnson about four people she follows online: A self-proclaimed https://joshreads.com/ (&quot;comics curmudgeon&quot;) who has hot takes about Mark Trail and Mary Worth; an https://twitter.com/AstroKatie (astrophysicist) studying how the universe might suddenly end (whatever!); a https://www.youtube.com/user/Aylingater77 (mysterious YouTuber) who reads creepy stories from Wikipedia and Reddit; and a https://twitter.com/meakoopa (literature phD) who also celebrates trashy movies like 2019&apos;s &quot;Cats.&quot;

When he&apos;s not writing about the media and running a PR agency, Ed Zitron is probably on Twitter, where he&apos;s curated a perfect experience for himself: He follows fascinating people who represent what he cares about, and aggressively mutes what he doesn&apos;t care for, including words like &quot;doge,&quot; &quot;stonk,&quot; and &quot;Gamestop.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s a melting pot of crap, just like my brain,&quot; he says.
On today&apos;s show, Ed puts talks about four of his favorite accounts on Twitter: A https://twitter.com/PitchingNinja (baseball analyst) who seems like a genuinely fun person to hang out with; a https://twitter.com/hokucurnan (talented videographer) who makes cool stuff look cooler; a https://twitter.com/drewtoothpaste (musician/webcomic artist) who might kick your ass (at the right place and right time); and a https://twitter.com/greengiant_es (corporate account) that posted the greatest tweet in the history of Twitter.

When he&apos;s not writing about the media and running a PR agency, Ed Zitron is probably on Twitter, where he&apos;s curated a perfect experience for himself: He follows fascinating people who represent what he cares about, and aggressively mutes what he doesn&apos;t care for, including words like &quot;doge,&quot; &quot;stonk,&quot; and &quot;Gamestop.&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s a melting pot of crap, just like my brain,&quot; he says.

On today&apos;s show, Ed puts talks about four of his favorite accounts on Twitter: A baseball analyst who seems like a genuinely fun person to hang out with; a talented videographer who makes cool stuff look cooler; a musician/webcomic artist who might kick your ass (at the right place and right time); and a corporate account that posted the greatest tweet in the history of Twitter.

On the podcast they co-host, https://underunderstood.com/podcast/ (Underunderstood), journalists Adrianne Jeffries and Regina Dellea answer the questions that you can&apos;t resolve with a simple Google search. For example: Why does everyone in Japan attribute this one quote to https://underunderstood.com/podcast/episode/snoopy-in-japan/ (Snoopy from Peanuts)? Are America&apos;s https://underunderstood.com/podcast/episode/area-code-conspiracy-theory/ (telephone area codes) all part of a big conspiracy? And why did people all over the US receive https://underunderstood.com/podcast/episode/closing-the-loop-on-chinas-mystery-seeds/ (&quot;mystery seeds&quot; in the mail) from China last year?
But when they&apos;re not solving mysteries, Adrianne and Regina have been spending a lot of time on TikTok recently, so they went all-in for today&apos;s episode of Follow Friday: Four accounts they love on TikTok, including a https://www.tiktok.com/@burr_iamcomedy? (comedian and her dorky husband); a polymath who also https://www.tiktok.com/@cyberexboyfriend? (roasts McMansions); a trans musician and https://www.tiktok.com/@leftatlondon?

He also shares his complicated feelings about representation in Hollywood, what a YouTuber has taught him about the future of entertainment, why food and sports writing matter, and which chat podcast in particular he got hooked on recently.
