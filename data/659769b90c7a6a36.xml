Hana and Leila explore the phrase with writer Patia Braithwaite who writes, ‘Black don’t crack is stressing me out.’  We also Stoop it with Dr. Michelle Henry, a dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon who explains what really happens to our skin as we age, and what she’s seeing when it comes to her Black patients.

        <![CDATA[<p>We’re Stoopin it in Australia and meet Indigenous journalist Rhianna Patrick as she navigates this question- why do I call myself ‘Black’?<br>
Rhianna takes us along as she unpacks what Blackness means Down Under. It’s complicated, and we meet people along the way who help her navigate this question. Dr. Jackie Huggins digs into the history of Indigenous peoples’ relation to Blackness, artist/journalist Daniel Browning explains why some young Indigenous people are identifying as ’Blak’- without the ‘C’, and Aurora Liddle Christie ponders her Jamaican-Indigenous Australian roots. Will Rhianna get any closer to understanding her use of the term ‘Black’?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Angelica Lindsey-Ali is known to tens of thousands of Muslims worldwide  as The Village Auntie. She’s a Black American Muslim therapist, wellness educator, public health professional and-  sexpert. Through her platforms, she advises Muslim women on how to tap in to their femininity. She teaches them about arousal and erotic dance, and says female sexual pleasure is a neglected part of Muslim teachings, and a sacred act of worship that’s rooted in ancestral African ritual and practice.<br>
We meet Angelica, we hear how she came to this work, what she learned along the way- and the trauma, trolling, and anti-Blackness that almost led her to abandon it all.<br>

        <![CDATA[<p>Imagine you were gifted a home, in Ghana. It’s your motherland, but not the place you grew up in. Would you move? That decision proved to be one of the most challenging ones that Afia had to make. She documented some of the most difficult conversations, honest observations and some self reflection that has us asking- should Afia be telling us all of this? Yes she should, she did- and you should hear it.<br>
Today we share with you an episode of the Peabody nominated S***hole Country.</p>]]>

Not 1st gen like her mom- they're more attached to their home countries. Not 2nd gen like her kids- they're settled in their Americanness. She's caught in the middle- and it's weighing on her.

        <![CDATA[<p>U.S. media companies are producing new glitzy reality TV shows in Africa. It’s a different kind of portrayal of Africa - something Hana has always wanted: a change in the narrative of poverty, war and famine. But something doesn’t feel quite right. She’s trying to just get her popcorn and enjoy the drama and messiness, but she’s conflicted and she’s wondering why. She talks it out with Nigerian writer Damilola Oyedele - someone else who is watching, and thinking at the same time. Plus, we go to Lagos, Nigeria- to hear how people there are reacting there.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode we meet Deborah from Brooklyn, who’s about to pack her bags and move to  Paris. It's a place she’s always adored, along with the likes of other famous African Americans; Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and Josephine Baker to name of few. Many black Americans have moved there for a particular reason, many were exhausted by the racial dynamics and conversations in the U.S. , just like Deborah,  who feels these are conversations that go in circles. France has prided itself on its citizens being “French” before identifying with an ethnicity and this is something that appealed to Deborah who’s chosen not to “lead with her blackness”. In this episode we go to France to talk about how black people are identifying and discuss some of the tensions behind a word like “noir” that can be seen as an insult for some and pure pride for others.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[Bonjour! Meet Deborah from Brooklyn, who’s  about to pack her bags and move to Paris.  It's a city she adores but it's  also a refuge from a lot of  racial conversations that she feels are going in circles in the U.S.  Deborah choses not to “lead with her blackness,"  but how will that work for her in France? How are  black French identifying?  We go to Paris and dig deeper into some of the tensions behind a word like “noir” that can be seen as an insult for some and pure pride for others.]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Why might things be different for a Black introvert? When writer Sequoia Holmes broke it down in her essay "Black Women aren't allowed to be Introverted"  we wanted to stoop this out some more. So we sent our introverted producer Jessica Jupiter out to find answers. In this episode we're digging  into how it can be different to be an introvert while Black. We also hear from nonprofit organizer and educator <em>Kelly Wickham Hurst</em> who has focused on correcting the ways we treat introverted Black students.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Season 4 is here! In this episode we're talking about Black folk and water. Yes, swimming.  We hear from a man who nearly lost his life while on vacation, and take a deeper look into our relationship to swimming. There are a lot  of jokes and myths within our community about why we don’t swim more, but what isn't funny is that nearly 70% of African American kids don't know how to swim. Today, we break down stereotypes that we've even heard our own family members reinforce. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>What’s a sound that embodies blackness? In this episode we ask around and then get deeper into conversation with Glory Edim, the founder of Well Read Black Girl, a Brooklyn based book club and online community. What’s it mean to be well read? This special Stoop episode was recorded live at WNYC's The GreenSpace, and goes deeper into conversations about what it means to return to Africa, how to create inclusive community, and really, how black are we?</p>]]>

In this episode we talk to interracial couples having difficult conversations around race, love and identity at a time when racial tensions are high. We also hear from Professor Shantel Buggs author of the study ‘Dating in the Time of #BlackLivesMatter’, who interviewed dozens of women to see whether awareness of racial issues mattered when they were choosing a partner, asking how socially aware do  you expect your non-Black partner to be?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>We end this season by going deep into how we express ourselves at the intersection where spirituality meets artistic expression - and how that intersection can be complicated. </p>

<p>We meet <a href="https://aliasharrief.bandcamp.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alia Sharrief</a>- a Black Muslim woman hip hop artist who raps about her faith, Black girl magic, and social justice - despite the haters.</p>

<p>And Leila takes us to an Afro-Cuban dance class to get in touch with the Orisha, and has some questions about others, that lead to questioning herself. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>When Oprah's longtime hairstylist Andre Walker created the hair typing system, he didn't expect it to become what it is today.  The chart has helped a lot of Black naturals understand their textures but it's also created some tensions when it comes to the lack of  representation of 4C women. From our hair history, to  hair salons, and a chat with Mr. Walker himself--we get to the bottom of why some people feel tangled up in this hair chart. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>"It's not hard for a black man of my caliber to say I love you."</p>

<p>But is it? </p>

<p>Many black people say they never heard I love you much growing up, including both Leila and Hana, hosts of The Stoop. In Episodes 2, we examine the reasons why we don't hear I love you, and what that means. We talk to inmates at San Quentin state prison, a professor who studies black male emotional expression, and Stooptalk with Al Letson about I love you in his home.</p>

<p>Did you hear I love you growing up? #blacklove #blackfamilies</p>

In Episodes 2, we examine the reasons why we don't hear I love you, what it means, and whether it's changing today.

        <![CDATA[<p>"It's not hard for a black man of my caliber to say I love you."</p>

<p>But is it? </p>

<p>Many black people say they never heard I love you much growing up, including both Leila and Hana, hosts of The Stoop. In Episodes 2, we examine the reasons why we don't hear I love you, and what that means. We talk to inmates at San Quentin state prison, a professor who studies black male emotional expression, and Stooptalk with Al Letson about I love you in his home.</p>

<p>Did you hear I love you growing up? #blacklove #blackfamilies</p>
