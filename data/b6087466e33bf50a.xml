claiming responsibility and warning the Chinese that Beijing must end its projects in Pakistan.</p><p>The attack is the latest against Chinese interests and while aimed at a seemingly irrelevant target a considerable distance from major projects, it is related to ongoing economic instability that recently forced the government in Islamabad to seek an IMF bailout package that illustrates the failure of China&#8217;s near-US$60 billion investment in the massive China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to generate any meaningful growth.</p><p>While the IMF&#8217;s &#8220;timely intervention&#8221; has helped Pakistan avoid bankruptcy, there is little denying that, according to leading politicians who spoke with Asia Sentinel on numerous occasions, the CPEC, which includes the Gwadar deep sea port, numerous energy projects, modern transportation links all the way to China and several special economic zones, in addition to its failure to drive growth is driving conflict in Pakistan in major part because it has saddled Pakistan with enormous debt, largely employed Chinese construction workers and reserved the deep-sea&nbsp;port for Chinese use while barring Pakistani fishing vessels all the while providing little benefit to Pakistan.</p><p>The continuing problems in turning around the project constitute a blow for both China and Pakistan. China muscled India out of the way to build the Gwadar port. It is considered a major linchpin &#8211; envisioned as arguably the most prestigious &#8211; in China&#8217;s trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative, providing transport links to China&#8217;s western border nearly 6,000 km away.</p><p>In many ways, the emergence of a militant group in Sindh, which is otherwise considered to be the land of the Sufi, a pacifist and pluralistic Islamic tradition, is an outcome of the ways the CPEC&#8217;s implementation has been designed in ways to cater to China&#8217;s needs first and foremost.</p><p>This exclusionary model of development not only explains anti-China militancy but also shows why different militant groups are in fact coming together for cross-ethnic alliances against both Islamabad and Beijing. As has been extensively reported in the Pakistani media, the SPA is allied with Baloch militant-nationalist groups, with the latter providing logistical support to the former to launch attacks.</p><p>In November 2018, a Baloch National Freedom Movement (BRAS) was launched. BRAS includes three groups, which were until recently rivals and competed with each other for influence. But the China factor has allowed these groups to close their ranks and develop a united front. BRAS includes Balochistan Liberation Army, Balochistan Liberation Front, and Baloch Republican Guards.</p><p>In the recent past, Baloch groups have launched many attacks, including a suicide attack on Chinese teachers in Karachi (Sindh province) in April 2022. While not directly related to these nationalist groups, Chinese interests have also been attacked many times in the recent past by the banned <em>Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan </em>(TTP).</p><p>Even though the TTP and groups like BRAS and SPA are not allies, all seek a similar end i.e., weakening the Pakistan state and driving China out of the country. Analysts believe that a <em>de facto </em>alliance between these groups cannot be ruled out completely, now that the TTP is back in Pakistan and has re-emerged as a player in Pakistan&#8217;s Swat valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). It also implies that China and CPEC are not welcome in three of Pakistan&#8217;s four provinces.</p><p><strong>&#8216;Soft Targets&#8217;</strong></p><p>Even though the CPEC is facing a religious and nationalist onslaught, Beijing continues to operate in Pakistan, ostensibly without fear. One of the key reasons for China&#8217;s continued optimism is that these groups have not been able to target any major Chinese establishments or infrastructure in Pakistan. They don&#8217;t have the capacity to launch major attacks and can attack only soft targets, such as teachers and doctors based in Pakistan and those not directly working on the project.</p><p>There is little denying, however, that the Pakistan state has been taking steps for quite some time to beef up security for the Chinese. The Pakistan military has even sealed-off the Gwadar port, which is on lease to the Chinese for 40 years since 2017x, and that a special CPEC security division was raised to ensure security. These steps have had the effect of protecting major Chinese projects.</p><p>Having said that, there is no denying that these security steps cannot by themselves prevent groups like SPA to emerge and target Chinese nationals.</p><p>Even if they are soft targets, the impact remains &#8216;hard&#8217; insofar as it tends to create panic. Following the suicide attack in April 2022, Pakistani media reports indicated many Chinese leaving Pakistan on the first available flights.</p><p>Although Pakistan tried to downplay the significance of this Chinese exodus, reports have also indicated how even these attacks on soft targets have eroded Beijing&#8217;s confidence in Pakistan&#8217;s security system, leading China to contemplate the possibility of deploying, covertly or overtly, their own security agencies in Pakistan to look after the security of their nationals.</p><p>But, even if such a step is taken, it is unlikely to prevent groups like BRAS and SPA from operating. Besides, Islamabad has refused to entertain Beijing&#8217;s request for a Chinese company to operate in Pakistan.</p><p>As an alternative, China has been talking to some &#8216;moderate&#8217; nationalists in Balochistan and Sindh and offering scholarships to the students of these impoverished regions to create a &#8216;soft&#8217; and &#8216;benevolent&#8217; image of itself.</p><p>But these steps are unlikely to change the way the CPEC is viewed by these groups. Specifically, they view the whole CPEC model as flawed. Even though it is a national project and even though all provinces are stakeholders, Pakistan has not been managing this project through the Council of Common Interests (CCI), a constitutional body which includes both Islamabad and all provinces and is empowered to make policy on common national matters.</p><p>Beijing, again, has played a role in it, as Asia Sentinel has learned from multiple Pakistani sources. In fact, Beijing has been trying to convince Islamabad, since 2015, to get rid of the 18th Constitutional amendment of 2010 to end provincial autonomy and make provincial powers and provincial stakes irrelevant for the &#8220;greater good&#8221; of development. Beijing&#8217;s preference for dealing with one center i.e., Islamabad, has created more resentment than development in the provinces.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[HK

media tycoon Jimmy Lai in a Hong Kong district court is that, clearly, the government had to search long and hard for a crime to fit whatever punishment is in store for the 74-year-old Lai.</p><p>The most important element that has separated Hong Kong from China and made it the home of thousands of multinational corporations and financial institutions has been its philosophy of hewing to the rule of law. That is now in danger.</p><p>The court convicted Lai on two counts of fraud for allegedly violating the lease on his corporate headquarters by subletting part of the office space in the building that housed his media outlet <em>Apple Daily</em> to another of his own companies. District Court Judge Stanley Chan Kwong-chi said the firm&#8217;s business didn&#8217;t conform with the lease agreement and that Lai had hidden the fact the company was using space in the building.</p><p>The lease violation is a minor common offense, with businesses routinely operating without legal authorization in premises and flats in industrial zones without prosecution, even for breach of tenancy, let alone fraud. In an effort to put Lai and Apple Daily out of business, authorities clearly were searching for an offense.</p><p>A more astonishing example concerned a case reported by the Hong Kong Free Press, one of the few independent publications left in the city, on the same day. After the High Court rejected a government effort to invalidate vaccination exceptions given by a liberal-minded doctor on the grounds that the government didn&#8217;t have the power to do so, officials simply announced a law change effective immediately even though it hadn&#8217;t been debated, let alone given the legislative rubber stamp by a Legislative Council that no longer has an opposition.</p><p>The implications of that action for the corporations and financial institutions domiciled in the city, making it the financial hub of Asia, are disturbing, to say the least. If the government can no longer be trusted to follow its own laws in a relatively minor case involving vaccine exemptions, it is concerning what happens when the stakes rise exponentially.</p><p>As to Lai&#8217;s conviction, with a sentence yet to be pronounced, it was preordained from the time he was arrested in January 2020. He has already <a href="https://cpj.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ad2c1e7bfaa1357bb4387b58&amp;id=0878780992&amp;e=26dd312665">served</a>&nbsp;a 20-month prison term for two other charges relating to his alleged involvement with unauthorized demonstrations that shook the city periodically from 2014 with the onset of the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement. He is&nbsp;<a href="https://cpj.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ad2c1e7bfaa1357bb4387b58&amp;id=785b98ef02&amp;e=26dd312665">awaiting trial</a>&nbsp;on national security charges, for which he faces life imprisonment with proceedings expected to begin on December 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Realistically, given the political situation in China with its unforgiving attitude toward what Beijing considers an ungrateful and rebellious city, Lai, who made a fortune with the Giordano clothing line before being forced to divest the company after insulting Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, may never be freed. Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who last week won effective lifetime tenure, has little sympathy for either Lai or Hong Kong&#8217;s recalcitrant citizens.</p><p>What has happened to Lai, whose arrest along with other Apple Daily executives and the closure of the paper was condemned months earlier by US President Joe Biden and European Union officials, is in large measure what has happened to Hong Kong, once one of the most vibrant cities in Asia if not the world. Some 47 former elected legislators and activists remain in jail, charged under the National Security Law with &#8220;conspiracy to commit subversion&#8221; for what their supporters say were peaceful political activities. Five of the defendants have been charged with being &#8220;major organizers,&#8221; which suggests possible sentences of up to life in prison. Although 29 agreed to plead guilty weeks ago, hoping for lighter sentences, sentencing has been delayed until at least November.</p><p>The city has also been badly crippled by its zero-tolerance approach to the Covid-19 coronavirus, with harsh quarantines that have driven many executives to leave the city for Singapore and other locations, as officials have kowtowed to Beijing and Xi&#8217;s crippling restrictions, which have shaved a considerable amount off of China&#8217;s GDP as production linkages and supply chains have taken the brunt of the restrictions.</p><p><strong>Speedy dismantling of Next Media</strong></p><p>As to Lai&#8217;s Next Media, what was perhaps unexpected was the speed with which one of Hong Kong&#8217;s most popular media empires was dismantled and removed from the city without a trace. On June 18, 2021, the brash 26-year-old Apple Daily broadsheet had a paid circulation of 86,000, with its website the second most-used among online news media in the city.</p><p>According to a survey conducted by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>,&nbsp;Apple Daily&nbsp;was the third most trusted paid newspaper in 2019, only marginally behind the English-language South China Morning Post and the Chinese-language Ming Pao. A week later, it was effectively gone.</p><p>Hong Kong authorities used the national security law to raid the paper with hundreds of police and to freeze the company assets as well as Lai&#8217;s own properties. Unable to pay salaries or its other bills, the paper published its final edition five days later on June 24, with supporters lined up for blocks to buy the final print edition of a million copies. In addition to Lai, six former Apple Daily staff members were detained and face life imprisonment under similar charges.&nbsp;</p><p>International press watchdog organizations condemned the conviction, with the Committee to Protect Journalists issuing a statement by CPJ President Jodie Ginsberg in New York saying the verdict &#8220;shows that Hong Kong will stop at nothing to silence one of its fiercest media critics. Lai is clearly being targeted for his journalism, and the persecution must stop. Hong Kong authorities should let Lai go free and drop all charges against him.&#8221; In 2021, Lai&nbsp;<a href="https://cpj.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ad2c1e7bfaa1357bb4387b58&amp;id=3c2bb61226&amp;e=26dd312665">received&nbsp;</a>CPJ&#8217;s Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award in recognition of his extraordinary and sustained commitment to press freedom.</p><p>The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) launched a petition calling on the Hong Kong authorities to urgently release Lai, a 2020 laureate of RSF&#8217;s Press Freedom Prize, and his six collaborators, who are accused of national security-related crimes and face a life sentence. Lai, said RSF East Asia Bureau Head Cedric Alviani urged the international community to&nbsp;&#8220;increase the pressure to secure Lai&#8217;s release, alongside his collaborators and all other press freedom defenders detained in Hong Kong and in the Mainland.&#8221;</p><p>CPJ called China the&nbsp;<a href="https://cpj.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ad2c1e7bfaa1357bb4387b58&amp;id=9a596443f6&amp;e=26dd312665">world&#8217;s worst jailer of journalists</a>&nbsp;in 2021, according to CPJ&#8217;s December 1&nbsp;<a href="https://cpj.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ad2c1e7bfaa1357bb4387b58&amp;id=101a58d96c&amp;e=26dd312665">prison census</a>.

former Chinese President Hu Jintao allies without his knowledge, leading to Hu&#8217;s removal from the closing ceremony of the 20th Communist Party Congress, according to two sources.</p><p>The public ejection on television of the 79-year-old former president from the head table, apparently against his will, caused shock waves in international circles as a demonstration of Chinese leader Xi Jinping&#8217;s raw power. While foreign media were allowed to broadcast the incident, the video footage of Hu&#8217;s removal was censored in Chinese media and social media.</p><p>Although officials attempted to downplay Hu&#8217;s abrupt departure as due to health issues, unofficial <a href="https://twitter.com/Doranimated/status/1584724117202341888?s=20&amp;t=Qmb1FwpJzfWm64a6KMioMg">video made public here</a> made it clear it was against Hu&#8217;s wishes.</p><p>The earlier standing committee list of the handful of the most powerful Chinese leaders governing the country included at least one person allied with Hu, but the final list of the seven members of the committee dropped any Hu prot&#233;g&#233;, said these sources.</p><p>The new Politburo Standing Committee, unveiled on October 23, consisted of Xi and six other men who were all Xi&#8217;s loyalists, Asia Sentinel <a href="https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/hu-jintao-ejection-highlights-xi-jinping-power">reported</a> on October 23. The week-long congress ended with Xi getting an unprecedented third term as Chinese president, while his predecessors Hu and Jiang Zemin had served only two, according to the two-term limit laid down by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.</p><p>&#8220;It seems pretty clear that the final list was not the list of names Hu had been led to expect, which suggests he thought he had a deal that there would be one or two Youth League names in the standing committee,&#8221; said one of the sources. The Communist Youth League is Hu&#8217;s faction.</p><p>Xi substituted his own list of the Politburo Standing Committee at the last minute, denying Hu any chance to oppose it in the closing ceremony of the congress, the source added. &#8220;Hence Hu&#8217;s removal from the open session, in case he said anything.&#8221;</p><p>Hu was escorted out of the closing ceremony of the congress on October 22, Asia Sentinel <a href="https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/hu-jintao-ejection-highlights-xi-jinping-power">reported</a> on October 23. The video of the moment just before Hu was taken away showed Li Zhanshu, seated next to Hu, taking away a red document from Hu while talking to him. Li was a member of the previous Politburo Standing Committee but not the latest committee.</p><p>Then Xi, who was seated on the other side next to Hu, gave instructions to what appeared to be an aide.</p><p>The man, holding a red document, and another person then escorted Hu out. Hu was seen in the video trying to get hold of the document in the man&#8217;s hands and having a prolonged discussion with the two men, indicating his reluctance to leave. It is unclear whether the red document held by the aide was the same document which Hu initially possessed.</p><p>Peter Humphrey, a British analyst, commented on the video on Linkedin on October 25: &#8220;It is very clear in these photos that Xi was personally calling the shots during this ugly incident when Xi personally called in his goons to purge Mr. Hu from the conference room in classic Stalinist style and (Li) on his left was trying to prevent Hu from using a document folder on the table in front of the elderly cadre. Hu was clearly about to do something that Xi jumped in to prevent.&#8221;</p><p>Humphrey previously ran a risk consultancy in Shanghai, was jailed in China and now lives in the UK.</p><p>&#8220;I think one of the key reasons for Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao to be removed from the conference was that he withheld applause for Xi in order to express disapproval of Xi's power grab throughout the 'congress', while everybody else obsequiously and fearfully clapped,&#8221; said Humphrey on Linkedin on October 24.</p><p>&#8220;And Hu was seated right next to Xi, so his protest was very obvious, and Xi would inevitably take offense.&#8221;</p><p>In the video, Hu looked tired and dazed, giving credence to the explanation in Chinese state media that the 79-year-old was unwell and taken to an adjacent room to recover. However, evidence in another video suggests ill health could not be the only reason that the former president was taken away from the congress. According to this other <a href="https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/1583782347245166592?s=20&amp;t=Qmb1FwpJzfWm64a6KMioMg">video</a>, everybody else at the congress, except for Li, ignored Hu while he was escorted out.</p><p>Normally, if an important person suddenly suffered ill health in a meeting, many people would react in surprise and try to help him. For example, when Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong fainted during a speech on August 21, 2016, several people rushed to Lee&#8217;s assistance.</p><p>Moreover, if an attendee at a meeting suffered from ill health, doctors and nurses would normally attend to him. Instead, one of the two men who took Hu away was Kong Shaoxun, deputy director of the general office of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, a holder of a political office, <a href="https://twitter.com/dakekang/status/1583807633588654080?s=20&amp;t=z2mpGZAabapNlXColB80rQ">tweeted</a> Dake Kang, an AP journalist, on October 22.</p><p><strong>Hu Jintao&#8217;s prot&#233;g&#233; demoted</strong></p><p>One of Hu Jintao&#8217;s proteges who failed to make it to the new Politburo Standing Committee was deputy prime minister Hu Chunhua (no relation to Hu Jintao). Previously, there was speculation that Chunhua would be promoted to prime minister, which would have guaranteed him a place in the standing committee. Instead, Chunhua lost his place in the Politburo, the government body below the Politburo Standing Committee, which means he has been demoted.</p><p>Hu Chunhua was once seen as a possible successor to Xi. If Xi had stepped down this year in accordance with Deng&#8217;s two-term rule, Chunhua could possibly have succeeded him, an analyst told Asia Sentinel. The analyst recalled that in 2008, he told a Chinese intelligence officer that he thought Hu Chunhua would be the next president after Xi. The Chinese intelligence officer replied, &#8220;Very perceptive, your understanding of our system is good.&#8221;</p><p>The previous Politburo Standing Committee included two of Hu Jintao&#8217;s allies, prime minister Li Keqiang and Wang Yang, chairman of the national committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference. Both are due to retire.</p><p>&#8220;Outgoing premier Li Keqiang, the stalwart of the Communist Youth League faction, recently remarked that &#8220;the waters of the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers won&#8217;t flow backwards.&#8221; The comment was seen as a rebuke of Xi&#8217;s statist policies,&#8221; said Enodo Economics, a UK research house focusing on China&#8217;s economy.</p><p>&#8220;But Li&#8217;s preferred candidate for premier, Hu Chunhua, didn&#8217;t make it onto the PBSC (Politburo Standing Committee), leaving the moderates without a standard-bearer,&#8221; Enodo added.</p><p>&#8220;President Xi&#8217;s overwhelming victory at the 20th Party Congress ensures that most of his conservative, quasi-Maoist economic and political policies, including an ironclad Covid lockdown policy, will endure for the foreseeable future,&#8221; Enodo forecast.</p><p>So far, Hu Jintao has not been purged, as old articles mentioning him are still available on Chinese state media websites.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Onetime Colony’s Offspring Produce New UK Leaders]]></title><description><![CDATA[Britain hopes he is the strong ethical and efficient leader it needs]]></description><link>https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/uk-first-non-white-premier-rishi-sunak</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/uk-first-non-white-premier-rishi-sunak</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 11:31:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>By: John Elliott</h5><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg" width="1024" height="682" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:682,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:130331,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35e38e95-fadc-4ebb-b59c-4c56e3265d82_1024x682.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see what an intelligent, young, multi-cultural, economics-fluent leader can do for us,&#8221; said a source who is in his 40s, when it was clear that Rishi Sunak, 42, would become Britain&#8217;s third prime minister this year, the youngest for decades, and the first non-white occupant of 10 Downing Street.</p><p>Of Indian descent with a Punjabi family that emigrated first to Kenya and then the UK, Sunak is also the first Hindu prime minister &#8211; and the first to have worked for Goldman Sachs and have an MBA.</p><p>The news that he had won was officially announced at 2 pm London time yesterday &#8211; 6.30 pm in India where it added to the celebrations as colored lights were lit and firecrackers noisily let off across the country to mark the big annual festival of Diwali. As happened when Kamala Harris became America&#8217;s vice president, Sunak&#8217;s rise is seen as proof of India&#8217;s growing importance internationally.</p><p>Narendra&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-congratulatory-message-to-rishi-sunak-pm-modi-talks-roadmap-2030-3459460">Modi, India&#8217;s prime minister, tweeted&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Warmest congratulations @RishiSunak!&#8221; and looked forward to strengthening India- UK relations.</p><p>Sunak became party leader last night and this morning he has met formally with King Charles III, who is inviting him to form a government as prime minister. He will then go to 10 Downing Street, one door away from No 11 where he lived as Chancellor of the Exchequer for just over two years till he resigned in July, and will begin to appoint his cabinet.</p><p><strong>Urgent issues</strong></p><p>Sunak has a massive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/23/most-pressing-issues-next-tory-pm-rishi-sunak-penny-mordaunt-boris-johnson-conservative?">list of urgent issues to tackle&nbsp;</a>and has pledged &#8220;there will be integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level of the government I lead.&#8221;</p><p>Financial and economic problems include a fiscal gap of some &#163;40 billion, an approaching recession and a cost-of-living crisis with inflation of around 10 percent, the highest for 40 years. That stems from Brexit and the Ukraine war&#8217;s rising energy costs, escalated by the right-wing economic agenda of Liz Truss, the outgoing prime minister. The national health service is failing to cope with demand and the public sector is facing shortages and a spate of wage-related strikes led by railway workers that could escalate into a confrontation between the government and trade unions.</p><p>Foreign policy issues include Ukraine where Johnson and Truss (as foreign secretary) led one of the toughest responses to the Russian invasion, plus confrontations with China. Unresolved Brexit problems include legislation challenging trade barriers that threaten stability in Northern Ireland, and there is also the looming question of Scotland&#8217;s independence.</p><p>All recent prime ministers have failed the &#8220;do for us&#8221; test mentioned at the top of this article. Both Boris Johnson and David Cameron in different ways failed because they believed too much in their (Eton-educated) leadership gifts, while Theresa May could not handle the cut and thrust of politics and diplomacy. Truss, who defeated Sunak for the prime minister&#8217;s job last month, thought she could buck the markets and public opinion with right-wing tax and borrowing dreams that Sunak had correctly warned would cause economic chaos.</p><p>Those prime ministers had spent years in politics before entering 10 Downing Street, whereas Sunak only began in 2015 when he became a member of parliament &#8211; though he was quickly spotted as a future prime minister by Cameron and others. He is therefore bringing a fresh approach, but he has much to learn about how to get the government machine to deliver on policies, and he also needs to learn how to project himself and his family.</p><p>As prime minister,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-uk-pm-favourite-no-stranger-to-controversies-here-are-some-3458228">he has to overcome the negative publicity&nbsp;</a>burden of the wealth and privileges that he has enjoyed for years. He and his fashion designer wife Akshata are worth some &#163;730 million, thanks mostly to the wealth of her father, Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, one of India&#8217;s three leading IT companies.</p><p>If he had been more adept at politics, Sunak would have in 2015, or soon after, canceled the US green card that he obtained when he worked at Goldman Sachs and as a hedge fund analyst. He would also have canceled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/rishi-sunaks-wife-says-its-not-relevant-to-say-where-she-pays-tax-overseas">his wife&#8217;s UK non-domicile&nbsp;</a>status as an Indian citizen which saved her paying taxes totaling as much as &#163;20m.</p><p><strong>Personal embarrassments</strong></p><p>Both the green card and tax became personal embarrassments earlier this year, as did a &#163;3,500 suit he wore at a leadership meeting along with his &#163;500 Prada shoes on a construction site. He talked on television about how many types of bread his family enjoyed when many voters could not even afford one loaf, and he was building a large swimming pool in the garden of his elegant north Yorkshire country house when the plight of the poor was spreading across the country.</p><p>It looks as if he has learned from those mistakes. But he has critics among MPs and a larger proportion in the party membership, not least because he arguably triggered the mass cabinet resignations that led to Johnson&#8217;s downfall in July when he quit as chancellor of the exchequer.</p><p>His right-wing credentials are also not as firm as some on the right would like, prompting a slanted&nbsp;Daily Telegraph&nbsp;headline last night that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/10/23/rishi-sunak-man-riddled-contradictions-trying-slippery-image/?">described him rather unfairly</a>&nbsp;as &#8220;A man riddled with contradictions trying to shed his &#8216;slippery&#8217; image.&#8221;</p><p>The article said that &#8220;not everyone knows what he truly stands for&#8221; on issues such as Brexit, which he supported, and the free market, which he moved away from with state intervention and increased corporation tax as a result of the covid pandemic.</p><p>On policy, Sunak is strong on the economy and financial markets because of his professional background and his experience as chancellor under Johnson. He will continue with the abandonment of Truss&#8217;s policies that was started by Jeremy Hunt, who became chancellor a week ago and is expected to stay in the job. Sunak believes in low taxes and has said he would reduce the bottom rate of income tax from 20 percent to 16 percent, but only when prudent without fueling inflation, perhaps in seven years&#8217; time.</p><p>But he has absolutely no experience in foreign policy, international relations, or national security, nor on vast swaths of domestic policy ranging from the national health service and home care, to the police, and transport.</p><p>When he appeared in public debates during his contest with Truss, however, he appeared as a fast-learning and efficient policy manager who was prepared to devise positive answers to problems without resorting to Truss-style popular tax cuts.</p><p>The hope now must be that he has not had to make too many promises to would-be cabinet ministers in order to obtain their support for his candidature &#8211; he eventually received nominations from 185 MPs. That success prompted his main rival Boris Johnson to withdraw two days ago followed by Penny Mordaunt, current leader of the commons, who gave up just before the 2 pm deadline yesterday.</p><p><strong>United cabinet</strong></p><p>Sunak has to balance different needs as he tries to form a united cabinet that has talent in the top jobs as well as representing different wings of the party and rewarding friends and allies who supported his bid to become PM.</p><p>On&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/10/24/rishi-sunak-policies-net-zero-taxes-cost-living/">climate change, Sunak i</a>s likely to follow the trend set by Johnson and a pledge to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, a target Truss might have weakened. He has said he would make the UK energy-independent by 2045 with increased power from offshore wind, rooftop solar, and nuclear sources and improved home insulation &#8211; a key detail many politicians forget. It remains to be seen if he lifts the blockage put by Truss on King Charles, a devoted climate change activist, attending the Cop27 summit in Egypt next month.</p><p>He could face problems with the Conservative Party&#8217;s right wing on strikes and law and order. Suella Braverman, who has been a strident home secretary and backed Sunak, would want an uncompromising tough line if she kept her job. Labor unrest however will not be solved with new laws that could escalate unrest and exacerbate economic problems.</p><p>There could also be a clash over a pending India-UK trade deal where Braverman opposed easing access to the UK for Indian students and key workers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/rishi-sunak-wants-to-change-united-kingdom-india-relationship-to-make-it-more-two-way/cid/1893979">Sunak is likely to back easier&nbsp;</a>access because he has said he wants to make it easier for British students to travel and for companies to work together &#8220;because it&#8217;s not just a one-way relationship, it&#8217;s a two-way relationship, and that&#8217;s the type of change I want to bring&#8221;.</p><p>Sunak&#8217;s most pressing problem is to unite the party which is riven by personal rivalries and policy differences. That will not be easy, but it is essential if it is to have any chance of winning the next general election due in 2024. There will be calls from opposition parties for an immediate general election, but Sunak can probably ignore them if he can hold the party together to tackle what he described in his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/10/24/rishi-sunak-speech-new-prime-minister/">84-second victory statement</a>&nbsp;last night as &#8220;a profound economic challenge.&#8221;</p><p><em><strong>John Elliott</strong> is Asia Sentinel&#8217;s South Asia correspondent.

Party Congress, gaining an unprecedented third term as China&#8217;s supreme leader with the new Politburo Standing Committee filled entirely with his people.</p><p>The increase in Xi&#8217;s power was dramatically highlighted with the removal of his predecessor Hu Jintao during the closing ceremony of the congress on October 22, although the Chinese state media attributed the 79-year-old Hu&#8217;s sudden departure as due to health issues.</p><p>&#8220;You just witnessed an unprecedented and seismic shift in Chinese political customs,&#8221; said a political analyst who declined to be named.</p><p>As widely expected, Xi gained a third term as general secretary, or president as popularly described in international media, on October 23. That broke the two-term limit for Chinese presidents laid down by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. The two presidents before Xi, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, served two terms.</p><p>Xi&#8217;s expanded power with the breaking of the two-term limit was symbolized by what happened with Jiang and Xi at the 20th Party congress which took place from October 16 to 22. The 96-year-old Jiang was absent, either due to ill health or because he was not invited or because he boycotted the congress to express his disapproval of Xi getting a third term. Hu attended the congress, but his removal from the closing ceremony graphically depicts Xi&#8217;s ascendancy over his predecessor, as widely broadcast by international media.</p><p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1583872847977381889?s=20&amp;t=YGNBx8nlEM5uk16hp9-Qeg">video</a> carried by international media, Hu, who wore an unhappy expression, argued for a long time with the two men who escorted him out of the venue, indicating he was reluctant to leave. On his way out, Hu exchanged a few words with Xi and patted the shoulder of outgoing Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who appeared to ignore Hu. Li is a prot&#233;g&#233; of Hu, as both belonged to the Communist Youth League. As Hu was escorted out, most of the senior delegates sitting behind him ignored him and stared ahead impassively.</p><p>One exception was Li Zhanshu, the outgoing chairman of the standing committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress (China&#8217;s parliament). As shown in this <a href="https://twitter.com/dansoncj/status/1583663702896967680?s=20&amp;t=YGNBx8nlEM5uk16hp9-Qeg">video</a>, Li Zhanshu, who was seated next to Hu, nervously wiped his brow with his handkerchief and stood up to try to help Hu, but was restrained by Wang Huning, a member of the new Politburo Standing Committee, the team of China&#8217;s seven most powerful officials.</p><p>&#8220;Li Zhanshu wanted to help Hu, but Wang Huning stopped Li. That tells you it was premeditated,&#8221; an analyst told Asia Sentinel.</p><p>AFP filmed the removal of Hu and broadcast the video, which was widely disseminated by other foreign media, but the incident was censored by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/former-chinese-president-hu-jintao-escorted-out-party-congress-2022-10-22/">reported</a> Reuters.</p><p>&#8220;CCTV did not broadcast live the closing ceremony. So there is no reason to doubt that the immediate impact was not for domestic consumption,&#8221; said the analyst who declined to be named.</p><p>&#8220;It is a message for the world, telling them Xi is totally in control. This is a message of strength in a time of geopolitical uncertainty,&#8221; the analyst added.</p><p>A Singaporean executive who declined to be named told Asia Sentinel, &#8220;Xi purposely let the world see Hu Jintao escorted out of the congress. This tells the world that Xi means business, don&#8217;t mess around with Xi.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;This is really telling the world that all the speculation about his leadership being under threat, had no real substance,&#8221; said Andre Wheeler, chief executive officer of Asia Pacific Connex, an Australian business consultancy.</p><p>State news agency Xinhua <a href="https://twitter.com/XHNews/status/1583829797297598465?s=20&amp;t=iauEvEk-HsStR5UMJQvdUg">said</a> Hu was taken to a room next to the congress hall for a rest and is feeling better. Others are skeptical that ill health was the reason for Hu&#8217;s removal.</p><p>Jamil Anderlini, chief editor of Politico Europe, <a href="https://twitter.com/JamilAnderlini/status/1584078024294551555?s=20&amp;t=YGNBx8nlEM5uk16hp9-Qeg">tweeted</a> on October 23, &#8220;With very few exceptions, the foreign reporters left in mainland China are either very junior and inexperienced or so scared of being expelled that they start to spout state propaganda. Thus, the literal removal of Hu Jintao from the political stage is reported as a &#8216;health issue.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>A professor told Asia Sentinel, &#8220;I think most people think correctly that Hu&#8217;s strange behavior does not have to do with his health. After all, he already sat through the first half of the closing ceremony. The only conclusion or almost certain conclusion is that Hu wanted to express his dissatisfaction over some issues in the congress. We presume it is over the fact that his own Youth League has been totally wiped out.&#8221;</p><p>Peter Humphrey, a British analyst, wrote on Linkedin today, &#8220;What did Mr. Hu do wrong? If you review all the footage from the seven days, you will see that he failed to applaud Xi's speeches throughout the weeklong 'congress'.&#8221;</p><p>Humphrey previously ran a risk consultancy in Shanghai, was jailed in China and now lives in the UK.</p><p>This action of a former senior leader leaving in such dramatic fashion has never happened before in past congresses.</p><p>&#8220;Of course, Xi doesn&#8217;t want to see this happen; dictators abhor surprises, everything has to be choreographed perfectly,&#8221; said the unnamed academic. &#8220;The fact that Hu sitting next to Xi did a very unusual thing has spoiled the ambiance of perfection of the congress, thus making Xi lose face.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Since the age of reform in 1978, nothing like this has happened, a former general secretary walking out of a pivotal party congress. It shows the world something is not right with the way the congress was being handled, or there was objection to the division of the spoils,&#8221; the professor added.&nbsp;</p><p>Xi wants to minimize or remove any future challenges, hence he is neutering the Communist Youth League faction now, the analyst explained. &#8220;The message to Hu is, &#8216;Your time is over.&#8217; It&#8217;s a pretty resolute message from Xi: &#8216;I&#8217;m in charge, any would-be contenders take note, I don&#8217;t take prisoners.&#8217; He&#8217;s thrown the old playbook in the bin.&#8221;</p><p><strong>New Politburo Standing Committee</strong></p><p>At a <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2022/1023/c90000-10162351.html">press conference</a> in Beijing on October 23, Xi presented the new Politburo Standing Committee comprising China&#8217;s seven most powerful officials including Xi. Not a single member of the committee belongs to the factions of Hu and Jiang. All the other six members of the committee are believed to be Xi loyalists. They are Wang Huning, Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, and Li Xi.</p><p>Cai Qi was an official in Zhejiang province while Xi was the province party secretary. He is known to have publicly called Xi &#8220;Xi Dada&#8221; (Xi Daddy) and &#8220;Boss Xi.&#8221; Li Xi will replace Zhao Leji as the head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the anti-graft agency, <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2022/1023/c90000-10162385.html">according to </a>People&#8217;s Daily. Thus, a Xi loyalist will lead Xi&#8217;s ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which some see as his tool to eliminate political rivals.</p><p>Xi has thus cleared the politburo standing committee of members of other factions. Deputy Prime Minister Han Zheng, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, and Li Keqiang are due to resign. Wang Yang, chairman of the national committee of the People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference, is currently the fourth most senior Chinese leader and belongs to Hu&#8217;s faction. Han Zheng is the most senior Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong and is believed to be part of Jiang&#8217;s faction.</p><p>The new Politburo Standing Committee reinforces the move away from Deng Xiaoping&#8217;s &#8220;committee style&#8221; politburo management to one of a singular, cult-style leader, said Wheeler. &#8220;This does not bode well for China, as the country is essentially at the mercy of one personality with no safety mechanism to evaluate their current economic trajectory.&#8221;</p><p>The test will be whether there will be some backlash as China&#8217;s economy flounders and Xi&#8217;s zero-covid policy will reinforce the sentiment developing within the middle class that increasingly sees Xi as having broken his social contract with them, Wheeler added.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Moral Outrage: Malaysia’s Election Gamechanger?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Indignation at endemic corruption a possible factor in

The week-long congress, which opened on October 16, is expected to give Xi an unprecedented third term, breaking the two-term limit for Chinese presidents laid down by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.</p><p>A UBS report forecast that the country&#8217;s restrictions will be eased significantly after the National People&#8217;s Congress in March 2023, though there is a risk that the current Zero-Covid policy may stay unchanged for longer, especially with the recent arrival in Asia of a swarm of variants.</p><p>&#8220;China with this rigid closing of the country is opening the doors for other countries for European investment,&#8221; said Wuttke at a <a href="https://sgc.frankfurt-school.de/">virtual roundtable</a> of the Sino-German Center of the Frankfurt School. EU investment in China is currently &#8220;limping along&#8221; at an average of &#8364;2 billion per quarter, while last year, he said, it was 20 times more in the US.</p><p>&#8220;We have seen (EU) companies going to other countries and looking for options, China plus one or China plus two. That is maybe good for Southeast Asia,&#8221; Wuttke said. &#8220;For us in China, it is a bit of an unheard-of situation. It used to be in beauty contests, it was China and China only.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Some foreign companies are moving their regional headquarters out of Shanghai because of the Covid-19 restrictions in that city which recently saw an upsurge in the pandemic, he said.</p><p>Strict Covid-19 containment policies continue to complicate China&#8217;s economic interaction with the outside world, and with the significant uptick of Omicron variant infections, international travel restrictions are likely to remain in place for much of 2022, said the EU Chamber of Commerce in China&#8217;s position paper which was released on September 21.</p><p>&#8220;This will further drag on the pace of deal-making and hinder due diligence processes,&#8221; according to the document. &#8220;In fact, the growing list of challenges is pushing many (European companies) to reduce, localize and silo their China operations, with an increasing number creating two separate systems&#8212;one for China and one for the rest of the world&#8212;which is an expensive and inefficient solution.&#8221;</p><p>According to the results of a flash survey by the European Chamber on the impact of both Covid-19 containment measures of China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 23 percent of respondents are considering shifting current or planned investments outside of China.</p><p>China&#8217;s GDP growth is expected to slow sharply to 2.8 percent in 2022 from 8.1 percent in 2021, the World Bank <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview">predicted</a>. &#8220;Wide-spread Omicron outbreaks and extreme weather have weakened economic growth.&#8221;</p><p>Wuttke said a GDP growth of 2.8 percent is nearly a recession for China&#8217;s economy. &#8220;For the first time since 1990, the rest of Asia is nearly growing twice as fast as China, and that of course is courtesy to the zero-tolerance policy,&#8221; he added.</p><p>&#8220;Hong Kong has lost a lot of its allure for international finance. Singapore is overrun with business,&#8221; Wuttke said.</p><p>In recent weeks, Asia Sentinel observed large numbers of foreign businessmen attending multiple conferences and the Formula One race during a visit to Singapore. In contrast, Hong Kong, where this correspondent lives, is more subdued in terms of foreign business visits.</p><p>The EU has free trade agreements with Singapore, Vietnam, South Korea, and Japan, which EU companies should exploit, Wuttke urged. His bearish outlook on China contrasts with the upbeat statements of Wang Wenbin, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman at the ministry&#8217;s <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/202209/t20220927_10772627.html">press conference</a> on September 27.</p><p>For the first eight months of this year, Wang said, China-EU trade increased by 8.8 percent year-on-year and EU investment in China went up by 123.7 percent. But Rhodium Group, a US consultancy, gives less euphoric figures, saying first-half FDI from the EU into China rose 14.6 percent year-on-year to &#8364;5.5 billion.</p><p>Greenfield FDI in China hit a historic low in the first half of this year, according to fDi Intelligence, a provider of FDI data. In the first half of this year, 177 greenfield projects were announced by foreign investors in China, slightly down from the 191&nbsp;projects over the same period of 2020, according to fDi which is affiliated with the Financial Times.</p><p>The 20th Party Congress report on which Xi based his October 16 speech mentions Marx or Marxism 31 times, but mentions &#8220;market&#8221; 19 times. The report&#8217;s more frequent mention of Marx over the market gives a taste of what will happen to the Chinese economy, Wuttke commented. &#8220;Ideology trumps the economy.&#8221;</p><p>Among the 2,296 delegates who attended the 20th Party Congress, only 18 were from the private sector, Wuttke noted. That is fewer than the 27 businessmen who attended the Party Congress in 2017 and the 34 in 2012.</p><p>&#8220;China is pushing more private entrepreneurs against the wall, which is of course not very good,&#8221; Wuttke said.</p><p>Enodo Economics, a UK think tank focusing on China, said, &#8220;Enodo believes that the renewed commitment to Xi&#8217;s policy preferences will be bearish for China equities, absent a softening of zero-Covid or warming of US-China relations. Xi&#8217;s speech on Sunday, at the opening of the Party Congress, gave no indication that either was in the cards.&#8221;</p><p><em><strong>Toh Han Shih</strong> is chief analyst of Headland Intelligence, a Hong Kong risk consultancy.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
