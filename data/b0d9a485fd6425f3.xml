   <media:description>This was such a delightful thing to have discovered about myself. 

Another delightful thing about my life is that, once per month, a lovely pair of socks designed by an independent artist arrives at my doorstep. And that can be the case for you as well!!

You can get a sample ballot and take it with you to your polling place! Or, in many places you can vote early. There are so many people who really are trying to make this country better, and democracy only happens when we do it.

Congrats to Kissy Psychiatric Hospital on their accreditation, and to everyone at PIH Sierra Leone on their continued strengthening of the healthcare system in SL. You can join the thousands of monthly donors to this project or make a one-time contribution here: http://pih.org/hankandjohn

   <media:description>I think, for example, that pretty much every question about &quot;cancel culture&quot; is a question poorly phrased because &quot;cancel culture&quot; means at least 20 different things, from celebrities going to jail for sexual assault to viral &quot;karen&quot; videos. It's impossible to be right about cancel culture but very easy to have an opinion on it because every person has a different definition. It is a question, like the math test in the video, seemingly intentionally designed to create conflict. 

There are so many mechanisms of how our disrupted world gets so messy and weird and bad, but the fact that it's much easier to argue about stuff when opinions are easy to form, and it's much easier to form easy opinions when questions are wrongly stated is actually new to me!!

Always learning!

   <media:description>In which John gets curious about when the median human being lived, and along the way learns something surprising about the human story.
LINK/SOURCES:
You can make a one-time or monthly donation to support better maternal and child healthcare in Sierra Leone here: http://pih.org/hankandjohn

Most of the population data in this video comes from the Population Reference Bureau, especially this excellent article: https://www.prb.org/articles/how-many-people-have-ever-lived-on-earth/ That's also where I learned that life expectancy in Iron Age France was 10-12.

The graphs and much of the information on life expectancy at various ages comes from Our World in Data, which is amazing. Here's their article on life expectancy over time and across communities: https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy

Their article on child survival and mortality statistics: https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality

And their article examining mortality in the distant past: https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past

I mostly relied on PRB info for global populations at various times, but this research summary from census.gov was also helpful: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/international-programs/historical-est-worldpop.html

Here's my math for why most people have never been 20: Of the first 100 billion people who lived, at least half (the most prominent researchers in the field consider that estimate on the low end) of people died before 15. Counting the 3% or so who died between 15 and 20, that means that probably at least 53 billion of the first 100 billion people died before the age of 20. Of the most recent 10 billion who died (most of whom were born between 1800 and 1950), over 30% died before the age of 20. That takes us to a conservative estimate of 56 billion of the 110 billion people who've died so far. (2.6 billion people are CURRENTLY under the age of 20, so even if you look at the entire population of humans, it is probable that most people have never been 20--hence the title.)

   <media:description>Coming to you with some epistemology from a treehouse in Indiana, it's two brothers using a loophole in their YouTube rules to make a nice, long final episode of Pizzamas 2022. 

(you can only get your Pizzamas stuff through this weekend AND THEN NEVER AGAIN  http://www.pizzamas.com)

As always, I am sad that it is over and somehow once again, I am ending with more video ideas than I entered with!! 

I just wanted to bring you some peace with respect to your feelings about Pluto. You don't have to worry about whether Pluto is a planet because planets do not exist.

In which John celebrates bit commitment, and explores how the quality of the bit can sometimes matter less than the quality of the commitment to that bit.

   <media:description>http://pizzamas.com I think we sometimes get stuck thinking that the only worthwhile solutions are the solutions that solve everything all at once. Certainly that's very exciting, and it would be very cool if we could get some of those for, like, transportation and medicine and democracy, but instead, it's mostly a bunch of work of lots of individuals doing small things that ends up making the world better. I get very skeptical when big simple solutions are proposed to me, and I think you should as well.

A lot of people have done great work showing that solar roads are a bad idea. This video actually came out DURING the 2014 campaign, which is amazing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obS6TUVSZds

And the same guy took a (maybe a bit excessively gleeful!) look at the failure of a large-scale installation in france: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM50P4K9UVk
