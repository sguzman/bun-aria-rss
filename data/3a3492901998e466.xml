    <title>True Crime Garage</title>
    <description>Hosts Nic and the Captain invite you to grab a chair, grab a beer and join them as they talk some true crime. This is no ordinary garage: it’s a rabbit hole of true crime, with a generous supply of alcohol and banter to lighten the load. From international atrocities to heinous stories on (US) home turf, dive head-first into a different case each week, and enjoy a cold one whilst your there. 




If you consider yourself an armchair detective, you’re in the right place, and you’re amongst friends. For the mystery-seeker, True Crime Garage presents an archive of missing persons, unsolved and cold cases, plus accounts of infamous serial killers and chilling solved cases. 




True Crime Garage has just one rule: don’t litter. Remember to not take yourself too seriously because if you do, nobody else will.

He is wanted for Unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, 1st degree murder and Armed robbery. Jason Brown is described as 5 foot 10 inches tall and 170 to 180 lbs. He is caucasian, with blond hair and green eyes. He speaks French fluently. 

He is believed to be using aliases that include Jason D. Brown, Derek Brown, Greg Johnson, Harline Johnson, Greg Harline Johnson, John Brown and Jay Brown. Authorities urge citizens not to engage with him but call for help immediately. Jason is wanted for 1st degree murder and should be considered armed and extremely dangerous at all times.

Sean-Paul had been unable to reach Kylen for a couple of days and this was not normal at all. In fact this sent the anxious father into a frenzy of activity. Sean-Paul lived in Montana and so he contacted everyone he could think of to try to help locate his daughter. He called the hospital, he called the jail and he called Kylen’s place of work frequently. No one had seen the girls since Friday the 13th. This was at Woody’s Tavern where the two ladies met with friends. During the visit Kylen and Crystal talked about some “creepy guy” that had spooked them at their campsite. Unfortunately on August 18, 2021 Kylen and Crystal were found dead and so began one of the most bizarre stories to come out of peaceful Moab, Utah. This case is still UNSOLVED and the Grand County Sheriff’s Office is still seeking information from the public.

On August 16, 2021 Sean-Paul Schulte reported to police in Utah that his daughter Kylen Schulte and her wife Crystal Turner were missing. Sean-Paul had been unable to reach Kylen for a couple of days and this was not normal at all. In fact this sent the anxious father into a frenzy of activity. Sean-Paul lived in Montana and so he contacted everyone he could think of to try to help locate his daughter. He called the hospital, he called the jail and he called Kylen’s place of work frequently. No one had seen the girls since Friday the 13th. This was at Woody’s Tavern where the two ladies met with friends. During the visit Kylen and Crystal talked about some “creepy guy” that had spooked them at their campsite. Unfortunately on August 18, 2021 Kylen and Crystal were found dead and so began one of the most bizarre stories to come out of peaceful Moab, Utah. This case is still UNSOLVED and the Grand County Sheriff’s Office is still seeking information from the public. Please call the Sheriff’s office with any information at (435) 259-8115.

www.TrueCrimeGarage.com

Around 9AM August 15th, 2002 a man named Chris Thompson went to his employer’s home. This was a scheduled work day and Chris was to be there at the home to start work that morning. When he arrived Chris found the overhead garage door to the home open. He found his boss inside the garage, dead. Michael Short had been shot once in the head. Inside the Henry County Sheriff’s department located Michael’s wife Mary. She too had been shot once in the head. As if things weren’t already bad enough, the Sheriff’s department could not locate the Short’s 9 year old daughter. What was the motive here in this double homicide? Where was the little girl? Join us in our Garage as we take a deep dive and look at a case that is now 20 years old and 20 years unsolved. This week we spotlight this case and the investigation that ensued over the years. Plus we look at some theories and suspects.

Something they had done countless times before. Except this time, they did not come home. This week we re-visit the still unsolved double murder case of Lyric Cook and Elizabeth Colins. We covered this case for the first time over two years ago and with the unfortunate ten year anniversary since these two wonderful and bright little girls were taken we felt compelled to give this another look and hope for some renewed interest and awareness of this still unsolved case.

      <title>America’s Highway Serial Killers /// Part 4 /// 593</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>America’s Highway Serial Killers /// Part 4 /// 593 </p><p>Part 4 of 4 </p><p><br /><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/" target="_blank">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p><p>This week we pick up right where we left off with more bad guys and bad news from America’s Highways. Tammy Jo Zywicki was an amazing young woman who had just one year left at Grinnell college before going on to some big and wonderful things. When her car broke down in central Illinois that all changed. Most of us would have stopped to help the young woman or felt guilty as we continued on our journey hoping not to be later for our next stop. Unfortunately in this real life true crime story that was not to be. As her Pontiac sat on the side of Interstate 80 (I-80) Tammy had her head under the hood trying to fix the problem but then along came a spider. A predator saw an opportunity and pounced.

Part 1 of 4 

www.TrueCrimeGarage.com

This week we start off by looking at an unsolved homicide of a young woman from California. Twenty two year old Kristin Alice Schmidt’s body was recovered from a State Park in Oregon. She was killed elsewhere and her body dumped and discovered by campers. As we started to look at Kristin’s still very active case investigation we learned that something larger may be at hand. Something so much larger than any one investigation. Something larger than an Oregon state investigation. America has a problem that was first identified back in the 1980’s. In April of 2009 the F.B.I. announced their Highway Serial Killings Initiative to raise awareness among law enforcement agencies and the general public about this issue and the F.B.I.’s offered assistance in these cases. 

Beer of the Week - Tropical Beer Hug from Goose Island Beer Company 

Garage Grade - 4 out of 5 bottle caps 

Recommended Reading - “ I ” The Creation of a Serial Killer by Jack Olsen

      <itunes:subtitle>Shannan Gilbert 911 Call /// Part 1 /// 579

Part 1 of 2 

www.TrueCrimeGarage.com

During the early morning hours of May 1, 2010 Shannan Gilbert traveled with Michael Pak from Manhattan to meet a client in Oak Beach. The homeowner Joseph Brewer was hosting a small gathering at his home. Joseph made arrangements for Shannan to be at his party. Michael Pak was Shannan’s driver and waited in his vehicle during the party. Something prompted Shannan to call 9-1-1 and she tells the dispatcher “Someone is after me!” Suffolk County Police have finally released Shannan’s 9-1-1 Call from that party. Join us in the Garage as we attempt to dissect and analyze this call. This is part of our continued coverage of the still unsolved Long Island Serial Killer case investigation. 

Previous coverage can be found in past episodes - Long Island Serial Killer Episodes 4 &amp; 5  /  Long Island Serial Killer Update Episode 20 / The Killing Season Episode 61 / L.I.S.K. Update Episode #74

People have been fascinated by this call and it’s still talked about today. Back in 1997 a man calling himself “Clay” called the Howard Stern show saying he has killed 12 women and he wants to kill more. Renewed interest in this call really started popping up this last summer and here at the Garage we started receiving emails from those of you that wanted to hear the “Clay” call again. This week we crack a couple of Christmas beers and analyze the “Serial Killer Phone Call.” Merry Christmas to all and Cheers from the Garage boys!</p><p> </p><p>Beer of the Week - Shiner Holiday Cheer!</p><p>Garage Grade - 5 out of 5 Bottle Caps!</p><p> </p><p>Our show - True Crime Garage “Off the Record” is available only on Stitcher Premium.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Flora Fire ////// 538</p>
<p>Part 1 of 1</p>
<p><br /><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a> </p>
<p>       The headlines were horrific. One read - “4 sisters perish in Flora fire.” On Monday, November 21, 2016 the tiny town of Flora, Indiana woke up to a terrible tragedy. At 3:30 AM a family of five woke up in a nightmare. Unfortunately only one member of the family made it out of the house that morning. Later it was determined that the fire was intentionally set and the reason that four beautiful little girls lost their lives was arson. Now it’s been five years and here in the Garage we are getting very frustrated with the handling of this case. The investigation involves multiple agencies, overseen by the Indiana State Police. An agency that we have always had a lot of faith in. But we have been told by the ISP that this investigation is a “full court press” to find justice for this family and the community. After five years that is simply hard to believe. </p>

Less than one month later, recent High School graduate Kelsey Smith goes missing after what was to be a quick trip to her local Target store. In 2016, Jessica Runions is reported missing to Kansas City PD after attending a party with friends. Join us in the Garage for an adult beverage or three as Nic & Captain go through all of the details surrounding these cases. </p>

<p>       This week in the Garage we review the still unsolved homicide of Jennifer Medernach. It has now been twenty years since the day that Jennifer’s mother reported her missing. 14 year old Jennifer Medernach left after an argument with her mother. She was spotted several times over the course of the next few days, still in the families’ neighborhood. But the story turned to tragedy when her body was found in a creek several days after being reported missing. This case is still very active and getting some justice for Jennifer is still very likely. Anyone with information should reach out to the Clay County Sheriff’s Office @ 904-264-6512.</p>

This case is still very active and getting some justice for Jennifer is still very likely. Anyone with information should reach out to the Clay County Sheriff’s Office @ 904-264-6512.

<p>Happy Halloween from your Garage friends! There are some pretty scary stories and rumors coming out of a tiny town in Missouri. Stories of meat hooks, cannibalism and serial killing. These rumors and stories all stem from an ongoing Missing Persons Investigation. The last reported sighting of 33 -year old Cassidy Rainwater was back in July of 2021. With a tip from the F.B.I. the Dallas County Sheriff’s office is investigating after receiving a photo of the woman partially nude and caged. Some of the locals call this place Spookyville. Join us in the Garage for some Halloween fun as we crack a couple and take a look at this open investigation and discuss just what might come of it. </p>

www.TrueCrimeGarage.com 

Loon Lake, Wisconsin - Cathy Nameth sent out a distress call. Something was terribly wrong. When her husband tried calling back, Cathy never answered. He rushed to her location finding her still clinging to life but covered in blood. Unfortunately Cathy died that day in October 2002 from multiple stab wounds. She was attacked and murdered in an isolated and safe recreational area. Concerns about a deranged murderer lurking in the woods terrified everyone. This week we discuss the still unsolved homicide case of Cathy Nameth.

<p>On January 21st and 22nd of 2017, forty tornadoes touched down in just under forty eight hours in the state of Georgia. The strongest was an EF-3 tornado with winds of one hundred and fifty miles per hour. FEMA and the National Guard were called in to support the rescue efforts. Damage estimates were around one hundred million dollars. Fifteen people died in Georgia and five more in other southern states as a result of these twisters. When the EF-3 tornado hit the Piney Woods Estates Mobile Home Park, two parents claimed the storm took their two year old boy Detrez Green. Join us in the Garage as we take a look at the parents strange story and discuss what really happened to little Detrez. </p>

<p>Part 1 of 1 </p>
<p>This week, the Captain invites Justin from Generation Why to join him in the garage and discuss the perplexing case of Canadian crypto-millionaire, Gerald Cotten, who died on his honeymoon. </p>
<p>We’re drinking Guinness: a smooth, dark stout that’s creamy in texture with an after-bite that’s both bitter and sweet. It’s malty, chocolatey and has a subtle punch of coffee. This classic brew originates from Dublin, Ireland. Although, I’m told by the Irish that Guinness only lives up to its reputation on Irish soil. Regardless, my dad calls it the adult protein shake. I give it 4.5 out of 5 bottle caps. </p>

<p> September 11th is a difficult day for our country. For one family the sadness of that date began back in 1995. That was the day that Jimmy Ryce disappeared and he became the boy that everyone knew and was looking for. He became the boy that was taken. Everyone in south Florida was asking, “Where’s Jimmy?” Little did they know the answer to that question was much closer to home than they thought.

<p>       Circleville, Ohio appears to be a town where everyone knows everyone’s secrets, or at least one person did. For over a decade anonymous letters were arriving in the mailboxes of residents, businesses, local city officials, schools and churches. These letters were demanding, accusatory and often threatening. Then one of the recipients dies a mysterious death. Afterwards, the local unsolved murder is mentioned time and time again in the letters. The author was claiming to know who was responsible for this unsolved murder of a local lady. Vulgar signs started to appear on the sides of busy roads and a murder attempt is made. A man is locked up for the attempted murder and yet the letters continued. Unsolved Mysteries featured this case and they too received strange and ominous letters. Many have called the Circleville Writer case - Ohio's greatest unsolved mystery. Join Nic and the Captain at your favorite spot on the Garage couch and hear the rest of the story.</p>

<p>   In the famous short story “The Most Dangerous Game” General Zaroff hunted shipwrecked sailors. The Zodiac killer used lover’s lanes in Vallejo, a lakeside park and the streets of San Francisco to shoot young couples. In the 70’s and 80’s someone was hunting the young women of Anchorage, Alaska. This week we explore the story of Alaska’s most cold blooded killer - Robert Hansen the Butcher Baker. </p>

<p>Part 2 of 2</p>
<p><br /><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a> </p>
<p>      November 12, 2013 - 30 year-old Chelsea Small was fatally shot while working at a Cash Advance business in Taylor, Michigan. Questions facing detectives is wether Chelsea knew her attacker and the actual motive for the attack in the first place. The killer made off with a small amount of cash. Security tapes show male suspect with age ranging from 25- 50. Possible white male with dark bushy hair, ball cap with emblem, dark clothing that could be some type of work uniform and light colored boots or shoes. The man appears to remain extremely calm during the entirety on the crimes committed. Please watch the footage and look at the pictures of the suspect that have been released over the years. Someone will be able to identify this man. Detectives would like everyone to pay close attention to the man’s unique clothing and the label / tag on the man’s pants. They believe the clothing / tag could be the break in the case. We agree and would also like to point out that the weapon used was unique and the suspect may have committed additional crimes. Anyone with ANY information should submit a tip by phone at 1-800-speak-up or online at <a href="http://1800speakup.org/">1800speakup.org</a> </p>

<p>     Brice Rhodes has been a major thorn in the side of the Kentucky Courts for the last five years. He is accused of three homicides. All three cases were quickly and easily linked to Brice as the perpetrator with a mountain of evidence against him in all three cases. But he is yet to be convicted. This week we review the crimes and the investigation that made the arrest and try to understand why this loser is not currently scheduled for his date with a lethal injection. </p>

<p>Part 2 of 2 </p>
<p><br /><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p>
<p>        On June 6, 1996 at 2:31 am a call came in for 911 emergency services in a suburb of Dallas, Texas. The caller was 26 year old mother Darlie Routier. Darlie was frantic and could be heard screaming and crying on the call. She tells dispatchers that someone broke into her home and attacked her family. When police arrive just minutes later they discover Darlie bloodied from knife wounds and her two boys both stabbed to death. Within days Detectives will say that there was no intruder and that Darlie viciously killed her sons. Join us in the Garage and pack a couple of extra cold ones as we do our best to go through the details of one of Texas’ most debated cases. </p>

<p>        On June 6, 1996 at 2:31 am a call came in for 911 emergency services in a suburb of Dallas, Texas. The caller was 26 year old mother Darlie Routier. Darlie was frantic and could be heard screaming and crying on the call. She tells dispatchers that someone broke into her home and attacked her family. When police arrive just minutes later they discover Darlie bloodied from knife wounds and her two boys both stabbed to death. Within days Detectives will say that there was no intruder and that Darlie viciously killed her sons. Join us in the Garage and pack a couple of extra cold ones as we do our best to go through the details of one of Texas’ most debated cases. </p>

<p>Join us in the Garage as we discuss one of the most bizarre missing persons cases we have seen. In the middle of a cold rainy night 9 year old Asha Degree left her home on foot. Where was she going? No one knows. Why did she leave? No one knows. Where is she now? Someone knows! Make no mistake, the evidence is obvious and mysterious but foul play is most certainly involved. There is a weird “bread crumb trail” in this case that is just a further extension of this big mystery. Who took Asha Degree?  </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Zodiac /// Part 5 /// 474</p>
<p>Part 5 of 5 <br /><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a> </p>
<p>In the late 60’s and early 70’s a hooded serial killer terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area. The killer told the press and police to call him the Zodiac. Few cases in modern True Crime have been discussed and speculated about more, especially on the west coast. Join us in the Garage with our good friend Mike Morford from the Criminology podcast as we take a deep dive into Zodiac’s communications with Melvin Belli and the still unsolved murder of Cheri Jo Bates. Tapping into Mike's extensive Zodiac knowledge we discuss the evidence, the suspects and of course the “what ifs.” </p>

<p>Part 3 of 5 </p>
<p><br /><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a> </p>
<p>In the late 60’s and early 70’s a hooded serial killer terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area. The killer told the press and police to call him the Zodiac. Few cases in modern True Crime have been discussed and speculated about more, especially on the west coast. In 2018 Law Enforcement in California finally apprehended Joseph Deangelo better known as the Golden State Killer. The Golden State Killer was dormant for 32 years and they still were able to arrest and convict him. The Zodiac, a much different type of killer has been silent for over 45 years. Is there still time to pull off the hood and final identify the one who calls himself the Zodiac? Join us in the Garage as we go through the Zodiac’s confirmed kill timeline and of course we will offer up some speculation and insights along the way. </p>

<p>In the late 60’s and early 70’s a hooded serial killer terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area. The killer told the press and police to call him the Zodiac. Few cases in modern True Crime have been discussed and speculated about more, especially on the west coast. In 2018 Law Enforcement in California finally apprehended Joseph Deangelo better known as the Golden State Killer. The Golden State Killer was dormant for 32 years and they still were able to arrest and convict him. The Zodiac, a much different type of killer has been silent for over 45 years. Is there still time to pull off the hood and final identify the one who calls himself the Zodiac? Join us in the Garage as we go through the Zodiac’s confirmed kill timeline and of course we will offer up some speculation and insights along the way. </p>

<p>Part 2 of 2 </p>
<p><br /><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a> In 2003 and 2004 something strange was going on down in Collier County, Florida. In the span of four short months two young men both in their early twenties go missing. Felipe Santos and Terrance Williams both now missing were last seen in two separate but very similar incidents. Both stories involve the missing person, their vehicle, some kind of traffic incident and an officer on the scene. The officer on the scene was 17 year Sheriff’s Office veteran Steven Calkins. Steven Calkins has been publicly named as a person of interest in both of these cases. We need your help and there is a very substantial reward for your help.

<p>Part 1 of 1</p>
<p><br /><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a> </p>
<p><br />On May 19th, 2016 Ginnie Gebo had a short conversation with her grandson Logan Schiendelman. He said something very strange to her, he had an epiphany. Logan told a friend “I don’t know if I’m going to survive this week”. These brief conversations would be some of the last communications of record to anyone from Logan. He has been missing since. If you or anyone you know has information about this case please call the Thurston County Sheriff’s Office @ 1-360-786-5500.

What could be more innocent, more everyday America, two little girls setting off on a bike ride to explore the neighborhood? Something they had done countless times before. Except this time, they did not come home. This week we discuss the unsolved double murder case of Lyric Cook and Elizabeth Colins. <br />

<p>Paradise Pines, California 1992 - On the afternoon of December 1st, six year old Danny Hohenstein was reported missing by his mother. Danny was last seen playing outside with a dog near his home.

This week we discuss the F.B.I. investigation and the hunt for this little boy.    Beer of the Week - Tangerine Wheat by Lost Coast Brewing  Garage Grade - 4 & a 1/4 bottle caps   </p>

<p>Millions of people all over the world enjoy their hobbies, an activity that brings us enjoyment. For Tim Watkins it was hitting the trails on his custom built Mountain Bike.

A suspect would emerge, one possibly linked to a much more infamous crime - the Delphi Murders. Could the two killers be one and the same? This week we discuss the case of Tim Watkins.

<p>Millions of people all over the world enjoy their hobbies, an activity that brings us enjoyment. For Tim Watkins it was hitting the trails on his custom built Mountain Bike. Tim was addicted to his bike and addicted to the scenic trails of Colorado. But all of this was shattered by a brutal and senseless murder. A suspect would emerge, one possibly linked to a much more infamous crime - the Delphi Murders. Could the two killers be one and the same? This week we discuss the case of Tim Watkins.    Beer of the Week - Intergalactic Juice Hunter by Odd13 Brewing  Garage Grade - 4 out of 5 bottle caps </p>

This case unlike any other will make you question if serial murder runs in the family. Join the Captain and Nic as we crack a few beers and talk though this strange tale.

<p>This week we set out to discuss the disappearance of two girls that went missing within 2 months of each other. The prime suspect in both cases has an interesting criminal history. Ward Weaver III is a man with a violent history and he is the son of a serial killer. This week we examine a much requested case from Oregon. This case unlike any other will make you question if serial murder runs in the family. Join the Captain and Nic as we crack a few beers and talk though this strange tale.   Beer of the Week - Bennington from Night Shift Brewing Garage Grade - 4 and a quarter bottle caps out of 5   </p>

<p>Back in 1974 the town of Rawlins, Wyoming experienced a terrifying summer as four females disappeared in just seven weeks. The ages ranged from ten to nineteen. The two older victims were last seen at the rodeo on the fourth of July. One girl seemed to have vanished into thin air as she was last seen walking in the busy part of town in broad daylight. 10 year old Jayleen Banker went missing from a different rodeo. The investigations provided no answers and no leads. The town of Rawlins was rocked and left to wonder what was happening to their girls. This week we take a deep dive into what is known today as the Rawlins Rodeo Murders.

<p>Lisa Stebic lived a rather quiet life. She was a working mother with two children and a failing marriage. She had her routine, a day at work, then home to her family and then out to the gym for a workout. On April 30th, 2007 the routine ended. Her husband says she was last seen leaving their home on this day. He has since been named a “person of interest” in this baffling disappearance. Where is Lisa and does her husband hold the answer?

      <title>Oklahoma Girl Scout Murders /// Part 3 /// 267</title>

<p>Part 3 of 3   </p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a>   </p>
<p>Camp Scott was a 410 acre camp operating since 1928. Located near a small town in Oklahoma the camp had facilities for up to 140 children and 30 staff.

<p> On a freezing, dark night in March of 2004 a 17 year old girl clocked out at work just before midnight. She got into her car and drove in the direction of home. She has never been seen again. Her car was found soon after and it appeared there was a strange vehicular accident. Her car was smashed backwards into an abandoned, creepy old farmhouse. The old house has a violent history. What happened to the driver of that car and was this even really a car accident at all? Did a terrible crime take place there instead? Did this event lead to the abduction of this girl? Someone out there knows something. This week we discuss the disappearance of Brianna Maitland.

<p>rue crime buffs all know the legends of the true crime world, the serial killers who have stood out. There are names like Gacy, Dahmer, Bundy and BTK… these names are synonymous with the word “monster.” But before these notorious killers roamed our streets hunting humans, there was another monster.

<p>Back in 1982 murders in a small town in Ohio rocked a community to it’s core. Rumors in town swirled and circled around one suspect in particular. But most feared the worst. Some said a group of drug addicted satanists were sacrificing the lives of the town’s youth. Others believed a deranged psycho was just starting to spill blood in their town. Either way, the local law enforcement, the FBI and outside agencies could not agree on a prime suspect. This week we visit a small town that was visited by murder.

<p>Michael Francke was a good man. He was hired in 1987 as the Director of Oregon state’s Department of Corrections. Michael was brought in to oversee the largest prison expansion in the state’s history. The Oregon prisons were very badly overcrowded. Many believe that Michael discovered something unsavory. This could have been corruption in the Oregon Department of Corrections, or an organized criminal element in the prison system. People believe this because Michael was telling them this. Before he could reveal the evil that lurked beneath the surface someone attacked and killed Michael Francke.

<p>On December 23rd, 1974, three girls from three different families set out on a shopping trip to purchase Christmas gifts for their friends and family. They piled in the car and drove off to south Fort Worth, Texas. They were supposed to be home by 4pm but they never returned... The mystery surrounding their disappearance continues to confound law enforcement officials. For some, time stopped on that December day. For others, the tragedy created a seedbed of suspicion that now divides. To this day this case remains a riddle with no answers. Tonight we crack a few cold ones and take a look at a cold case, that is heating up again. </p>

<p>The Colonial National Historic Parkway, Virginia - From 1986 to 1989, four young couples died at the hands of what the FBI long ago concluded was most likely a serial killer or killers. For years investigators actively and exhaustively worked the case, compiling a list of 150 possible suspects. But no one was ever arrested. This week we discuss the details of these unsolved cases and examine if the cases are in fact linked. Beer of the Week - Good Life by Billsburg BreweryGarage Grade - 4 bottle caps</p>

<p>Sean Patrick McDuffy Jr. was last seen on December 20th, 2015. Sean left his house in Calhoun, Georgia and was driving to North Carolina. It was going to be a quick trip to drop off his friend Eric Brown. But Sean likely had more than just dropping off his friend in his plans. Like most of Sean's recent activity this trip revolved around drugs. Either buying, selling or trading drugs for weapons. In Calhoun, Meth is cheap and always available. It is everywhere and the Meth trade is woven into the fabric of this small town. After 9 p.m. Sean picked up Eric at Eric's cousin's house and away they went. Eric went to Clay County, North Carolina and Sean Patrick McDuffy Jr. went into a missing persons file.

<p><a href="http://www.TrueCrimeGarage.com">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p>
<p>Sean Patrick McDuffy Jr. was last seen on December 20th, 2015. Sean left his house in Calhoun, Georgia and was driving to North Carolina. It was going to be a quick trip to drop off his friend Eric Brown. But Sean likely had more than just dropping off his friend in his plans. Like most of Sean's recent activity this trip revolved around drugs. Either buying, selling or trading drugs for weapons. In Calhoun, Meth is cheap and always available. It is everywhere and the Meth trade is woven into the fabric of this small town. After 9 p.m. Sean picked up Eric at Eric's cousin's house and away they went. Eric went to Clay County, North Carolina and Sean Patrick McDuffy Jr. went into a missing persons file.

<p>Who killed officer Luky? Luky was a K-9 Officer for the Hot Spring County Sheriff’s department for two years. In July 2017 his handler left for an out of town trip. The sheriff’s deputy left Luky chained up in his backyard on a 98 degree day. When the deputy returned home he found Luky dead. The cause of death is bizarre. In the beginning we heard rumor and speculation that it was heat stroke or maybe a gunshot. We are told this was blunt force trauma. What really happened to officer Luky?

<p><a href="http://www.TrueCrimeGarage.com">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p>
<p>Chino Hills, California, 1983 - In the dark of night, evil lurks around a house at the top of a hill. A sliding door was left unlocked and evil makes it's way inside the home. A sleeping family are surprised and slaughtered. One victim survives and tells a story that doesn't fit the evidence found at the scene. A suspect is quickly identified, and the manhunt began. Kevin Cooper is arrested, convicted and sentenced to death for the murders. The evidence is overwhelming. But was it suspiciously overwhelming? Did the police plant evidence? For more than 30 years, Cooper has proclaimed his innocence from a cell on death row. This week we discuss the horrific murders of the Ryen family and little Christopher Hughes. We will try to determine if Kevin Cooper is guilty of these murders. Beer of the Week - Grapefruit Double IPA by Claremont Craft Ales Garage Grade - 4 and a half bottle caps out of 5</p>

<p>Saturday night, October 22, 2005.  Ocilla, Georgia.  30 year old Tara Grinstead, a popular high school history teacher and former Miss Georgia contestant, attends a BBQ with friends at the home of the former Ocilla school superintendant Dr. Troy Davis and his wife Missy.  The party has gathered to watch the Georgia football game, socialize and enjoy some Southern barbecue.  At approximately 11 pm, Davis walks Tara to the door as she gets ready to leave.  She tells him that she is heading home.  She gets into her car and drives away.  That was the last known sighting of Tara Grinstead. What happened to Tara that night?  How could she have just disappeared into thin air? Over the years there have been several strong persons of interest, but in 2017 this case took a twist that no one saw coming.</p>

<p>Taken from Michael Cannell’s amazing book titled - Incendiary... The NYPD certainly didn’t understand it. The famously tough-minded New York Detectives stumbled and fumbled, as a harassing band of news-paper reporters detailed every turn. For more than a century the police had relied on muscle and shoe leather to collar bad guys. The street corner respected the billy club and that was that. But reliable strong-arm methods proved useless in the face of a schizophrenic serial bomber.  The NYPD’s corrupt precinct Captains and stubborn Commanders resisted the new methods promoted by college-educated criminologist until a serial bomber forced them to adapt.

She intended to walk to a store and buy some cigarettes. She never made it. Before leaving she had left a note for her boyfriend. They had been arguing that night. Her parents last saw her walking from their home at 2:20 in the morning. They have not seen nor heard from her since.

<p>Barry and Honey Sherman were one of the wealthiest couples in Canada. Barry had founded a large pharmaceutical business in his younger years that was wildly successful. With the success came many friends and enemies. In December of 2017 both Barry and Honey were found dead in their mansion. It’s very likely that the two were dead for more than 24 hours before the discovery of their bodies. Early indicators suggest strongly that the Toronto Police Service suspected a murder/suicide. That Barry had killed his wife and them himself. As the Investigation continued we would find that there are reasons to suspect that the rich couple were murdered in their home. This week we venture back to Canada and see if we can shed some light on the unfolding story of the deaths of Barry and Honey Sherman.

A dark haired man slipped into the home of the Otero's one morning as the children prepared for school. He murdered all four people inside the home.

<p> </p>
<p>Part 2 of 2 <a href="http://www.TrueCrimeGarage.com">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p>
<p>This is one of the strangest missing person cases that we have looked into. It's strange because of the very short window of time in which little William goes missing. William was three years old when he was last seen. He was playing outside with his sister. According to reports William was only left unsupervised for about 15 minutes. Several strange vehicles were spotted near where William was playing. Was the little boy being watched? Did someone snatch him up and take him? Police are still working under the assumption that William is alive. This week we take a look at the details of William's disappearance.

<p>10 years ago a man walked into a Lane Bryant clothing store posing as a delivery man. He announced a holdup and began taking women to a back room where they were bound with tape. One of the brave ladies managed to call 911. The robbery escalated and turned very violent. Before fleeing he shot all six ladies.

<p>10 years ago a man walked into a Lane Bryant clothing store posing as a delivery man. He announced a holdup and began taking women to a back room where they were bound with tape. One of the brave ladies managed to call 911. The robbery escalated and turned very violent. Before fleeing he shot all six ladies. Despite police arriving on the scene within minutes of the 911 call the killer managed to get away. Police have spent millions of dollars trying to catch this man. Was this a robbery gone very bad or are there bigger motives at play? Beer of the Week - Grinderpunch by Soundgrowler Brewing Garage Grade - 4 out of 5 bottle caps</p>

<p><a href="http://www.TrueCrimeGarage.com">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p>
<p>Episode 199 - Arthur Shawcross, the monster often referred to as “the worst serial killer, you’ve never heard of”. That may not be the case as Shawcross came from one of New York state’s more populated cities. This man was a convicted child killer set free by the state to kill again. During his time in prison Shawcross allowed members of the media to interview him on several occasions. Shawcross also had several pen pals that he wrote to often. This week we discuss the life and murders committed by “The Genesee River Killer” and speak with one of his pen pals, John Paul Fey. John is the co-author of the soon to be best seller “The Shawcross Letters”Beer of the Week - Genesee BeerGarage Grade - 3 out of 5 bottle caps</p>

Kendrick’s death has been ruled an accident however many including Kendrick’s parents say different. They believe he was murdered by several students. The murder then covered up by the sheriff because the alleged killers father is a F.B.I. Agent. Grab a beer and find a comfortable chair because this will be a bumpy ride.

When the two intruders find two employees in the store a brutal attack is unleashed. Dan Morse wrote the book "The Yoga Store Murders" had the following to say when asked about the crime. - It was Mayhem in Bethesda. It was like a nightmare - random guys in ski masks who could slaughter and rape people they don't know. That's like out of the movies.

<p>Episode 192 - We first became aware of this case in the second half of last year. Loyal Garage listeners were emailing and bringing attention to the strange situation up in Toronto. For nearly eight years men had been practically disappearing right off of the streets of Toronto. This didn’t go unnoticed by police. In fact the police opened two major investigations to address the situation. The problem, neither investigation provided any answers. Until January, 2018 when the cases of Toronto’s missing men broke wide open. This week we discuss the continuing investigation into Canada’s most recent and very prolific serial killer.Beer of the Week - Keefe’s Irish Stout by Granite BreweryGarage Grade 4 out of 5 bottle caps</p>

<p>Episode 189 - 3pm on November 6th, 2003 someone walked into the Superbike Motorsports store in Chesnee, South Carolina and shot the owner, his mother and both employees in the head. The crime became known as “The Superbike Murders” and it seemed as senseless as it was cold-blooded. Nothing was taken from the store. It became one of the most famous cold cases in the state of South Carolina. Police refused to give up on the case and thirteen years later they got what they had been looking for but it started with the disappearance of a young couple. </p>

<p>Episode 188 - Late June, 1999 a woman finds a body near a cornfield off a rural road just about 20 miles north of St. Louis. Investigators are quick to make an identification however the Medical Examiner is uncertain as to how the man has died. Police have their theories and suspicions. They believe the man had been killed somewhere else and dumped in a spot between the road and cornfield. The man was 41 year old Ricky McCormick, a loner. His friends called him a vampire because he would leave home after the sun went down and not return until it was coming up again. Ricky had a checkered past and he ran in some circles that likely could have led to his death. When searching the dead man’s pockets police discovered a strange clue. Two pieces of paper and on each of them long messages written in code. The FBI has released these codes to the public with their own message that these notes could tell us who killed Ricky McCormick.

Some suspected the murderer was a former employee. The neighbors feared a madman was on the loose. Today we know most of the story and as usual, the truth is stranger than fiction.

<p>Episode 182- This case begins with a teenager who goes missing. Several weeks later in September of 1972 a body is discovered atop a cliff, above an abandoned quarry in Springfield, New Jersey. Later it was determined this was the body of the missing teen, Jeannette DePalma. Along with the body it is said that cult related items were recovered from the area. Her body was said to have been resting on a makeshift altar in the woods. The murder of Jeannette DePalma is very bizarre and is still unsolved.

<p>Friday, April 15, 2005 - 59 year old Ray Gricar, the district attorney for Centre County, Pennsylvania called into work. He said he would not be coming into work that day. He let his girlfriend know that he planned to take a drive and do some antique shopping. He never returned home. The next day investigators found his vehicle parked at an antique shop's dirt lot. The car was locked and Ray's cell phone was found inside the car. The scene was eerily familiar to that of Ray's brother's suicide years ago. What happened to Ray Gricar? Had many years as a prosecutor made him one too many enemies? Was Ray's case tied to the Penn State scandal? Or was Ray living a secret life and decided to walk away?

<p>January 1984- A hammer wielding monster is attacking individuals and families in the cities of Aurora and Lakewood, Colorado. Two cities just 15 miles apart and both south of Denver. In several of these cases the attacker entered the victim's homes. It is not known how he gained access. All of the attacks were brutally violent and in each he either killed the victim or left them for dead. This sent a panic to all residents in the greater Denver area. Home alarm system sales and gun sales increased as people tried to protect their families. The killer who local police and detectives said would never stop seemingly did. The Hammer man slipped back into the nightmare from which he emerged. Tonight we discuss the details from the attacks and murders in this Colorado cold case.Beer of the Week - Fat Tire Belgian White Ale Garage Grade - 3 and 3 quarter bottle caps out of 5</p><p><a href="https://truecrimegarage.com/home">Beer Fund: https://truecrimegarage.com/home</a></p>

<p>Cleveland, Ohio - Sunday, March 24, 2013- Aliza Sherman a 53 year old mother of four stepped out into the cold to run some errands. She promised her youngest sons she would not be gone very long and she would return home with dinner. Hours and hours went by. Jeremy tried calling his mother's cell but she did not answer. Then he called his older sister Jennifer. Jeremy explained to Jennifer that their mother had been gone too long and he could not reach her. Jennifer tried many times to get her mother on the phone to no avail. Jennifer decided to take the search to the streets and look for her mother. Before she could locate Aliza the Cleveland Police Department notified Jennifer that they would like to speak with the Sherman family. It was then that detectives notified the family that Aliza Sherman had been killed in downtown Cleveland in broad daylight.</p>

<p>Cleveland, Ohio - Sunday, March 24, 2013- Aliza Sherman a 53 year old mother of four stepped out into the cold to run some errands. She promised her youngest sons she would not be gone very long and she would return home with dinner. Hours and hours went by. Jeremy tried calling his mother's cell but she did not answer. Then he called his older sister Jennifer. Jeremy explained to Jennifer that their mother had been gone too long and he could not reach her. Jennifer tried many times to get her mother on the phone to no avail. Jennifer decided to take the search to the streets and look for her mother. Before she could locate Aliza the Cleveland Police Department notified Jennifer that they would like to speak with the Sherman family. It was then that detectives notified the family that Aliza Sherman had been killed in downtown Cleveland in broad daylight.</p>

<p>The Suspect... It's a parents worst nightmare... You send your kid off to school and you think they are safe. Once they get inside the four walls of their school nothing bad should happen. In June of 2010, 7 year old Kyron Horman was dropped off at his school. His stepmother last saw him walking to his classroom. She left when Kyron was just feet from the classroom door. When school was let out, Kyron was to be picked up from the bus stop. When the bus arrived and let the kids out, Kyron was not there. Sometime during the school day he was taken from his school. Tonight we discuss the tragic story of a missing little boy.

<p>Earlier this month 19 year Kenneka Jenkins went to a hotel with some friends. They were joining others at the Crowne Plaza hotel for a birthday party. About four hours after arriving, Kenneka is reported missing. Police were not called but Kenneka's friends called her mother. Her mother raced to the hotel and requested the hotel staff's assistance in locating her daughter. There's good reason to question the amount of assistance offered by the hotel. Kenneka would later be found dead in a freezer at the hotel. Tonight we search for answers as we take a look at the death investigation of young Kenneka Jenkins.

<p>Earlier this month 19 year Kenneka Jenkins went to a hotel with some friends. They were joining others at the Crowne Plaza hotel for a birthday party. About four hours after arriving, Kenneka is reported missing. Police were not called but Kenneka's friends called her mother. Her mother raced to the hotel and requested the hotel staff's assistance in locating her daughter. There's good reason to question the amount of assistance offered by the hotel. Kenneka would later be found dead in a freezer at the hotel.

<p>Candace Hiltz, 17, was murdered on August 15, 2006. She was described at the time as a teen mother who had an 11-month-old daughter. Candace's family, said Candace had an altercation of some sort with an officer at the sheriff's office about a week before she was killed. Just days before her death the family's dog went missing. James Hiltz, Candace's older brother, was a person of interest in the murder but never was charged. Multiple family members who have spoken out all say James Hiltz was not the murderer and that he wouldn't have hurt his younger sister. Many suspect someone in law enforcement killed Candace. Candace's family continues to fight for justice.</p>

<p>Part 2 of 2    </p>
<p><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a>    </p>
<p>Terri "Missy" Bevers was 45 years old. She was a fitness instructor, married and the mother of three daughters. She was found murdered on Monday, April 18th, 2016 inside the Creek Side Church in Midlothian, Texas. She was scheduled to teach a class there early that morning. Later that day, The Midlothian Police Department released surveillance video from the Church that showed Missy’s killer, dressed in police tactical gear. This person was walking through the halls of the Church, opening doors and breaking glass, prior to Missy’s arrival. Initial reports suggested that Missy may have interrupted a burglary in progress at the Church and had been killed as a result. Today we discuss this truly fascinating case.            <a href="http://www.barkbox.com/TCG"></a></p>

<p>Part 2 of 2    </p>
<p><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a>    </p>
<p>Terri "Missy" Bevers was 45 years old. She was a fitness instructor, married and the mother of three daughters. She was found murdered on Monday, April 18th, 2016 inside the Creek Side Church in Midlothian, Texas. She was scheduled to teach a class there early that morning. Later that day, The Midlothian Police Department released surveillance video from the Church that showed Missy’s killer, dressed in police tactical gear. This person was walking through the halls of the Church, opening doors and breaking glass, prior to Missy’s arrival. Initial reports suggested that Missy may have interrupted a burglary in progress at the Church and had been killed as a result. Today we discuss this truly fascinating case.            <a href="http://www.barkbox.com/TCG"></a></p>

<p>For 67 years the FBI has sought the public's assistance in a special way through one of their most effective and longest running publicity programs- the "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives" list. Since 1950, the list has led to the location of almost 500 of our nation's most dangerous criminals. While the list began with bank robbers and murder suspects fleeing jurisdiction, it has evolved into a search for organized crime figures, serial killers, and terrorists. This week we have selected and will discuss a few cases from the FBI's most wanted list. Join us as we join the hunt for America's most wanted fugitives.</p>

<p>Madeleine McCann is the most famous missing person in the world. In 2007 you couldn't turn on a TV or computer without seeing her name and face. Sadly she went missing just days before her 4th birthday. Now it's been over 10 years and we are still looking for her. The details of the night she disappeared are still sketchy at best. What really happened that evening? Was Madeleine abducted or is this whole thing a bizarre coverup? Tonight over drinks we discuss the possibilities.Beer of the Week - Flannel Mouth by Blake's Hard Cider Co.Garage Grade - 4 out of 5 bottle caps</p>

<p>We all know that a lot of crazy things can happen on Halloween night but maybe none as crazy as this. In 2001 a couple of High School students were out enjoying several Halloween parties. The partying took them into the early morning hours of November 1st. One of them was so intoxicated he could not remember what took place Halloween night. In the same area of town a man leaving work after 2am was beaten and strangled to death in a parking lot. Several dreams about the murder and one phone call led to the arrests of the teenagers. One of them confessed and the other was convicted of murder.  </p>

<p>Tupac Shakur was one of the biggest rap stars of the nineties. He sold millions of records and landed roles in hit movies. But Tupac was always the rebel and this would cause him legal troubles. After serving time in prison Tupac signed a record deal with the infamous Death Row Records. On September 7, 1996 Tupac attended a boxing match at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. After leaving the match Tupac and his entourage attacked a man in the lobby. After the brawl, Tupac went with Death Row Records owner Suge Knight to go to a night club. On the way to the club their car was shot up while sitting at a stoplight. Tupac was hit with four bullets. He died six days later. To this day no one has been charged with his murder.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p>
<p>In the early morning hours of December 30th, 1999 in Welch, Oklahoma a trailer home fire is reported. Firefighters arrive and put out the blaze. The dead body of wife and mother Kathy Freeman is discovered. Her husband, daughter and a family friend are missing. Law Enforcement theorized Kathy’s husband Danny shot her, set the home on fire and abducted his daughter Ashley and her friend Lauria. The following day, to everyone’s surprise Lauria’s family looking for clues at the scene of the fire find the dead body of Danny Freeman. Tonight we gather in the garage and discuss what could have possibly happened that night in the trailer. We also want to know what happened to Ashley Freeman and Lauria Bible.   </p>

<p><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p>
<p>John Wayne Gacy was liked by most who knew him. He was a sharp businessman who had spent his time building up his contracting company, hosting elaborate parties, and entertaining children at hospitals. People thought of him as a generous, friendly, and hard-working man. However, there was another side that few had ever witnessed... Or at least lived to tell about. For several years John Wayne Gacy viciously tortured, raped and murdered more than thirty young men, who would later be discovered in his home and in the local river. This is the story of a community leader who was called the most hated man in America. He also has earned the name "the killer clown."</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Casey Anthony /// Part 4 /// 104    <a href="http://truecrimegarage.com/">TrueCrimeGarage.com</a>   Back in 2008 when 2 year old Caylee Anthony was reported missing the news media flocked to Orlando, Florida. When her little body was found in the woods near the Anthony’s home, we watched. When Casey Anthony screamed at her parents on video footage from jail, we watched. When the state of Florida charged Casey with first degree murder and the trial started, we watched and we couldn’t get enough. Today we go through one of the craziest trials in Florida criminal history. Join us in the garage for a cold one or two. Cheers!</p>

<p>Born Sture Bergwall, Thomas Quick was a chosen name. This man was also known as the Sater Man and Sweden's worst serial killer. He has been convicted of unspeakable crimes. He has confessed to stabbings, stranglings, rape, incest and cannibalism. But his confessions told us little about Thomas Quick and even less about Sture Bergwall. Tonight we review the confessions and the crimes and ask an important question. Who is Mr. Quick?</p>

<p>High school graduation is to be a time of celebration. Thinking of the memories created with friends over the years and an acknowledgement of accomplishments. June, 1992 - Suzanne Streeter and Stacy McCall just finished high school and planned to spend the first few days of summer with friends. They stayed the night at Suzanne's mother's home. Sometime between 2:30am and 8am the three women disappeared. They are suspected to have been kidnapped and murdered. Outside of several possible serial killers living in the area police are left with very few leads. Tonight we examine the very strange disappearance of the women that now are known as the Springfield Three.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a>  </p>
<p>In 1991- Austin, Texas 4 teenage girls were bound and killed in a small yogurt shop. The store of course was robbed. Four teenage boys would later be arrested and two of them found guilty of the murders. These convicted killers were eventually released when new evidence showed that the state's case was wrong. Now over 25 years later this case remains unsolved. Who killed these girls? Some still argue police had it right years ago, when they questioned the four boys and later arrested them. Some investigators suggest the killer or killers are unknown to law enforcement. Some point toward an insurance fraud scheme reaching high levels of the local judicial system. </p>

<p>Beer of the Week- Fuzzy Baby Ducks by New England Brewing CompanyGarage grade - 4 1/2 out of 5 bottle capsIt didn't start with Columbine but if you ask people my age that's the first School massacre that we remember and you hate to force yourself to rank these tragedies but Sandy Hook certainly is one of the worst. These stories are becoming a common occurence. We won't say it out loud but we are becoming numb to these horrible events. We use to kiss our kids and send them off hoping they would learn something and make us proud but these days we kiss our kids and hope that they come back. Once we shake off the shock and try to comprehend these tragic stories we must know why. We seek out to answer every question one can think of but even after we have done so, we are still confused. We have to blame someone, that part is easy as usually the guilty party is found close to his victims with a bullet in his head. But that's just not enough. That's not good enough. Because kids are not supposed to die, parents are not supposed to bury their children. Children and young adults are supposed to have too many exciting things to look forward to in their lives to ever think or consider carrying out these plans that end lives, ruin families, destroy communities and break the hearts of a nation. Why?Is the problem our gun control laws? Is the problem mind altering pharmaceuticals treating our troubled youth? Or is it the bullies? We may never know.</p>

<p>September 16th, 2009 - 24 year old Mitrice Richardson is briefly detained by deputies for not paying her bill at Geoffrey's restaurant on the Pacific Coast Highway. After midnight she is released from the Malibu/ Lost Hills Sheriff's station. She is without her car, purse and cellphone. She simply sets off on her own without provisions and walks off into the darkness. A little after 6am a trespasser matching Mitrice's description is spotted in the backyard of a home in Cold Canyon. Was this Mitrice? Regardless Mitrice was sent out into the dark, alone with no transportation in an area that she is unfamiliar and she disappears. Tonight we look for Mitrice Richardson and ask who could have taken her?</p>

<p>September 16th, 2009 - 24 year old Mitrice Richardson is briefly detained by deputies for not paying her bill at Geoffrey's restaurant on the Pacific Coast Highway. After midnight she is released from the Malibu/ Lost Hills Sheriff's station. She is without her car, purse and cellphone. She simply sets off on her own without provisions and walks off into the darkness. A little after 6am a trespasser matching Mitrice's description is spotted in the backyard of a home in Cold Canyon. Was this Mitrice? Regardless Mitrice was sent out into the dark, alone with no transportation in an area that she is unfamiliar and she disappears. Tonight we look for Mitrice Richardson and ask who could have taken her?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Joseph Colombo /// Part 2 /// 73</p>
<p>Part 2 of 2 </p>
<p>Being the leader of one of New York's five crime families does not come without problems. Joseph Colombo was the boss of the Colombo mafia but he was also a family man and a community leader. Coming up through the ranks was tough though. Joseph's father was killed by a rival gang when he was just a teenager. In 1970 he created the Italian-American Civil Rights League. Joe arranged for the community to picket against J Edgar Hoover and the FBI as they harassed and used questionable tactics to arrest Italian-Americans. In 1971 Colombo was gunned down at a rally in one of the most publicized assassinations in New York's history. The shooter was quickly hand cuffed and shot in front of police. Jerome Johnson shot Colombo but who shot Johnson? Was it the police, was it one of Colombo's men or was it the FBI? Author and director Don Capria joins us in the garage to discuss the biggest conspiracy in New York mafia history.</p>

<p>The Taconic Parkway Crash of 2009 was one of the areas most tragic stories. The fatal three car crash resulted in the deaths of eight people. It was quickly determined that Diane Schuler 36 years of age was responsible for the crash and the homicides of the other 7 innocent victims. An autopsy determined her blood alcohol level to be .19%, that's more than two times the legal limit for the state of New York. Her husband and sister in-law have publicly stated that Diane was not a drinker and this was not a homicide but in fact an accident. Her erratic driving was the result of either a stroke or a health issue. Tonight we examine the Schuler families' statements and take a look at the facts. Why was a seemingly good mother driving under the influence with 5 young children in her vehicle?Don't drink and drive and please stop texting and driving!</p>

<p>December 6th, 2014 a volunteer fire department is responding to a car blaze call when they are met with the unthinkable. A young woman has been set on fire and left for dead. Media sources are quick to report the woman was trying to communicate with the first responders. She unfortunately passed away shortly after she was attacked. Was the young woman able to name her killer? If she did why would it take a year to make an arrest? With Jessica Chambers' murder the focal point of so many news headlines why does the public know so little about the crime?

<p>TrueCrimeGarage.com</p>
<p>Welcome to Season 4 of True Crime Garage! Remember when your parents would say "make sure you are home before dark?" Well this is one of those stories. In 1951 in a nice neighborhood on the westside of Cleveland, ten year old Beverly Potts did not make it home. She had gone to a nearby park with Patricia her best friend and neighbor. When it started to get dark Patricia left and went home while Beverly decided to stay. Last seen walking home by herself she left all of us asking "what happened to Beverly?" Today we take shelter from the snow and cold and gather in the garage to discuss one of Ohio's greatest mysteries.</p>

<p>With Ted Bundy neatly tucked away in a Florida death row cell we can all just relax now right? Wrong! In 1982 the bodies of several young women were found in Washington state's Green River. Authorities unleash an investigation and manhunt almost the same size and scale of the "Ted Murders." With little to no real strong leads police are not optimistic. October 1, 1984 the Green River task force receives a letter from Mr. Theodore Robert Bundy offering his assistance to their investigation. Can one killer catch another and why would he want to help? We will ask these questions and many more tonight in the garage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p>
<p>1974 Washington State- Young beautiful ladies were disappearing at several college campuses. Some were last seen walking on campus, returning home and one unfortunate woman was snatched in the middle of the night as she slept in her bed. Of course women disappearing is a problem but no one seemed to understand just how big of a problem the Pacific Northwest was experiencing. Well the eyes of the entire community were opened wide in July of 1974 when the abductor of young women struck at the Lake Sammamish State Park. The park was extremely busy that day as temperatures reached ninety degrees and several large companies hosted their company and family picnics. It is estimated between forty and fifty thousand people visited the park for fun in the sun on that warm July Sunday. One of the attendees was not a person at all but merely the devil all dressed up like a young man. Two of the young ladies near the beach were fooled by the devil and lured to their deaths. This week we are hot on the trail of Ted Bundy as we talk about what investigators were calling the Ted Murders</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Mary Pinchot Meyer - Part 2 ////// 63</p>
<p> <a href="http://truecrimegarage.com/">Truecrimegarage.com</a></p>
<p>October 12, 1964 Mary Pinchot Meyer went out for her usual midday stroll to get some fresh air and maybe a little inspiration. While out walking near the C & O canal Mary was attacked. She was shot twice, died practically instantly and left for someone to find. Police make an arrest and the trial is set. But do they have the right guy? Or was Mary killed by some shadowy agency because of an affair with the late President Kennedy? This week in the garage we continue to look at the unsolved murder of Mary Pinchot Meyer. Was Mary's murder a hit and cover-up put together by an organized group like the C.I.A. or was it a random act of violence committed by a loner? Hmmm, that's funny. Isn't that the same question we ask ourselves about John Kennedy's murder? </p>

<p>Truecrimegarage.com</p>
<p>In the 60's there was little doubt that America was changing. The debate has always been and remains, who was in charge of those changes. Mary Pinchot Meyer, a divorced smart woman in her forties with ties to the CIA and the White House is just one of several that may have been silenced in that era of change and social growth. October 12, 1964 Mary went out for her usual midday stroll to get some fresh and air and maybe a little inspiration. While out walking near the C & O canal Mary was attacked. She was shot twice, died practically instantly and left for someone to find. Police make an arrest and the trial is set. But do they have the right guy? Or was Mary killed by some shadowy agency because of an affair with the late President Kennedy and because she "knew too much." This week in the garage we take a look at the unsolved murder of Mary Pinchot Meyer and find out what we know.</p>

<p>TrueCrimeGarage.com</p>
<p>Everyone is talking about the newest True Crime documentary "The Killing Season" and we are too. The Killing Season starts off as a documentary about the still unsolved Long Island Serial Killer case and becomes an investigation that will take documentarians Joshua Zeman and Rachel Mills to many cities and many dark places. The Captain and Nic discuss their thoughts about the first two episodes and what they hope the series will present to viewers. We also hear Nic discuss the real life cases behind Joshua's documentaries. This includes phantom clowns, suspected child serial killer Andre Rand and of course the Long Island Serial killer.</p>

<br /><br /><span>Etan Patz, Jacob Wetterling, Beverly Potts, Steven Stayner, Adam Walsh and Elizabeth Smart few if any are more famous than the child abduction of Johnny Gosch. It's a typical horror story but this time the boogeyman is real and we don't know his name. Young Johnny lives in a wonderful neighborhood in West Des Moines, Iowa. He comes from a great family. He has a paper route and he saves his money. Recently he purchased the dirt bike he had always wanted.

He went down to the corner and picked up the papers. He said hi to some of the other boys who were prepping for their morning routes.

<br /><br /><span>TrueCrimeGarage.com</span><br />
<br /><br /><span>In Atlanta, Georgia over a two year period between the summer of 1979 through the spring of 1981 there was a killer striking with an unheard of frequency. At least 28 African-American children and young adults were killed. This series of murders is sometimes called the Atlanta Child Murders. When it comes to criminal investigations we often hear how &quot;it's not like it is on tv&quot; yet this case was different, very different because it truly was a lot like how you would see a case work out on tv. The Atlanta Murders has all of the necessary attributes of a really good mystery and movie like investigative drama. An unknown person or persons is killing a major cities African-American youth sometimes at the rate of two or three a month and remains undetected despite the police's best efforts. The FBI and BCI units are called in. They even assembled a group of &quot;Super Cops&quot; from all over the country to come to Atlanta and lend their expertise. When the killer is finally caught it turns out to be one of the cities' own, a native. Then years after Wayne Williams is convicted of the murders some would come forward and wonder just how guilty is he and was he in fact responsible for all of the murders?</span><br />

The next victim 11 year old Krista Harrison was abducted right in front of her friend. The friend described the kidnapper as a white man who looked to be about 25 to 35 years old. In 1983 police connected the crimes to a local serial rapist 43 year old Robert Buell. Robert quickly admits to the rapes of several grown women.

Emma is spotted and photographed in a nearby city sipping coffee at a coffee shop - or so they thought. A strange unidentified man gets upset when he sees Emma's missing persons poster.

Emma's mother Shelley Fillipoff spends 2 months in a city far from her home searching for her missing daughter. After criminal charges are filed against her on an unrelated event, the public eye has now become very suspicous of the mother who arrived in a city far from her home the very same day her daughter was last seen there.

Some time between the hours of 11 o'clock and midnight he left. Some thought maybe to use the restroom others said maybe he went home to his apartment across the St. John's University campus but we may never know. He should have returned to the party or had he left he would have walked about three minutes to his apartment but he was never seen again. Joshua's father spent countless hours searching for his son and most of that on the 2700 acres that is the St. John's University campus. Tonight we ask ourselves what happened to Joshua?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joshua Guimond ////// 47 TrueCrimeGarage.com November 9, 2002 Joshua Guimond was at a party with friends. Some time between the hours of 11 o'clock and midnight he left. Some thought maybe to use the restroom others said maybe he went home to his apartment across the St. John's University campus but we may never know. He should have returned to the party or had he left he would have walked about three minutes to his apartment but he was never seen again. Joshua's father spent countless hours searching for his son and most of that on the 2700 acres that is the St. John's University campus. Tonight we ask ourselves what happened to Joshua? Beer of the week - Sugar Shack Maple Stout Garage Grade - 3 1/2 out of 5 bottle caps Please don't litter,</p>

<br /><br />June 15, 1989 - Port Saint Joe Florida... A woman driving on highway 98 pulls off of the road and into the parking lot of a covenience store and parks her car. She notices that she had parked next to a white Toyota cargo van and she could see a man with a mustache sitting in the driver's seat. She goes into the store and when she comes out she can see that the Toyota has left but before she gets in her car she spots something lying on the asphalt in the empty space next to hers. It was a polaroid photograph and the image on it would frighten a community and a nation. Come into the garage and get out of the heat as we discuss the weird story of the photograph.<br />

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Maura Murray /// Part 2 /// 30</p>
<p><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p>
<p>February 9th, 2004 Maura Murray a young woman who had just left the University of Massachusetts unexpectedly crashes her car in a rural mountainous area of New Hampshire. Just minutes later police find her car abandoned and locked and she has not been seen since. Where was she going, why did she leave school so quickly and why does this case continue to haunt us 12 years later. The local police believe Maura fled the area running away from her troubles and her family to start a new life. Maura's father believes she was murdered. What happened that night and more importantly where is Maura? This strange case has left many an armchair detective and cyber sleuths obsessed with hunting down any detail about Maura and her movements. Tonight we close the garage doors, open up a beer and discuss the case that refuses to go cold. Beer of the week- Summer Solstice by Bob's of New Hampshire Garage Grade: 3 1/2 out of 5 bottle caps</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Oakland County Child Killer ////// 28</p>
<p><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p>
<p>February 15th, 1976 boys and girls started to go missing just north of Detroit in Oakland County Michigan. Police and investigators suspected 7 children and young adults had been abducted and held captive for 4-19 days and then laid out neatly near businesses and houses. The Oakland County Child Killer was also nicknamed the Babysitter because the kids appeared to have been well taken care of and well fed while being held captive. This unknown serial killer even washed and pressed the victim's cloths and bathed them before discarding the bodies. This person was never caught but it goes a lot further than that. Nic & the Captain gather once again in the garage and discuss this tragic case including lots of little known information that may help to shed some light on one of America's most famous cold cases. Beer of the week: Two Hearted Ale by Bell's Brewing Inc. Garage Grade: 4 1/2 bottle caps out of 5 Cheers, Nic & The Captain</p><p><a href="https://truecrimegarage.com/home">Beer Fund: https://truecrimegarage.com/home</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.truecrimegarage.com/">TrueCrimeGarage</a> </p>
<p>Nic & The Captain discuss the unsolved murder of 26 year old Joey Labute Jr. This case hits close to home and close to the heart. Joey was last seen having drinks with friends at a popular downtown bar in Columbus Ohio. His body was found in the Scioto River, March 29th, 2016. This case is extremely sad and hauntingly familiar. Almost 10 years prior to the day that Joey's body was found, a young professional man same age as Joey had disappeared from a busy downtown bar in the same neighborhood. As Columbus mourns the loss of Joey the city is reminded of the disappearance of Brian Shaffer. </p>

<p>June 13, 1994 just after midnight, the bodies of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown are found near Nicole's condo. Both had been stabbed several times and Nicole's throat had been cut so severally that she was nearly decapitated. What would take place over the next several days and the polarizing trail are still fresh in our minds 20 years later. What has remained a mystery is the actions and movements of persons in the last few hours of June 12. Today we revisit this crime to go over the timeline of that day's events and present the evidence that sometimes is lost in the muck of drama and glamour. Did the famous football star kill his former wife and young Ron Goldman, we all know he was acquitted. We will discuss the evidence that points towards OJ's guilt and explore a few other suspects that you may not have heard of. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Long Island Serial Killer - update </p>
<p>In the final episode of the season Nic & the Captain chat about the first season of True Crime Garage and how much love and help they have received from listeners and the TCG Army. We get to hear bits about cases they intend to cover in season 2 and new information that came out in February 2016 regarding the unsolved Long Island Serial killer and Shannon Gilbert cases. Thanks for a fantastic season 1 & we hope to see you again soon with a HUGE season 2!!!! </p>
<p>Beer of the week - Florida Cracker by Cigar City Brewing - Tampa Florida </p>
<p>This refreshing white ale is brewed with unmelted wheat, orange peel and coriander and then fermented in French saison yeast. It's lighter, very tasty and complicated like all of Cigar city's brews. Delicious but don't call me cracker! Garage grading - 3-1/2 bottle caps </p>
