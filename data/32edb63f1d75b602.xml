      <title>What is Happening with the Supreme Court?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/what-is-happening-with-the-supreme-court</link>
      <description>This week, the Supreme Court issued a ruling making it easier to carry a firearm in public, which broke during the taping of this episode. And since we taped, Roe versus Wade was officially overturned. Norm Ornstein and Dr. Kavita Patel try to make sense of it all on the latest episode of Words Matter.

      <title>American's Mission Statement read by Senator John F. Kennedy</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/americans-mission-statement-read-by-senator-john-f-kennedy</link>
      <description>On July 4th we celebrate the birth of the American Experiment. The Declaration of Independence -- written in the Spring of 1776 by a 33 year old Thomas Jefferson -- is America’s mission statement. And like all mission statements, the words represented not what we were, but what we aspired to be. In fact, the author himself was a gifted writer, but a deeply flawed person who – like his country -- did not embody the ideas and ideal of that document.
For more than two hundred and forty years, the story of America has been the struggle between those who want to move us close to the words of our mission statement – and those who want to stop them.
It is often forgotten that the Declaration itself was meant to be spoken. 
In 2004 the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library released a previously unknown 1957 recording of then-Senator Kennedy reading the Declaration of Independence in New York on July 4th.
So this week to honor Independence Day -- And to remind ourselves that as a country must continue the struggle to turn America’s founding words into reality – we give John F. Kennedy’s reading of the Declaration of Independence the final word.

      <title>Barack Obama's Eulogy for the Honorable Reverend Clementa Pinckney</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/barack-obamas-eulogy-for-the-honorable-reverend-clementa-pin</link>
      <description>On June 26th 2015 President Barack Obama delivered the eulogy at the funeral of the Reverend Clementa C. Pinckney, the senior pastor of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston and a South Carolina State Senator.
Reverend Pinckney and 8 other Black church members had been murdered a week earlier during Bible Study in a racially motivated mass shooting perpetrated by a white supremacist. 
The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is one of the oldest Black churches in the United States, and it has long been a center for organizing events related to civil rights. 
Founded in 1816, the church played an important role in the history of South Carolina, during slavery and Reconstruction, during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s and in the Black Lives Matter movement. 
It is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal Church in the South, often referred to as "Mother Emanuel". 
Rev. Pinckney, was a well known activist who had held rallies after the shooting of Walter Scott by a white police officer two months earlier, in nearby North Charleston. As a state senator, Reverend Pinckney had pushed for legislation requiring police to wear body cameras.
The Reverend and his church were targeted because of their history and role in civil rights activism. 
With a rousing eulogy and a chorus of “Amazing Grace,” President Barack Obama called on the country to honor the nine victims of the South Carolina church massacre by working toward racial healing.
He said that included removing the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina State House grounds.
“It’s true, the flag did not cause these murders,” The President said, but “we all have to acknowledge the flag has always represented more than just ancestral pride. For many, black and white, that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation. We see that now.”
“By taking down that flag,” he said, “we express God’s grace.” But I don't think God wants us to stop there.“
On July 6, 2015, the South Carolina Senate voted to remove the Confederate flag from display outside the South Carolina State House. 
Make no mistake - the protests we have seen in the last month are a continuation of that struggle. And none of us can stop - none of us should rest until we dismantle and remove every symbol and every fact of the systemic oppression and racial subjugation that President Obama described in his eulogy of Reverend Pinckney.

      <title>President John F. Kennedy on Civil Rights</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/john-f-kennedy-on-civil-rights</link>
      <description>This week we highlight presidential leadership and one of the most important civil rights speeches ever delivered by a sitting American president.
By June of 1963, John F. Kennedy has been president for nearly two and a half years.
While Kennedy had long privately expressed his deep moral objections to the treatment of black people in American society and indicated support for New federal legislation. 
His public comments ranged from cautious moderate criticism to a 1950s version of “both sides-ism” but were mostly nonexistent.
In June of 1963, however the man and the moment met.
Alabama Governor George Wallace’s staged photo op defiance of federal law by standing in the school house doorway had lasted less than 90 minutes. 
On June 11th 1963 two black students were peaceful enrolled at the University of Alabama under the protection of a federalized Alabama National Guard commanded by US Marshals under the direction of the Department of Justice and the Attorney General of the United States.
Kennedy’s advisors recommended and Fully expected that the president would NOT address the American people that evening. 
With a little less than 18 months until to the 1964 elections, the President’s legislative agenda and his political future depended upon the votes Southern Democrats in Congress and those of their politically unforgiving constituents. 
The President had other ideas. Kennedy saw a way to exercise moral leader on an issue where he had to that point failed. He would request Network Television airtime to address the nation on the issue of civil rights. 
The facts and statistics on racial inequality in the United States described by President Kennedy to the American people that evening had even never been acknowledged by a President before - much less spoken in such a detailed and direct language. 
In a telegram to the White House after watching the President’s remarks in Atlanta with other civil rights leaders, the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr. described the address as ONE OF THE MOST ELOQUENT, PROFOUND,AND UNEQUIVOCAL PLEAS FOR JUSTICE AND FREEDOM OF ALL MEN, EVER MADE BY ANY PRESIDENT.
Dr King knew that Kennedy was moved by his now famous “Letter from Birmingham Jail” - written just weeks before. 
To President Kennedy and many Americans Dr. King’s letter was more than than a spirited defense of civil disobedience. It was an indictment of white indifference.
As you listen to the speech, you will hear Kennedy echoing King’s “Letter”
The President rejects the idea that Black Americans should have to wait for equality. "Who among us," Kennedy asks the American people, "would then be content with counsels of patience and delay?"

      <title>ENCORE: Hill Women - with Cassie Chambers</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/encore-hill-women-with-cassie-chambers</link>
      <description>Our guest this week is a writer, lawyer, speaker and an advocate. Cassie Chambers grew up in Eastern Kentucky, graduated from Yale College, the Yale School of Public Health, the London School of Economics, and Harvard Law School, where she was president of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, a student-run law firm that represents low-income clients.
Cassie received a Skadden Fellowship to return to Kentucky to do legal work with domestic violence survivors in rural communities.

      <title>A Tribute to Walter Mondale</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/a-tribute-to-walter-mondale</link>
      <description>Walter Frederick "Fritz" Mondale (January 5, 1928 – April 19, 2021) was a politician, statesman, diplomat, and lawyer who served as a U.S. senator from Minnesota from 1964 to 1976 and as the 42nd vice president of the United States from 1977 to 1981 under President Jimmy Carter.. In 1984 he was the Democratic Party's nominee for president of the united states.
As a Senator, Mondale had been the primary sponsor of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 – transformative legislation that outlawed the Refusal to sell or rent a dwelling to any person because of their race, color, religion or national origin.
Walter Mondale was the first vice president to have an office in the White House and established the concept of an "activist Vice President." He began the tradition of weekly lunches with the president, which continues to this day. More importantly, he expanded the vice president's role from figurehead to presidential advisor, full-time participant, and troubleshooter for the administration. Subsequent vice presidents have followed this model.[38
In 1984 he made history as the Democratic presidential nominee when he selected New York Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate. Making her the first woman on a national ticket
In August of 2019, we had the honor and privilege of spending some with former Vice President Mondale as Joe Lockhart and I traveled to Minneapolis to interview him for Words Matter. 
Joe had served in a senior position on Mondale’s 1984 Presidential Campaign and as far as Walter Mondale was concerned - that made him part of the family, literally.
They had kept in touch over the years. The former Vice President regularly held events and get togethers with his former staffers where ever he traveled - and Joe had always attended no matter how busy he was. 
At 91, Mondale was still very sharp and as always polite, courteous and inquisitive. He asked about Joe’s wife and children by name and remembered small details about their last visit that Joe himself had forgotten. 
He wanted to understand all he could about how podcasts worked, how many people listened, and why they were popular.
What impressed me most about him were his humility, self awareness and introspection. While most politicians can muster faux humility – during a campaign – that was not what Walter Mondale was all about. As with everything else - he was sincere and genuine. 
Mondale was brutally honest and realistic about why his 1984 campaign had been soundly defeated. Even with the microphones turned off, he was complimentary of former Presidents Reagan and George HW Bush - And unlike like most politicians- he took full responsibility (even for things that were not his fault) for the historic loss to Ronald Reagan. 
As we got ready to leave, the former Vice President was the embodiment of Minnesota Nice - he thanked us for making the trip, told us how much he enjoyed the interview, made Joe promise to send his regards to his family and even asked if we were all set with ride to airport. 
As he walked us to the elevator - he shook my hand and gave Joe a hug and told us both to “keep up the good fight”. 
Last weekend - just days before his passing Walter Mondale sent a final message to his staff:
Dear Team,
Well my time has come. I am eager to rejoin Joan and Eleanor. Before I Go I wanted to let you know how much you mean to me. Never has a public servant had a better group of people working at their side!
Together we have accomplished so much and I know you will keep up the good fight.
Joe in the White House certainly helps.
I always knew it would be okay if I arrived some place and was greeted by one of you!
My best to all of you!
Fritz
With that let’s listen to Joe Lockhart’s interview with the late, great former Vice President - Walter Mondale.

      <title>Deep State Radio: A Tale of Two COVIDS</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/deep-state-radio-a-tale-of-two-covids</link>
      <description>On the one hand, America's vaccine roll out is making great progress. On the other, in the last week COVID cases are on the rise in 38 states. On the one hand, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are working remarkably well. On the other hand, Astra Zeneca and perhaps Johnson and Johnson not so much. (Or maybe the government is over-reacting to a very tiny number of problem cases with the J&amp;J vaccine.) On the one hand we know more about the disease. On the other hand it keeps changing and about a third of us just don't want to know the science. Where does this lead? We discuss with Pulitzer Prize-winner Laurie Garrett, former senior Obama health specialist Dr. Kavita Patel and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School. Also: A special conversation about latest revelations about Trump and Russia and the Biden team's response.  Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio.Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities. You can subscribe to the podcast on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.If you become a member of the DSR Network, you’ll receive benefits such as ad-free listening via private feed, discounts to virtual events and Deep State Radio Swag, and access to the member-only Slack community. This is one of the most closely followed podcasts among the people influencing the most important decisions in Washington and worldwide today. You can learn more by visiting thedsrnetwork.com.

      <title>"Good Trouble" with John Lewis</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/good-trouble-with-john-lewis</link>
      <description>John Robert Lewis was a politician, statesman, and civil rights leader who served in the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 5th congressional district from 1987 until his death in 2020. He was the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee from 1963 to 1966.
Born near Troy, Alabama, on February 21, 1940, he the third of ten children of Willie Mae and Eddie Lewis.[2][3] His parents were sharecroppers in rural Pike County, Alabama,
As a child in rural Alabama in the 1940s, young John Lewis was disturbed by the evidence that he saw around him of the South’s Jim Crow racial segregation laws. He wanted to know why they existed.
Even as a small child he would ask his mother why black children went to separate schools from white children, why Black people were forced to use separate bathrooms, separate drinking fountains and sit in separate sections in public places.
His mother discouraged his curiosity, by saying, “Don’t get in the way. Don’t get in trouble.” But, as John Lewis often explained later, he went in the other direction – he got in the way. He got into trouble – GOOD TROUBLE as he famously called it.
Inspired by the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr who he first met at the age of 18, John Lewis was already an established Civil Leader by the age of 21. He had been one of the 13 original Freedom Riders in 1961 and lead the way in desegregating interstate transportation
At 23, John Lewis became the chairman of the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and was one of the "Big Six" leaders of groups who organized the August 1963 March on Washington. He was the youngest person to speak at the Lincoln Memorial on August 28th 1963 – on the same stage that Dr. King delivered his iconic “I have a Dream” Speech.
While he held many important leadership roles in the civil rights movement and the fight to end legalized racial segregation in the United States. the cause John Lewis became most associated with was that of Voting Rights.
In 1965, John Lewis organized some of the voter registration efforts during the Selma voting rights campaign, and became nationally known for his prominent role in the Selma to Montgomery marches.[49] 
On March 7, 1965 – a day that would become known as "Bloody Sunday" – Lewis and fellow activist Hosea Williams led over 600 marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.
At the end of the bridge and the city-county boundary, the marchers were met by Alabama State Troopers who ordered them to disperse.
When the marchers stopped to pray, the police discharged tear gas and mounted troopers charged the demonstrators, beating them with nightsticks. Lewis's skull was fractured, but he was aided in escaping across the bridge to Brown Chapel, a church in Selma that served as the movement's headquarters.[50] Lewis bore scars on his head from this incident for the rest of his life.[51]
In March 2015, on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Barack Obama, delivered a speech  in Selma and then John Lewis lead the way as President Obama, former President George W. Bush and 40,000 Civil Rights Movement veterans and marched across that very same bridge.
With that – let’s listen to the honorable John Robert Lewis talk about the importance of  “good trouble”

Lewis's skull was fractured, but he was aided in escaping across the bridge to Brown Chapel, a church in Selma that served as the movement's headquarters.[50] Lewis bore scars on his head from this incident for the rest of his life.[51]
In March 2015, on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Barack Obama, delivered a speech  in Selma and then John Lewis lead the way as President Obama, former President George W. Bush and 40,000 Civil Rights Movement veterans and marched across that very same bridge.
With that – let’s listen to the honorable John Robert Lewis talk about the importance of  “good trouble”

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>John Robert Lewis</strong> was a politician, statesman, and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement">civil rights</a> leader who served in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> for <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia%27s_5th_congressional_district">Georgia's 5th congressional district</a> from 1987 until his death in 2020.

      <title>Deep State Radio: It's Not Too Early to Predict What Biden Era Politics Will Be Like</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/deep-state-radio-its-not-too-early-to-predict-what-biden-era</link>
      <description>By this time during the presidency of the former guy, his national security advisor had been booted, the Muslim ban had been tried and Comey was days from getting fired. We also knew that the GOP was simply not going to do anything about even the worst things Trump was doing. So it's not too early to make some prognostications about about the political weather we can expect in the Biden Era. The bad news is, we already know the GOP is still Trump's GOP, obstructionist at best, anti-democratic, racist, corrupt and traitorous at worst. The good news is that so far, Joe Biden has managed to by-pass the Beltway and win bi-partisan support by listening to the American people and giving them the kind of programs and change the majority of them have long supported. Will this continue? What could result in a course change? We discuss with Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Washington Post, Dr. Kavita Patel, former Obama White House official and practicing physician and Ryan Goodman, NYU Law professor and co-editor of "Just Security." Join usEach week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio.Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities.

      <title>Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. - "I've Been to the Mountain Top"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/rev-dr-martin-luther-king-jr-ive-been-to-the-mountain-top</link>
      <description>On April 3, 1968 the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was in Memphis, Tennessee to lend his support, his help, and his leadership to the Memphis Sanitation Worker’s Strike.
That February, Black sanitation workers had walked off the job because two of them had been crushed to death in a garbage compacting truck. There was already unrest and tension because the Black workers were paid poorly and treated even worse. They deserved a raise and better working conditions.
On March 28, Dr. King participated in a huge Memphis march, but to his dismay, it ended in violence. With the intention of leading a peaceful march later that week, Dr. King returned to Memphis on April 3. That evening, he spoke at Mason Temple, then the Church of God in Christ world headquarters. 
As he had throughout the tumultuous struggle for Civil Rights during the 1950s and 60s, Dr. King called on America and Americans to live up to the promise of our founding creed, and to honor the words of our founding documents. 
As Dr. King came to the end of his speech, he talked about his 1958 attempted assassination, the bomb threat that delayed his plane that day, and threats made against him in Memphis. 
As a storm raged outside the packed church, Dr. King prophetically spoke of his own mortality.
The next day, Thursday, April 4, 1968, Dr. King was at the Lorraine Motel with aides and friends; Rev. Billie Kyles of Memphis arrived to take the group to dinner. At about 6 p.m. Dr. King stood with Rev. Kyles on the balcony outside his Room 306 and told musician Ben Branch to be sure to play “Take My Hand, Precious Lord” at the rally that evening.
Then, as Dr. King leaned over the balcony railing to speak with his young aide Reverend Jesse Jackson  he was struck down by an assassin’s bullet.
He was 39 years old.
Later that evening, in Indianapolis, Indiana – presidential candidate, Senator Robert Kennedy delivered the news of Dr. King’s murder to a crowd of black and white supporters.
Exactly two months later Robert Kennedy himself was assassinated in Los Angeles after winning the California Democratic presidential primary.
With that, let’s listen to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s “I've Been to the Mountain Top” in its entirety.

      <itunes:summary>On April 3, 1968 the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was in Memphis, Tennessee to lend his support, his help, and his leadership to the Memphis Sanitation Worker’s Strike.
That February, Black sanitation workers had walked off the job because two of them had been crushed to death in a garbage compacting truck. There was already unrest and tension because the Black workers were paid poorly and treated even worse. They deserved a raise and better working conditions.
On March 28, Dr. King participated in a huge Memphis march, but to his dismay, it ended in violence. With the intention of leading a peaceful march later that week, Dr. King returned to Memphis on April 3. That evening, he spoke at Mason Temple, then the Church of God in Christ world headquarters. 
As he had throughout the tumultuous struggle for Civil Rights during the 1950s and 60s, Dr. King called on America and Americans to live up to the promise of our founding creed, and to honor the words of our founding documents. 
As Dr. King came to the end of his speech, he talked about his 1958 attempted assassination, the bomb threat that delayed his plane that day, and threats made against him in Memphis. 
As a storm raged outside the packed church, Dr. King prophetically spoke of his own mortality.
The next day, Thursday, April 4, 1968, Dr. King was at the Lorraine Motel with aides and friends; Rev. Billie Kyles of Memphis arrived to take the group to dinner. At about 6 p.m. Dr. King stood with Rev. Kyles on the balcony outside his Room 306 and told musician Ben Branch to be sure to play “Take My Hand, Precious Lord” at the rally that evening.
Then, as Dr. King leaned over the balcony railing to speak with his young aide Reverend Jesse Jackson  he was struck down by an assassin’s bullet.
He was 39 years old.
Later that evening, in Indianapolis, Indiana – presidential candidate, Senator Robert Kennedy delivered the news of Dr. King’s murder to a crowd of black and white supporters.
Exactly two months later Robert Kennedy himself was assassinated in Los Angeles after winning the California Democratic presidential primary.
With that, let’s listen to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s “I've Been to the Mountain Top” in its entirety.

      <title>Geraldine Ferraro Becomes the First Woman on a National Ticket</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/geraldine-ferraro-becomes-the-first-woman-on-a-national-tick</link>
      <description>Geraldine Ferraro was a politician, diplomat, attorney - and also a teacher, activist, author, and businesswoman.
The daughter of an Italian immigrant, Geraldine lost her father when she was 8, and moved with her family to the South Bronx where her mother worked in the garment industry to support them.
She was an outstanding student winning a full scholarship to college, and earning a degree in English with honors. 
Geraldine Ferraro worked as a public school teacher in Queens before entering Fordham University School of Law in 1957. She continued to teach second grade at PS 57 in Queens during the day while going to law school in Manhattan at night and was of 2 women in her graduating class of 179 to earn a Juris Doctorate in 1960. 
Ferraro raised a family and worked as a civil lawyer for 13 years - occasionally doing pro bono work for women in family court.
She joined the Queens District Attorneys Office in 1974 heading the new Special Victims Bureau that dealt with sex crimes, child abuse, and domestic violence. 
Before she made history as the first woman to run for office on a national ticket - Geraldine Ferraro was a rising star in the Democratic Party and a powerful voice in Congress. 
Elected in 1978 to Represent New York’s 9th Congressional District in Brooklyn and Queens, a seat once held by Joseph Pulitzer and later by Chuck Schumer.
In only her second term she served in a prestigious leadership position as Secretary of the House Democratic Caucus - under legendary Speaker Tip O’Neil. A position perviously held by Shirley Chisholm and later by James Clyburn. 
In July of 1984, former Vice President Walter Mondale made history when he asked Ferraro to join the Democratic ticket as his running mate when he became the presidential nominee to challenge incumbent President Ronald Reagan and his Vice President George HW Bush.
One hundred and ninety-seven years after the Constitutional Convention was held in Philadelphia in 1787, a female candidate was finally nominated for national office at the Democratic Convention in San Francisco in 1984.
36 years, 6 months and 2 days later Senator Kamila Harris – also the daughter of immigrants, was sworn in as the 49th Vice President of the United States
Let’s listen to the Honorable Geraldine Ferraro’s historic acceptance speech for the 1984 Democratic Vice Presidential nomination

      <title>Deep State Radio: When Can We Go To War and Who Decides?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/deep-state-radio-when-can-we-go-to-war-and-who-decides</link>
      <description>Few decisions a government can make are more consequential than deciding when the use of force is warranted. In the US a debate has raged for decades about how much latitude a president should have in making such decisions and what role Congress should play. Legal contortionism has turned congressional authorizations for the use of force in one circumstance into blank permissions slips still cited by president decades later. This week, the Congress has begun to reconsider these profoundly important issues and we are joined by experts Steve Pomper, formerly of the Obama NSC, and Oona Hathaway, professor at Yale Law School, as well as regular co-host Ryan Goodman, co-editor of Just Security and professor at NYU Law School for a discussion on what changes are needed and which are possible. Don't miss it.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio.Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities.

She was active in the Civil Rights Movement and worked closely with both Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. 
On January 20, 1993, Angelou became the second poet in American history -- and the first African American and woman -- to read a poem at a presidential inauguration, when she recited her original work "On the Pulse of Morning" at the first inauguration of Bill Clinton.
She was the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at the inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961.
Angelou's audio recording of the poem won the 1993 Grammy Award for "Best Spoken Word" - introducing her to a whole new generation and bringing much deserved recognition for her previous works.
As evidenced by her Grammy win - Maya Angelou was as brilliant a performer as she was a writer.
In 2011 - she awarded the national’s highest civilian honor - the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
But of all her awards and accolades - one of the most memorable was her 1992 commencement address at Spelman College -an private historically black women's liberal arts college in Atlanta, Georgia, 
The Spelman Messenger later wrote - 
“ Maya Angelou left an indelible mark upon the world. Her wit, wisdom, and work will continue to inspire generations of Spelman women.” 
With that - let’s listen to Grammy winning poet Maya Angelou and her iconic 1992 Spelman College Commencement Address

      <title>Angela Davis and the Importance of Academic Freedom</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/angela-davis-and-the-importance-of-academic-freedom</link>
      <description>Dr. Angela Davis is an activist, philosopher, academic and author.
Born in Birmingham, Alabama during World War II - she attended segregated black elementary and middle schools in the 1950s.
Davis studied philosophy at Brandis University and did her graduate work in Germany with famed philosopher Herbert Marcuse.
She would later say that: “Herbert Marcuse taught me that it was possible to be an academic, an activist, a scholar, and a revolutionary.”
After returning to the United States, Angela Davis joined the Communist Party, became involved in the Black Panther Party, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, second-wave feminism and actively protested the War in Vietnam.
In 1969 Angela Davis became an acting Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of California Los Angeles.
That same year the University of California initiated a policy against hiring Communists.[
At their September 19, 1969, meeting, the Board of Regents - urged on by then-Governor Ronald Regan, fired Professor Davis from her teaching post because of her political beliefs.”
On October 8th 1969, Angela Davis gave a speech at UCLA protesting her dismissal.
“Education” she told a cheering student audience, “should not mold the mind according to a prefabricated architectural plan. It should rather liberate the mind. Because the mind has to be liberated in order to perceive the world, to see society, to understand what its advantages are, what its disadvantages are.” 
In that same speech Angela Davis drew persuasive links between the suppression of academic freedom, academic and social institutional racism, and the rise of totalitarianism in German during the 1930s. 
Later that month Angela Davis was reinstated by a California Superior Court judge and completed teaching the 1969-70 academic year. 
With that - let’s listen to Angela Davis talk about academic freedom, institutional racism and the dangers of totalitarianism.

      <title>Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/eleanor-roosevelt-and-the-universal-declaration-of-human-rig</link>
      <description>This week, in honor of Women’s History Month, we wanted to pay tribute to one of the most consequential leaders in American History. Eleanor Roosevelt was the niece of the 26th President of the United States and the wife of the 32nd – but make no mistake, she was a political thinker, an international activist and a World Leader in her own right.
Of her many achievements and successes, perhaps none was more personally satisfying and poignant than her work - after FDR’s death - at the United Nations -- in particular, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Adopted at the Third Session of the U.N. General Assembly held in Paris, to this day it is one of the most meaningful and important accomplishments in the 75-year history of that World Assembly. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as Ken Burns noted in his award-winning series, The Roosevelts, was history's first attempt at laying out the principles under which all nations should behave toward their own citizens and toward each other.
And it was largely the work of one delegate from the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt.
It was no easy task leading the international drafting committee at the dawn of the Cold War. But the former First Lady, as always, was shrewd, persuasive, and relentless.
As tough as she was tactful, she drove her fellow delegates so hard that one felt compelled to remind her that they "had human rights too."
"If they wanted shorter days, Theodore Roosevelt's favorite niece answered, "they should make shorter speeches."
At 3 a.m. on the morning of December 10th, 1948, the General Assembly approved the Universal Declaration of Human Rights without a single dissenting vote.
And after the historic vote, the entire General Assembly did something it had never done before and has never done since. It rose to give a standing ovation to a single delegate, Eleanor Roosevelt.

      <itunes:summary>This week, in honor of Women’s History Month, we wanted to pay tribute to one of the most consequential leaders in American History. Eleanor Roosevelt was the niece of the 26th President of the United States and the wife of the 32nd – but make no mistake, she was a political thinker, an international activist and a World Leader in her own right.
Of her many achievements and successes, perhaps none was more personally satisfying and poignant than her work - after FDR’s death - at the United Nations -- in particular, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Adopted at the Third Session of the U.N. General Assembly held in Paris, to this day it is one of the most meaningful and important accomplishments in the 75-year history of that World Assembly. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as Ken Burns noted in his award-winning series, The Roosevelts, was history's first attempt at laying out the principles under which all nations should behave toward their own citizens and toward each other.
And it was largely the work of one delegate from the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt.
It was no easy task leading the international drafting committee at the dawn of the Cold War. But the former First Lady, as always, was shrewd, persuasive, and relentless.
As tough as she was tactful, she drove her fellow delegates so hard that one felt compelled to remind her that they "had human rights too."
"If they wanted shorter days, Theodore Roosevelt's favorite niece answered, "they should make shorter speeches."
At 3 a.m. on the morning of December 10th, 1948, the General Assembly approved the Universal Declaration of Human Rights without a single dissenting vote.
And after the historic vote, the entire General Assembly did something it had never done before and has never done since. It rose to give a standing ovation to a single delegate, Eleanor Roosevelt.

      <title>Shirley Chisholm - Black Feminist Pioneer</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/shirley-chisholm-black-feminist-pioneer</link>
      <description>As Black History Month ends and Women’s History Month begins, we wanted to honor a pioneer in the struggle for equal rights for both movements.
Shirley Anita Chisholm was a politician, educator, activist, community organizer and author.
Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1924, as a child during the Great Depression - while her parents struggled to make ends meet - young Shirley and her two sisters were sent to Barbados to live with their Grandmother. Long before the Civil Rights movement in the United States, young
Shirley watched as her community advocated for their rights as she witnessed the Barbados workers' and anti-colonial independence movements. Chisholm would later say about her time on Barbados with her Grandmother: “Granny gave me strength, dignity, and love. I learned from an early age that I was somebody. I didn't need the Black Revolution to tell me that."
In 1964, after nearly two decades as an educator and community activist, Chisholm ran for and was elected to the New York State Assembly.
Even within the New York Democratic Party, Shirley Chisholm had faced resistance to candidacy based on her sex - so she took her
campaign directly to women, using her role as Brooklyn branch president of Key Women of America to mobilize female voters.
Four years later - in 1968, Shirley Chisholm became the first Black woman elected to the United States Congress, representing New York's 12th congressional district for seven terms from 1969 to 1983. 
Her 1968 congressional campaign slogan was "Unbought and Unbossed" - which later became the title of her memoir and a documentary film on her amazing life. 
On January 25, 1972, in a Baptist church in her district in Brooklyn - Shirley Chisholm became the first African-American candidate for a major party's nomination for President of the United States, and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
In her presidential announcement - she called for a "bloodless revolution" at the forthcoming Democratic nominating convention and described herself as representative of the people offering a new articulation of American identity: 
"I am not the candidate of Black America, although I am Black and proud. I am not the candidate of the women's movement of this country, although I am a woman and equally proud of that. I am the candidate of the people and my presence before you, symbolizes a new era in American political history."
Let’s listen to Civil Rights and Women’s Rights Pioneer Shirley Chisholm announce her candidacy for President of the United States.

Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1924, as a child during the Great Depression - while her parents struggled to make ends meet - young Shirley and her two sisters were sent to Barbados to live with their Grandmother. Long before the Civil Rights movement in the United States, young
Shirley watched as her community advocated for their rights as she witnessed the Barbados workers' and anti-colonial independence movements. Chisholm would later say about her time on Barbados with her Grandmother: “Granny gave me strength, dignity, and love. I learned from an early age that I was somebody. I didn't need the Black Revolution to tell me that."
In 1964, after nearly two decades as an educator and community activist, Chisholm ran for and was elected to the New York State Assembly.
Even within the New York Democratic Party, Shirley Chisholm had faced resistance to candidacy based on her sex - so she took her
campaign directly to women, using her role as Brooklyn branch president of Key Women of America to mobilize female voters.
Four years later - in 1968, Shirley Chisholm became the first Black woman elected to the United States Congress, representing New York's 12th congressional district for seven terms from 1969 to 1983. 
Her 1968 congressional campaign slogan was "Unbought and Unbossed" - which later became the title of her memoir and a documentary film on her amazing life. 
On January 25, 1972, in a Baptist church in her district in Brooklyn - Shirley Chisholm became the first African-American candidate for a major party's nomination for President of the United States, and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
In her presidential announcement - she called for a "bloodless revolution" at the forthcoming Democratic nominating convention and described herself as representative of the people offering a new articulation of American identity: 
"I am not the candidate of Black America, although I am Black and proud. I am not the candidate of the women's movement of this country, although I am a woman and equally proud of that. I am the candidate of the people and my presence before you, symbolizes a new era in American political history."
Let’s listen to Civil Rights and Women’s Rights Pioneer Shirley Chisholm announce her candidacy for President of the United States.

      <title>Deep State Radio: The Accountability Conundrum: How Do We Form Commissions to Investigate 1/6 or COVID in the Current Political Environment?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/deep-state-radio-the-accountability-conundrum-how-do-we-form</link>
      <description>When the 9/11 Commission was formed in the wake of the Al Qaeda attacks on the US, the current was united in grief and anger but politically polarized and it was very difficult to find a path forward that would be credible and an effective driver of reform. But the divisions of the early 2000s were nothing compared to what we have today and the problem is compounded by the active culpability one political party has in both of the issues that demand investigation. So, how do we get to accountability today? We discuss this question with former 9/11 Commissioner, former Indiana congressman Tim Roemer as well as Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security" and Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and former senior Obama White House staffer. Join us.

      <title>Malcolm X - "The Ballot or the Bullet" </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/malcolm-x-the-ballot-or-the-bullet</link>
      <description>He was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska- and he became one of the most celebrated, influential and misunderstood leaders of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s
Malcolm X was a Muslim Minister and human rights activist - best known as a pioneer of the Black Nationalist Movement and as an apostle for self-respect and uncompromising resistance to white oppression.
By the time he was assassinated 56 years ago this week - Malcolm X had become one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history.
He is credited with raising the self-esteem of Black Americans and reconnecting them with their African heritage. He is largely responsible for the spread of Islam in the Black community in the United States.
Many African Americans, especially those who lived in cities in the Northern and Western United States, felt that Malcolm X better articulated their struggle against racism and inequality than the mainstream civil rights movement did.
He argued that if the U.S. government was unwilling or unable to protect Black people, Black people should protect themselves.
Although he had publicly criticized the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on nonviolence and racial integration - after he left the Nation of Islam in March of 1964, Malcolm X declared his willingness to cooperate with that Movement.
Of those civil rights leaders he said: “I've forgotten everything bad that [they] have said about me, and I pray they can also forget the many bad things I've said about them."
Originally delivered in Cleveland, on April 3rd 1964 - this recorded version was delivered in April 12th in Detroit.
Today, historians regard “The Ballot or the Bullet” as one of the most influential speech in American history. 
Far from a call to violence – Malcolm X sought educate his community as to the extent of their political power:
The whites are so evenly divided that every time they vote, the race is so close they have to go back and count the votes all over again. Which means that any block, any minority that has a block of votes that stick together is in a strategic position. Either way you go, that's who gets it. You're in a position to determine who'll go to the White House and who'll stay in the doghouse. 
While distancing himself from the Nation of Islam - Malcolm X described his continued commitment to Black Nationalism, which he defined as the philosophy that African Americans should control the political, economic and social destinies of their own communities.
Like many of the great speeches we feature - Malcolm X tied his and his people’s struggle to American’s Founding and embraced the spirit of the American Revolution:
The white man made the mistake of letting me read his history books. He made the mistake of teaching me that Patrick Henry was a patriot, and George Washington – there wasn't nothing non-violent about ol' Pat, or George Washington. "Liberty or death"- is what brought about the freedom of whites in this country from the English.
This is why I say it's the ballot or the bullet. It's liberty or it's death. It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody.
Here is Malcolm X’s historic speech - "The Ballot or the Bullet" - in its entirety.

        <![CDATA[<p>He was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska- and he became one of the most celebrated, influential and misunderstood leaders of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X">Malcolm X</a> was a Muslim Minister and human rights activist - best known as a pioneer of the Black Nationalist Movement and as an apostle for self-respect and uncompromising resistance to white oppression.</p><p>By the time he was assassinated 56 years ago this week - Malcolm X had become one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history.</p><p>He is credited with raising the self-esteem of Black Americans and reconnecting them with their African heritage. He is largely responsible for the spread of Islam in the Black community in the United States.</p><p>Many African Americans, especially those who lived in cities in the Northern and Western United States, felt that Malcolm X better articulated their struggle against racism and inequality than the mainstream civil rights movement did.</p><p>He argued that if the U.S. government was unwilling or unable to protect Black people, Black people should protect themselves.</p><p>Although he had publicly criticized the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on nonviolence and racial integration - after he left the Nation of Islam in March of 1964, Malcolm X declared his willingness to cooperate with that Movement.</p><p>Of those civil rights leaders he said<em>: “</em><strong><em>I've forgotten everything bad that [they] have said about me, and I pray they can also forget the many bad things I've said about them</em>."</strong></p><p>Originally <a href="http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/speeches/malcolm_x_ballot.html">delivered </a>in Cleveland, on April 3rd 1964 - this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uKbrtVwKeE&amp;feature=youtu.be">recorded version</a> was delivered in April 12th in Detroit.</p><p>Today, historians regard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballot_or_the_Bullet"><em>“</em><strong><em><u>The Ballot or the Bullet”</u></em></strong></a><em> </em>as one of the most influential speech in American history. </p><p>Far from a call to violence – Malcolm X sought educate his community as to the extent of their political power:</p><p><strong><em>The whites are so evenly divided that every time they vote, the race is so close they have to go back and count the votes all over again. Which means that any block, any minority that has a block of votes that stick together is in a strategic position. Either way you go, that's who gets it. You're in a position to determine who'll go to the White House and who'll stay in the doghouse. </em></strong></p><p>While distancing himself from the Nation of Islam - Malcolm X described his continued commitment to Black Nationalism, which he defined as the philosophy that African Americans should control the political, economic and social destinies of their own communities.</p><p>Like many of the great speeches we feature - Malcolm X tied his and his people’s struggle to American’s Founding and embraced the spirit of the American Revolution:</p><p><strong><em>The white man made the mistake of letting me read his history books. He made the mistake of teaching me that Patrick Henry was a patriot, and George Washington – there wasn't nothing non-violent about ol' Pat, or George Washington. "Liberty or death"- is what brought about the freedom of whites in this country from the English.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>This is why I say it's the ballot or the bullet. It's liberty or it's death. It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody.</em></strong></p><p>Here is Malcolm X’s historic speech - <a href="http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/speeches/malcolm_x_ballot.html"><strong><em>"The Ballot or the Bullet" </em></strong></a>- in its entirety.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter">http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Deep State Radio: On January 6, the Noose Was for Mike Pence...Now a Legal Noose Is Tightening Around Trump</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/deep-state-radio-on-january-6-the-noose-was-for-mike-penceno</link>
      <description>While Trumpists may have celebrated that the disgraced former president was not convicted by the Senate and the Senators who voted to convict have been attacked for their show of conscience, the reality is that Trump's legal prospects are not good. Mitch McConnell, his one time ally, called for his prosecution. Multiple cases in which he is a target are under way--in NY, Atlanta, and Washington DC. A commission is being called to investigate the January 6th insurgency. We discuss where these may lead and how the GOP may handle the consequences with former Trump Admin senior staffer Olivia Troye and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security." Don't miss it.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio. Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities.

      <title>Senate Chaplain, Rear Admiral (Ret.) Barry C. Black </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/senate-chaplin-retired-admiral-barry-c-black</link>
      <description>Last week, as the House Managers presented their Impeachment case -- a step-by-step, rigorous, fact-based prosecution that clearly drew the connection between Donald Trump’s words and the violence that ensued in that very chamber little more than a month earlier - we thought back to the stirring words of the Senate Chaplain, Rear Admiral (Ret.) Barry C. Black following that failed insurrection.
At 4:45am on the morning of January 7th - just hours after an angry mob had violently attacked the US Capitol - a joint session of Congress certified the free and fair election of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States.
As the proceeding drew to a close - Vice President Mike Pence, who just hours earlier was targeted for execution by the mob in that very building - recognized the Senate Chaplain to give the final invocation.
Let’s listen to the powerful prayer offered by the Senate Chaplain, Rear Admiral (Ret.) Barry C. Black.

      <description>The House Impeachment managers proved beyond any reasonable doubt that Donald Trump incited an insurrection against the US government that resulted in six deaths over 140 injuries and profound damage to our democracy. Good as they were, we have to admit, it wasn't that tough to do because we all saw the events unfold. So, ensuring justice will be done should be easy, right? Not so fast. The Senate Kangaroo court you will remember from a year ago is back in session and most of the GOP simply do not care about facts or the law or the Constitution or the judgment of history. Which is why Trump will be acquitted. But...what then? What does it mean? Can other prosecutions follow? We discuss with former US Attorney Barb McQuade, NYU Law's Ryan Goodman and Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution. We also include an update on a bunch of breaking COVID news with Kavita. So...don't miss this episode.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio.

      <title>The Legendary Barbara Jordan on Impeachment</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/the-legendary-barbara-jordan-on-impeachment</link>
      <description>Barbara Jordan was a lawyer educator politician and a leader of the civil rights movement a Democrat and Houston native. Jordan was the first African-American elected to the Texas Senate after Reconstruction and the first southern African-American woman elected to the United States House of Representatives.
On July 25th 1974 Congresswoman Jordan delivered a televised opening statement as the House Judiciary Committee began consideration of articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon. It is regarded by historians as one of the greatest speeches in all of American history. Congresswoman Jordan offered a passionate and powerful defense of the United States Constitution. A document, she noted, did not include people like her when it was written and completed in 1787.
Congresswoman Jordan also provided thoughtful and well documented explanations of our system of checks and balances which were designed to stop any politician from abusing their power. She stuck to the facts and the law and noted the seriousness and the solemn duty she and her fellow members were about to undertake. As she quoted extensively from the Founders, Congresswoman Jordan explained that those who had drafted and ratified the Constitution anticipated actions like Nixon's and had created the check of impeachment to guard against such executive overreach and abuse of office. So this week we give Congresswoman Barbara Jordan the Final Word.

      <title>Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Impeachment </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/speaker-nancy-pelosi-on-impeachment</link>
      <description>As it looks more and more likely that the Republicans in the Senate will not hold former President Donald Trump accountable for his actions in inciting an insurrection against the United States, we thought it important to remind our listeners why it matters. 
And we could think of no more articulate voice than the duly elected Speaker of the People's House. 
Let's remember what happened. 
The President of the United States encouraged his supporters to launch an attack on the Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the free and fair election of Joe Biden. Six people were killed and dozens more permanently injured.
We have seen such things happen in other countries. But for those who think that America is exceptional, it was a rude awakening. 
"It can't happen here," they said 
It did. 
On January 13th, as the House of Representatives began considering the Article of Impeachment now before the United States Senate, Speaker Nancy Pelosi reminded those gathered in the very chamber that had been violently attacked by an angry mob just one week earlier, that words matter, truth matters and accountability matters. 
We could not agree more.

      <title>Deep State Radio: Was Trump's Coup Attempt on January 6th the Start of Something Much Worse?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/deep-state-radio-was-trumps-coup-attempt-on-january-6th-the-</link>
      <description>While some may look at the Trump coup attempt on January 6th as the last desperate act of the disgraced former president to remain in power, it is already being seen among white supremacist groups as a long expected signal of an escalation in domestic unrest leading to a civil war they have long planned and hoped for. The fact that Trump is likely to go unpunished for leading the January 6th effort and the Republican Party is taking a strong stand against accountability for that assault may only make matters worse. We discuss the case for Trump's conviction by the Senate, how we got to the 6th and what it augurs for the future with Elizabeth Neuman, Director of the Republican Accountability Project and former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of "Just Security" and professor of law at NYU Law School. Don't miss this chilling conversation.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio. Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities. You can subscribe to the podcast on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts. If you become a member of the DSR Network, you’ll receive benefits such as ad-free listening via private feed, discounts to virtual events and Deep State Radio Swag, and access to the member-only Slack community. This is one of the most closely followed podcasts among the people influencing the most important decisions in Washington and worldwide today. You can learn more by visiting thedsrnetwork.com.

      <title>INAUGURATION SPECIAL: Amanda Gorman, Lady Gaga &amp; Joe Biden</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/inauguration-special-amanda-gorman-lady-gaga-joe-biden</link>
      <description>Last week, after 4 long, divisive and tragic years, we witnessed the continuation of a 244-year-old American tradition.
It was not a peaceful transfer of power. As incoming White House Chief of Staff, Ron Klain correctly noted, “there was nothing inevitable about this day.”
Nonetheless - last Wednesday we watched a quadrennial ceremony that Ronald Reagan once called both “commonplace and miraculous” - commonplace because it has happened every 4 years for the 244 - and miraculous because it has happened every 4 years for the last 244.
It was, as John F Kennedy said exactly 60 years earlier- “not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom.”
It is a ritual that in the past many of us had taken for granted. Not this year - if the last 4 years have taught us anything it is that words truly do have power and they have consequences.
Not since Abraham Lincoln, had a new president given an inaugural address to a more divided nation while under the real threat of armed conflict.
And Joe Biden rose to the occasion. 
Let us never forget how close we came to last week NOT happening and as Lincoln said at Gettysburg – rededicate ourselves to a new birth of freedom – where truth, facts and power of words are given their proper place. #WordsMatter

      <title>In Honor of Dr. Martin Luther King  - "A Letter from Birmingham Jail"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/in-honor-of-dr-martin-luther-king-a-letter-from-birmingham-j</link>
      <description>Last week would have been the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 92nd birthday.  Given all that has happened over the last year and the last few weeks, we wanted to highlight one of the most significant and consequential calls for racial equality and social justice in American History - “Letter from Birmingham Jail”
On Good Friday, April 12, 1963 - the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and fellow civil rights leaders were arrested in Birmingham, Alabama as they lead a now famous Campaign of non-violent direct action to protest racial segregation and oppression in that Southern City.
In the early 1960s, Birmingham was one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States - enforced by both law and culture. Black citizens faced legal and economic oppression, and violent retribution when they attempted to even draw attention to these conditions
The Birmingham Campaign would become a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. President Kennedy’s Address to the Nation on Civil Rights, the August 1963 March on Washington and many other events were a direct result of this campaign and Dr. King’s now famous letter.

Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities. You can subscribe to the podcast on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts. If you become a member of the DSR Network, you’ll receive benefits such as ad-free listening via private feed, discounts to virtual events and Deep State Radio Swag, and access to the member-only Slack community. This is one of the most closely followed podcasts among the people influencing the most important decisions in Washington and worldwide today. You can learn more by visiting thedsrnetwork.com.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/deep-state-radio-the-trump-coup-a-week-in-washington-like-no</link>
      <description>In the midst of a pandemic, with almost 4000 people dying every day, when the nation should be coming together, the President of the United States once again tore it asunder. Worse, what he did was mobilize the first violent coup attempt in US history on the back of his months long seditious efforts to nullify the November election and steal the sovereign power of American voters. As it happens, he also did it on a week when the Democratic Party secured control of the US Senate, another development with seismic consequences in Washington. We discuss these events and their meaning with former Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams advisor Karen Finney, election law specialist Rick Hasen, former Obama health policy advisor Dr. Kavita Patel and NYU Law Professor and co-editor of "Just Security" Ryan Goodman. It's an important deep dive into the meaning behind the events of an extraordinary week. Join us.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio.

      <description>Joe Biden's cabinet will look more like America than any in our history. It will contain more women, more people of color, a wide range of ages, political perspectives and regional points of view. Does that matter? How? And what is still missing? We discuss and then we turn our attention to the latest developments in the COVID crisis, Trump's increasingly erratic behavior as his exit approaches and when, if ever, life may return to "normal." It's a conversation with our regulars Dr. Kavita Patel, former head of health policy in the Obama White House, and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of "Just Security" and professor at NYU Law School. You won't want to miss it.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio. Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities.

If you become a member of the DSR Network, you’ll receive benefits such as ad-free listening via private feed, discounts to virtual events and Deep State Radio Swag, and access to the member-only Slack community. This is one of the most closely followed podcasts among the people influencing the most important decisions in Washington and worldwide today. You can learn more by visiting thedsrnetwork.com.

      <title>Deep State Radio: Trump's Endgame: How Bad Can it Get?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/deep-state-radio-trumps-endgame-how-bad-can-it-get</link>
      <description>Despite his historic losing streak in the courts (not to mention his big election loss), Donald Trump continues to argue he was robbed. And many in his own party are supporting Trump's arguments and his baseless conspiracy theories. In fact the vast majority of Republicans now believe what is a complete fairy tale from a president who, whether he likes it or not, has just a few short weeks left in office. What is the significance of this extraordinary GOP unity around what amounts to nothing less than a coup attempt, an effort to disenfranchise millions of American voters simply because they did not support Trump. We discuss with NYU Law School's Ryan Goodman and former FBI special agent and senior lecturer at Yale's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs Asha Rangappa. Don't miss it.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio. Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities. You can subscribe to the podcast on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts. If you become a member of the DSR Network, you’ll receive benefits such as ad-free listening via private feed, discounts to virtual events and Deep State Radio Swag, and access to the member-only Slack community. This is one of the most closely followed podcasts among the people influencing the most important decisions in Washington and worldwide today. You can learn more by visiting thedsrnetwork.com.

      <description>We are about to enter a period of national catastrophe unlike any we have ever seen, unlike the past year, unlike wars through which we have lived. Mass death during this time is preventable if you listen to scientists and use common sense. But half the country does not. They have embraced an 11th Century combination of superstition and ignorance and are condemning their relatives, their neighbors and their friends to death. Even with a vaccine and competent administration on the horizon, the next three months will be terrible and the crisis may linger into next summer. For all these reasons, listen to this special conversation with Dr. Kavita Patel, a practicing physician who is also a former top Obama White House health policy official, Laurie Garrett, Pulitzer Prize-winning expert on pandemics, and Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School. It is a conversation you will want to share with your family and friends.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio. Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities.

If you become a member of the DSR Network, you’ll receive benefits such as ad-free listening via private feed, discounts to virtual events and Deep State Radio Swag, and access to the member-only Slack community. This is one of the most closely followed podcasts among the people influencing the most important decisions in Washington and worldwide today. You can learn more by visiting thedsrnetwork.com.

      <title>Deep State Radio: Can We Get There From Here: The Precarious Path to "The Third Reconstruction"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/deep-state-radio-can-we-get-there-from-here-the-precarious-p</link>
      <description>A Democratic victory in the 2020 elections is not a sure thing. As we have discussed on other episodes, the elections are fraught with risks. Further, once an election takes place, there are many ways that the President or his allies can try to cling to power. Only after there is a smooth transition and new leadership however, can the US turn to the business of effectively confronting our looming challenges associated with the pandemic, economic recovery and the climate crisis. Rising to those challenges could be a moment of great hope, even of rebirth, for the United States. We discuss how we get there from here with Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland), one of the very smartest members of the U.S. Congress, and with our regulars, Dr. Kavita Patel, former senior official in the Obama White House and Ryan Goodman, professor at NYU Law School and co-editor of "Just Security." Don't miss it.
Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio. Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities. You can subscribe to the podcast on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts. If you become a member of the DSR Network, you’ll receive benefits such as ad-free listening via private feed, discounts to virtual events and Deep State Radio Swag, and access to the member-only Slack community. This is one of the most closely followed podcasts among the people influencing the most important decisions in Washington and worldwide today. You can learn more by visiting thedsrnetwork.com.

      <description>Some of the most hard-hitting and shocking criticisms of Donald Trump have come from insiders in his administration. From Rex Tillerson’s calling his former boss a “fucking moron” to his former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats saying that having watched Trump up close the only conclusion he could draw was that the Russian’s had something on the president. Miles Taylor, former chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security, and Olivia Troye, a former top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence are among the most vocal former insiders turned critic. On this edition of Deep State Radio join them, NYU Law School Professor Ryan Goodman and former White House senior health advisor Dr. Kavita Patel to get a glimpse of the dysfunction up close. Join us.

      <title>DSR: The 3 a.m. Call is Coming from Inside the White House</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/dsr-the-3-am-call-is-coming-from-inside-the-white-house</link>
      <description>The biggest national security story in America today is the biggest domestic story and the biggest political story and the biggest economic story and the biggest public health story. The COVID outbreak at the White House might have resulted in greater empathy for those who have suffered so due to the pandemic but the opposite seems to be happening. It seems to be leading to an effort by the president and his supporters to double down on disastrous policy choice and to put more Americans at risk. We discuss with Pultizer Prize Winner Laurie Garrett, Dr. Kavita Patel, former WH staffer, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center.

      <title>Deep State Radio: Our Unfolding Democratic Emergency: The Red Lights are Already Flashing</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/deep-state-radio-our-unfolding-democratic-emergency-the-red-</link>
      <description>The Constitutional rot of the past four years has set the stage for the corruption of our institutions and, equally importantly, for growing delegitimization of our government. This plays into the hands of a president who is ever more desperate to cling to power lest he lose his fortune and his freedom. This in turn has experts who are studying the preparations for the November 3 election to express deep concern that we may be heading into a period of profound crisis for our system, one that, should Trump prevail in undermining the will of the people could mean the collapse of our system and a the onset of a period of national chaos. This is not abstract. Critical, dangerous steps confirming this is the direction we are headed are already taking place. We discuss with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Barton Gellman, Rosa Brooks of the Georgetown Law Center and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. It is essential listening.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio. Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities. You can subscribe to the podcast on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts. If you become a member of the DSR Network, you’ll receive benefits such as ad-free listening via private feed, discounts to virtual events and Deep State Radio Swag, and access to the member-only Slack community. This is one of the most closely followed podcasts among the people influencing the most important decisions in Washington and worldwide today. You can learn more by visiting thedsrnetwork.com.

      <title>Deep State Radio: Have We Already Seen the October Surprise?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/deep-state-radio-have-we-already-seen-the-october-surprise</link>
      <description>Is a resurgent COVID the October Surprise? Is it the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Will it be the nomination and approval of a replacement for her prior to the election? Will it be the announcement of a vaccine? Or is it tied to the president's reluctance to guarantee a peaceful hand-over of power if he loses. We discuss these options and others with Mimi Rocah, candidate for Westchester, NY, District Attorney, Katie Barlow, attorney and journalist, and Dr. Kavita Patel, practicing physician and former senior Obama White House aide. Co-hosts Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and David Rothkopf of The DSR Network explore the implications of this week's developments on all these issues with our guests and the discussion is riveting. You can subscribe to the podcast on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts. If you become a member of the DSR Network, you’ll receive benefits such as ad-free listening via private feed, discounts to virtual events and Deep State Radio Swag, and access to the member-only Slack community. This is one of the most closely followed podcasts among the people influencing the most important decisions in Washington and worldwide today. You can learn more by visiting thedsrnetwork.com.

      <title>The Ginsburg Tapes - In Memory of Ruth Bader Ginsburg</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/the-ginsburg-tapes-in-memory-of-ruth-bader-ginsburg</link>
      <description>Last week, America lost an iconic jurist and a life long advocate for equal rights. In memory of the Honorable Ruth Bader Ginsburg, we replay Katie's interview with Lauren Moxley, the host of The Ginsburg Tapes Podcast  -- which chronicles Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s oral arguments before the then all-male United States Supreme Court from 1972 to 1978 —before she became #Notorious RBG.
The Ginsburg Tapes allows the listener to be a fly on the wall for some of the most important cases in American jurisprudence as future Justice Ginsburg challenged laws treating men and women differently. In between the actually Supreme Court recordings, Lauren puts the cases, the law and even the Justices themselves in historical context and explains how as a lawyer, RBG really did change the World.

Brian talks about the battle between Fox News journalists and the network’s primetime opinion hosts - Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Sean Hannity. Brian credits former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson as being the catalyst behind the international #MeToo movement. Brian also explains how American lives were lost during the Coronavirus pandemic because viewers believed the information they saw and heard on the network.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/the-barlow-group-rainbows-rainclouds-with-jen-psaki-and-paul</link>
      <description>White House and campaign veterans Jen Psaki and Paul Begala join Katie Barlow and Joe Lockhart for a discussion about the “Rainbows &amp; Rainclouds” of the 2020 presidential campaign. In a McLaughlin Group tribute, Joe joins the panel, and Katie leads the group as they analyze the political landscape heading into the home stretch of the race for the White House. Jen explains the challenges facing Team Biden as they work to keep the Democrats united. Paul says the best strategy for defeating Trump is to ignore his Twitter feed and focus the voter’s attention on his track record and how his Administration has negatively impacted their lives. And Joe discusses Q-Anon – and why Team Trump is looking to this dangerous conspiracy group for new voters.

      <description>Former White House Political Director Doug Sosnik joins Katie Barlow and Joe Lockhart for an update on the 2020 elections. Sosnik explains how 2016 and 2020 are vastly different for President Trump, who he calls the “Austin Powers” candidate. Sosnik breaks down how the political landscape has been transformed in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic and how a vast majority of the electorate thinks the country is on the “wrong track”. Sosnik also discusses Joe Biden’s strategy, the impact of early voting on the general election debates, and what impact an “October Surprise” might have on the race between Biden and Trump.

      <title>Presidential Words Matter: FDR at the 1936 Democratic Convention</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/presidential-words-matter-fdr-at-the-1936-democratic-convent</link>
      <description>Since we currently have a president who doesn't seem to know or even understand the importance of words, especially when they are spoken by the president of the United States, we thought it might be helpful in a time of national crisis to remember that we have had presidents of both parties who did understand this.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, led our country through difficult times with the power and eloquence of his words.
In 1936 during the Great Depression and as the clouds of war gathered over Europe, he delivered one of the most important political speeches ever given by a sitting president.
The occasion was the Democratic National Convention held that year in Philadelphia four years earlier in 1932. FDR had made history by flying to Chicago and becoming the first presidential candidate to accept his party's nomination in person.
In an earlier episode of Words Matter, we discussed this important speech with Professor Harvey Kaye, who has just published a new book entitled: FDR on Democracy.
In his 1936 acceptance speech, Roosevelt used the language of the founders and decried the economic royalists who were trying to fight back against the progress of the New Deal because it threatened their power.
As you listen to his words, pay particular attention to the part where Roosevelt tells his audience they have a rendezvous with destiny.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt, led our country through difficult times with the power and eloquence of his words.
In 1936 during the Great Depression and as the clouds of war gathered over Europe, he delivered one of the most important political speeches ever given by a sitting president.
The occasion was the Democratic National Convention held that year in Philadelphia four years earlier in 1932. FDR had made history by flying to Chicago and becoming the first presidential candidate to accept his party's nomination in person.
In an earlier episode of Words Matter, we discussed this important speech with Professor Harvey Kaye, who has just published a new book entitled: FDR on Democracy.
In his 1936 acceptance speech, Roosevelt used the language of the founders and decried the economic royalists who were trying to fight back against the progress of the New Deal because it threatened their power.
As you listen to his words, pay particular attention to the part where Roosevelt tells his audience they have a rendezvous with destiny.

      <title>Presidential Words Matter: Ronald Reagan on the Challenger Disaster</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/presidential-words-matter-ronald-reagan-on-the-challenger-di</link>
      <description>The Space shuttle Challenger’s launch had already been delayed twice when it finally took off on January 28th 1986. 
This particular launch was widely publicized because for the first time a civilian—a teacher named Christa McAuliffe—was traveling into space. The plan was to have McAuliffe communicate to students from space. According to the New York Times, nearly half of America’s school children aged nine to thirteen watched the event live in their classrooms. 
But tragically - After a short seventy-three seconds into flight, the world was stunned when the shuttle burst into flames, killing all seven crew members on board.
President Ronald Reagan cancelled his scheduled State of the Union address that evening and instead addressed the nation’s grief. 
A young speechwriter — a friend and hero of mine — Peggy Noonan was tasked with drafting the president’s remarks.
It was a heavy burden - as she later recalled “I kind of figured the entire nation had seen an auto accident,”
Peggy Noonan draft a speech that was aimed - as she put it “at those who were 8-years-old, those who are 18, and those who are 80 without patronizing anybody.”
It was one of the greatest speeches in presidential history and earned Ronald Reagan his now famous title “The Great Communicator”

      <title>America's Mission Statement - Read by John F. Kennedy</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/americas-mission-statement-read-by-john-f-kennedy</link>
      <description>On July 4th we celebrate the birth of the American Experiment. The Declaration of Independence -- written in the Spring of 1776 by a 33 year old Thomas Jefferson -- is America’s mission statement. And like all mission statements, the words represented not what we were, but what we aspired to be. In fact, the author himself was a gifted writer, but a deeply flawed person who – like his country -- did not embody the ideas and ideal of that document.
For more than two hundred and forty years, the story of America has been the struggle between those who want to move us close to the words of our mission statement – and those who want to stop them.
It is often forgotten that the Declaration itself was meant to be spoken. 
In 2004 the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library released a previously unknown 1957 recording of then-Senator Kennedy reading the Declaration of Independence in New York on July 4th.
So this week to honor Independence Day -- And to remind ourselves that as a country must continue the struggle to turn America’s founding words into reality – we give John F. Kennedy’s reading of the Declaration of Independence the final word.

      <title>Preview - GURU: The Dark Side of Enlightenment </title>
      <link>https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1518839824</link>
      <description>Wondery has new tru-crime mini series that we think you’ll really enjoy.
In the Mid 2000s James Arthur Ray was a charismatic self-help guru who promised his followers a path to wealth and happiness. But not all who followed him finished their journey.
This is the story told in a new true crime mini-series from Wondery called “GURU: The Dark Side of Enlightenment”.
James Arthur Ray wasn’t really well known until he was in a movie called “The Secret”, and then was a guest on Oprah’s TV show a few times. Soon after that, thousands of people started attending his seminars, and he was pegged to be the next great self-help guru.
But what many didn't know about were his more...extreme methods. Methods that pushed his students to their limits, giving some the transformative life experience they dreamed of ... and killing others.

      <title>Presidential Words Matter: Barack Obama's Eulogy for the Honorable Reverend Clementa Pinckney</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/presidential-words-matter-barack-obamas-eulogy-for-the-honor</link>
      <description>On June 26th 2015 President Barack Obama delivered the eulogy at the funeral of the Reverend Clementa C. Pinckney, the senior pastor of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston and a South Carolina State Senator.
Reverend Pinckney and 8 other Black church members had been murdered a week earlier during Bible Study in a racially motivated mass shooting perpetrated by a white supremacist. 
The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is one of the oldest Black churches in the United States, and it has long been a center for organizing events related to civil rights. 
Founded in 1816, the church played an important role in the history of South Carolina, during slavery and Reconstruction, during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s and in the Black Lives Matter movement. 
It is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal Church in the South, often referred to as "Mother Emanuel". 
Rev. Pinckney, was a well known activist who had held rallies after the shooting of Walter Scott by a white police officer two months earlier, in nearby North Charleston. As a state senator, Reverend Pinckney had pushed for legislation requiring police to wear body cameras.
The Reverend and his church were targeted because of their history and role in civil rights activism. 
With a rousing eulogy and a chorus of “Amazing Grace,” President Barack Obama called on the country to honor the nine victims of the South Carolina church massacre by working toward racial healing.
He said that included removing the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina State House grounds.
“It’s true, the flag did not cause these murders,” The President said, but “we all have to acknowledge the flag has always represented more than just ancestral pride. For many, black and white, that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation. We see that now.”
“By taking down that flag,” he said, “we express God’s grace.” But I don't think God wants us to stop there.“
On July 6, 2015, the South Carolina Senate voted to remove the Confederate flag from display outside the South Carolina State House. 
Make no mistake - the protests we have seen in the last month are a continuation of that struggle. And none of us can stop - none of us should rest until we dismantle and remove every symbol and every fact of the systemic oppression and racial subjugation that President Obama described in his eulogy of Reverend Pinckney.

      <title>Presidential Words Matter: LBJ 1965 Howard University Commencement Address</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/presidential-words-matter-lbj-1965-howard-university-commenc</link>
      <description>On June 4, 1965, President Johnson delivered the commencement address at Howard University, the nation’s most prominent historically black university.
‪In his address, Johnson explained why “opportunity” was not enough to ensure the civil rights of disadvantaged Americans.
‪The ‘To Fulfill These Rights’ speech as it is widely known was the intellectual framework for affirmative action. 
‪President Johnson spoke of racial injustice and economic disparities between black and white Americans. 
‪For many in the audience that day, it was one of the first times they felt a president - any president - really acknowledge the treatment of black citizens from slavery to Jim Crow.
‪As one graduate - Lillian Beard -recalled on the 50th Anniversary - “I believe that afternoon in 1965 changed a lot of minds, because we felt that he spoke directly to us.”
‪LBJ’s Howard University address came only a few months after he had gone before a Joint session of Congress to speak in support of the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March.
‪It was in that message to Congress that Johnson famously identified himself with the civil rights movement when he declared, “We shall overcome.”
‪The Howard speech, which was principally the work of presidential speech writer Richard Goodwin and then-Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan was an extension of Johnson’s March voting-rights speech.
‪The goal was to take the civil rights movement from one focused on legal justice to one focused on economic justice.
‪In the Howard speech, Johnson pointed out that the racial barriers to freedom were slowly tumbling down, but instead of resting on that progress and what his administration had done to that point - Johnson went a step further: “Freedom is not enough,” the President told the graduates.
‪It was important for American society to achieve “equality as a fact and equality as a result.”
‪The next day President received a telegram from Martin Luther King Jr., telling him, “Never before has a president articulated the depths and dimensions of the problems of racial injustice more eloquently and profoundly.”
Dr. King was not exaggerating the importance of the Howard speech.  
In August Johnson would sign the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law, and two years later, he would appoint Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court, making him the nation’s first black justice. 
But unfortunately- the racial transformation Johnson had promised and hoped to bring about when he spoke at Howard did not take place. 
55 years later the same underlying conditions exist and the economic disparities LBJ described have not gotten better - far from it. They have gotten exponentially worse.
If we are to fulfill the promise of social and economic justice made By LBJ to Black Americans more than a half century ago - all of us must commit ourselves to radical and immediate change. Anything less would be a monumental failure.

      <itunes:summary>On June 4, 1965, President Johnson delivered the commencement address at Howard University, the nation’s most prominent historically black university.
‪In his address, Johnson explained why “opportunity” was not enough to ensure the civil rights of disadvantaged Americans.
‪The ‘To Fulfill These Rights’ speech as it is widely known was the intellectual framework for affirmative action. 
‪President Johnson spoke of racial injustice and economic disparities between black and white Americans. 
‪For many in the audience that day, it was one of the first times they felt a president - any president - really acknowledge the treatment of black citizens from slavery to Jim Crow.
‪As one graduate - Lillian Beard -recalled on the 50th Anniversary - “I believe that afternoon in 1965 changed a lot of minds, because we felt that he spoke directly to us.”
‪LBJ’s Howard University address came only a few months after he had gone before a Joint session of Congress to speak in support of the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March.
‪It was in that message to Congress that Johnson famously identified himself with the civil rights movement when he declared, “We shall overcome.”
‪The Howard speech, which was principally the work of presidential speech writer Richard Goodwin and then-Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan was an extension of Johnson’s March voting-rights speech.
‪The goal was to take the civil rights movement from one focused on legal justice to one focused on economic justice.
‪In the Howard speech, Johnson pointed out that the racial barriers to freedom were slowly tumbling down, but instead of resting on that progress and what his administration had done to that point - Johnson went a step further: “Freedom is not enough,” the President told the graduates.
‪It was important for American society to achieve “equality as a fact and equality as a result.”

      <title>ENCORE: President John F. Kennedy on Civil Rights</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/encore-president-john-f-kennedy-on-civil-rights</link>
      <description>This week we highlight presidential leadership and one of the most important civil rights speeches ever delivered by a sitting American president.
By June of 1963, John F. Kennedy has been president for nearly two and a half years.
While Kennedy had long privately expressed his deep moral objections to the treatment of black people in American society and indicated support for New federal legislation. 
His public comments ranged from cautious moderate criticism to a 1950s version of “both sides-ism” but were mostly nonexistent.
In June of 1963, however the man and the moment met.
Alabama Governor George Wallace’s staged photo op definance of federal law by standing in the school house doorway had lasted less than 90 minutes. 
On June 11th 1963 two black students were peaceful enrolled at the University of Alabama under the protection of a federalized Alabama National Guard commanded by US Marshals under the direction of the Department of Justice and the Attorney General of the United States.
Kennedy’s advisors recommended and Fully expected that the president would NOT address the American people that evening. 
With a little less than 18 months until to the 1964 elections, the President’s legislative agenda and his political future depended upon the votes Southern Democrats in Congress and those of their politically unforgiving constituents. 
The President had other ideas. Kennedy saw a way to exercise moral leader on an issue where he had to that point failed. He would request Network Television airtime to address the nation on the issue of civil rights. 
The facts and statistics on racial inequality in the United States described by President Kennedy to the American people that evening had even never been acknowledged by a President before - much less spoken in such a detailed and direct language. 
In a telegram to the White House after watching the President’s remarks in Atlanta with other civil rights leaders, the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr. described the address as ONE OF THE MOST ELOQUENT, PROFOUND, AND UNEQUIVOCAL PLEAS FOR JUSTICE AND FREEDOM OF ALL MEN, EVER MADE BY ANY PRESIDENT.
Dr King knew that Kennedy was moved by his now famous “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” - written just weeks before. 
To President Kennedy and many Americans Dr. King’s letter was more than than a spirited defense of civil disobedience. It was an indictment of white indifference.
As you listen to the speech, you will hear Kennedy echoing King’s “Letter”
The President rejects the idea that Black Americans should have to wait for equality. "Who among us," Kennedy asks the American people, "would then be content with counsels of patience and delay?"

      <title>Letter from a Birmingham Jail: Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/letter-from-a-birmingham-jail-rev-dr-martin-luther-king-jr</link>
      <description>This week we highlight one of the most significant and consequential calls for racial equality and social justice in American History - “Letter from a Birmingham Jail”
On Good Friday, April 12, 1963 - the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and fellow civil rights leaders were arrested in Birmingham, Alabama as they lead a now famous Campaign of non-violent direct action to protest racial segregation and oppression in that Southern City.
In the early 1960s, Birmingham was one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States - enforced by both law and culture. Black citizens faced legal and economic oppression, and violent retribution when they attempted to even draw attention to these conditions
The Birmingham Campaign would become a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. President Kennedy’s Address to the Nation on Civil Rights, the August 1963 March on Washington and many other events were a direct result of this campaign and Dr. King’s now famous letter.

      <title>Presidential Words Matter: George W. Bush at the National Cathedral</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/presidential-words-matter-george-w-bush-at-the-national-cath</link>
      <description>This week we focus on leadership and comfort in a time of national tragedy, crisis and mourning.
On September 14th 2001 - President George W. Bush spoke at the National Cathedral in Washington at a National Day of Prayer and Remembrance Service.
Just 72 hours earlier - more than 3,000 Americans had been killed during the most lethal terrorist attack in US history. 
The country was still shut down - commercial air travel was grounded. The dead were still being counted. But the president talked of unity. The tragedy whose full toll had yet to be reckoned, could have torn the country apart, but instead it had united the American people and their leadership.
He expressed both empathy for those who lost family, friends and loved ones and a steady resolve that they shall not have died in vain.
In the interest of full disclosure - I joined President Bush’s White House staff less than three months after this speech. I was a Democrat from New York who had worked at both ABC and NBC News. Not the most likely candidate to serve in the West Wing under a Republican President from Texas. 
In the weeks, months and years that followed this speech - the President, his advisors and his Administration myself included - make some serious and consequential mistakes. 
We will spend the rest of our lives trying to rectify those errors and atone for those failings. 
But in the immediate aftermath of that national tragedy- President Bush provided leadership and resolve as well as a few things that the American people desperately needed - comfort, empathy and hope.

      <title>Presidential Words Matter: John F. Kennedy on Civil Rights</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/presidential-words-matter-john-f-kennedy-on-civil-rights</link>
      <description>This week we highlight presidential leadership and one of the most important civil rights speeches ever delivered by a sitting American president.
By June of 1963, John F. Kennedy has been president for nearly two and a half years.
While Kennedy had long privately expressed his deep moral objections to the treatment of black people in American society and indicated support for New federal legislation. 
His public comments ranged from cautious moderate criticism to a 1950s version of “both sides-ism” but were mostly nonexistent.
In June of 1963, however the man and the moment met.
Alabama Governor George Wallace’s staged photo op definance of federal law by standing in the school house doorway had lasted less than 90 minutes. 
On June 11th 1963 two black students were peaceful enrolled at the University of Alabama under the protection of a federalized Alabama National Guard commanded by US Marshals under the direction of the Department of Justice and the Attorney General of the United States.
Kennedy’s advisors recommended and Fully expected that the president would NOT address the American people that evening. 
With a little less than 18 months until to the 1964 elections, the President’s legislative agenda and his political future depended upon the votes Southern Democrats in Congress and those of their politically unforgiving constituents. 
The President had other ideas. Kennedy saw a way to exercise moral leader on an issue where he had to that point failed. He would request Network Television airtime to address the nation on the issue of civil rights. 
The facts and statistics on racial inequality in the United States described by President Kennedy to the American people that evening had even never been acknowledged by a President before - much less spoken in such a detailed and direct language. 
In a telegram to the White House after watching the President’s remarks in Atlanta with other civil rights leaders, the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr. described the address as ONE OF THE MOST ELOQUENT,
 PROFOUND,
 AND UNEQUIVOCAL PLEAS FOR JUSTICE AND FREEDOM OF ALL MEN,
 EVER MADE BY ANY PRESIDENT.
Dr King knew that Kennedy was moved by his now famous “Letter from Birmingham Jail” - written just weeks before. 
To President Kennedy and many Americans Dr. King’s letter was more than than a spirited defense of civil disobedience. It was an indictment of white indifference.
As you listen to the speech, you will hear Kennedy echoing King’s “Letter”
The President rejects the idea that Black Americans should have to wait for equality. "Who among us," Kennedy asks the American people, "would then be content with counsels of patience and delay?"

      <title>Presidential Words Matter: Ronald Reagan's Farewell Address</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/presidential-words-matter-ronald-reagans-farewell-address</link>
      <description>In January of 1989 after 8 years in office, President Ronald Reagan delivered his 34th and final Oval Office address.
His tenure was not without controversy - and there is much about Reagan and his policies for historians and commentators to rightly criticize.
But more than anything else Ronald Reagan understood the power and importance of words.
For his final presidential address Reagan wanted to end on a note of what had become his trademark - optimism.
All of his political life The Gipper had talked about America as a Shining City on a Hill. But he never really defined what he’d meant.
As he prepared to leave office - Reagan finally communicated that vision.
Pay attention to his words - in Reagan’s view America was made great by free trade and the contributions of immigrants.
“If that City had to have walls, those walls had doors and those doors were open to all who had the heart and the will to get here.”
It is a very different message than we hear from those who claim his legacy three decades later.

      <itunes:summary>In January of 1989 after 8 years in office, President Ronald Reagan delivered his 34th and final Oval Office address.
His tenure was not without controversy - and there is much about Reagan and his policies for historians and commentators to rightly criticize.
But more than anything else Ronald Reagan understood the power and importance of words.
For his final presidential address Reagan wanted to end on a note of what had become his trademark - optimism.
All of his political life The Gipper had talked about America as a Shining City on a Hill. But he never really defined what he’d meant.
As he prepared to leave office - Reagan finally communicated that vision.

      <title>SPECIAL: A Tribute to Tim Russert</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/special-a-tribute-to-tim-russert</link>
      <description>Today, on what would have been his 70th birthday, we pay tribute to the late, great Tim Russert - Moderator of Meet the Press and NBC News Washington Bureau Chief.
Unlike many in the public eye - Tim was the same guy off camera as he was on. He was tough, but fair, - always quick with a joke and above all he was forever humbled by his success and the opportunities afforded the son of a sanitation worker from South Buffalo.
“What a country?” Tim would often marvel - he lived by the words of the pious Saint Luke - “To whom much has been given, much will be required.”
Tim believed it was his responsibility as a journalist to hold our leaders accountable - regardless of party. To ask tough, but fair questions in pursuit of the truth.
A lawyer by training, a Meet the Press interview was like a public deposition. He didn’t suffer fools and he wrote his questions so that anything short of a complete and honest answer would be met with a series of increasingly pointed follow ups. When he believed a public official was shading the truth – or worse – Tim would lean across the table and remind them, with purpose:  "Senator, Madame Secretary, Mr. President – Words Matter."
That is his legacy - and for those of us who want to honor him, we must try our best to continue that mission.
So today - on what would have been his 70th birthday - we honor Tim Russert by playing his 2002 Commencement Address at the University of Massachusetts Boston.

      <title>Presidential Words Matter: FDR 1936 Democratic Convention</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/presidential-words-matter-fdr-1936-democratic-convention</link>
      <description>This week, we begin a new series, Presidential Words Matter. Since we currently have a president who doesn't seem to know or even understand the importance of words, especially when they are spoken by the president of the United States, we thought it might be helpful in a time of national crisis to remember that we have had presidents of both parties who did understand this.
These presidents have led our country through difficult times with the power and eloquence of their words.
So this week, we wanted to highlight President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who in 1936 during the Great Depression and as the clouds of war gathered over Europe, delivered one of the most important political speeches ever given by a sitting president.
The occasion was the Democratic National Convention held that year in Philadelphia four years earlier in 1932. FDR had made history by flying to Chicago and becoming the first presidential candidate to accept his party's nomination in person.
In an earlier episode of Words Matter, we discussed this important speech with Professor Harvey Kaye, who has just published a new book entitled: FDR on Democracy.
In his 1936 acceptance speech, Roosevelt used the language of the founders and decried the economic royalists who were trying to fight back against the progress of the New Deal because it threatened their power.
As you listen to his words, pay particular attention to the part where Roosevelt tells his audience they have a rendezvous with destiny.

      <title>ENCORE: The Contenders with Walter Mondale </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/encore-the-contenders-with-walter-mondale</link>
      <description>The Contenders is a special podcast series by Joe Lockhart. Given the importance of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, we thought it important and informative to hear from those people who've actually run for president. What goes into the decision? How do you possibly get to the place of thinking you can take on the toughest job in the world? What were your biggest mistakes as a candidate? What lessons did you learn and what advice do you have for those running against Donald Trump?
Joe recently traveled to Minnesota to interview his former boss, Vice Presidential Walter Mondale. Nearly a quarter century before Sarah Palin was picked by John McCain, it was Walter Mondale who first put a woman on a national ticket when he picked Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.
The former Vice President reflects on that and much more.

      <title>Hill Women - with Cassie Chambers</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/hill-women-with-cassie-chambers</link>
      <description>Our guest this week is a writer, lawyer, speaker and an advocate. Cassie Chambers grew up in Eastern Kentucky, graduated from Yale College, the Yale School of Public Health, the London School of Economics, and Harvard Law School, where she was president of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, a student-run law firm that represents low-income clients.
Cassie received a Skadden Fellowship to return to Kentucky to do legal work with domestic violence survivors in rural communities.
In 2018, Cassie helped pass Jeanette’s Law, which eliminated the requirement that domestic violence survivors pay an incarcerated spouse’s legal fees in order to get a divorce.
Her new book, Hill Women: Finding Family and a Way Forward in the Appalachian Mountains, celebrates the amazingly resilient women in her family and the beloved mountain culture that helped shape her.

      <title>The Presidency &amp; Pandemics </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/the-presidency-pandemics</link>
      <description>Since World War 2, US presidents have had to deal with pandemics as part of their job – the Eisenhower Administration fast-tracked the polio vaccine. Gerald Ford dealt with Swine Flu, Ronald Reagan’s legacy is marred by his Administration’s inaction on AIDS in the 1980s and of course, President Obama confronted the global threat of Ebola.
And now we have the Coronavirus – this week Katie and Joe, talk about the Presidency and pandemics.

      <title>Words Matter Library: Daniel Patrick Moynihan, American Visionary </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-daniel-patrick-moynihan-american-vision</link>
      <description>The Almanac of American Politics described Daniel Patrick Moynihan as “The nation’s best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson.” Before his election to the US Senate in 1976, Moynihan served in the administrations of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford. He was ambassador to India, and U.S. representative to the United Nations, and was four times elected to the U.S. Senate from New York.
This week we are honored to add Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Portrait in Letters of an AmericanVisionary to the Words Matter Audible Library. In this important book, distinguished journalist Steven Weisman compiles a vivid portrait of Moynihan’s life, in the senator’s own words. Moynihan's letters offer an extraordinary window into particular moments in history, from his feelings of loss at JFK’s assassination, to his passionate pleas to Nixon not to make Vietnam a Nixon war, to his frustrations over healthcare and welfare reform during the Clinton era.

      <title>Welcome to 2020!</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/welcome-to-2020</link>
      <description>Happy New Year - Welcome to 2020.
This year will be one of the most - if THE most consequential in American political history.
For the first time ever, a President of the United States runs for re-election after being impeached by the House of Representatives and facing a trial in the US Senate.
Control of both Houses of Congress, the White House and the future of the Supreme Court all hang in the balance.
And in the next few months, Democrats will choose their nominee to take on President Trump in November. But going into Iowa and New Hampshire - after nearly a year of campaigning and a half dozen debates, no clear front runner has emerged.
And now - in addition to all of that - war hangs over the Middle East after US forces assassinated Iran’s highest ranking military leader less than 48 hours into the new year.
Katie and Joe discuss that and more.

      <title>Best of Words Matter Library: The Ginsburg Files</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/best-of-words-matter-library</link>
      <description>In this Best of edition of the Words Matter Library, Katie sits down with Lauren Moxley, the host of The Ginsburg Tapes Podcast  -- which chronicles Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s oral arguments before the then all-male United States Supreme Court from 1972 to 1978 —before she became #Notorious RBG.
The Ginsburg Tapes allows the listener to be a fly on the wall for some of the most important cases in American jurisprudence as future Justice Ginsburg challenged laws treating men and women differently. In between the actually Supreme Court recordings, Lauren puts the cases, the law and even the Justices themselves in historical context and explains how as a lawyer, RBG really did change the World.

      <title>The Professionals Pilot</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/the-professionals-pilot</link>
      <description>This week Katie and Joe preview Joe's new series "The Professionals" where we give you the inside story of what really drives a presidential campaign. We'll break down what makes a campaign successful and why some candidates come up short. Our experts meet two important criteria - they're not actively working on a campaign now (so they can be unbiased) AND they've been involved at a senior level for multiple presidential campaigns.
In the pilot episode Jen Psaki, Paul Begala and Ron Klain take you behind the scenes of presidential debate prep.

      <title>Words Matter Library: Profiles in Courage by John F. Kennedy</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-profiles-in-courage</link>
      <description>As the United States Senate prepares for the Impeachment Trial of President Donald J. Trump, we once again put then-Senator John F. Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize winning book into the Words Matter Library. Profiles in Courage chronicles acts of bravery and integrity by 8 United States Senators. Caroline Kennedy and the late John F. Kennedy Jr. narrate the story of leaders who defied their party and their constituents to do what they felt was right and as a result suffered severe criticism and significant losses. 
History will be watching to see if there are any modern examples of political courage left in Washington.

      <title>Words Matter Library: Verify by Joelle Charbonneau</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-verify-by-joelle-joelle-charbonneau</link>
      <description>This week we put Verify by bestselling author Joelle Charbonneau into the Words Matter Library. This eerily timely, high-stakes page-turner is destined to start important conversations at this particular moment in our history.
Meri Beckley lives in a world without lies. When she looks at the peaceful Chicago streets, she feels pride in the era of unprecedented hope and prosperity over which the governor presides.
But when Meri’s mother is killed, Meri suddenly has questions that no one else seems to be asking. And when she tries to uncover her mother’s state of mind in her last weeks, she finds herself drawn into a secret world with a history she didn’t know existed.
Suddenly, Meri is faced with a choice between accepting the “truth” or embracing a world the government doesn’t want anyone to see—a world where words have the power to change the course of a country and where the wrong ones can get Meri killed.

      <title>Words Matter Library: Cokie Roberts Tribute</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-cokie-roberts-tribute</link>
      <description>Last Month, we lost best-selling author, iconic reporter and journalistic pioneer Mary Martha Corinne Morrison Claiborne Roberts, "Cokie" to her family, friends, colleagues and the tens of millions of Americans who read her column or watched and listened to her every week on NPR and ABC News.
Originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, she learned politics at an early age. Both her father and her mother served for decades in the United States Congress. An award winning political reporter and analyst, Cokie Roberts, along with Eleanor Clift, NPR's Linda Wertheimer and Nina Totenberg transformed the male dominated world of Washington political journalism.
An Emmy Award winner, Cokie Roberts also earned other honors, including the Edward R. Murrow Award, the Everett McKinley Dirksen Award for coverage of Congress and the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. In 2000, she was inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame.
With all the impeachment news weren’t able to properly pay tribute to her life and legacy.
And so, this week, to honor groundbreaking journalist Cokie Roberts, we put her 2013 commencement address at LSU into the Words Matter Library.

      <title>Impeachment &amp; the Press with Margaret Sullivan</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/impeachment-the-press-with-margaret-sullivan</link>
      <description>As the House moves forward with the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, how the press covers it could determine the outcome. This week, Katie and Joe sit down with Margaret Sullivan to talk about impeachment and the press.
Margaret Sullivan is the media columnist for The Washington Post and before that Margaret served as the fifth public editor of The New York Times and was the first woman to hold that position. Margaret is a native of Lackawanna, New York and began her career as a summer intern at the Buffalo News becoming the first woman editor there and managing editor in the hundred and thirty nine year history of that storied newspaper.

      <title>American Elections: Wicked Game Preview </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/american-elections-wicked-game-preview</link>
      <description>This week we preview a great new podcast - American Elections: Wicked Game from Wondery.
On Tuesday, November 3rd, 2020, the citizens of the United States will cast ballots to elect their president, and it feels like the country couldn’t be more divided.
America will have to endure another 58 weeks of shouting, outrage, and the worst sort of political rancor. How has it come to this?
It turns out, it’s almost always been this way. And the 58 weeks we have remaining is just enough time to review the entire history of presidential elections, from the unanimous and inevitable election of George Washington in 1789, to Donald Trump’s surprise electoral victory in 2016

      <title>ICYMI: Barbara Jordan on Impeachment</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/icymi-barbara-jordan-on-impeachment</link>
      <description>On July 25th 1974 Congresswoman Barbara Jordan delivered a televised opening statement as the House Judiciary Committee began consideration of articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon. It is regarded by historians as one of the greatest speeches in all of American history. Congresswoman Jordan offered a passionate and powerful defense of the United States Constitution. A document, she noted, did not include people like her when it was written and completed in 1787.
Congresswoman Jordan also provided thoughtful and well documented explanations of our system of checks and balances which were designed to stop any politician from abusing their power. She stuck to the facts and the law and noted the seriousness and the solemn duty she and her fellow members were about to undertake. As she quoted extensively from the founders Congresswoman Jordan explained that those who had drafted and ratified the Constitution anticipated actions like Nixon's and had created the check of impeachment to guard against such executive overreach and abuse of office.

      <title>Words Matter Library: Eleanor Roosevelt at the United Nations</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-eleanor-roosevelt-at-the-united-nations</link>
      <description>This week, the 74th session of the General Assembly of the United Nations began in New York.
To mark the occasion, we wanted to pay tribute to one of the most important and meaningful accomplishments of that body – the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Adopted at the 3rd UN General Assembly held in Paris –this document -- As Ken Burns notes in The Roosevelts --was history’s first attempt at laying out the principles under which all nations should behave towards their own citizens and as well as towards each other.
It was largely the work of one delegate from the United States, former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. 
This week we put Eleanor Roosevelt’s speech on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into the Words Matter Library.

      <description>This week Katie and Joe take a look at what's happening on Capitol Hill with Julie Hirschfeld Davis the new congressional editor for the The New York Times. Julie has covered politics from Washington for two decades, writing on Congress, three presidential campaigns and three presidents.

      <title>SPECIAL The Contenders with Walter Mondale</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/special-the-contenders-with-walter-mondale</link>
      <description>The Contenders is a special podcast series by Joe Lockhart. Given the importance of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, we thought it important and informative to hear from those people who've actually run for president. What goes into the decision? How do you possibly get to the place of thinking you can take on the toughest job in the world? What were your biggest mistakes as a candidate? What lessons did you learn and what advice do you have for those running against Donald Trump?
Joe recently traveled to Minnesota to interview his former boss, Vice Presidential Walter Mondale. Nearly a quarter century before Sarah Palin was picked by John McCain, it was Walter Mondale who first put a woman on a national ticket when he picked Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.
The former Vice President reflects on that and much more.

      <title>Words Matter Library: 56th Anniversary of the March on Washington</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-56th-anniversary-of-the-march-on-washin</link>
      <description>It was one of the defining moments of the civil rights movement and one of the most iconic speeches in American history.
56 years ago this week The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, or the March on Washington, was held in the Nation’s Capital on Wednesday, August 28, 1963. 
More than 250,000 people turned out to advocate for the civil and economic rights of black Americans. At was here, standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial, that the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his historic "I Have a Dream" speech.
Dr. King considered the words in Declaration of Independence and the Constitution as a “scared obligation” -- he believed that the Founders and their descendants should be held accountable. 
For Dr. King and millions of others – America would only become great when this dream was fully realized and this country finally lived up to its founding words. 
This week we put Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech into the Words Matter Library

      <title>Final Word: Toni Morrison</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/final-word-toni-morrison</link>
      <description>Last week we lost one of the most influential and celebrated novelists in American literary history Toni Morrison. A novelist, essayist and Princeton Professor, Morrison wrote nine major novels -- all of which earned extensive critical acclaim. 
Among dozens of other awards and achievements, she won both a Pulitzer Prize and American Book Award in 1988 for her novel Beloved. And in 1993, Toni Morrison became the first black woman of any nationality to win a Nobel Prize.
The citation for her award in literature declared Morrison to be an author “who in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality.” 
In 2012, Toni Morrison was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.
In commencement address at Rutgers University in 2011, Toni Morrison encouraged graduates to seek a meaningful life -- something she herself had certainly achieved.

      <title>The Threat of White Nationalist Terrorism </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/the-threat-of-domestic-terrorism</link>
      <description>Is the federal government doing enough to fight domestic terrorism? This week we talk to one former senior law enforcement official who says no. For nearly two decades, Daryl Johnson was senior domestic terrorism analyst at the Department of Homeland Security and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Back in 2009 he wrote a DHS Report on “Rightwing Extremism” that was widely circulated in the law enforcement community and was leaked to the press.
Instead of taking action, Republicans on Capitol Hill attacked his findings.
Johnson explains how and why Donald Trump's election changed the pattern of extreme white nationalists and what can be done about it.

      <title>ICYMI: Shannon Watts "Fight Like a Mother"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/icymi-shannon-watts-fight-like-a-mother</link>
      <description>Shannon Watts is the author of Fight like a Mother – How a Grassroots Movement took on the Gun Lobby and Why Women will Change the World.
Until December of 2012 Shannon Watts was a stay-at-home mother of five and former communications executive.
The day after the Sandy Hook tragedy, Shannon Watts started a Facebook group with the message that all Americans can and should do more to reduce gun violence.
That online conversation turned into a grassroots movement -- Moms Demand Action which now has a chapter in every state and is part of Everytown for Gun Safety, the largest gun violence prevention organization in the country with nearly 6 million members.
She is also an active board member of Emerge America, one of the leading organizations for recruiting and training women to run for office.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/can-racism-win</link>
      <description>Over the last few weeks, Donald Trump has left no doubt that he is a racist. He has also made it clear -- race will be perhaps THE biggest issue in 2020. 
The question is: Can racism win?
This week Katie and Joe talk to Keith Boykin. Keith is a CNN political commentator, New York Times best-selling author, and a former White House aide to President Bill Clinton. Keith teaches at the Institute for Research in African-American Studies at Columbia University in New York and previously taught at American University in Washington, D.C.

      <title>Words Matter Library: The Ginsburg Tapes</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-the-ginsberg-tapes</link>
      <description>This week we sit down with Lauren Moxley, the host of The Ginsburg Tapes Podcast  -- which chronicles Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s oral arguments before the then all-male United States Supreme Court from 1972 to 1978 —before she became #Notorious RBG.
The Ginsburg Tapes allows the listener to be a fly on the wall for some of the most important cases in American jurisprudence as future Justice Ginsburg challenged laws treating men and women differently. In between the actually Supreme Court recordings, Lauren puts the cases, the law and even the Justices themselves in historical context and explains how as a lawyer, RBG really did change the World.

      <description>Few know more about the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation than our guest this week, former Justice Department and FBI senior official James A. Baker. 
From 2014 to 2017 Mr. Baker was general counsel of the FBI and was involved in the initial and some of the most important aspects of the investigation into Russia's attack on the 2016 presidential election. 
We talk to Jim Baker about that, Robert Mueller's testimony and if our government is doing enough to ensure that the 2020 election is free from foreign influence.

      <title>Final Word: Barbara Jordan on Impeachment</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/barbara-jordan</link>
      <description>Barbara Jordan was a lawyer educator politician and a leader of the civil rights movement a Democrat and Houston native. Jordan was the first African-American elected to the Texas Senate after Reconstruction and the first southern African-American woman elected to the United States House of Representatives.
On July 25th 1974 Congresswoman Jordan delivered a televised opening statement as the House Judiciary Committee began consideration of articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon. It is regarded by historians as one of the greatest speeches in all of American history. Congresswoman Jordan offered a passionate and powerful defense of the United States Constitution. A document, she noted, did not include people like her when it was written and completed in 1787.
Congresswoman Jordan also provided thoughtful and well documented explanations of our system of checks and balances which were designed to stop any politician from abusing their power. She stuck to the facts and the law and noted the seriousness and the solemn duty she and her fellow members were about to undertake. As she quoted extensively from the founders Congresswoman Jordan explained that those who had drafted and ratified the Constitution anticipated actions like Nixon's and had created the check of impeachment to guard against such executive overreach and abuse of office. So this week we give Congresswoman Barbara Jordan the Final Word.

      <title>The Latest from Trumpistan </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/last-week-in-trumpistan</link>
      <description>This week Katie and Joe review the Trump Family's Excellent Adventure: Part II - Ivanka Trump's prominent role at the G20 and the photo-op diplomacy in North Korea. They also discuss how Donald Trump tried to turn a national celebration into a celebration of himself.
And last week Gold Star parent Khzir Khan welcomed new citizens to this country as he delivered the keynote address in Charlottesville Virginia at Monticello’s annual Independence Day Celebration and Naturalization Ceremony. Khan and his wife Ghazala moved to the United States in 1980 and became citizens six years later, in 2004. Their son U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan was killed while serving in Iraq. This week we give proud American and Gold Star parent Khzir Khan the Final Word.

      <title>SPECIAL The Declaration of Independence - Read by John F. Kennedy</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/the-declaration-of-independence-read-by-john-f-kennedy</link>
      <description>On July 4th we celebrate the birth of the American Experiment. The Declaration of Independence -- written in the Spring of 1776 by a 33 year old Thomas Jefferson -- is America’s mission statement. And like all mission statements, the words represented not what we were, but what we aspired to be. In fact, the author himself was a gifted writer, but a deeply flawed person who – like his country -- did not embody the ideas and ideal of that document.
For more than two hundred and forty years, the story of America has been the struggle between those who want to move us close to the words of our mission statement – and those who want to stop them.
It is often forgotten that the Declaration itself was meant to be spoken. 
In 2004 the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library released a previously unknown 1957 recording of then-Senator Kennedy reading the Declaration of Independence in New York on July 4th.
So this week to honor Independence Day -- And to remind ourselves that as a country must continue the struggle to turn America’s founding words into reality – we give John F. Kennedy’s reading of the Declaration of Independence the final word.

      <title>Words Matter Library: Shannon Watts</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-shannon-watts</link>
      <description>Shannon Watts is the author of Fight like a Mother – How a Grassroots Movement took on the Gun Lobby and Why Women will Change the World.
Until December of 2012 Shannon Watts was a stay-at-home mother of five and former communications executive.
The day after the Sandy Hook tragedy, Shannon Watts started a Facebook group with the message that all Americans can and should do more to reduce gun violence.
That online conversation turned into a grassroots movement -- Moms Demand Action which now has a chapter in every state and is part of Everytown for Gun Safety, the largest gun violence prevention organization in the country with nearly 6 million members.
She is also an active board member of Emerge America, one of the leading organizations for recruiting and training women to run for office.

      <itunes:summary>Shannon Watts is the author of Fight like a Mother – How a Grassroots Movement took on the Gun Lobby and Why Women will Change the World.
Until December of 2012 Shannon Watts was a stay-at-home mother of five and former communications executive.
The day after the Sandy Hook tragedy, Shannon Watts started a Facebook group with the message that all Americans can and should do more to reduce gun violence.
That online conversation turned into a grassroots movement -- Moms Demand Action which now has a chapter in every state and is part of Everytown for Gun Safety, the largest gun violence prevention organization in the country with nearly 6 million members.
She is also an active board member of Emerge America, one of the leading organizations for recruiting and training women to run for office.

      <title>Special Final Word: 75th Anniversary of D-Day</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/special-final-word-75th-anniversary-of-d-day</link>
      <description>75 years ago this week -- on June 6, 1944 soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force undertook the largest amphibious invasion in military history.
More than 150,000 U.S., British and Canadian troops, landed on the heavily fortified beaches of Normandy to liberate France and the Continent from 4 years of brutal Nazi Occupation.
As the operation began, Armed Forces Radio broadcast a message to the troops from the Supreme Allied Commander and future President, General Dwight D. Eisenhower.
General Eisenhower knew that many under his command would not survive the landing – and more than 4,000 people were lost that day.
But as he sent his troops into battle, General Eisenhower expressed confidence in their courage – and told them that the righteousness of their great and noble cause would eventually lead to victory over the forces of fascism, tyranny and oppression.
So to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day we give Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower the final word.

      <title>Special Final Word: 65th Anniversary of Brown vs. Board of Education</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/special-final-word-65th-anniversary-of-brown-vs-board-of-edu</link>
      <description>Last week was the 65th Anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education. This week the final word goes to the woman behind the case. Linda Brown was in the third grade when her father Oliver tried to enroll her in Sumner Elementary School in Topeka Kansas. Oliver and his daughter Linda were denied admission to the school that day. The year was 1950. Sumner was an all-white school. And Linda attended the school for black children across town. Separate but equal ruled the day in America. The moment Linda was turned away, it started a series of events that toppled the idea of separate but equal and led her all the way to the steps of the Supreme Court of the United States. Linda's father was the named plaintiff in the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education.
This week, we give education pioneer and civil rights icon Linda Brown, the final word.

      <title>Words Matter Library: Max Boot - Why I Left the Right</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-max-boot-why-i-left-the-right</link>
      <description>This week we put The Corrosion of Conservatism: Why I Left the Right, by Max Boot into the Words Matter Library. Washington Post Columnist Max Boot details his ideological journey from a “movement” conservative to a man without a party, beginning with his political coming-of-age as a young émigré from the Soviet Union, enthralled with the National Review and the conservative intellectual tradition of Russell Kirk and F. A. Hayek. Against this personal odyssey, Max simultaneously traces the evolution of modern American conservatism, jump-started by Barry Goldwater’s canonical The Conscience of a Conservative, to the rise of Trumpism and its gradual corrosion of what was once the Republican Party.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/special-the-great-impeachment-debate-round-1</link>
      <description>To impeach or not to impeach -- that is the question. This week our own Joe Lockhart had a op-ed column published in The New York Times under the headline: “There’s a Prize Bigger than Impeachment” -- that followed a Times column back in March by our friend Philippe Reines co-Host of the new podcast Unredacted with Emily Brandwin and Molly Jong Fast, entitled --  “Why Impeaching Trump is ‘Worth It’”. Philippe's argument was the exact opposite of Joe's.
So, they decided to debate the issue face to face on Words Matter.  Katie moderates Round 1 of the Great Impeachment Debate.

      <title>Words Matter Library: Zucked by Roger McNamee</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-zucked-by-roger-mcnamee</link>
      <description>The New York Times bestseller about a noted tech venture capitalist, early mentor to Mark Zuckerberg, and Facebook investor, who wakes up to the serious damage Facebook is doing to our society – and sets out to try to stop it. 
This week we add ZUCKED by Roger McNamee to the Words Matter Library. It’s a story that begins with a series of rude awakenings. First there is the author’s dawning realization that the platform is being manipulated by some very bad actors. Then there is the even more unsettling realization that Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are unable or unwilling to share his concerns, polite as they may be to his face. 
And then comes the election of Donald Trump, and the emergence of one horrific piece of news after another about the malign ends to which the Facebook platform has been put. To McNamee’s shock, even still Facebook’s leaders duck and dissemble, viewing the matter as a public relations problem. Now thoroughly alienated, McNamee digs into the issue, and fortuitously meets up with some fellow travelers who share his concern, and help him sharpen its focus. Soon he and a dream team of Silicon Valley technologists are charging into the fray, to raise consciousness about the existential threat of Facebook, and the persuasion architecture of the attention economy more broadly — to our public health and to our political order.

Listen to Nina talk with Katie about the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, the Mueller Report and executive privilege and her special friendship with the Terminator -- former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

      <title>Words Matter Library: Daniel Patrick Moynihan - A Portrait in Letters </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-daniel-patrick-moynihan-a-portrait-in-l</link>
      <description>The Almanac of American Politics described Daniel Patrick Moynihan as “The nation’s best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson.” Before his election to the US Senate in 1976, Moynihan served in the administrations of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford. He was ambassador to India, and U.S. representative to the United Nations, and was four times elected to the U.S. Senate from New York.
This week we are honored to add Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Portrait in Letters of an American Visionary to the Words Matter Audible Library. In this important book, distinguished journalist Steven Weisman compiles a vivid portrait of Moynihan’s life, in the senator’s own words. Moynihan's letters offer an extraordinary window into particular moments in history, from his feelings of loss at JFK’s assassination, to his passionate pleas to Nixon not to make Vietnam a Nixon war, to his frustrations over healthcare and welfare reform during the Clinton era.

      <title>Final Word - Linda Brown</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/final-word-linda-brown</link>
      <description>Linda Brown was in the third grade when her father Oliver tried to enroll her in Sumner Elementary School in Topeka Kansas. Oliver and his daughter Linda were denied admission to the school that day. The year was 1950. Sumner was an all-white school. And Linda attended the school for black children across town. Separate but equal ruled the day in America. The moment Linda was turned away, it started a series of events that toppled the idea of separate but equal and led her all the way to the steps of the Supreme Court of the United States. Linda's father was the named plaintiff in the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education.
This week, we give education pioneer and civil rights icon Linda Brown, the final word.

      <title>Meet Joe Lockhart</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/meet-joe-lockhart</link>
      <description>Last week we talked to Former White Press Secretary Joe Lockhart about the news of the day how the Mueller investigation operates differently than the Starr investigation operated and how the White House in crisis battles with a hostile Congress and communicates with the press and the American people.
Our listeners wanted to hear more -- so we invited him back.
Joe served as the 19th White House Press Secretary under President Bill Clinton from 1998-2000. In 1999, Joe became the only White House Press Secretary in American history to serve during the Senate Impeachment Trial of a US President. Later Joe co-founded the Glover Park Group and went on to serve as Senior Vice President of the National Football League. Joe is currently a CNN political analyst and Vice Chairman of Edelman Public Relations.

      <title>Words Matter Library: Power Wars by Charlie Savage</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/words-matter-library-power-wars-by-charlie-savage</link>
      <description>This week we put Power Wars, by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Washington correspondent for The New York Times, Charlie Savage into the Words Matter Audible Library.
First published in 2015, Power Wars is an investigative history of national-security legal policymaking in the Obama administration. Charlie is also the author of Takeover, published in 2007, which chronicles the Bush-Cheney administration’s efforts to expand presidential power.
Charlie has been covering post-9/11 issues — including national security, individual rights and the rule of law — since 2003, when he was a reporter for The Miami Herald. Later that year, he joined the Washington bureau of The Boston Globe; he moved to the Washington bureau of The New York Times in 2008. He has also co-taught a seminar on national security and the Constitution at Georgetown University.

      <title>The Show Goes On - Max Boot Interview </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/the-show-goes-on-max-boot-interview</link>
      <description>Washington Post Columnist Max Boot is the Jeane J. Kirkpatrick Senior Fellow in National Security Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a Global Affairs Analyst for CNN. In his latest book, The Corrosion of Conservatism: Why I Left the Right, Max details his ideological journey from a “movement” conservative to a man without a party, beginning with his political coming-of-age as a young émigré from the Soviet Union, enthralled with the National Review and the conservative intellectual tradition of Russell Kirk and F. A. Hayek. Against this personal odyssey, Boot simultaneously traces the evolution of modern American conservatism, jump-started by Barry Goldwater’s canonical The Conscience of a Conservative, to the rise of Trumpism and its gradual corrosion of what was once the Republican Party.

      <title>Steve's Final Episode</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/steves-final-episode</link>
      <description>Steve sits down with Elise and Adam in his first podcast interview since Howard Schultz announced on 60 Minutes that he was "seriously considering" an independent bid for President of the United States. In 2019, a billionaire thinking about running for president is a topic of great consequence. As Steve himself has reminded us again and again over the last two years, these are extraordinarily dangerous times, and the very future of our republic may hang in the balance. We believe that at this pivotal moment in our history, words do have power and they do have consequences. Don't miss Steve's final appearance on the podcast.

      <title>Shutdown Fallout</title>
      <link>https://www.wordsmattermedia.com/</link>
      <description>The 35-day federal government shutdown may be over - for now - but the long terms effects will be felt by hard working Americans for months and perhaps years to come. $200 million in spending per week was lost not only by federal workers, but contractors and the people working in businesses that count on those dollars to survive. Elise and Steve discuss the political fallout from Donald Trump’s PR stunt gone horribly wrong.

      <description>This week, to honor legacy of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr we proudly put “A Letter from Birmingham Jail” and “Where Do We Go from Here?” into the Words Matter Audible Library. There is perhaps no leader or public figure who symbolizes the power and importance of words better than Dr. King. Both of these Audible titles are historical treasures which are all too relevant today.

      <title>Professor Eddie Glaude, Jr. on Race in America</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/professor-eddie-glaude-jr-on-race-in-america</link>
      <description>Professor Eddie Glaude Jr. argues in his groundbreaking book Democracy in Black that we live in a country founded on a “value gap”—with white lives valued more than others—that still distorts our politics today. Whether discussing why all Americans have racial habits that reinforce inequality, why black politics based on the civil-rights era have reached a dead end, or why only remaking democracy from the ground up can bring real change, Professor Glaude crystallizes the untenable position of black America--and offers thoughts on a better way forward. Forceful in ideas and unsettling in its candor, Democracy in Black is a landmark book on race in America.

      <title>Remembering 41</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/remembering-41</link>
      <description>George H. W. Bush was a man of honor, courage, integrity and kindness. The last of the "greatest generation" to serve as Commander-in-Chief, the 41st President of the United States will be remembered for many things -- not the least of which is his humanity. Few "great" people are also "good" people, George H. W. Bush was both -- and he will be missed.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/words-matter/episodes/an-interview-with-firing-line-host-margaret-hoover</link>
      <description>Welcome to "Words Matter" with Elise Jordan and Steve Schmidt. Our goal here is to promote reality. As a wise man once said, "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, not their own facts." Words have power and they have consequences. In this episode we will explore the questions: How did we arrive at this political moment? Will the Republican Party and the conservative movement survive President Trump and Trumpism? And if the GOP survives, what does it look like and who leads it? We will explore these questions with "Firing Line" host and conservative author Margaret Hoover.
