			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">A prick of the skin; the sorrow of grief; the inevitability of change; our dependence on the whim of the cosmos. Suffering bleeds into every aspect of our existence and, according to Siddhārtha Gautama (the Buddha), the anguish of our misfortune stems from our ignorance and confusion. If we were to see the world for how it really is – a place of impermanence, interdependence, and emptiness – then, according to Buddhism, we might free ourselves from illusion and discover the path to liberation and enlightenment. Today, this insight is shared by over half a billion people. Yet, most philosophy departments in Europe and America offer no courses in Buddhist philosophy and (within the leading journals) academic papers focusing on the central tenets of Buddhist philosophy of religion are vastly outweighed by their Abrahamic (and predominantly Christian) counterparts.</p> <p class="">Professor Jay Garfield, our guest for this episode, is the exception to this rule. Championing the globalisation of philosophy and reshaping perceptions of Buddhist scholarship, Professor Garfield is Chair of Philosophy at Smith College in Massachusetts, Visiting Professor at Harvard Divinity School, Professor at Melbourne University, and adjunct Professor at the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies. Named amongst the 50 most influential philosophers of the past decade – with over 30 books and over 200 publications – it is safe to say that Professor Garfield is one of the leading exponents of Buddhist philosophy in contemporary academia.</p> <p class="">For Garfield, if philosophy won’t diversify, then let’s call it out for what it is: a colonial discipline that ignores the rich and relevant insights of non-Western thought. As philosophers, we cannot afford to ignore the metaphysical, ethical, epistemological, and existential insights of Buddhist scholarship. It’s time to engage with Buddhism, and rid ourselves of our prejudices, ignorance, and confusion. Buddhism is a philosophy of the present, not a philosophy of the past, and it’s time we treated it that way.</p> <div id="block-f5a73868521bd86256d7" class= "sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule" data-block-type="47"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id="block-201e5ec787c77c0b332f" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class="">This episode is produced in partnership with <a href= "https://www.global-philosophy.org/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">The Global Philosophy of Religion Project</a> at <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/ptr/departments/philosophy/research/projects/global-philosophy-of-religion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Birmingham</a>, led by <a href="https://www.yujinnagasawa.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Yujin Nagasawa</a> and funded by the <a href= "https://www.templeton.org/grant/the-global-philosophy-of-religion-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Templeton Foundation</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id="block-85ca32300908de488ab0" class= "sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule" data-block-type="47"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id="block-ceff1892eba6926f34b9" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p class="">On April 11, 1961, a Monster was put on trial in the state of Israel and broadcasted to the world. The Monster, who was housed in a glass box, was accused of crimes against humanity and the Jewish people – of knowingly sending hundreds of thousands of people to their deaths. When the trial commenced, and the Monster was asked how he pleaded, he answered, ‘Not guilty, in the sense of the indictment.’</p> <p class="">As the trial proceeded, the Monster portrayed himself as a cog in a machine. He was a cog who was helpless to stop the inevitable – a cog that was merely performing its duty. To some who observed the trial, the ‘Monster’ who sat before them appeared all too human. Behind the glass, there was no demonic essence of evil. The Monster was, in fact, an average person: a normal person who was capable of committing terrifyingly evil acts.</p> <p class="">One observer went as far as to say that the manner in which the accused spoke, and the way he framed his story, was evidence that he simply lacked the ability to think. To this observer, it was no radical evildoer who sat in the glass box. In fact, his professed motives, and his inability to avoid cliches, were evidence of his banality.</p> <div id="block-998c3c14fb2724bbd417" class= "sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule" data-block-type="47"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id="block-07235e0bbc60bde69c19" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class="">Music produced by <a href="https://ovidiusmd.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ovidiu Balaban</a> – all rights reserved.</p> </div> </div> <div id="block-998c3c14fb2724bbd417" class= "sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule" data-block-type="47"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id="block-07235e0bbc60bde69c19" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p class="">“How did the universe come into existence?” It’s a question that most of the world’s religions seek to answer. According to the Abrahamic faiths, the world can only exist with the existence of a being who was not caused by something other than itself – and this they call ‘Yahweh’, ‘Allāh’, or ‘God’. Philosophical arguments to this end come in many forms, one of which – from the medieval Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (known in the West as ‘Avicenna’) ­­­– claims that we can prove the existence of this necessary being with absolute certainty.<em> If</em> something can<em> </em>exist there must be an uncaused being, and from this concept alone, Avicenna says that we can deduce every other property that Muslims attribute to Allāh.</p> <p class="">In this interview, we’ll be discussing Avicenna and the philosophy of Islam with Dr Mohammad Saleh Zarepour. Currently Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Manchester, Dr Zarepour completed his first PhD at the Tarbiat Modares University in Iran and his second PhD at the University of Cambridge. Publishing extensively in philosophy of religion – and having worked on major initiatives such as the Global Philosophy of Religion Project – it is safe to say that Saleh is one of the world’s leading experts in Islamic philosophy.</p> <p class="">Islam claims to solve the problem of existence, but its implications extend far beyond the origin of the cosmos. Allāh is a being invested in his creation – a being that will judge, reward, or punish us for our good and bad deeds, who permits us to live and to suffer – and differs from the God of Judaism and Christianity in his nature and actions. Thus, we should ask not only whether belief in Allāh’s necessity is reasonable, but whether the beliefs of Muslims are more (or less) reasonable than those of their Abrahamic cousins.</p> <div id="block-316fe42ce5dc58428d29" class= "sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule" data-block-type="47"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id="block-05e948912c574d05eaa2" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class="">This episode is produced in partnership with <a href= "https://www.global-philosophy.org/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">The Global Philosophy of Religion Project</a> at <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/ptr/departments/philosophy/research/projects/global-philosophy-of-religion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Birmingham</a>, led by <a href="https://www.yujinnagasawa.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Yujin Nagasawa</a> and funded by the <a href= "https://www.templeton.org/grant/the-global-philosophy-of-religion-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Templeton Foundation</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id="block-6b4d6d572327bedcf1c9" class= "sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule" data-block-type="47"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id="block-6aeb638dbf916f0cb8db" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>Art is created by people, but people are fallible. When the art we love is tainted by the brush of an artist’s biography, we must ask whether the shift in our aesthetic experience is reasonable. One might also wonder whether artworks can do wrong in and of themselves. If artworks can be intended as conveyers of truth, can they convey falsehoods or – more awkwardly – lies? These aren’t just conceptual problems. If artworks lie and immoral artists are inseparable from their artworks, how should we respond? Should we censor all art, some art, or no art at all?</p> <p>In this episode, we’ll be discussing the ethics of art with Cambridge University’s Dr Daisy Dixon. Dixon’s work, which explores the nature of (and responses to) unethical art, invites us to place art within its context – to consider artworks in relation to their artists, truth-functionality in relation to an artwork’s surroundings, and dangerous artworks in relation to their curation. If we do so, says Dixon, we’ll not only gain a better understanding of art but how we can bring about a better world.</p> <div id="block-31e644273b15e59bab6e" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to ‘Episode 105 (Part II of II)’, in which we’ll be analysing Hauskeller’s argument against transhumanist approaches to animals.</p> <p>We are all prisoners of our biology. Whether humans (and our non-human cousins) have the capacity to think, feel, or fly is dictated by their DNA, long before they have a say in the matter. It’s a living lottery that has lifted human beings to lofty heights; that is, above the world’s lowly, lesser creatures. With the emergence of new technologies, the age of the transhumanists is upon us: philosophers and scientists who believe that the lottery should be rigged towards self-design and the elimination of suffering. We have a moral imperative, say the transhumanists, to engineer a world that is better for everybody: to seek out technological solutions to ethical problems, not just for ourselves but the rest of the animal kingdom. After all, the question is not, ‘can they reason?’ – nor ‘can they talk?’ – but ‘can they suffer?’</p> <p>In this episode, we’ll be discussing animals in transhumanism with Professor of Philosophy and Head of Department at the University of Liverpool, Michael Hauskeller. With over two hundred publications – across a vast range of philosophical questions – in both academic and public philosophy, Professor Hauskeller is, undoubtedly, one of the world’s most prominent philosophers. For Hauskeller, philosophy helps us navigate ourselves towards a better tomorrow: through philosophy, we can discover what kind of people we want to be, in what kind of world we want to live, and how we should steer the futures of our fellow creatures.</p> <p>Our question for today: should we take pity on the world’s poor brutes – those who live such lowly lives – and lift them up to our own lofty heights?

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1642698488213_639" class="">If we want to improve our public discourse, we must aim to be as objective as possible. When we raise our consciousness and work towards clearing our minds of personal interests, political affiliations, and the sophistry of art, we grow closer to rationality and knowledge.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Introduction</p> <p class="">Given the choice, who wouldn’t increase the balance in their bank account, switch into a fit and healthy body, find themselves in a meaningful career, and cultivate happiness and love in their relationships? These are preferences we all share, but few of us achieve them. Perhaps we could, if only we made better choices. We all want to make better decisions – the salad over the burger, the restful night’s sleep over ‘one more episode’ – yet we continue to succumb to our desires. Perhaps we need some help: maybe we need something to nudge us in the right direction?</p> <p class="">In this episode, we’ll be discussing the philosophy of nudges with Professor Thomas Schramme. Chair of Philosophy at the University of Liverpool, Thomas’s research focuses on moral and political philosophy and the philosophy of health and medicine. With over one hundred publications and heading several innovative projects – including ‘How Does it Feel? Interpersonal Understanding and Affective Empathy’ – Professor Schramme is not only an expert in his field but always communicates his ideas through accessible and engaging prose.</p> <p class="">As we’ll find in this interview, Schramme challenges some of the most prominent ideas in contemporary politics and psychology. According to Daniel Kehneman, nudges ‘have changed the world’… but, asks Schramme, do they always change it for the better?</p>       <p>This episode is produced in partnership with the <a href= "https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/philosophy/research/research-projects/philosophy-and-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philosophy and the Future</a> project at the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/philosophy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Liverpool</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">The existence of God is the most discussed, and perhaps the most important, question in philosophy.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine the smile on your parent’s face as you rush to meet them at the school gates, the soft heat of the sand between your toes on a first holiday, waking up in the haze of a late afternoon after dancing all night, the drop in your stomach when you realize you’ll never hear their voice again. These are conscious experiences. Without them, what is there to life? In this sense, we all know what consciousness is – there’s nothing we know more intimately – yet it remains one of life’s greatest mysteries. Despite the incredible advances made in physical science, it doesn’t seem like we’re any closer to an explanation of where consciousness comes from. How is it, exactly, that the brain’s 86 billion neurons give rise to conscious experience?

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">A philosophical education can feel like a long and arduous path. Sometimes you think you have seen the light; you think that you have knowledge, only to discover you knew nothing. It is times like this where the learner must examine their blind spots and begin their path to understanding once again while accepting that the next attempt might too end where it began.</p> <p class="">The philosopher Plato likened this path to the ascent from a dark cave up into the light of the sun. He also said that those who have seen the illuminated world above have a responsibility to go back to show others the way. Today we go back, not because we have seen the sun, but because we have travelled the path enough to know we can do a little better than we did before. The blind leading the blind? Perhaps, but we might stumble into something interesting along the way.</p> <div id="block-e1ee89fc8309d5f94acf" class= "sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule" data-block-type="47"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id="block-64616ee465d03bc19fbe" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1625831692128_675" class="sqs-block-content"> <p class="">With special thanks to the following creators for their sound samples.</p> <p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1625831692128_674" class=""><a href= "https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/431117/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">InspectorJ</a>, <a href= "https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/411791/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">InspectorJ(2)</a>, <a href= "https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/353194/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">InspectorJ(3)</a>, <a href= "https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/398702/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">InspectorJ(4)</a>, <a href= "https://freesound.org/people/straget/sounds/405423/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">straget</a>, <a id= "yui_3_17_2_1_1625831692128_673" href= "https://freesound.org/people/jameswrowles/sounds/207783/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener" name= "yui_3_17_2_1_1625831692128_673">jameswrowles</a>, <a href= "https://freesound.org/people/JG_Booysen/sounds/353093/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">JG_Booysen</a>, <a href= "https://freesound.org/people/ethang/sounds/88795/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethang</a>, <a href= "https://freesound.org/people/womb_affliction/sounds/330707/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">womb_affliction</a>, <a href= "https://freesound.org/people/bennychico11/sounds/44407/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">bennychico11</a>, <a href= "https://freesound.org/people/HerbertBoland/sounds/28239/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">HerbertBoland</a>, <a href= "https://freesound.org/people/ShadyDave/sounds/262259/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">ShadyDave</a>, and <a href= "https://freesound.org/people/3bagbrew/sounds/59569/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">3bagbrew</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id="block-cf9ee309d67dccf815df" class= "sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule" data-block-type="47"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id="block-fb97b02d39a7b80fa2c9" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p class="">It cannot have escaped your attention that there is a small contingent of our nation that poses a threat to our way of life.</p> <p class="">They want us to stop farming our most prized delicacy on the grounds of their ‘moral concerns’. We must not let them push us around. As you well know, it has always been an important part of our culture. Why should we assume that this small group of radicals have got it right and that our ancestors have all been wrong? Think of all the memories we’ve shared when eating the meat around the table with our families. It is a wonderful thing.</p> <p class="">Secondly, I have yet to come across anyone who doesn’t gain great satisfaction from the delicious taste of the meat. Whether it is in patties, ground mince or slices, it is enjoyed by billions every day. Imagine the backlash if we showed sympathy to the radicals! Think about all the businesses that rely on meat for their income. It would be political suicide.</p> <p class="">Finally, and most importantly, we must always remember the natural order of things. We are top of the food chain, and it is our right to exercise our dominion. Every test we have conducted on the creatures have proven them to be inferior, be it intelligence, strength, or a capacity to live what we’d all say is a fulfilling life.</p> <p class="">I know that you must feel the same; all I ask is for permission to deal with the radicals.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Introduction</p> <p class="">It cannot have escaped your attention that there is a small contingent of our nation that poses a threat to our way of life.</p> <p class="">They want us to stop farming our most prized delicacy on the grounds of their ‘moral concerns’. We must not let them push us around. As you well know, it has always been an important part of our culture. Why should we assume that this small group of radicals have got it right and that our ancestors have all been wrong? Think of all the memories we’ve shared when eating the meat around the table with our families. It is a wonderful thing.</p> <p class="">Secondly, I have yet to come across anyone who doesn’t gain great satisfaction from the delicious taste of the meat. Whether it is in patties, ground mince or slices, it is enjoyed by billions every day. Imagine the backlash if we showed sympathy to the radicals! Think about all the businesses that rely on meat for their income. It would be political suicide.</p> <p class="">Finally, and most importantly, we must always remember the natural order of things. We are top of the food chain, and it is our right to exercise our dominion. Every test we have conducted on the creatures have proven them to be inferior, be it intelligence, strength, or a capacity to live what we’d all say is a fulfilling life.</p> <p class="">I know that you must feel the same; all I ask is for permission to deal with the radicals.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>Christianity is the largest religion in the world: with almost 2.5 billion followers across the globe, nearly one in three people have faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Essential to the Christian worldview is the belief that the universe was created by a maximally great God: a being who is invested in the moral lives of his people and offers salvation to all who embrace his teachings. He is a God of three persons, a God of maximal power and intelligence, and a God who loves us all unconditionally. For many Christians, this belief is a matter of faith, but is this faith reasonable?</p> <p>Joining us this episode to discuss the nature and existence of God is Visiting Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology and Professor of Philosophy at Houston Baptist University, Dr William Lane Craig. With over thirty books and two hundred publications, Dr Craig has had a profound and lasting impact on academic debates within philosophy and theology. As well as being one of the leading philosophers of our time, Dr Craig’s work extends beyond the dusty chalkboards of university campuses. As the founder of the hugely popular non-profit organisation Reasonable Faith, Dr Craig is best known for his online lectures and for taking on the world’s most prominent philosophers and scientists in defence of Christianity. In the words of James Porter Moreland, ‘It is hard to overstate the impact that William Lane Craig has had for the cause of Christ. He is simply the finest Christian apologist of the last half century.’</p> <p>Without God, says Craig, morality is groundless, metaphysics is hopeless, and life is meaningless. The God of Christianity is the wellspring from which all life and values come into being. It is God who made us without dust, and it is to God to whom we shall return.</p> <p><strong>Global Philosophy of Religion</strong></p> <div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1621784338235_7326" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class="">This episode is produced in partnership with <a href= "https://www.global-philosophy.org/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">The Global Philosophy of Religion Project</a> at <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/ptr/departments/philosophy/research/projects/global-philosophy-of-religion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Birmingham</a>, led by <a href="https://www.yujinnagasawa.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Yujin Nagasawa</a> and funded by the <a href= "https://www.templeton.org/grant/the-global-philosophy-of-religion-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Templeton Foundation</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1621784338235_6553" class= "sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule" data-block-type="47"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> </div> </div> <div id="block-183a6e33ff6c69743ed6" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1620481929880_657" class="">Over a year has passed since COVID-19 forced the world to shut its doors.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Introduction</p> <p class="">Conspiracies happen. Sometimes there really are people who are plotting. Sometimes people use their power to undermine the power of others and harm people for their own personal gain. Sometimes, your paranoia is justified.</p> <p class="">Perhaps then, we should all be a little more suspicious. After all, don’t we want to protect the freedoms of our families, friends, and neighbours?</p> <p class="">Perhaps… but perhaps not. What if our suspicions lead us down a never-ending rabbit hole?

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p class="">Hinduism is the world’s oldest living religion, and it won’t be disappearing any time soon. This ancient worldview currently boasts over one billion devotees, making it the third most popular religion in the world. Despite its popularity, scholarship in philosophy of religion continues to ignore its influence, with academic papers on the Abrahamic faiths vastly outnumbering those devoted to Hinduism. Our classrooms don’t paint a prettier picture. In UK schools, Hinduism is scarcely taught in comparison to the other major world religions, with reports showing that educators lack the confidence and subject knowledge to teach Hinduism properly. Fortunately, thanks to the work of scholars such as Jessica Frazier, things are changing.</p> <p class="">Jessica Frazier is Lecturer in Theology and Religion at Trinity College, Oxford and Fellow of the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies. Frazier is one of the world’s leading experts on Hindu philosophy, reshaping and globalising philosophy of religion for the 21st century. As well as being the founding editor of the <em>Journal of Hindu Studies</em>, she is best known for her books <em>Reality, Religion and Passion, The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies,</em> and most recently, <em>Hindu Worldviews: Theories of Self, Ritual and Reality</em>. Far from your ivory tower academic, Jessica is a committed public philosopher, broadening the horizons of academics and the general public through her captivating writing style and regular media appearances. </p> <p class="">As we will see, Frazier’s work demonstrates Hinduism's rich and insightful philosophical tradition; a tradition that can shed light on life’s greatest questions: from the nature of life, god and suffering, to the fundamental structure of reality.</p> <hr /> <div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1614334712645_9238" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1614461849614_693" class="sqs-block-content"> <p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1614461849614_692" class="">This episode is produced in partnership with <a href= "https://www.global-philosophy.org/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">The Global Philosophy of Religion Project</a> at <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/ptr/departments/philosophy/research/projects/global-philosophy-of-religion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Birmingham</a>, led by <a href="https://www.yujinnagasawa.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Yujin Nagasawa</a> and funded by the <a href= "https://www.templeton.org/grant/the-global-philosophy-of-religion-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Templeton Foundation</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id="block-09f989ab34251ae5bd91" class= "sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule" data-block-type="47"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id="block-28cdc4a09c251120d814" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p class="">Hinduism is the world’s oldest living religion, and it won’t be disappearing any time soon. This ancient worldview currently boasts over one billion devotees, making it the third most popular religion in the world.

Our classrooms don’t paint a prettier picture.

The gender of these leaders, said Plato, was not to matter – despite him labelling them ‘the philosopher kings’.</p> <p class="">That ideal was never realised but the conversation started by Plato and his contemporaries inspired what many think of as the birth of ‘Western Philosophy’. The central tenets being: the nature of reality, truth and knowledge, how to live the good life, and most importantly, the practice of prudence and the pursuit of justice.</p> <p class="">To the Ancient Greeks, Prudence and Justice were personified as females. The term ‘philosophy’ itself contains the Greek word ‘Sophia’ meaning wisdom – which was also personified in the female form. Thus, it is a great irony that much of the history of philosophy has focused on the achievements of men: at its lowest points using its own intellectualising to oppress women. Prudence and justice seemed only to exist for men.</p> <p class="">However, there have always been women concerning themselves with the big questions, seeing beyond the darkness and shadows that kept their societies stuck in male-centric thinking.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">In Plato’s ideal state, the wisest amongst the populous would be selected to rule. These rulers, who could see beyond the shadows to glimpse the light of truth, would be trusted to make choices to the benefit of all. The gender of these leaders, said Plato, was not to matter – despite him labelling them ‘the philosopher kings’.</p> <p class="">That ideal was never realised but the conversation started by Plato and his contemporaries inspired what many think of as the birth of ‘Western Philosophy’. The central tenets being: the nature of reality, truth and knowledge, how to live the good life, and most importantly, the practice of prudence and the pursuit of justice.</p> <p class="">To the Ancient Greeks, Prudence and Justice were personified as females. The term ‘philosophy’ itself contains the Greek word ‘Sophia’ meaning wisdom – which was also personified in the female form. Thus, it is a great irony that much of the history of philosophy has focused on the achievements of men: at its lowest points using its own intellectualising to oppress women. Prudence and justice seemed only to exist for men.</p> <p class="">However, there have always been women concerning themselves with the big questions, seeing beyond the darkness and shadows that kept their societies stuck in male-centric thinking. Now more than ever, there are people dedicated to pointing the spotlight on women’s ideas, women’s lives, and women’s achievements.

The innovations and freedoms enjoyed by the Global North have shown that the free market is the only viable economic system; it is almost impossible to imagine a coherent alternative.’</p> <p class="">This was certainly the view of Margaret Thatcher, who was elected as Prime Minister amidst the turbulence of 1980s’ Britain.

For Blakeley, neoliberalism was a system geared towards maximising share profits over goods and services: a dangerous economic model that puts shareholders first, customers second, and workers last.</p> <p class="">As we left ‘the golden age of capitalism’, the rising tides of climate catastrophe, global poverty, and vast increases in income inequality eventually came knocking at the doors of world governments... but nobody answered. As prime ministers and presidents pretended they weren’t home, a guest arrived who hadn’t the courtesy of knocking. In 2008, the world watched on as the market collapsed in the biggest economic crash since 1929. The house of cards had fallen – the contradictions of Western, free market economics had caught up with us.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p class="">I am Ixion, strapped to the burning wheel of fire in the underworld that is my life. A bleak assessment to be sure, but I put it to you that it is the truth. For what is life if not an ever-swinging pendulum of pain and boredom, kept in motion by the insatiable will? I constantly strive for the things that I want, but what I want is never enough; long-term satisfaction is tedium elegantly veiled. This alone is a cruel trick to the individual, but in a world of many, it is the ultimate tragedy.</p> <p class="">The wills of the multitude cannot avoid the inevitable conflict, as one will’s ends treats another as its means. The tiger feasts on the wild dog, who feasts on the baby turtle, all to propagate life so that future generations can play out this tragic scene ad infinitum. In human life - save rare moments of true compassion - we are little better. Yet, there is a hint of salvation. </p> <p class="">What if we all realised that, at our core, we are the same will? What if we could make the wheel of Ixion stand still, if only for a moment? Would it be possible to see beauty? Would it be possible to see to fellow sufferers rather than fellow egos? I suspect it might, but I am afraid that I, and many others, are easily fooled. ‘The Will’ will do as it pleases, and not what pleases us.</p> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1608808615081_315" class= "body entry-content"> <div id="item-5fe46947b58b9e349d5d4823" class= "sqs-layout sqs-grid-12 columns-12" data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1608806264430"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1608808615081_314" class="row sqs-row"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1608808615081_313" class= "col sqs-col-12 span-12"> <div id="block-8758daab661e28329297" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p class="">I am Ixion, strapped to the burning wheel of fire in the underworld that is my life. A bleak assessment to be sure, but I put it to you that it is the truth. For what is life if not an ever-swinging pendulum of pain and boredom, kept in motion by the insatiable will? I constantly strive for the things that I want, but what I want is never enough; long-term satisfaction is tedium elegantly veiled. This alone is a cruel trick to the individual, but in a world of many, it is the ultimate tragedy.</p> <p class="">The wills of the multitude cannot avoid the inevitable conflict, as one will’s ends treats another as its means. The tiger feasts on the wild dog, who feasts on the baby turtle, all to propagate life so that future generations can play out this tragic scene ad infinitum. In human life - save rare moments of true compassion - we are little better. Yet, there is a hint of salvation. </p> <p class="">What if we all realised that, at our core, we are the same will? What if we could make the wheel of Ixion stand still, if only for a moment? Would it be possible to see beauty? Would it be possible to see to fellow sufferers rather than fellow egos? I suspect it might, but I am afraid that I, and many others, are easily fooled. ‘The Will’ will do as it pleases, and not what pleases us.</p> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1608808615081_315" class= "body entry-content"> <div id="item-5fe46947b58b9e349d5d4823" class= "sqs-layout sqs-grid-12 columns-12" data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1608806264430"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1608808615081_314" class="row sqs-row"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1608808615081_313" class= "col sqs-col-12 span-12"> <div id="block-8758daab661e28329297" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p class="">Jack was walking down a street. It was a day like any other. As ever, his mind was a flurry of thoughts, worries, and anxieties, stimulated by coffee and the bright light of his phone. In a bid to relieve his stress, he put his phone in his pocket, and tried to notice the details he would usually ignore. </p> <p class="">As he walked past the pharmacy, he saw a sick man coughing and spluttering; he was throwing medication back to stop his disease from decaying his body. Jack kept walking and came across an old woman waiting at a bus stop. She was fragile, crooked, and anxious; clearly age had taken much from her. Crossing the road away from the bus stop, he waited for the traffic to pass. Driving slowly past him was a hearse: a coffin on full display, surrounded by flowers, proceeded by a stream of weeping mourners. </p> <p class="">Jack fell to his knees, overwhelmed with despair, “we all get sick, we all age, and we all die. We cannot escape this fate!” His head against the pavement, he didn’t move for almost an hour. When he got up, he was approached by a homeless man, to whom he said, “sorry, I don’t have any change.” The man replied, “It is you who needs a little <em>change</em>, young monk. I know why you fall to your knees in despair: the inescapable suffering of life weighs on us all. Let me tell you of someone who was once like you, who tried to remove suffering from our minds… let me tell you the story of Siddhartha Gotama, The Buddha.”</p> <div id="block-ec934a9b1d63f76544d9" class= "yui3-widget yui3-block-base yui3-block-parent-base sqs-block-html sqs-block html-block"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1602934576673_6222" class= "sqs-block-html-content sqs-block-content"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1602934576673_6239" class= "sqs-dd-invalid-handle yui3-widget sqs-html"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1602934576673_6241" class="sqs-html-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p class="">Jack was walking down a street. It was a day like any other. As ever, his mind was a flurry of thoughts, worries, and anxieties, stimulated by coffee and the bright light of his phone. In a bid to relieve his stress, he put his phone in his pocket, and tried to notice the details he would usually ignore. </p> <p class="">As he walked past the pharmacy, he saw a sick man coughing and spluttering; he was throwing medication back to stop his disease from decaying his body. Jack kept walking and came across an old woman waiting at a bus stop. She was fragile, crooked, and anxious; clearly age had taken much from her. Crossing the road away from the bus stop, he waited for the traffic to pass. Driving slowly past him was a hearse: a coffin on full display, surrounded by flowers, proceeded by a stream of weeping mourners. </p> <p class="">Jack fell to his knees, overwhelmed with despair, “we all get sick, we all age, and we all die. We cannot escape this fate!” His head against the pavement, he didn’t move for almost an hour. When he got up, he was approached by a homeless man, to whom he said, “sorry, I don’t have any change.” The man replied, “It is you who needs a little <em>change</em>, young monk. I know why you fall to your knees in despair: the inescapable suffering of life weighs on us all. Let me tell you of someone who was once like you, who tried to remove suffering from our minds… let me tell you the story of Siddhartha Gotama, The Buddha.”</p> <div id="block-ec934a9b1d63f76544d9" class= "yui3-widget yui3-block-base yui3-block-parent-base sqs-block-html sqs-block html-block"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1602934576673_6222" class= "sqs-block-html-content sqs-block-content"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1602934576673_6239" class= "sqs-dd-invalid-handle yui3-widget sqs-html"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1602934576673_6241" class="sqs-html-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

As ever, his mind was a flurry of thoughts, worries, and anxieties, stimulated by coffee and the bright light of his phone. In a bid to relieve his stress, he put his phone in his pocket, and tried to notice the details he would usually ignore. </p> <p class="">As he walked past the pharmacy, he saw a sick man coughing and spluttering; he was throwing medication back to stop his disease from decaying his body. Jack kept walking and came across an old woman waiting at a bus stop. She was fragile, crooked, and anxious; clearly age had taken much from her. Crossing the road away from the bus stop, he waited for the traffic to pass. Driving slowly past him was a hearse: a coffin on full display, surrounded by flowers, proceeded by a stream of weeping mourners. </p> <p class="">Jack fell to his knees, overwhelmed with despair, “we all get sick, we all age, and we all die. We cannot escape this fate!” His head against the pavement, he didn’t move for almost an hour. When he got up, he was approached by a homeless man, to whom he said, “sorry, I don’t have any change.” The man replied, “It is you who needs a little <em>change</em>, young monk. I know why you fall to your knees in despair: the inescapable suffering of life weighs on us all. Let me tell you of someone who was once like you, who tried to remove suffering from our minds… let me tell you the story of Siddhartha Gotama, The Buddha.”</p> <div id="block-ec934a9b1d63f76544d9" class= "yui3-widget yui3-block-base yui3-block-parent-base sqs-block-html sqs-block html-block"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1602934576673_6222" class= "sqs-block-html-content sqs-block-content"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1602934576673_6239" class= "sqs-dd-invalid-handle yui3-widget sqs-html"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1602934576673_6241" class="sqs-html-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p class="">One day when Jack, Olly, and Andy were accompanying Confucius, Confucius said: “Why don’t each of you tell me what you have your mind set on.”</p> <p class="">Andy was the first to reply, he said he wanted to be as profitable and the prestigious as the Duke of Zhou. Once he had profit and prestige, he could have all things his heart desired. </p> <p class=""> Jack, having suspected that Andy had given a poor response, said he wished to cultivate humanness by helping others to help themselves. He wanted to allow others to see how their selfishness prevented them from becoming truly human and from experiencing true joy. </p> <p class=""> Finally, Olly simply responded that he wished not to make any promises he couldn’t keep but that he hoped to learn from the ancients, respect the roles he had been assigned, and care for his friends and family. </p> <p class=""> Confucius sat quietly for a moment and then said: “Andy, you have mistaken what made the Duke of Zhou so well pleased. Jack, you have said the right words but for the wrong reason.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p class="">One day when Jack, Olly, and Andy were accompanying Confucius, Confucius said: “Why don’t each of you tell me what you have your mind set on.”</p> <p class="">Andy was the first to reply, he said he wanted to be as profitable and the prestigious as the Duke of Zhou.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">There was once a wise farmer named Oliver who, enjoying the evening’s sun at the end of a summer’s day, watched on as one of his prized horses escaped from his farm. That evening, having heard the news, Jack and Andrew came to Oliver’s farm to express their sympathies. Oliver turned to his neighbours upon their arrival and said, “maybe.”</p> <p class="">The next day the horse returned, but brought with it six wild horses. Jack and Andrew, seeing the horses from their homes, ran to Oliver’s exclaiming his good fortune. Olly turned to the men and said, “maybe.”</p> <p class="">The following day, Oliver tried to saddle and ride one of the wild horses. He was thrown off the horse’s back and broke his leg. Jack and Andrew came to offer their condolences for the misfortune.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">Misogyny is the hatred of women, practiced only by a few bigoted men. A hatred, which is far from systemic. Sexual and domestic violence are at record lows and continue to decline. Women are entitled to equal pay, positions of power, and bodily autonomy, and these rights and liberties have been enshrined in law and accepted by the general population. Feminism is the rule, misogyny the exception: we are all feminists now.</p> <p class="">This couldn’t be further from the view of <a href= "http://www.katemanne.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kate Manne</a>, Associate Professor at <a href= "https://philosophy.cornell.edu/kate-manne" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Cornell University</a> and author of the hugely popular and multi-award-winning, <a href= "https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/313/313936/down-girl/9780141990729.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny</a>. Today, Kate is not only one of the world’s leading feminist philosophers (labelled as “The Simone de Beauvoir of the 21st century” by Amanda Marcotte), but according to <a href= "https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/prospect-worlds-top-50-thinkers-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospect Magazine</a>, one of the “World’s Top 10 Thinkers”.</p> <p class="">Today we’ll be discussing Kate’s newly released, <a href= "https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/608442/entitled-by-kate-manne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women</a>. Kate calls us to radically rethink our understanding of the nature and function of misogyny. Misogyny is <em>not</em> the hatred of women and girls, practiced by the few, it is controlling and punishing those who challenge male entitlement, practiced by the many. Misogyny is the law enforcement branch of the patriarchal order - a deterrent, a warning, a whip - which sustains the hierarchy of men over women. As history and the personal experiences of women so often attest to, those at the top of hierarchies often expect things from those beneath them.</p> <div id="block-1b7f65cbd89e21316da5" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">The smell of coffee, the taste of asparagus, the warmth of a hug, and the agony of death: conscious experience makes up the fabric of our world, yet many consider it to be the most intractable mystery in philosophy and science. <em>What is it like</em> to undergo experience? What is the function of consciousness? Where does consciousness occur? What are the contents of this experience? Is our stream of consciousness unified?</p> <p class="">The hardest problem of all, might be the origin of consciousness itself: how, why, or <em>are we,</em> subjects of experience? In one sense, it shouldn’t come as a surprise - after all, in the words of physicist <a href="https://mkaku.org/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">Michio Kaku</a>, ‘Sitting on your shoulders is the most complicated object in the known universe; 100 billion neurons, each connected to 10,000 others’.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">Approximately 13.8 billion years ago, an infinitely dense state of an infinitely large universe lay dormant upon the backdrop of existence. Then, the expansion of everything. The potential for trillions of galaxies sprung out from this same point, and today, they shine like fairy lights in the darkness of the vast cosmos. From our own little planet, bursting with life, art, culture, and science, we can observe the effects of the big bang and the universes’ continuing expansion. We can see the beginning, but we can also see the end. In about five billion years, the sun will swell to around 250 times its current size, leaving our once blue and white planet a lifeless, magma-covered rock. That’s settled, the apocalypse is coming: the land will fry and the seas will boil - but there is more at stake than the Earth. What matters now is the bigger question: how will the universe end?</p> <p class="">In this episode, we’ll be discussing the impending doom of the cosmos with theoretical astrophysicist Katherine Mack. Katie is Assistant Professor of Physics at North Carolina State University. As well as making huge contributions to the field of astrophysics, Katie is one of the most active public-facing scientists in the world today. From publications in Slate, Scientific America, and Time Magazine, to featuring on the BBC and being quoted in the song lyrics of Hozier, Katie’s work is expanding into the furthest corners of our planet.

He has been reading diligently, noting fastidiously, and practicing his jokes in the mirror. Fully invested in his work, he goes to great lengths to ensure that the podcast is well received. But today is no ordinary day for Jack, something is about to happen that he could never prepare for.</p> <p class="">Sat at his desk with his nose in Thomas Nagel’s Mortal Questions, Jack reaches for his cafetière to refill his Nietzsche coffee mug - when he hears the sound of a heavy creak above him. The room begins to shake, the coffee mug spills, and Jack jumps out of his chair as dust begins to fall around him. Fearing that the roof will cave, he runs out of the house, but finds that the streets are shaking too.</p> <p class="">Like the set of a stage, the neighbourhood before his eyes begins to fall backwards. As the walls hit the ground, Jack sees countless figures in black uniforms running frantically in all directions. He looks up to the sky and sees several tall figures on ladders: a blue figure holds a large, blinding torch, a white figure holds a watering can, and a black figure holds what seems to be a large block of cheese. Jack is overwhelmed with disbelief - he is standing in the middle of a stage. Suddenly, one of the figures shouts instructions to another, who frantically pulls on a rope - the stage rising back to its original position, the figures disappearing.</p> <p class="">It dawns on him: Jack is the actor in a play. What of his life? His childhood? His family and friends? What of his projects? Will he ever be able to return, to his old life?</p> <p class="">Jack ponders the thought for a moment and walks back into his home.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">Imagine two possible worlds. In the first world, Andrew is driving home from an intimate dinner party with Olly and Jack. He has been enjoying a range of delicious cheeses and wines, despite being the designated driver. With the exception of Andrew’s singing, the drive is uneventful, and the party arrives home, safe and sound. In the second world, the same initial conditions apply. Andrew has enjoyed a plethora of gastronomic delights, and finds himself behind the wheel, singing without reservation. Driving through the familiar country roads, where sadly it has been known for deer to meet the paths of oncoming traffic, Andrew sees an unknown shape ahead. Too slow to react, the car strikes the figure, and Andrew feels the crunch of the object beneath his wheels. The following morning, Andrew switches on Radio 4: ‘Police are requesting any information the public might have relating to a hit and run on Country Road yesterday evening, where a 6-year-old boy unfortunately lost his life. Anybody with information relating to the event, believed to have occurred in the hours in which one could be expected to be travelling home from an intimate dinner party, should contact their local police station immediately’. Andrew realises that it was not a deer he hit with his car, and turns himself in to the police station.</p> <p class="">For Bernard Williams and Thomas Nagel, this is a classic case of moral luck. In both possible worlds, Andrew’s actions and intentions were the same. In the first, Andrew wakes up and continues with his life. In the second, we expect him to face up to fourteen years in prison. Our question: should we judge Andrew’s moral character any more harshly in the second case than the first - do they not deserve the same punishment?</p> <div id="block-f6f52e777f06ad713a23" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1587162459738_859" class="sqs-block-content"> <p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1587162459738_858" class=""><strong id= "yui_3_17_2_1_1587162459738_857">Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">Imagine two possible worlds. In the first world, Andrew is driving home from an intimate dinner party with Olly and Jack. He has been enjoying a range of delicious cheeses and wines, despite being the designated driver. With the exception of Andrew’s singing, the drive is uneventful, and the party arrives home, safe and sound. In the second world, the same initial conditions apply. Andrew has enjoyed a plethora of gastronomic delights, and finds himself behind the wheel, singing without reservation. Driving through the familiar country roads, where sadly it has been known for deer to meet the paths of oncoming traffic, Andrew sees an unknown shape ahead. Too slow to react, the car strikes the figure, and Andrew feels the crunch of the object beneath his wheels. The following morning, Andrew switches on Radio 4: ‘Police are requesting any information the public might have relating to a hit and run on Country Road yesterday evening, where a 6-year-old boy unfortunately lost his life. Anybody with information relating to the event, believed to have occurred in the hours in which one could be expected to be travelling home from an intimate dinner party, should contact their local police station immediately’. Andrew realises that it was not a deer he hit with his car, and turns himself in to the police station.</p> <p class="">For Bernard Williams and Thomas Nagel, this is a classic case of moral luck. In both possible worlds, Andrew’s actions and intentions were the same. In the first, Andrew wakes up and continues with his life. In the second, we expect him to face up to fourteen years in prison. Our question: should we judge Andrew’s moral character any more harshly in the second case than the first - do they not deserve the same punishment?</p> <div id="block-dab26bafbd985e225a95" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">Olivia Coombes is a philosopher and teacher at the University of Edinburgh whose research focuses on issues about the possibility of time travel, the paradoxes involved in time travel, and how these topics relate to the question of free-will. In addition to this, Liv is also the co-host of the Edinburgh-based podcast Two Philosophers: One Podcast, No Problems.</p> <p class="">Since the philosopher David Lewis, and before, philosophers, scientists, movie fans (pretty much everybody), have deliberated the possibility of time travel. People have asked questions like: What is the order of time? If we could build a powerful enough machine, would we be able to travel through time? Causation goes forwards in time, but is there anything stopping it going backwards? And, if it could, can we have causal loops in time?</p> <p class="">In this episode we’re going to be focusing on the grandfather paradox, which is one instance of the question: can time travellers change the past? This paradox asks us whether or not we could go back in time and kill our own grandfathers. Many people say no: it is logically impossible, like squaring circles, or making something from nothing. However, Olivia Coombes thinks differently.

Every day, whether it was in school or in the church, someone would arrive with a basket, and I would take what they offered. Today a similar basket lays in front of me, full of apples I've been saving so to take a closer inspection.</p> <p class="">Check those apples for me would you? Why so worried? Surely if they are good, there is nothing to worry about. You've heard of the Italian who was punished for checking, you say? I understand. I will do it myself.</p> <p class="">There are too many in there to check one by one. I shall take them all out and only place back in the basket the ones that are certifiably good! I think the Italian might have been onto something, they all look rotten! I must check closer. I refuse to accept that they are all bad!</p> <p class="">Ah, there is one. That will do.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">Let me tell you about the day Socrates drank the poison. You must be aware of his trial and apology? The Athenians have not stopped talking about it since Meletus and the others condemned him. Do not worry, he did not die in fear and nor is he truly gone. He argued his case much like he always had. He died the philosopher’s death, having practiced for it his entire life.</p> <p class="">What does this mean? Socrates spoke persuasively about matters concerning the immortality of the soul. He said the life of a true philosopher helps the prisoner, chained hand and foot in their body, to escape from the dark cave of ignorance and into the light of wisdom. This, in turn, provides the soul with the perfect means to release itself from the body after death.</p> <p class="">When the hour arrived, and Socrates finally took the hemlock, he did not flinch. Those of us who bore witness could not help but shed a tear – we were not as brave as the wise man who lay before us. What? You would like to hear more?

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">Galileo Galilei is widely considered to be the father of modern science and one of the greatest philosophers to have lived. Galileo played a pivotal role in the developments of the scientific revolution, overturning key tenets of Aristotelian physics and most significantly, advocating mathematics as the language of science. For Galileo, the physics of the past was plagued with unhelpful sensory qualities like colours, tastes, smells and sounds; for science to make progress, he thought, ‘the book of the universe’ must be written in a purely quantitative language.</p> <p class="">For Durham University’s Philip Goff, this was Galileo’s Error. The hard problem of consciousness was born when Galileo stripped consciousness away from the scientific picture. Somehow, we must find a way back.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">No book can teach you how to tame the raging river of fortune, for it has many plans contrary to ambitious minds. Yet to submit powerlessly to fate with lamentation, as if God has not instilled you with freedom of the will, is a sign of disrespect and the ultimate folly of our kind. For the river splits into many paths and those that appear to drag us towards the abyss, may, in the end, lead us to glory if only we persist in our efforts.</p> <p class="">That is not to say that fortune always favours the brave. The acts of life should be understood as drama rather than science, and sometimes the heroes lose. Nevertheless, if it just so happens that you wish to play the role of the Prince or Princess, and be responsible for guiding others to a better future, there is wisdom you can learn from your time and through history to aid your cause.</p> <p class="">Before we go any further, however, I must warn you that the practicalities of ruling come with demands that are not for the faint-of-heart. Human nature dictates that at times, you will need to adopt the methods of the Fox and the Lion.</p> <p class="">You must be like the Fox in order to spot the traps laid by those who wish to see you fail and you must be like the Lion so that those same people will never try too hard for fear of the repercussions.</p> <p class="">This might sound harsh, but let me remind you that the road to hell is often pathed with good intentions and that sometimes to be good you must learn… to be cruel.</p> <div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1565444819341_215716" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class="">This episode is sponsored by <a href= "https://tinyurl.com/y4csq4no" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><strong>Rachel Poulton’s <em>The Little Book of Philosophy</em></strong>.</a></p> <p class="">For more information about the book, please click the following link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4csq4no" target= "_blank" rel= "noopener"><strong>https://tinyurl.com/y4csq4no</strong></a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id="block-bb774c1202f90d951f22" class= "sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule" data-block-type="47"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id="block-150bde88fa8c1ce6e557" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">No book can teach you how to tame the raging river of fortune, for it has many plans contrary to ambitious minds. Yet to submit powerlessly to fate with lamentation, as if God has not instilled you with freedom of the will, is a sign of disrespect and the ultimate folly of our kind. For the river splits into many paths and those that appear to drag us towards the abyss, may, in the end, lead us to glory if only we persist in our efforts.</p> <p class="">That is not to say that fortune always favours the brave. The acts of life should be understood as drama rather than science, and sometimes the heroes lose.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">University of Sheffield philosopher, Assistant Professor <a href= "https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/profiles/byerly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Byerly</a> is best known for his work in philosophy of religion, epistemology and virtue theory. Publishing widely in these areas, Ryan is also Reviews Editor for the European Journal for Philosophy of Religion, Treasurer for the British Society for Philosophy of Religion, and a member of Sheffield’s Centre for Engaged Philosophy. Amongst many other fascinating papers in philosophy of religion, Ryan is the author of ‘The Awe-Some Argument for Pantheism’, which forms our focus for today’s discussion.</p> <p class="">Ryan’s argument for pantheism (the belief that ‘God is the universe and the universe is God’) provides an exciting and unique take on not just the type of god we should believe in, but also the way in which we might come to establish its existence. In short, Ryan thinks that the emotion of awe - that profound, ineffable feeling that one has when they see Van Gogh’s Starry Night or a meteor burning up in the atmosphere - can point us in the direction of things which are divine. The greatest object of awe, says Byerly, is the cosmos, and therefore, the cosmos is the most divine thing.</p> <div id="block-01d0aa7691a06d777816" class= "sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

As well as publishing extensively in phenomenology and philosophy of mind, Michelle is also the author of <a href= "https://global.oup.com/academic/product/non-propositional-intentionality-9780198732570" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Non-Propositional Intentionality, Cognitive Phenomenology</a>, and our focus for this episode, her 2016 book, <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Given-Experience-its-Content/dp/0198748906" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Given: Experience and its Content.</a></p> <p class="">This episode is all about what some philosophers have called ‘the given’, that is, what is given to us in our immediate experience. From Aristotle to Hume, philosophers have tried to account for the categories, types, and distinctions within the mind. Michelle’s work continues in this tradition, however it takes a new and exciting turn away from the orthodox positions in philosophy of mind - she thinks that phenomenology comes first, that phenomenology is responsible for our mind’s ability to represent the world, and that there are many more types of phenomenology than we’ve currently admitted.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class=""><a href= "https://www.marist.edu/liberal-arts/faculty/andrei-buckareff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrei Buckareff</a> is Associate Professor of Philosophy and Co-Director of the Cognitive Science Program at <a href="http://www.marist.edu/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York</a>, and Associate Editor of the journal <a href= "https://researcherslinks.com/journal/Science-Religion-and-Culture/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science, Religion, and Culture</a>. Andrei’s work focuses on a range of fascinating topics, from metaphysics, philosophy of mind, epistemology and the philosophy of action, to philosophy of religion, the afterlife, pantheism, and alternative concepts of God. Andrei is a prolific writer, publishing extensively in these fields, and his influence cannot be overstated. Alongside Yujin Nagasawa and funded by the John Templeton Foundation, Andrei is also the co-leader of the ‘<a href= "https://www.templeton.org/grant/the-pantheism-and-panentheism-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pantheism and Panentheism Project’</a>, which will form our focus for today.</p> <p class="">In this episode, we’ll be speaking to Andrei about alternative concepts of God; more specifically, on Andrei’s recent work surrounding pantheism and panentheism. In a word, Andrei argues that if we are to understand God as ‘acting in space-time’, we should be inclined to believe that this God exists within time and space, at all spatial locations. Moreover, if we are inclined to think that God is omniscient, then we should also believe that God ‘is the universe’ – that is, God and the universe are essentially made of the same stuff, with God being either identical with or constituted by the cosmos.</p> <p class="">Andrei’s work calls the orthodox theist to radically reconceptualise their understanding of God, in the light of a more philosophically plausible philosophy. Our question, if we are theists, do we need to change the way we think about God?</p> <p class="">This episode is produced in partnership with ‘<a href= "https://www.templeton.org/grant/the-pantheism-and-panentheism-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pantheism and Panentheism Project</a>’, which is led by Andrei Buckareff and Yujin Nagasawa and funded by the <a href="https://templeton.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Templeton Foundation</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">Imagine you are in an open field which stretches in every direction, further than your eyes can see. Since there is nothing of interest in your immediate surroundings, you set your sights on the horizon. You begin to walk with purpose; long strides eventually break into a run until you are sprinting as fast as you can. After a while, you begin to slow down. Not just because of a lack of breath, but because something doesn’t quite feel right.</p> <p class="">Your steps relax to a strolling pace as you turn back to glance at where you started — but it isn’t clear how far you’ve come. You continue walking; at first for hours, then days, and then weeks. Eventually, although the anxiety set in days ago, you come to a stop. No matter how many steps you had taken, the horizon never came any closer. The goal was never realised, regardless of your efforts.</p> <p class="">This short passage might tell you something about your own life, or at least a way of thinking which has occupied your mind at one time or another. The horizon in the story is an analogy for instrumental goods. Instrumental goods are those things in life that you want because you believe them to be necessary for your well-being or happiness. A new job or a trip that you’ve always wanted to take, for example.</p> <p class="">We think that once we meet these goals, we will somehow achieve happiness as if it was some state which could be reached and maintained forever. But these ideas are sorely misguided. We cannot find and maintain happiness by seeking it in instrumental goods. You see, permanent, unchanging happiness is like the horizon in the story. No matter how hard you work for it, no matter how many promotions you achieve, how many new trips you take, you simply cannot find happiness in this way.</p> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">Imagine you are in an open field which stretches in every direction, further than your eyes can see. Since there is nothing of interest in your immediate surroundings, you set your sights on the horizon. You begin to walk with purpose; long strides eventually break into a run until you are sprinting as fast as you can. After a while, you begin to slow down. Not just because of a lack of breath, but because something doesn’t quite feel right.</p> <p class="">Your steps relax to a strolling pace as you turn back to glance at where you started — but it isn’t clear how far you’ve come. You continue walking; at first for hours, then days, and then weeks. Eventually, although the anxiety set in days ago, you come to a stop. No matter how many steps you had taken, the horizon never came any closer. The goal was never realised, regardless of your efforts.</p> <p class="">This short passage might tell you something about your own life, or at least a way of thinking which has occupied your mind at one time or another. The horizon in the story is an analogy for instrumental goods. Instrumental goods are those things in life that you want because you believe them to be necessary for your well-being or happiness. A new job or a trip that you’ve always wanted to take, for example.</p> <p class="">We think that once we meet these goals, we will somehow achieve happiness as if it was some state which could be reached and maintained forever. But these ideas are sorely misguided. We cannot find and maintain happiness by seeking it in instrumental goods. You see, permanent, unchanging happiness is like the horizon in the story.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="">Imagine you are in an open field which stretches in every direction, further than your eyes can see. Since there is nothing of interest in your immediate surroundings, you set your sights on the horizon. You begin to walk with purpose; long strides eventually break into a run until you are sprinting as fast as you can. After a while, you begin to slow down. Not just because of a lack of breath, but because something doesn’t quite feel right.</p> <p class="">Your steps relax to a strolling pace as you turn back to glance at where you started — but it isn’t clear how far you’ve come. You continue walking; at first for hours, then days, and then weeks. Eventually, although the anxiety set in days ago, you come to a stop. No matter how many steps you had taken, the horizon never came any closer. The goal was never realised, regardless of your efforts.</p> <p class="">This short passage might tell you something about your own life, or at least a way of thinking which has occupied your mind at one time or another. The horizon in the story is an analogy for instrumental goods. Instrumental goods are those things in life that you want because you believe them to be necessary for your well-being or happiness. A new job or a trip that you’ve always wanted to take, for example.</p> <p class="">We think that once we meet these goals, we will somehow achieve happiness as if it was some state which could be reached and maintained forever. But these ideas are sorely misguided. We cannot find and maintain happiness by seeking it in instrumental goods. You see, permanent, unchanging happiness is like the horizon in the story. No matter how hard you work for it, no matter how many promotions you achieve, how many new trips you take, you simply cannot find happiness in this way.</p> <p class=""><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class="">Part I.

Thomas’ work in these areas has had a great impact, most notably, through her 2018 books <a href= "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Absolute-Time-Modern-British-Metaphysics/dp/0198807937/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Emily+Thomas+philosophy&qid=1553769348&s=gateway&sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Absolute Time: Rifts in Early Modern British Metaphysics</a> and <a href= "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Early-Modern-Women-Metaphysics-Thomas/dp/1107178681" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early Modern Women on Metaphysics.</a></p> <p>In this episode, we’ll be discussing Emily Thomas’ forthcoming work on The Idealism and Pantheism of <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Sinclair" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">May Sinclair</a>. Born in 1863, May Sinclair was a prolific novelist, as well as a deeply influential poet, translator, critic and philosopher. It Is this last field, philosophy, which perhaps she is least well known for her work. Amongst her many great novels, short stories and poems, May Sinclair published her philosophical treatise in A Defence of Idealism in 1917, and The New Idealism in 1922, which both form the focus of today’s discussion. Sinclair’s unusual take on questions concerning space and time, god, and classic philosophical problems such as Zeno’s paradox, provide us with a refreshing and exciting approach to our understanding of the universe. Combined with her great passion, wit, and her breathtaking writing style, it is no stretch to say that May Sinclair is one of the 20th-centuries most underrated philosophers.</p>]]></description>

The crisis of our times, of our generation “is not that we have it good, or even that we might be worse of later, but that we can’t come up with anything better… Notching up purchasing power another percentage point, or shaving off our carbon emissions; perhaps a new gadget – that’s about the extent of our vision.”</p> <p>At best, Bregman provides us with a desirable and achievable vision of human progress; a world with no borders, 15-hour work weeks and a universal basic income for everybody.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Currently Visiting Professor of Science and Religion at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York, Robert Wright’s work in journalism, psychology and philosophy has been deeply influential. Robert is the author of many best-selling books including ‘<a href= "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Moral-Animal-Why-Are-Way/dp/0349107041" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Moral Animal: Why We Are the Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology</em></a><em>’</em>, ‘<a href= "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nonzero-History-Evolution-Cooperation-Destiny/dp/0349113343/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1548327456&sr=8-7&keywords=Robert+wright" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny</em></a><em>’</em>, ‘<a href= "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Evolution-God-origins-our-beliefs/dp/0349122466/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1548327456&sr=8-5&keywords=Robert+wright" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Evolution of God</em></a><em>’</em>, and most recently, ‘<a href= "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Buddhism-True-Philosophy-Enlightenment/dp/1439195455" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment</em></a><em>’.</em></p> <p>Our focus for this episode is Robert Wright’s latest book, Why Buddhism is True.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), a man who suffered greatly from bodily ills, considered himself somewhat of a physician. Yet, his remedies were not aimed towards physical conditions of the body, but rather the personal and societal ills of his time. Nietzsche, often poetically and rhetorically, dissected what he perceived to be the root of the suffering or apathy many of his contemporaries were facing.</p> <p>His diagnosis focussed primarily on the human tendency to deny life. Life denying, for Nietzsche, came in many ways: the asceticism of the Buddha or Arthur Schopenhauer, the herd-like mentality of what Nietzsche called “the Last Man”, and most famously – the otherworldly illusions of Christianity. To him, these were all attempts to cower in the face of an objectively indifferent reality.</p> <p>Nietzsche’s prognosis? To stand in the face of this indifference and shout yes! To affirm life and strive for personal excellence. How he envisioned this is subject to much scholarly debate but Nietzsche provides certain clear themes over his prolific authorship.</p> <p>His masterwork <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> suggests we should look forward to the “Ubermensch” or “Superman”, a spiritually healthier individual who approaches the world in an honest and fearless way. Similarly, continuing his claim from <em>The Gay Science</em>, <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> also reminds the reader that “God is dead”. Nietzsche wanted people to recognise the void in values left by God’s absence and the responsibility we have been given to create our own meaning.</p> <p>Nietzsche’s legacy is an interesting one. <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, along with the Bible, ironically, were given to German soldiers during the First World War. He also, after his death, was accused of being a proto-Nazi due to his sister’s influence over his final posthumous works.</p> <p>Nietzsche’s thoughts on his own works are remarkable in their irony and grandiosity. He hoped his messages would strike a chord with people and force them to look deep into their own intentions and actions. He also hoped they would provide a basis for personal change.</p> <p>A passage from <em>Ecce Homo</em> gives us an insight into his style and desired effect:</p> <blockquote> <p>“I know my fate. One day my name will be associated with the memory of something tremendous — a crisis without equal on earth, the most profound collision of conscience, a decision that was conjured up against everything that had been believed, demanded, hallowed so far. I am no man, I am dynamite.”</p> </blockquote>]]></description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), a man who suffered greatly from bodily ills, considered himself somewhat of a physician. Yet, his remedies were not aimed towards physical conditions of the body, but rather the personal and societal ills of his time. Nietzsche, often poetically and rhetorically, dissected what he perceived to be the root of the suffering or apathy many of his contemporaries were facing.</p> <p>His diagnosis focussed primarily on the human tendency to deny life. Life denying, for Nietzsche, came in many ways: the asceticism of the Buddha or Arthur Schopenhauer, the herd-like mentality of what Nietzsche called “the Last Man”, and most famously – the otherworldly illusions of Christianity. To him, these were all attempts to cower in the face of an objectively indifferent reality.</p> <p>Nietzsche’s prognosis? To stand in the face of this indifference and shout yes! To affirm life and strive for personal excellence. How he envisioned this is subject to much scholarly debate but Nietzsche provides certain clear themes over his prolific authorship.</p> <p>His masterwork <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> suggests we should look forward to the “Ubermensch” or “Superman”, a spiritually healthier individual who approaches the world in an honest and fearless way. Similarly, continuing his claim from <em>The Gay Science</em>, <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> also reminds the reader that “God is dead”. Nietzsche wanted people to recognise the void in values left by God’s absence and the responsibility we have been given to create our own meaning.</p> <p>Nietzsche’s legacy is an interesting one. <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, along with the Bible, ironically, were given to German soldiers during the First World War.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dr Skye Cleary is a philosopher and author, best known for her work in the field of existentialism. As well as teaching at Columbia, Barnard College and the City College of New York, Skye is also the associate director of the Center for New Narratives in Philosophy at Columbia University.</p> <p>Skye’s contribution to the world of public philosophy has been extensive, writing for a wealth of publications, including <em>The Paris Review</em>, <em>TED-Ed</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em>, <em>Aeon</em>, <em>Business Insider</em>, <em>The Independent</em> and <em>New Philosopher</em> magazine. Skye is also the editor of the American Philosophical Association blog and the author of our focus for this episode, her 2015 book, <a href= "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Existentialism-Romantic-Love-Skye-Cleary/dp/1137455799" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Existentialism and Romantic Love</em></a>.</p> <p>We’re going to be discussing with Skye the idea of romantic love, and what we can learn about love from existentialist philosophers such as Max Stirner, Soren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Friedrich Nietzsche. In a world of romantic cinema, novels, love songs, dating apps, and self-help books, the dream of romantic love has been sold to many of us, but Skye Cleary thinks we need to take a step back. The worry, is that we might blindly sacrifice our freedom, offload our happiness onto another person, or use them as a means to our own ends. Existentialism teaches us that we should aim to live authentically and embrace our freedom. Our question for this episode, is whether or not our current understanding of romantic love is compatible with such a view. Can Jack meet Jill fall in love, and not fall down the hill? Should we, can we, and why, should we love?</p>]]></description>

Dr Mørch’s research focuses on panpsychism, neutral monism and liberal conceptions of physicalism. More specifically, how such views can respond to problems in philosophy of mind and metaphysics, such as the hard problem of consciousness (namely, how does soggy grey matter give rise to technicolour experience), the problem of mental causation (how can the mind interact the world), and the metaphysics of causation (what does it really mean for one event to ‘cause’ another).</p> <p>In this episode, we’re going to be discussing these topics with Hedda, but focus more specifically, on her views on consciousness and Integrated Information Theory. In Hedda’s own words:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>"The nature of consciousness seems to be unique among scientific puzzles.

Our audiobook ‘Developments in Christian Thought’ is free to download on all major podcast apps and at our website www.thepanpsycast.com/audiobook. For more information, take a little peak in the iTunes description (or at the bottom of this page).</p> <p>The audiobook is made up of 24-chapters, equally divided into 2-parts, which have been imaginatively named Part I and Part II. Part I contains 12 in-depth discussions, in which we talk through the history of theological thought within Christianity (as specified by the OCR Developments in Christian Thought specification).

As well as 12 discussions between myself, Olly and Andrew, you can expect interviews with Yujin Nagasawa, Daniel Hill, Thom Atkinson, Peter Adamson, Joseph Shaw, Eric Metaxas, Christopher Rowland, Alison Stone, Michael Wilcockson, David Ford, Peter Ochs and Tim Mawson.

We simply do not have characters that are good enough to qualify as honest, compassionate, wise, courageous and the like. We are not vicious people either – dishonest, callous, foolish cowardly, and so forth. Rather, we have a mixed character with some good sides and some bad sides. This, I have claimed, is the most plausible interpretation of what psychology tells us. It is also true to our lived experience in the world. Those are the facts as I see them.

Many problems arise in the field of religious language, but our principal focus in this episode will be the problems that arise within the Abrahamic religions (that is, Judaism, Christianity and Islam). Simply put, it is unclear how one could use human-made language, to talk meaningfully about something infinitely powerful, infinitely knowledgeable and infinitely loving. This problem is worrisome to believers as it has the potential to undermine their traditions; if we cannot speak meaningfully about God, then the texts and teachings of Abrahamic faiths can only be deemed unintelligible (i.e. impossible to understand). In his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, the 18th Century Scottish philosopher David Hume alluded to the problem as follows: “But when we look beyond human affairs… when we carry our speculations into the two eternities, before and after the present state of things; into the creations and formulation of the universe; the existence and properties of spirits; the powers and operations of one universal Spirit existing without beginning and without end; omnipotent, omniscient, immutable, infinite and incomprehensible: We must be far removed from the smallest tendency to scepticism not to be apprehensive, that we have here got quite the reach of our faculties.” In Part I we’re discussing ‘the via negativa’, in Part II, Thomas Aquinas and Ludwig Wittgenstein, in Part III, the verification and falsification principles, and in Part IV we’ll be engaging in some further analysis and discussion.</p>]]></description>

Obtaining his PhD from the Australian National University in 2004, Nagasawa’s work in philosophy is extensive, focusing on a range of topics from the problems surrounding consciousness to the nature and existence of God. Our focus for Episode 33, is Nagasawa’s ‘The Problem of Evil for Atheists’. The argument can be stated as follows; atheists believe that the world is generally good and they are happy and grateful to exist, i.e. they are existential optimists. However, our entire evolutionary biological system is based upon the painful, miserable suffering of the weak. So, why should we think that the world is overall good and that we should be grateful to exist, if our existence depends on a violent, cruel and unfair biological system which guarantees pain and suffering for unaccountably many sentient animals? Nagasawa argues that the theist is in a better position to answer this question than the atheist, suggesting that the problem of evil provides a good reason to abandon atheism and adopt theism. Part I. ‘The Problem of Evil for Atheists’. Part II. Further Analysis and Discussion.</p>]]></description>

Please tweet us your thoughts at www.twitter.com/thepanpsycast.</p> <p>For more Information on Yujin Nagasawa, please visit: www.yujinnagasawa.co.uk. Yujin’s latest book: Yujin Nagasawa, Miracles: A Very Short Introduction - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Miracles-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions-ebook/dp/B07663TS81. The paper we are discussing this episode: Yujin Nagasawa, The Problem of Evil for Atheists - https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/6d4b8e_e2fede5338c949e29637ccd5b79b6609.pdf.</p> <p>Yujin Nagasawa is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Birmingham, as well as President of the British Society for the Philosophy of Religion and Co-Director of the John Hick Centre for Philosophy of Religion. Obtaining his PhD from the Australian National University in 2004, Nagasawa’s work in philosophy is extensive, focusing on a range of topics from the problems surrounding consciousness to the nature and existence of God. Our focus for Episode 33, is Nagasawa’s ‘The Problem of Evil for Atheists’. The argument can be stated as follows; atheists believe that the world is generally good and they are happy and grateful to exist, i.e. they are existential optimists. However, our entire evolutionary biological system is based upon the painful, miserable suffering of the weak. So, why should we think that the world is overall good and that we should be grateful to exist, if our existence depends on a violent, cruel and unfair biological system which guarantees pain and suffering for unaccountably many sentient animals? Nagasawa argues that the theist is in a better position to answer this question than the atheist, suggesting that the problem of evil provides a good reason to abandon atheism and adopt theism. Part I. ‘The Problem of Evil for Atheists’. Part II. Further Analysis and Discussion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Meta-ethics is the attempt to understand the metaphysical, semantic, epistemological and psychological presuppositions of moral thought. It investigates our ethical language, in search of the meaning that lies behind it. Meta-ethics is concerned with are a broad range of puzzles, for example: What do we mean we make moral claims? Do our preferences or feelings motivate moral assertions? Or are we stating facts when we make moral claims? Is morality more a matter of taste than truth - and if it is a matter of truth, how do we learn about the moral facts? This episode we’ll be introducing you to three meta-ethical views.

Ludwig Wittgenstein was an Austrian-British philosopher whose work focused on the philosophy of mathematics, logic, the philosophy of mind, and most notably, the philosophy of language.<br /> Wittgenstein’s influence on the world of philosophy has been phenomenal. The study of philosophy was immensely important to Wittgenstein, not only as an academic discipline but as a form of therapy. In Ludwig’s own words, he describes philosophy as, "the only work that gives me real satisfaction". Wittgenstein’s work can be divided into an early period, exemplified by the Tractatus (our focus for Part I), and a later period, articulated in the Philosophical Investigations (which is our focus for Part II). Early Wittgenstein was concerned with the logical relationship between propositions and the world. He thought that by providing an account of this relationship, he had solved every philosophical problem. The later Wittgenstein rejected many of the assumptions of the Tractatus, arguing that the meaning of words is best understood as their use within a given language-game. Wittgenstein’s life and work are astonishing. His mentor, Bertrand Russell, described him as "the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived; passionate, profound, intense, and dominating". Part I.

Born in Rocken, in Prussia in 1844, Nietzsche set out his career in philology but later turned to writing idiosyncratic philosophical treatise and collections of aphorisms. He directed these against the pious dogmas of Christianity and traditional philosophy. He saw both as self-serving veils drawn over the harsher realities of life. He felt we needed not a high moral or theological ideals but a deeply critical form of cultural genealogy that would uncover the reasons why we humans are as we are and how we have come to be this way. He believed that every great philosopher actually a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir rather than conducting an impersonal search for knowledge. Studying our own moral genealogy cannot help us escape or transcend ourselves but it can enable us to see our illusions more clearly and lead a more vital, assertive existence. There is no God in this picture. The human beings who created God have also killed him. It is now up to us alone. The way to live is not to throw ourselves into faith but into our own lives, conducting them in affirmation of every moment, exactly as it without wishing anything was different and without harbouring resentment for others or our fate (Sarah Bakewell, The Existentialist Cafe, p.19-20).

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Everything you could need is on www.thepanpsycast.com! Please tweet us your thoughts at www.twitter.com/thepanpsycast. The Nicomachean Ethics is Aristotle’s (384 – 322 BC) best-known work on ethics. The work consists of ten books and is understood to be based on Aristotle’s lecture notes. These notes were never intended for publication. Sometimes his notes are merely cues to talk more generally about a subject, other times they are more representative of what Aristotle would have actually said to his students. The Nicomachean Ethics is amongst the most discussed texts in history and philosophers continue to debate its contents and intended purposes today.  One cannot deny, however, that Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics is concerned with key political and ethical questions – Questions like, How can we do what is best for citizens? and What is the good life and how do we achieve it?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Everything you could need is on www.thepanpsycast.com! Please tweet us your thoughts at www.twitter.com/thepanpsycast. Most people understand conscience as something which tells us right from wrong. The conscience is that little voice in your head that tells you to do your homework, go to bed on time and eat 5 a day. In fact, the Oxford Dictionary defines conscience as: “A person's moral sense of right and wrong, viewed as acting as a guide to one's behaviour.” We’re going to be questioning this definition extensively. What is conscience? Where does the conscience come from? Where does the word conscience come from? Is conscience fundamental in its own right, or is it acquired through our development? Does the conscience carry any moral authority, and if so, what should be the function of conscience in ethical decision-making? Is conscience just an illusion? To aid our exploration of these questions, we’re going to be consulting C. S. Lewis’ Studies in Words in Part I, Aquinas’ Summa Theologiae in Part II and Sigmund Freud’s The Ego and the Id in Part III. In Part IV we’ll wrap up the show with some further analysis and discussion and the return of philosophical ultimatum.</p>]]></description>

The Prussian-born philosopher, economist, political theorist, sociologist, and revolutionary socialist, produced some of the most controversial and influential works in the past two-hundred years. A champion of human rights for many and a dangerous radical for many others; Karl Marx, the communist, is considered one of the principal architects of modern social science. Regardless of your own points of view, it is hard to deny that Marx's critique of capitalism is relevant today. In January 2017, Oxfam published An Economy for the 99%, which found that the richest 8 men in the world are worth more than the poorest 3.6 billion. In 1848, alongside Friedrich Engels, Marx produced the Manifesto of the Communist Party. In the concluding remarks, Marx writes, "The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working men of all countries, unite!"</p>]]></description>

In January 2017, Oxfam published An Economy for the 99%, which found that the richest 8 men in the world are worth more than the poorest 3.6 billion. In 1848, alongside Friedrich Engels, Marx produced the Manifesto of the Communist Party. In the concluding remarks, Marx writes, "The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working men of all countries, unite!"</p>]]></description>

In the words of David Chalmers, “The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is also a subjective aspect. As Nagel has put it, there is something it is like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual field. What unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in them. All of them are states of experience.” Debating the question, 'Does physicalism address the hard problem of consciousness?' are Philip Goff (www.philipgoffphilosophy.com) and David Papineau (www.DavidPapineau.com).</p>]]></description>

The following is a quotation from Colin Heydt: Writing of John Stuart Mill a few days after Mill’s death, Henry Sidgwick claimed, “I should say that from about 1860-65 or thereabouts he ruled England in the region of thought as very few men ever did: I do not expect to see anything like it again.” Mill established this rule over English thought through his writings in logic, epistemology, economics, social and political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, religion, and current affairs. One can say with relative security, looking at the breadth and complexity of his work, that Mill was the greatest nineteenth-century British philosopher. Part I. Utilitarianism (7:30), Part II.

Born in Somerset, England 1632 and died in Essex, at the age of 72 in 1704, John Locke was among the most famous philosophers and political theorists of the 17th century. Locke's main political work, Two Treatise of Government, was published in anonymously in 1689. The First Treatise is a sentence-by-sentence refutation of Robert Filmer's Divine Right of Kings, whilst the Second Treatise outlines Locke's ideas for civilized society based on natural rights and contract theory. Our main focus today is the second treatise of government. Locke begins by describing the state of nature, a picture much more stable than Thomas Hobbes' state of nature that recall, is "war of every man against every man,". Locke argues that all men are created equal in the state of nature by God. He proceeds by explaining the hypothetical rise of property and civilisation, in the process explaining that the only legitimate governments are those consented to by the people. Ultimately for Locke, a government that rules without the consent of the people can ultimately be overthrown. For many, the language of the second treatise of government echoes throughout the declaration of independence. In the words of Thomas Jefferson: "Bacon, Locke and Newton, I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived". Part I. State of Nature (19:15), Part II. Property (00:05 in Part II), Part III. Civil Society (15:50 in Part II), Part IV. Further Analysis and Discussion (31:40 in Part II).</p>]]></description>

Few political thinkers can be considered as influential as Thomas Hobbes. Published in 1651, Hobbes’s most famous work, the Leviathan (or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil), argues that to leave a hypothetical state of nature, we must sign a social contract and submit ourselves to be ruled by an absolute sovereign. The state of nature is “a war of all against all”. The only rational way out for Hobbes is to establish a strong and undivided government. In this episode we’ll be asking questions like; Who was Hobbes and why is he important? What is human nature? Why do we need government? Part I. Life and Historical Context (03:00), Part II. The State of Nature (13:45), Part III. The Solution (00:10 - in Part II), Part IV. Further Analysis and Discussion (18:15 - in Part II).

			<description><![CDATA[<p>All the reading can be found at www.thepanpsycast.com! Please tweet us your thoughts at www.twitter.com/thepanpsycast. Albert Camus (1913-1960) is perhaps the most read philosopher of the 20th century. Camus is generally considered to be the father of absurdism, the idea that life's meaning is beyond our reach and that we should embrace what he called the absurd. Given the extraordinary number of people that have read Camus' work, it is no surprise that he is one of the most romanticised philosophers to have lived. In this two-part special on Camus, we're going to be asking questions like; Who was Albert Camus? Is life worth living? What is the absurd? And How should we deal with the absurd? Part I. The Life of Camus (04:20), Part II. The Absurd (16:40), Part III. Camus' Response to the Absurd (00:10 in Part II), Part IV. Further Analysis and Discussion (15:25 in Part II).

Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) was arguably the most influential philosopher of the 20th century. The quintessential existentialist, Sartre encapsulates the very essence of existentialism through his various philosophical works and plays. Sartre still has much to teach us. Still, Sartre would argue too many people live in Bad faith. They ignore that they are "condemned to be free". Amongst other things, we'll be asking, Why did 50,000 people attend his funeral? Are we condemned to be free? And Are we living in bad faith? Part I. The Life of Sartre (03:35), Part II. "Man is condemned to be free" (18:15), Part III. Bad Faith (00:10 in Part II), Part IV. Further Analysis and Discussion (31:40 in Part II).

			<description><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1535905190969_913">What started off as just myself, Olly and Andrew (my co-hosts) talking philosophy at the University of Birmingham in the early episodes, has blossomed into something extraordinary. Bear in mind, that when this project started, we had never podcasted before. So, expect some poor audio quality, and some even poorer jokes in the first 15-16 episodes. Now, The Panpsycast team goes beyond the original three. Greg Miller, Emily Rose Ogland, Phoebe Light and Thom Atkinson have joined the club, and as a consequence, we've produced some amazing content.<br />  <br /> From our humble beginnings, we have gone from strength to strength and looking back, we’ve been lucky enough to interview some of the biggest names in philosophy - A. C. Grayling, Daniel C. Dennett, Peter Singer, Yujin Nagasawa, Bence Nanay, Alison Stone, Christian B Miller, Rebecca Roache, Galen Strawson, Steven Pinker - and the list goes on. </p> <p>Not only do we interview big thinkers, but we also release informal discussions focusing on a broad range of areas within philosophy - existentialism, moral philosophy, political philosophy, philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion - there really is something for everyone, and we always pitch our discussions at non-specialists.</p> <p>Every episode, we want somebody who is completely unfamiliar with a particular topic or thinker, to come out the other end at the forefront of the contemporary discussion - but most importantly, come out of the other end with a smile on their face. </p> <p>To quote William James, “Good-humor is a philosophic state of mind; it seems to say to Nature that we take her no more seriously than she takes us. I maintain that one should always talk of philosophy with a smile.”</p> <p>Thank you, we hope you enjoy the show.</p>]]></description>
