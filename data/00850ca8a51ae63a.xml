   <media:description>This is a spontaneous home video which wasn't originally meant for YouTube, but as little miss is learning her French numbers, I thought you might enjoy it. I've found this advent calendar particularly useful to reinforce her learning, as we've been counting the stockings every day, sometimes in French sometimes in English, to see which one we were allowed to open that day! We're actually slightly ahead as we're off to France before the 24th (Fingers crossed this actually goes to plan!), so I let her start the calendar at the end of November. Only mentioning as some of you may notice we counted to 21, yet it's not the 21st of December yet! üòÖ &#13;

Have a lovely Christmas!
Joyeux No√´l √† tous !

   <media:description>French alphabet pronunciation lesson. You'll find learning the French alphabet particularly useful should you ever need to spell your name, your address or any other word to a French speaking person. If you're a beginner and are not yet familiar with French pronunciation, knowing your French ABC's will also help you get an idea of how French words are pronounced.

In this French alphabet lesson, I first recite the alphabet, then go over it again introducing a French word starting with each letter of the alphabet in turn and explaining the pronunciation of some of those words, to help you even further with your French pronunciation.

Hope you find this lesson useful! üôÇ

What are adverbs of frequency? How can you talk about your routine in French? In this French lesson, we first clarify what adverbs and adverbial phrases of frequency are. We then discuss the French adverbs of frequency along with their pronunciation. I then go on to tell you about my morning routine, in French, to illustrate how both adverbs and adverbial phrases of frequency are used in context. We then do a little reading / listening exercise, for you to see how many French adverbs of frequency (and adverbial phrases) you can find in the text.

Don't forget to download your PDF (linked above) to get the list of French adverbs &amp; adverbial phrases of frequency, as well as the transcript and translation of my morning routine.&#13; Hope you find the lesson useful! Bonne journ√©e üôÇ

   <media:description>Ever wondered how to pronounce a particular French word or phrase? I'm sure you have. French pronunciation can be rather puzzling at times! And whilst google translate is often pretty accurate, it's not always so and it's quite robotic! In this video I share an amazing free resource where you'll be able to listen to any French word or phrase, pronounced by native French speakers! And just so you know, in case you're learning other foreign languages, French is only one of the languages covered on this website! So, please go and check it out. You'll wonder how you ever managed without!

P.S: This video is NOT sponsored. I just use the site myself and thought you'd also find it useful!
