										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/twitter-open-checkmark.png" alt="twitter-open-checkmark" width="800" height="793" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-138479" /></p>

<p>When I heard that Twitter was going to open the blue checkmark up to anyone willing to pay $8/month, I was happy.</p>

<p>As a legacy holder of the checkmark there&#8217;s a slight band-aid-sting of the check indicating specialness&#8212;who doesn&#8217;t want to feel special?&#8212;but I&#8217;d much rather see a mutual platform benefit than sit atop a dungheap. And giving everyone verification is a clear platform benefit. So I&#8217;m for it.</p>

<p><center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apparently Twitter&#39;s new verification won&#39;t require any identity verification, just a monthly payment. If that&#39;s the case we&#39;re going to see an influx of criminals buying accounts with stolen credit cards to engage in spam and impersonation. <a href="https://t.co/NyMvswErni">https://t.co/NyMvswErni</a></p>&mdash; Marcus Hutchins (@MalwareTechBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1588316968645316608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center></p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p class="note">Keep in mind this reporting could be wrong and verification could still be part of the plan.</p>

<p>Except, no, it doesn&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re opening up verification. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1588304086792667136">this analysis</a> above they&#8217;re:</p>

<ol>
<li>Removing verification</li>
<li>Removing the validation of being a public persona </li>
<li><strong>Charging $8/month for it</strong></li>
</ol>

<p class="note">I guess you could argue that Twitter having money will meta-help Twitter in the future.</p>

<p>So we haven&#8217;t gained anything for the community. In fact I&#8217;d argue we&#8217;ve lost a lot. One of the biggest features of the blue check&#8212;not just on Twitter but on any social media platform&#8212;is disambiguation from copycats. If the analysis above is true and correct, we lose that. Now it&#8217;s just blue checks everywhere.</p>

<p>Which would be fine if that was the case for validated non-public people&#8212;the more the better. But they&#8217;re not validated. In sum, this is <strong>less</strong> validation, and <strong>more</strong> blue checks. Seemingly all in the name of revenue.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<p>If this is true, the effects will be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Malicious actors paying <em>negligible</em> costs to attain credibility with their victims</li>
<li>Devaluation of the checkmark (it used to mean you were confirmed to be a real human, at least)</li>
<li>Some more revenue for Twitter</li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe #3 makes #1 or #2 worth it, and it looks like we&#8217;re about to find out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/reverse-transcription-miessler.png" alt="reverse-transcription-miessler" width="800" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-138473" /></p>

<p>There are dozens of reasons to be bullish on AI right now, especially in the GPT space where we have AIs producing so much extraordinary art. But I&#8217;m excited about something else that we&#8217;re naturally evolving GPT into, which I&#8217;m calling <em>Reverse Transcription</em>.</p>

<h2>A bit of background</h2>

<p>Right now there&#8217;s a massive push towards content creation and content creators. Millions of people are either watching people on TikTok or YouTube or Twitter or Substack, and many of them&#8212;especially young people&#8212;are thinking they want that to be their career.</p>

<div id="attachment_138469" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138469" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/maxresdefault-6.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="size-full wp-image-138469" /><p id="caption-attachment-138469" class="wp-caption-text">MKBHD doing his thing</p></div>

<p>But there&#8217;s a chasm between those who can write, vs. those who can also make a podcast, vs. those who can also make videos. And then there&#8217;s the unicorn people who can do all of that, but they also feature themselves in the videos in addition to having the best production in the world. That&#8217;s people like <a href="https://mkbhd.com">MKBHD</a>.</p>

<p>So, you know how GPT-3 can create images from text? Well it can also do that with video. Here&#8217;s a company that&#8217;s doing this commercially already, called Synthesia.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" width="855" height="481" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8UDJfyvvBQ" title="How to generate AI videos in under 5 minutes" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>That&#8217;s an avatar speaking the text that you give it. And it looks like a real person.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>Now imagine MKBHD doing that, but passing along what his studio background looks like, and what kind of t-shirt he&#8217;s wearing, and what stylization he wants in the video.</p>

<h3>The future of video production</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of my professional videos with my RED camera and Neumann mic, wearing one of my merch shirts, speaking in my most energetic voice, excited, optimistic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you pass it a script that you want it to read, along with this prompt, and a few seconds later you have a full video. With bokeh, with all the details that make it look like your own set. And the avatar on the screen looks exactly like you. The speech. The mannerisms. Everything.</p>

<p>How? Because you pointed it to all your previous videos, and it just figured out what &#8220;youness&#8221; actually means.</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">

<div class="text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-lg">Get a weekly analysis of what's happening in security and tech—<em>and why it matters</em>.</div>
<div class="mt-2"><form action="https://danielmiessler.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292&amp;id=49fdb7d723" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="mc-embedded-subscribe-form validate inline" novalidate > 
            <div>
            <div class="mc-field-group">
            <input  placeholder="your best email" type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL">
            <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="button text-system">
            </div>
            <div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292_49fdb7d723" tabindex="-1" value=""></div>
            </div>
            </form></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What&#8217;s so crazy about this is that if you need to cut a word out, add a sentence, or whatever, you just edit the script and resend it. Even better, you can change what you&#8217;re wearing, change the studio, or put yourself speaking from the beach.</p>

<p>The hard parts of video production become easy, which will bring all the focus back to the content iself.</p>

<p class="note">As the AI improves it&#8217;ll do the prompt engineering as well.</p>

<p>Of course there will still be people who are better and worse at doing this. People better and worse at using these tools. Etc. And just like with AI Art, the people who are best at it are those who actually know how to make the stuff organically. But that will be more true towards the beginning. The better the tech gets the more that gap will close.</p>

<p>What we&#8217;re about to see is extraordinary.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=2></div>

<p>The ability to go from text to a perfect podcast, or a perfect YouTube video. Without any audio or video work being done by the creator.</p>

<p>Think of how much new content is about to be created. And how it&#8217;s going to fundamentally change the creator space.</p>

I got in an uncharacteristic Twitter squabble about Apple on Sunday morning. Someone was attacking me for talking about what Apple is doing right, and he unfollowed me during the discussion. We talked for another hour or so, cooling down the tone, and it went from a scuffle to a conversation. At the end he followed me back, I thanked him for being so passionate for the right things, and I followed him back. The lesson?

<p><br />
Don&#39;t stress about how much you&#39;re learning when you read or watch educational content. Maybe you&#39;re only getting X amount of retention, but it&#39;s hard to say what that number really is. Plus, learning can sink deep into us and affect how we see the world, which has a lot more impact than remembering facts. If you love a book or some piece of content, watch it again while taking notes, or use it to update a current methodology you&#39;re using to do something. But feel free to just listen to it as well, lettting it blow by. You&#39;ll likely absorb more than you think.<br />

<p>People are blown away that Apple keeps winning while <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/27/google-microsoft-20x-more-damage-than-apple/">its competitors are floundering</a>. It’s a simple formula.</p>

<p><strong>Make consistently super-high-quality products that work together as part of an ecosystem.</strong></p>

<p class="note">Google and Microsoft have 20X Apple&#8217;s losses in the last year.</p>

<p><center>

</center></p>

<p>Other companies are just churning out the latest hardware, which doesn’t maintain consistent design cues, that someone else made, which is not integrated into any sort of long-term vision.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>It makes their products utterly forgettable.</p>

<p>Those really are the main components I think:</p>

<ol>
<li>Consistently high-quality products</li>
<li>Products that maintain a consistent design language</li>
<li>Having them all work together as part of an ecosystem vision</li>
</ol>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I wrote about this in 2017. No, wait. 2007. That&#8217;s right, <strong>before</strong> the iPhone launched.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the iPhone is getting ready to come out in June and I’m hearing a lot of press about how this phone or that phone is better than it already, and that it’s too late for it to make a splash. I disagree. People keep talking about features, and I think they are missing the point. Sure, there will be many people who don’t get an iPhone because it doesn’t have a certain feature (or 5 certain features), but again — I think there’s something else to this.<br /><br />I think the iPhone is simply going to be superior (demand-wise) to these other offerings despite lacking features such as 3G, a real keyboard, etc. Look at the music player market; there are a number of other players that are “better” than the iPod, but they don’t have the same feel, the same interface, the same…”I don’t know what” that the iPod has.<br /><br /><cite>Why The iPhone Will Dominate But Not Based on Features/Functionality</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that &#8220;having the newest features&#8221; isn&#8217;t anywhere in my list or in that prediction. It doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>You know who else doesn&#8217;t have the newest features?</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<ul>
<li>Rolex</li>
<li>Stanford</li>
<li>Chick-fil-A</li>
<li>In-N-Out Burger</li>
<li>The Four Seasons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons from other industries</h2>

<div id="attachment_138454" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138454" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/maui-2022.png" alt="maui-2022" width="800" height="547" class="size-full wp-image-138454" /><p id="caption-attachment-138454" class="wp-caption-text">iPhone 14 Pro Through a Pair of Dillon Optics Blue Lens Sunglasses</p></div>

<p>I stayed at Four Seasons in Maui recently.</p>

<p>We hadn&#8217;t been there since like 2017 or something. When we drove up it looked the same. Smelled the same. All the restaurants were the same. Breakfast was the same. It was nearly identical to the last time we were there.</p>

<p>I was fucking amazed. Then I started thinking about Rolex, and how they only slightly iterate on their designs. The submariner has looked pretty much the same for nearly a century.</p>

<div id="attachment_138456" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138456" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/Rolex-Submariner-graphic-1000x667-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="size-full wp-image-138456" /><p id="caption-attachment-138456" class="wp-caption-text">Rolex keeps its design language extremely consistent</p></div>

<p>What this says to me, in a shouting tone of voice, is that <span class="tweet-able">consistency of quality and design is its own feature</span>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the tweet. And Apple isn&#8217;t just doing it better than everyone else&#8212;they&#8217;re basically the only people doing it.</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">

</div>

<h2>Vision and ecosystem matter too</h2>

<p>The other thing Appe is slowly but steadily making progress on is ecosystem.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard for Google and Amazon to have an ecosystem because they have too many product lines, and fully half of what they put out is garbage. They do make some great stuff though.</p>

<p>The difference is Apple is plodding. Slowly. And towards a vision. Siri is still lagging, no question. It&#8217;s way behind Alexa, and even Google, in many voice-related features. And it has been for years and years.</p>

<p>But remember: it&#8217;s not the latest features that win this kind of race. It&#8217;s consistency and quality. And, anecdatally, I&#8217;m seeing a lot more of my tech friends using their HomeKit more in the last year or so. It&#8217;s still way behind in features, but the quality and consistency is starting to show promise. Hopefully.</p>

<p>But beyond HomeKit style ecosystems, there&#8217;s also just the pure consumer tech side. There&#8217;s no better tech combo in the world than an iPhone, an Apple Watch, and a pair of AirPod Pro 2&#8217;s. It&#8217;s butter. Same with adding in a Macbook. Oh, and an iPad. Oh, and if someone comes over and needs the wireless password, it prompts me to share it with them transparently.</p>

<p>Like I said. Butter.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div>

<p>Admitting that I&#8217;m an Apple fanboy&#8212;I&#8217;ve camped for every iPhone since 2007&#8212;I don&#8217;t feel that from any other brand. But I honestly wish I did. When I see Google or Amazon do something cool it gets me excited. I want a worthy competitor on the field.</p>

<p>But right now we basically have Apple making great stuff, consistently, that looks and feels the same, and everyone else just throwing shit at the wall.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re not actually chasing Apple&#8217;s products. They&#8217;re chasing something else that Apple has&#8212;which they desperately wish they had as well.</p>

<p>A plan.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/podcast/">podcasting</a> since 2015 and got <em>really</em> into audio when the plague started. Like…<a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/optimizing-a-genelec-nad-dirac-jtr-setup.30803/">too much</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been obsessed with podcast audio quality for years, and have been through so…many…iterations of my setup. I started with a Yeti (still a great mic). Did the Electrovoice. Did the Shure SM7B. And now I&#8217;m using a Neumann U87ai.</p>

<p class="callout">You always want the initial recording to be as clean as possible.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not what matters. What matters is the quality of the chain, especially as you start fixing crap that&#8217;s in the original recording.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the basic rule. The most important rule. <strong>Don&#8217;t fuck with it</strong>.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>You want to create as positive an environment as possible for your initial recording. Best mic. Best room. Best room treatment. Best mic position. The least amount of noise. Etc. That&#8217;s like 95% of the battle.</p>

<p>The other 85% of the battle is cleaning up the trash that will inevitably happen despite trying really hard on that. Such as de-essing (removing the sibilant, soul-piercing, s-sounds), removing mouth noises, background hisses and hums, etc.</p>

<p class="note">This is a huge debate in the audiophile world as well.</p>

<p>So that brings us to this post. The traditional wisdom is to do as much of this as possible using hardware. Why? Because hardware is better than software. That&#8217;s the thinking anyway. And it was mostly true for a very long time. But we&#8217;re seeing that change I think, and not just in audio.</p>

<p>So I got the RODECASTER PRO 2 when it came out. It&#8217;s super rad. Love the thing. And I naturally wanted to re-optimize my podcast chain using it. In other words, drop all my software plugins (I use the iZotope stuff, which is excellent).</p>

<p>So I did that, and here&#8217;s the result:</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">

<h3>Hardware optimization using the Rodecaster Pro 2</h3>

</p>

<p>I like that a lot. It&#8217;s clean, loud, and solid. But it&#8217;s not SUPER clean. I can still hear artifacts in there. If you can&#8217;t hear them, listen to this one and you&#8217;ll see (👀👂?) it.</p>

<h3>Software optimization using iZotope&#8217;s software plugins</h3>

<p>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://omny.fm/shows/unsupervised-learning/software-optimization/embed?style=artwork" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write" width="100%" height="180" frameborder="0" title="Software Optimization"></iframe>
</p>

<p>If you listen to those on big speakers, in your car, and with headphones, you&#8217;ll hear that the second one is noticably cleaner.</p>

<p>And again&#8212;I&#8217;m doing very little to the natural sound of the Neumann U87ai. Just noise gate (for mouth and breathing noises), and a de-esser. And I did the extact same things on the RODECASTER.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=2></div>

<p>I really wanted the hardware to win. I did. But it looks like software is just getting too good.</p>

<p>So if you&#8217;re in a similar position, consider doing this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn off EVERYTHING on your hardware. Just have the chain be as clean as possible</li>
<li>Turn on the bass reduction on your mic, if it has that feature</li>
<li>Use your favorite audio plugins to apply a noise gate for breathing and mouth noises</li>
<li>Use your favorite audio plugins to take some aggro off your s&#8217;s</li>
</ol>

<p>Don&#8217;t EQ it. Don&#8217;t add bass. You think it&#8217;s cool, but it produces fatigue in the listener and is hard to hear with low-end background noise like in a car or subway. And don&#8217;t worry about any other effects either.</p>

<p>Your voice is the instrument. Leave it as natural as possible. Let the mic do the work, and and let the <strike>hardware</strike> software do the rest.</p>

<strong>US Attacks Chinese Chip Production</strong><br />
The export controls just placed on China for advanced semiconductors are extraordinary. They will slow China for years in their ability to do both advanced computing and to build top-end military technology. Many are saying, however, that this is a bit like provocations before Pearl Harbor, saying it&#39;s so big that it could push China into going after Taiwan or otherwise escalating against the US. I am personally ok with that, because I think China has been too brazen in their attacks against the US, especially in the cyber space, with relatively few repercussions. I just hope that the world can break their supply chains out of China as quickly as possible, similar to what Apple is doing, and that it&#39;ll force China to chill out and be friendly again. Their aggression is somewhat understandable as a response to The Great Humiliation, but they&#39;ve overdone it and become a global menace. And I hope this, and other measures like it, help them dial that back. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/07/biden-administration-tech-restrictions-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:source sans pro,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif">MORE</span></span></a><br />
<br />
<strong>Is China About to Rise or Fall?</strong><br />
One of the trends I&#39;m reading most about, and listening to experts most about, is the future trajectory of China. There are two main narratives right now: 1) China is about to crush America and become the dominant world power, and 2) China has unbelievable weaknesses right below the surface, and they&#39;re about to materialize and hobble the country. Despte having read multiple books about China and its future, and having listened to dozens of hours of experts debating this, I don&#39;t feel like I have a good grasp of things. The best thing I feel I have is a good understanding that these are the primary narratives, which I guess is something. The arguments that they&#39;re ascending are easy: So many people, so many people getting a good education, they&#39;re stealing the world&#39;s intellectual property, they&#39;re becoming the world&#39;s dominant bullies, which they can because they make everything for everyone, and they also have a functioning government that is thinking very long-term about the success of the country (which the US does not have). The arguments for China&#39;s fall are far less discussed, but they include a huge problem of not having enough young people, a major real estate crash, and the fact that so many smart young people are not actually in China because they left to the US or Canada or Europe. Which way this will go is one of the most important variables in the world&#39;s future right now, as it will significantly determine other major issues such as North Korea, Taiwan, and Russia. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2022/05/01/is-china-in-decline/?sh=1491f3a53839" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:source sans pro,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif">MORE</span></span></a><br />

<strong>Luxury Surveillance Becomes the Norm</strong><br />
I just read <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/amazon-tracking-devices-surveillance-state/671772/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a good article</a> about Luxury Surveillance that definitely resonated. Well, mostly. I think there are many people, especially in the security community, who share his desire not to be tracked. But I&#39;d argue most rich people will be fine with it, as long as it&#39;s done to their advantage. To me it&#39;s is about tradeoffs. What are the benefits of perfect life tracking and ubiquitous personal surveillance? And what are the downsides? How would you like to know everything about everything around you? Who&#39;s near your house, how many times they&#39;ve been there? Whether they&#39;ve been reported elsewhere? Whether you&#39;re walking into a dangerous neighborhood? Etc. I&#39;d argue that as the tech gets better, the downsides will reduce relative to the upsides&mdash;specifically for the top 10% of earners. Those who can pay for it will get all this tracking and monitoring without a lot of the data-broker-drama that comes with it. For the less well-off, they will get that tracking at the cost of their whereabouts and preferences. I don&#39;t see the big breach of one&#39;s data as a major risk here. Security for these services will be better, just the same as bank and brokerage security is decent for those who use them today. It&#39;ll be decent because the rich will demand that it is, and because they also demand to use these technologies. In short, those who are unwilling to share any data will fall in numbers over time. The benefits of providing that data will simply outpace the negatives, and those from the old school who refuse on principle will age out. Hard to imagine, but I think that&#39;s where it&#39;s going.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/amazon-tracking-devices-surveillance-state/671772/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:source sans pro,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif">MORE</span></span></a><br />

Birdfeeder Update: <em>Thank you so much</em> to those who gave advice on the birdfeeder. I now have had a number of visitors, and my feeder level is starting to drop a bit. I&#39;ve learned a few things as well, which some of you pointed out. 1) You have to provide cover. The feeder is next to a tree that&#39;s gaining some mass, so that&#39;s probably helping. 2) You want to be conscious of who you&#39;re attracting. Some birds are migratory and there&#39;s a theory that it&#39;s disruptive to provide permanent food to those who orient their lives around following it. I&#39;m going to keep researching this, but I think the visitors I&#39;m getting are called Cow Birds, which I think are just local types.<br />

Ask yourself what your main thing is. Is it family? Is it getting to work at a particular company? Is it making enough money so you can become an artist full-time? Know what your main thing is, and periodically look at your calendar and to-do list to make sure it&#39;s properly prioritized.<br />

<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://omny.fm/shows/unsupervised-learning/humiliation-is-deadly/embed?style=artwork" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write" width="100%" height="180" frameborder="0" title="Humiliation is Deadly"></iframe>
</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking for a few years about the danger presented by humiliated people and groups. That is, people who not only feel like they have no respect and no options to gain any respect, but who also feel that:</p>

<ol>
<li>They deserve those things, and…</li>
<li>That someone else is the cause of them not having them</li>
</ol>

<p>I think both are critical. If you feel tread upon but feel like it&#8217;s just the natural order of things, you&#8217;re less likely to be angry about it. But if you feel you&#8217;re &#8220;better than this&#8221;, and &#8220;being disrespected&#8221;, and &#8220;it&#8217;s your time to rise up&#8221;, well…then there will be problems.</p>

<p class="note">The cover is weird on purpose because of the topic.</p>

<p><center></p>

<iframe loading="lazy" type="text/html" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B08H7Y414K&#038;preview=inline&#038;linkCode=kpe&#038;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_XYPS3R1GVD0C5P96R23H" ></iframe>

<p></center></p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>I just read a few phenomenal books by <a href="https://willstorr.com">Will Storr</a>, one of which was called <a href="https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B08H7Y414K&#038;preview=newtab&#038;linkCode=kpe&#038;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_XYPS3R1GVD0C5P96R23H">The Status Game</a>. Its premise is that status is the ultimate game, and that all other games are really just embedded mini-games. Money, power, etc. None of those would be important if they didn&#8217;t impart status.</p>

<p class="note">What status game are you playing?</p>

<p>Throughout the book he looks at many instances of people who&#8217;ve become violent&#8212;both individuals and groups&#8212;and points to events where they were acutely humiliated. He also talks about people being mostly tied to a particular status game, and how extraordinarily difficult it is for some to switch once it’s lost or removed.</p>

<div id="attachment_138397" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138397" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/old-us-status-game.png" alt="old-us-status-game" width="1014" height="620" class="size-full wp-image-138397" /><p id="caption-attachment-138397" class="wp-caption-text">THE STATUS GAME SO MANY TRUMP VOTERS ARE TRYING TO GET BACK</p></div>

<p>Uneducated US white workers 50 years ago had a thriving status game. It was being a solid American. Working at a known company. Having a healthy family. Being a good Christian. And all media was about white people and performed by white people, with other races and cultures basically being background scenery.</p>

<p>These are mostly gone now. Whether from automation, or atheism, or globalism, or the reduced oppression of other ethnic groups, anyone playing a status game based on white cultural dominance in the US is currently in bad shape.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>So that&#8217;s one example. Let&#8217;s look at more where 1) they are either lacking a status game or they have one where they&#8217;re losing, and 2) they are angry about this.</p>

<p class="note">Generalizations ahead, proceed with caution.</p>

<h3>School shooters</h3>

<ul>
<li>The status game is high school (yikes)</li>
<li>Good looks, humor, charisma, athletics, academics</li>
<li>Kids without those are often bullied</li>
<li>Bullying often becomes humiliation</li>
<li>Access to social media lets them find similar people who are also angry</li>
<li>Those people might be part of groups who can offer <strong>another status game</strong></li>
<li>That status game might be based on <strong>racism or nationalism or mysogyny</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There is extensive <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/06/1110013040/the-highland-park-suspect-breaks-the-mold-on-violent-extremists">study being done on these topics</a>, but it seems obvious that bullied kids are gravitating towards forums that promote hate. And most of that hate seems to be around race, nationalism, or hatred of women.</p>

<h3>White people</h3>

<p>I said in <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/frontview-mirror-2021-edition/">Frontview Mirror 2021 Edition</a> that I thought white people were going to be the dominant terror threat for some time in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The rise of terrorism in the US and Europe caused by factions of white people.</strong> — As demographics continue to change in Europe, the US, and Canada, expect increasing numbers of young white males to gravitate towards extremism as an alternative to being told they are guilty, worthless, unworthy of mates, etc. Anyone who will tell them that they’re valuable and attractive— and that they should be proud—will be irresistible to large numbers of them. Examples include Mormonism, Communism, White Nationalism/Supremacy. <br /><br /><cite>Frontview Mirror 2021, April 2021</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Here I&#8217;m speaking generally of young, less-educated, less-fortunate white people who don&#8217;t have many economic or mating options, and the older generation who told them they&#8217;re being stolen from</li>
<li>In their minds they used to be on top in the US, and then it all got messed up by…someone</li>
<li>Could be the Blacks, Jews, Liberals, Women&#8212;or whatever their particular group or forum is focused on</li>
<li>Extreme-left culture is doubling down on this by messaging that all white people should feel guilty and ashamed</li>
<li>This makes it easy for extremist groups to recruit young white males into groups that channel hate. And most importantly, they provide a new status game. A status game based on being proud of something. Which is usually either 1) whiteness, 2) being American, or 3) being a man. Not necessarily in that order&#8212;again, the research is just starting on this stuff</li>
</ul>

<h3>China</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve also been thinking for years about how this dynamic applies to China.</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">
<div class="text-lg font-bold">The UL Newsletter: Finding the Patterns in the Noise…</div>
<div class="text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-lg">Get a weekly analysis of what's happening in security and tech—<em>and why it matters</em>.</div>
<div class="mt-2"><form action="https://danielmiessler.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292&amp;id=49fdb7d723" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="mc-embedded-subscribe-form validate inline" novalidate > 
            <div>
            <div class="mc-field-group">
            <input  placeholder="your best email" type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL">
            <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="button text-system">
            </div>
            <div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292_49fdb7d723" tabindex="-1" value=""></div>
            </div>
            </form></div>
</div>
</div>

<ul>
<li>China was successful for hundreds of years, with the best math, the best technology, the most literate population, etc. They had won their chosen status game, which was something like Confucianism + Taoism</li>
<li>They opted out of the status games other regions were playing, like Europe, and the US, and Russia, and they got left behind</li>
<li>During this time they got invaded, conquered, experienced famines, social and political upheval, and general misery</li>
<li>They even have a name for this, and they refer to it often in their current political speeches. It&#8217;s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_of_humiliation">The Century of Humiliation</a>. I mean it&#8217;s right in the name.</li>
<li>The current president uses this as the fire to motivate the Chinese people, essentially saying: </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were disrespected and ignored for too long. No more. We&#8217;re going to be the world power now, and China will be restored to its former and true glory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s Make China Great Again.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>We need to be a little careful with these types of models. They&#8217;re useful, but it&#8217;s easy to over-attribute them if you turn them into a fetish. There are obviously lots of factors that go into making someone agressive, or violent, or otherwise anti-social. But I do think this &#8216;pride and status and humiliation&#8217; model has a lot of explanatory power.</p>

<p>And one of the most interesting and powerful things about this model is that it hints at a solution. If the cause of so much of our negativity in the world is individuals and groups feeling like they have no value, and no status game they can play without being horrible, then why not focus on building better status games? And why not ceate culture and messaging that restores status to those who feel it&#8217;s been taken?</p>

<h3>Narrative for would-be school shooters</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey guys, so many of the most successful people in the world today also felt exactly as you do. It&#8217;s ok to be different. It&#8217;s ok to not be popular. It&#8217;s ok to be an introvert. You can be awesome. I know you can, and that you will. We have your back, and come talk to us if you need help.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div>
</blockquote>

<h3>Narrative for white pepole</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey guys, it&#8217;s cool to be white. That doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re better than anyone. You&#8217;re not. But nobody&#8217;s better than you either. Keep your chin up. You&#8217;re seeing tons of Black and Asian people in the media because they&#8217;ve been hidden for so long, and they need some spotlight. And the immigrants are killling it because they hustle their asses off, just like you used to 50 years ago. If you hustle like that you still have your shot. Chill. You&#8217;re awesome. They&#8217;re awesome. We&#8217;re all awesome. We have your back, and come talk to us if you need help.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Narrative for China</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey guys, China rocks. As the US, as Europe, as the entire world, we have tremendous respect for you. What happened to you during those 100 years was reprehensible. You didn&#8217;t deserve that, and nobody does. We see you. You&#8217;re smart, you&#8217;re dedicated, you&#8217;re hard-working, and you care about the health of your country as a whole&#8212;which is something much of the world could learn from you. Chill. You&#8217;re awesome. They&#8217;re awesome. We&#8217;re all awesome. We have your back, and come talk to us if you need help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to understand who&#8217;s hurting, and why&#8212;especially those who are being given harmful explanations for their treatment by extremists. Because those are the people most likely to hate and hurt others. In other words, we need to build healthy Status Messaging and healthy Status Games for those that are suffering most.</p>

<p>The alternative status games are already out there, and they come from extremists that are actively recruiting. We must create and broadcast healthy alternatives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/human-robot-painting-miessler.png" alt="human-robot-painting-miessler" width="1024" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-138380" /></p>

<p>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://omny.fm/shows/unsupervised-learning/ai-art-will-push-the-top-1-to-human-artists/embed?style=artwork" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write" width="100%" height="180" frameborder="0" title="AI Art Will Push the Top 1% to Human Artists"></iframe>
</p>

<p>One effect I think we&#8217;ll see from all this AI-generated art is magnified status for those who insist on the opposite, i.e., manual, human art. The more manual the better. The more human the better. Ideally there&#8217;d only be one of whatever you have, and it&#8217;d only be yours.</p>

<p>Why is this? It&#8217;s because when we talk about people making art for things, there are really two games being played. The first is the base need for an image of some sort. Like for a blog post, or an article. It&#8217;s something visual to complement the text. But the second axis is the most important one, which is status.</p>

<p>These overlap considerably, but ultimately when you put a piece of nice art on an article, which might also have nice typography, you&#8217;re saying to the reader, &#8220;this is the good stuff.&#8221;</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>And the better the automated art, the higher the status of the human-generated alternative. It reminds me of lawns, which are the poster yards for conspicuous consumption. Lawns were created to communicate several things, all of which are gross insights into the human mind.</p>

<ol>
<li>I have lots of space</li>
<li>I have a staff to maintain this, or I do it myself because I enjoy it</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not even really using the space—and it&#8217;s hard to maintain—but I can so I will</li>
</ol>

<p>When you have a giant estate a big lawn is a brag about the size of your staff. Like boasting that you have 15 servants in the British aristocracy.</p>

<div id="attachment_138384" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138384" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/giant-lawn.png" alt="giant-lawn" width="800" height="542" class="size-full wp-image-138384" /><p id="caption-attachment-138384" class="wp-caption-text">Wow, probably lots of staff</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think of how rich they must be if they&#8217;re spending all that money on X!?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s the same for &#8220;Made in America&#8221;, or &#8220;Hand Made&#8221;. They both indicate higher quality, maybe, but often not. It&#8217;s not actually the quality that improves, but the amount of attention and effort, which is different. Handmade things imply a shorter supply of them, made by higher-skill people.</p>

<p>Ultimately we&#8217;re talking about scarcity, which is one of the most potent champions for status. We want what other people can&#8217;t have. And in a world where it&#8217;s so easy to have nice-looking art, the way to one-up and win that game is to ask them who made it. If they answer anything other than with real artists name, you&#8217;ll be looked down upon.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<p>So that&#8217;s the prediction: this pendulum swing of AI art will basically raise the bottom of art. There won&#8217;t be many sites left with no art, or horrible-looking art. And stock photo businesses are all about to close or become AI-art businesses.</p>

<p>But the overall effect at the top end will be to differentiate by talking about the humans who do things for you. Not machines. Not AI. Not robots. Humans. Because at that level it&#8217;s mostly not about the quality of the thing&#8212; it&#8217;s about the status it conveys.</p>

<p>One of the most challenging parts of finishing a post is coming up with a good image.</p>

<p>The AI art tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion are cool, but a lot of the magic comes down to <a href="https://www.saxifrage.xyz/post/prompt-engineering">prompt engineering</a>, which is non-trivial.</p>

<p class="note">Prompt Engineering is almost equal parts art and science currently.</p>

<p class="callout">If prompt engineering is the hard part, then let&#8217;s use AI to write the prompts.</p>

<p>In other words, AI might be able to make you a cool piece of art, but only if you tell it how (and in <a href="https://dallery.gallery/the-dalle-2-prompt-book/">very specific and strange ways</a>).</p>

<p class="note">Your writing was creative already, so let that do the work.</p>

<p><strong>But what if you could tell it how automatically, just based on the text in what you wrote?</strong></p>

<p><center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">💡🤖 Fun Project: A quick tool that:<br><br>1. Takes the text of a blog post<br>2. Summarizes it into a DALL-E prompt<br>3. Submits that to DALL-E<br>4. Now you have art for the blog!</p>&mdash; ᴅᴀɴɪᴇʟ ᴍɪᴇssʟᴇʀ (@DanielMiessler) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/1581803468003516416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center></p>

<p>That&#8217;s the idea I became obsessed with last night, and I was able to get a working proof of concept in less than 30 minutes! This stuff is just nuts.</p>

<h2>How to build it</h2>

<p class="note"><a href="https://www.v7labs.com/blog/few-shot-learning-guide">More on few-shotting</a>.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>Ok, as I said in the tweet, there are a few key steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Summarize the text</li>
<li>Turn that into a prompt</li>
<li>Create an image from the prompt</li>
</ol>

<p>My technique&#8212;and be gentle because it&#8217;s a very quick POC&#8212;is to combine the first two steps into a <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/few-shot-learning-gpt-neo-and-inference-api">few-shot</a> learning template. For anyone who just WTF&#8217;d, <span class="tweet-able">few-shotting is basically showing an AI the right answer a few times and then giving it a similar problem with no answer</span>.</p>

<p>So I wanted the template to both 1) train the AI to write a prompt, and 2) feed it my text to build the prompt from. I did that by mixing those two in the Summary portion of the template.</p>

<div id="attachment_138311" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138311" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/miessler-prompt-summary1-650x312.png" alt="miessler-prompt-summary1" width="650" height="312" class="size-medium wp-image-138311" /><p id="caption-attachment-138311" class="wp-caption-text">One of the training shots, showing the mixture of prompt and content summarization</p></div>

<p class="note">You can tweak this language to make it match your blog.</p>

<p>Specifically, the:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a professional digital painting about…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…was static in all the summaries I trained it with. And so was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gorgeous digital painting, warm colors, captivating, trending in artstation…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which means when I ask this tool for the real (non-training) prompt&#8212;using my new text&#8212;I don&#8217;t have to add those things!</p>

<h2>Training the prompter</h2>

<p class="note">Some guru will be able to show me a better way, no doubt.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<p>So that&#8217;s pretty much it. You just need the text to get summarized, which includes a label (I used Text), and then a summary that is your output on a separate line (I used Summary). <strong>Then, as your final step, send the thing you want to summarize (which is the completed prompt), and leave the answer blank!</strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what the whole promt looks like, with all the &#8220;Text:&#8221; portions being taken from other blog posts of mine:</p>

<div id="attachment_138322" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138322" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/miessler-full-prompt-text.png" alt="miessler-full-prompt-text" width="650" height="1074" class="size-full wp-image-138322" /><p id="caption-attachment-138322" class="wp-caption-text">The full series of Text/Summary training scenarios</p></div>

<h2>Remarkably solid prompt quality</h2>

<p>Using this technique I was able to generate some pretty decent prompts, which surprised me. Here&#8217;s the opening of a blog post I did recently, and I wanted to see if this technique could create a decent prompt for it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s common to hear that it’s hard to get into cybersecurity, and that this is a problem. That seems to be true, but it’s informative to ask a simple follow-up: The current cybersecurity jobs gap sits at around 2.7 million people. A problem for who? I think what we’re facing is an instance of the Two-Worlds Problem that’s now everywhere in US society. It’s where the vast majority of people are feeling pain from an issue, but there’s an elite that lives in a reality where the problem doesn’t exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s not the whole article, of course, but it&#8217;s already got some decent stuff to key off of. So how did this trainer do? Here&#8217;s the prompt it created:</p>

<p class="command">
a professional digital painting about cybersecurity, jobs gap, two-worlds problem, pain, elite, reality, gorgeous digital painting, warm colors, captivating, trending in artstation
</p>

<p>Seriously?!?! That&#8217;s stunning. So not only did it keep my DALL-E 2 prompt stuff in there, but <strong>it also added the summary nested in the middle</strong>!</p>

<p>So it extracted these terms from the text: <strong>cybersecurity, jobs gap, two-worlds problem, pain, elite, reality</strong>, and then it seamlessly blended them into the specific art styling I&#8217;ve told it I want for my site.</p>

<p class="note">You can tell which is which by the icons.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m pretty excited at this point, but now for the big question. How do the images look based on this prompt? Here are some of the outputs of running this prompt on DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion.</p>

<div id="attachment_138324" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138324" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/prompt-outputs-miessler.png" alt="prompt-outputs-miessler" width="650" height="646" class="size-full wp-image-138324" /><p id="caption-attachment-138324" class="wp-caption-text">Output from three different AI-engines using the GPT-3-created Prompts</p></div>

            </form></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Oh, and you know what? I&#8217;ve not even begun, because I can comb through all the different art styles that these engines can make, and I can add <strong>a particular style I like</strong> to the prompt training. Actually I have multiple ideas there:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hardcode the art style you want for your blog</li>
<li>Hardcode a color scheme</li>
<li>In your custom prompt creator tool, factor in the content for the art style!</li>
<li>Add a custom art call to the tool, so you can ask for different art styles based on mood</li>
</ol>

<h2>Creating a simple utility, <code>bac</code></h2>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit over-stimulated right now, but here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done so far to make this kind of slick and usable. I&#8217;ve created a simple utility called Blog Art Creator (<code>bac</code>), which sounds fancy but is nothing but a silly shell script.</p>

<ol>
<li>I have the training scenarios in a single file, <code>training.txt</code>.</li>
<li>I save my new content to another file, <code>content.txt</code>.</li>
<li>I have the final prompt in another file, <code>prompt.txt</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The utility just concatanates text, so it combines the training data, your content, and the prompt, and sends all of that to GPT-3. I use <a href="https://github.com/CrazyPython/gpt3-cli">this cli tool</a> within my script:</p>

<p class="command">
gpt3 &#8211;engine text-davinci-001 &#8211;temperature 0.75 &#8211;freq-penalty 1 &#8211;pres-penalty 1
</p>

<p>Which leaves us with this for the, um, &#8220;code&#8221;.</p>

<div id="attachment_138345" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138345" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/dac-script-650x331.png" alt="dac-script" width="650" height="331" class="size-medium wp-image-138345" /><p id="caption-attachment-138345" class="wp-caption-text">A dirty, no-good hack</p></div>

<p>So then I just run <code>bac</code>.</p>

<p class="command">
bac
</p>

<p>Now, as you know, you can create some pretty lame looking stuff if you don&#8217;t do your prompts right. So let&#8217;s test this with a brand new prompt from a much earlier, random blog post.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People are hyped about the metaverse, and it’s honestly understandable. First, we’re going through some shit as a species right now. Social tension, the best part of Star Wars’ last three movies were the previews, and there’s a global pandemic. Part of this metaverse hype is just being excited to be excited, and I get it.Metaverse lore has lots of fun stuff in it—from AR/VR to headsets to avatars to moving between worlds. But I think we can reduce the metaverse to one concept and two axes.The metaverse is about experiencing a better life than in meatspace.Most important to this is content.Second most important to this is interface.ContentContent is life. It’s the source of meaning. It’s what gives provides us with evolution’s nectar of happiness in the form of hormone releases when we struggle and achieve something.<br /><br /><cite><a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/gaming-is-metaverse-1-0/">Gaming is Metaverse 1.0</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which produced this prompt:</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div>

<p class="command">
a professional digital painting about the metaverse, hype, understandable, exciting, better life, content, interface, gorgeous digital painting, warm colors, captivating, trending in artstation
</p>

<div id="attachment_138327" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138327" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/bac-output-miessler-650x263.png" alt="bac-output-miessler" width="650" height="263" class="size-medium wp-image-138327" /><p id="caption-attachment-138327" class="wp-caption-text">Running the bac command and getting output</p></div>

<p>And created these images from DALL-E in the <strong>first two runs</strong>.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/autosummarization-test-1-650x159.png" alt="autosummarization-test-1" width="650" height="159" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138332" /></p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/autosummarization-test-2-650x158.png" alt="autosummarization-test-2" width="650" height="158" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138333" /></p>

<p>In. Sane.</p>

<p>I will absolutely be using this for my own stuff going forward.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>What I&#8217;ll work on in immediately is breaking apart the art styling from the content summarization and tagging. Basically I want to be able to change the art in a separate file and have that get added into all the training shot strings separately from the labeling as part of the <code>bac</code> utility. Same with the labeling.</p>

<p>So actually:</p>

<ol>
<li>Break apart the art styling so I can change it without editing <code>training.txt</code></li>
<li>Create a parser for going to get content from my site, either randomly or by search term, and implement that as command switches to <code>bac</code></li>
<li>Add the automatic art switching based on terms found in the content, e.g., create &#8220;dramatic&#8221; and &#8220;serious&#8221; art if the content summary contains &#8220;depression&#8221;, &#8220;war&#8221;, &#8220;future&#8221;, etc, with a more moody color scheme as well. Implement those as switches too.</li>
</ol>

<h2>End of POC</h2>

<p>Well I&#8217;m stoked. I can&#8217;t wait to work on this more tonight, and I really hope you enjoy messing with the ideas and finding tons of ways to improve it. And <a href="https://ctt.ac/7t3d7">share it out</a> or <a href="mailto:daniel@danielmiessler.com">hit me up</a> if you want to hack on upgrades/variations.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol class="note">
<li>Next steps for me would also include automating the submission to the image generation services, but that&#8217;s a bit kludgy right now. I&#8217;ll add that to the automation once it&#8217;s available and/or easier to submit to and get results from.</li>
</ol>

<p>Few things in tech were more predictable than Stadia shutting down.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I wrote the week it came out:</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/stadia-first-analysis-650x372.png" alt="stadia-first-analysis" width="650" height="372" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138258" /></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I said about it in 2021.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/stadia-second-analysis-650x138.png" alt="stadia-second-analysis" width="650" height="138" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138259" /></p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>And here&#8217;s my analysis of why this keeps happening: <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/heres-how-i-know-stadia-and-similar-products-will-fail/">How I Knew Stadia Would Fail</a></p>

<p>The overall reason for this is UI/UX in my opinion, <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/google-is-getting-left-behind-due-to-horrible-ui-ux/">which I talked about here in 2020</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not an expert on internal Google politics, but it seems to me&#8212;and I&#8217;ve heard elsewhere&#8212;that they pretty much let engineers run everything. The coding, obviously, but also a whole lot of the product side as well.</p>

<p>If that&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s not working. Again, maybe there are other factors that I&#8217;m not aware of, but to me this reads as not having a clear product vision and solid designers as part of product teams.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/google-is-getting-left-behind-due-to-horrible-ui-ux/">I ranted about with Google&#8217;s management interfaces</a>, the interfaces seem completely oblivious to how people will actually use the products. So they fail.</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">

  <p>To be clear, Google’s strategic goals and large projects are overwhelmingly respectable (self-driving cars, fighting disease, etc.), and I continue to look up to them as leaders in technology for those types of efforts.But when it comes to their basic web services, their mobile platform, their UI/UX, their sense of design and integration, their attention to detail, and 1,000 other things about how they present themselves, they’re third-rate or worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve been talking about this for nearly 10 years now. And so have thousands of others.</p>

<p class="note">Billions?</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=2></div>

<p>At this point I&#8217;ve lost my empathy for them. How in the hell can you continue making the same exact mistake, for like 10 years, which is no-doubt causing the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in dozens of products&#8212;but you don&#8217;t adjust?</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>Whatever. I guess we just slowly wait for someone who knows how to make a GUI to catch up to them in backend competence. Because then they&#8217;ll be in serious trouble.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/2022-apple-products-650x396.jpg" alt="2022-apple-products" width="650" height="396" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138237" /></p>

<p>I just camped for the new lineup of Apple products, as I have every year <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/why-iphone-will-succeed-my-argument-in-letter-form/">since 2007</a>, and I am pretty impressed.</p>

<p>As many have said, this year was an incremental update. The iPhones look nearly identical. And so do the AirPods Pro 2.</p>

<p>The exception was the Apple Watch Ultra, which is a rather new form factor. Beefier. With some extra features. But utlimately it&#8217;s still 90% the same as the Series 8.</p>

<p>I would argue this is a good thing. It means they think they&#8217;re getting close to the ultimate forms of these products. And I agree. With a few exceptions that I can&#8217;t wait to see filled in.</p>

<h2>1. USB-C</h2>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/apple-iphone-13-pro-4.jpg-650x366.webp" alt="apple-iphone-13-pro-4.jpg" width="650" height="366" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138242" /></p>

<p class="note">Or Thunderbold, but with a USB-C connector.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>Yeah, I know, everyone gets this one. It&#8217;s just time to unify everything behind a single connector. Nuff said already.</p>

<h2>2. A Round Apple Watch</h2>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/apple-watch-round-6-650x412.jpg" alt="apple-watch-round-6" width="650" height="412" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138239" /></p>

<p>I was a watch guy before I was an Apple guy, and I am bummed about wasted real estate with the round watch faces that sit inside the Apple Watch&#8217;s rectangular form factor.</p>

<p>I would love something that looks more like a Submariner, but with the Apple buttons on it. I&#8217;d pay thousands for it. Probably. I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s taken this long, but I hope it comes soon.</p>

<h2>3. High-Resolution Audio on AirPods</h2>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/high-res-airpods-650x488.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="488" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138245" /></p>

<p>The new <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/">Airpods Pro 2</a> have improved drivers and algorithms that measurably improve their sound, but as a mid-level audiophile (shudder) I am still waiting for the final piece of lossless and high-quality audio. It&#8217;ll require a new protocol, but that shouldn&#8217;t be too much of an obstacle. f</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<p>It&#8217;s a small point, and things already sound great, but if you&#8217;re into audio it&#8217;s pretty annoying to know the source is lossless/high-quality, and the drivers are excellent, but that the protocol is stripping quality from your audio.</p>

<h2>4. TouchID Under the Glass</h2>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/iPhone-12-Touch-ID-Feature-Img-650x366.jpg" alt="iPhone-12-Touch-ID-Feature-Img" width="650" height="366" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138241" /></p>

<p>FaceID keeps getting better, but I&#8217;d love if it was eventually paired with TouchID that activates when you put your thumb on the screen.</p>

<p>It might not be better or faster when you&#8217;re looking at the screen, but there are enough times when you blink, or look away, or at a bad angle, and you don&#8217;t land a FaceID authentication. So it&#8217;d be brilliant to have both.</p>

<h2>5. Unification of The Naming</h2>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/4356629_original-12.jpg-650x325.webp" alt="" width="650" height="325" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138246" /></p>

<p>Finally, just a naming gripe which I don&#8217;t really fault them for but can&#8217;t wait for them to fix.</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">

            </form></div>
</div>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Apple Silicon has Normal, Max, and Ultra</li>
<li>iPhones have Normal, Plus, Pro, and Max</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus there are the iCloud tiers, which might be too hard to bring in. But can we try to standardize a bit?</p>

<p>I do see the problem. iCloud and other services they&#8217;re following the Disney+ naming convention. And with iPhones you have to have a ladder in both the regular line and the Pro line, and the steps on those ladders have to be distinct to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>Maybe the answer is unifying the line and just having more steps. So it&#8217;s just:</p>

<ul>
<li>iPhone</li>
<li>iPhone Plus (larger base model)</li>
<li>iPhone Pro  </li>
<li>iPhone Pro Plus</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the challenge is differentiating size vs. performance. Those two things need different laddering terminology.</p>

<p>Perhaps Plus can be the size difference, while Pro, Max, Ultra are the performance tiers.</p>

<p>And with Apple Silicon, it just becomes:</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div>

<ul>
<li>M2 </li>
<li>M2 Pro</li>
<li>M2 Max</li>
<li>M2 Ultra</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure they should have that many tiers though.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Anyway, these are the things I think they should sort out to arrive at the peak of this line of products for the next five years or so.</p>

<ol>
<li>USB-C</li>
<li>A Round Apple Watch</li>
<li>High-res Audio</li>
<li>Touch-ID Under the Glass</li>
<li>Unified Naming</li>
</ol>

<p>Let me know if you have any other ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/alfred-safari.png" alt="alfred-safari" width="2584" height="1756" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-138229" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just started using Safari again after being on Chrome for a while, and one of the things I miss most from Chrome is custom searches.</p>

<p>There you can search Amazon directly from the address bar by doing:</p>

<p class="note">You can change the search prompts to be single letters like &#8216;a&#8217; for Amazon.</p>

<p class="command"><span class="firstc">a</span> <span class="secondc">tv lightstrips</span> </p>

<p>At the time of writing (September 2022) there isn&#8217;t any way to do this in Safari. You can do this, but it&#8217;s too much typing:</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p class="command"><span class="firstc">amazon.com</span> <span class="secondc">tv lightstrips</span> </p>

<p class="note">Alfred is like Quicksilver, Omnikey, and Spotlight all in one.</p>

<p>The best solution I&#8217;ve found is to <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">just use Alfred</a>, which is great since I use it already for text expansion and many other tasks.</p>

<div id="attachment_138233" style="width: 543px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138233" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/alfred-safari-2-533x650.png" alt="" width="533" height="650" class="size-medium wp-image-138233" /><p id="caption-attachment-138233" class="wp-caption-text">The custom search options in Alfred</p></div>

<p>As you can see in the screenshot, there&#8217;s an entire Web Search section in Alfred that lets you set custom search engines. So you just go into there and set your trigger letter for each, and you&#8217;re good to go.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<div id="attachment_138234" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138234" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/alfred-safari3-650x126.png" alt="" width="650" height="90" class="size-medium wp-image-138234" /><p id="caption-attachment-138234" class="wp-caption-text">After invoking Alfred and the Amazon search prefix</p></div>

<p>Then you just hit <code>⌘ + SPACE</code> to invoke Alfred, and then type <code>a tv lightstrips</code> to search on Amazon.</p>

<p>Your query will be opened automatically in a new tab in Safari.</p>

<p>Hope that helps you!</p>

<p>My mom died on Saturday.</p>

<p>My biological mother became unable to function when I was around five due to mental illness, which left my dad and me on our own. Sometime after we were blessed with a strong, beautiful soul named Rhonda.</p>

<p>My dad and I were like rescue dogs, and she saved us. She brought so much love into what was a hard, matter-of-fact relationship between my dad and I. She taught him to be kinder with me, and with himself. And she spent her whole life helping me to open up about about my own internal life.</p>

<p>She stayed on me about homework and school, and there is zero doubt in my mind that I would not have graduated high-school were it not for her.</p>

<p>She had a tremendous talent for listening to people, and it was only around 5 years ago that I realized my enjoyment of helping people came from her. During one conversation she was talking about how people are just struggling through life, and why we need to help them get through it.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/mom3.png" alt="mom3" width="650" height="431" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-138226" /></p>

<p>My daft self was like, &#8220;Wow, we&#8217;re so similar in that way!&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t until days later that I realized we didn&#8217;t arrive at this independently, but rather that <em>I learned it from her</em>. She loved talking to and helping people, and she passed some of that to me.</p>

<p>People have been coming around randomly, after hearing the news, talking bout how easy it was to talk to her, and how much she helped them. It was sweet and beautiful to hear.</p>

<p>She died of an aggressive type of cancer that was supposed to take her within weeks or months, that had no chance of remission. But the diagnosis was back in 2020, and the oncologists were able to give us a miraculous extra two years with her. I am forever thankful to them for that time.</p>

<p>She died peacefully in her sleep, with my dad sleeping next to her.</p>

<p>I will miss her.</p>

</p>

<p>In today’s standalone episode I’m going to talk about some new gaming ideas I’ve not seen anywhere else, and have their creator, Andrew Ringlein, come on and talk about them. Andrew was also on a previous episode where we talked about crypto and how it changes incentives in business.</p>

<p>So I’ve been a steady, casual gamer since junior high school, and Andrew actually introduced me to Role Playing Games way back then. Andrew is a die-hard gamer, a super close friend, and quite simply the smartest game designer I’ve ever met. And now he’s actually built a game studio and is in the middle of launching two games.</p>

<p>But before I bring him on I want to talk about why I thought these ideas warranted a UL episode. He’s a close friend, but I have lots of friends, and I only create UL content around ideas that I think will be interesting to the audience.</p>

<p>What I personally find most interesting in the gaming space is not really the games, but new things happening in the games. The engagement mechanisms. How the content is being created. How people are incentivized to create their own content. And how changing rules change incentives and then change behavior.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p><strong>Basically, I’m excited about how new games change gaming itself.</strong></p>

<p>I have talked to Andrew throughout the creation of his new games, and had a bit of input and knew the general direction, but the other day I spent over an hour doing a brain dump of everything he thinks is unique about the game he’s releasing, which is called Rifters.</p>

<p>And I’ve broken these new mechanics into 5 Rifter Mechanics (Update With Full List Number)</p>

<p>1: Core Gaming Concepts, and</p>

<p>First, and just to get it out of the way, NFTs are a big part of the game. He came up with this during the NFT climax earlier in 2022. But luckily for the game and its legacy, it’s not about hyping some sort of NFT (which is the worst part about the whole space). Rather it’s a mechanism for getting NFT-united groups to come play in the game. So the NFT thing is ever-present, but it’s just a mechanic, not the entire point.</p>

<p>So, here are the mechanics.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<ol>
<li>The first core concept is what he’s calling Reactive Reality. This is where things happening within the game itself, as well as adjacent to the game in other mediums, all affect the nature of reality inside the game. So think of the physics engine. The strength of items. The relative power of different magic types. They’re all dynamically modifiable based on player activity! Imagine pacts with Gods where you make deals and promises, and in return something you desire actually happens.</li>
<li>The second concept is highly tied to the first and deals with the existence of Simultaneous Realities for the game. That means the main game is happening within the game itself, within the browser, but dialogue and activity is taking place simultaneously on Discord, on Twitter, and even in meatspace! And tying in with the first major concept, those actions in Discord or Twitter—or live on Earth—can directly and significantly affect the rules and outcomes of the game!</li>
<li>The third concept is Gamification of Pro-Community Behaviors, which he calls Crossover Incentives. In other words, this is a Discord-adjacent game that wraps community-desirable actions—such as talking about the community on social media, or looking for people who trash-talking the community&#8211;and incentivizes them through in-game activities.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>This is the first game ever made, to my knowledge, where an action on Discord, or Twitter, or in front of the Oakland Coliseum, can materially alter a game’s fundamental reality.</strong></p>

<p>Not as a hack or a trick, but built directly into the game engine from the beginning. Tons of the game’s underlying variables are adjustable from external inputs, giving players across multiple mediums (Discord, Twitter, Physical, etc.) more control than ever over a game.</p>

<p>So the Core Concepts are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reactive Reality</li>
<li>Simultaneous Realities</li>
<li>Crossover Incentives</li>
</ol>

<p>When you combine these you end up with a completely new type of game that merges game, community, and reality into one, which he’s referred to as Metagaming (think meta in RPGs combined with mixing worlds). So you have the game itself that has adjustment and change built right into its core (Reactive Reality). Then you have gaming activity happening across multiple dimensions simultaneously, including in-game, on Twitter, in Discord, and in physical reality (Simultaneous Realities). And then you have in-game activities affecting real-world communities and vice-versa (Crossover Incentives).</p>

<p>Here are a couple of examples:</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">
<div class="text-lg font-bold">The UL Newsletter: Finding the Patterns in the Noise…</div>
<div class="text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-lg">Get a weekly analysis of what's happening in security and tech—<em>and why it matters</em>.</div>
<div class="mt-2"><form action="https://danielmiessler.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292&amp;id=49fdb7d723" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="mc-embedded-subscribe-form validate inline" novalidate > 
            <div>
            <div class="mc-field-group">
            <input  placeholder="your best email" type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL">
            <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="button text-system">
            </div>
            <div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292_49fdb7d723" tabindex="-1" value=""></div>
            </div>
            </form></div>
</div>
</div>

<ul>
<li><p>Let’s say you just had a major player die in your clan within Rifters, and you really wish you could resurrect them. You can speak with a game avatar and forge an agreement that says if you can get 10 influencers of X amount of power to take the following action, that will create enough power outside of the game to cross the Rift into the game!</p></li>
<li><p>Or let’s say you create some amazing item in the game and you want to give it ungodly powers. You can can go to an avatar and make a deal in which you bring X number of new viewers into a given location, and that attention will result in the Avatar being pleased with you in-game, giving you the ability to forge a +5 weapon instead of a +2 weapon. And it’s up to you to negotiate that pact, including what you have to do and how it will affect the game.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Crucially—this isn’t a change that happens for just you, in your own instance. No. These are game-wide changes. You are literally able to leverage your community, your network, and—most importantly your creativity—to forge pacts that affect the underlying rules of the game for everyone in it.</p>

<p>So those are the main elements, but here are some additional mechanisms that add to vitality.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Personalized Items — Items are created within Rifters that are named after specific individuals in real life. Like, “Will Wheaton’s Wand of Woe”. Anyone else can wield it, and it’ll be a fine weapon at +1 and the ability to fix any technical problem. But if Will Wheaton actually shows up and claims it, it becomes a +5 weapon, with its own custom art, and a whole list of additional buffs. Plus, the guild he joins with will get a ton of additional advantages both in the game as well as in their Discord community. Again: crossing the boundary between real and game worlds!</p></li>
<li><p>Tribal CTF — One of the primary dynamics is 8 factions that make up each game, and the fact that they are each NFT communities. Groan, I know, NFTs. Well, remember, it’s not the NFT bit that matters here: it’s the community bit. This allows things like a community’s Discord channel saying, “Hey, we’re going against BORED APES in Rifters, let’s go kick some ass!”</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div></li>
<li><p>Importance Mapping — The more powerful a given item (in this model an NFT), the more powerful the item in game. This encourages people with powerful NFTs to bring their item into Rifters to see how powerful they can be.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So that brings the complete list to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reactive Reality</li>
<li>Simultaneous Realities</li>
<li>Crossover Incentives</li>
<li>Personalized Items</li>
<li>Tribal CTF</li>
<li>Importance Mapping</li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, so those are some of the core ideas, with a few examples. To hear more, listen to <a href="https://omny.fm/shows/unsupervised-learning/metagaming-an-interview-with-andrew-ringlein">the included podcast</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_138155" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138155" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/dalle-midjourney.png" alt="dalle-midjourney" width="650" height="585" class="size-full wp-image-138155" /><p id="caption-attachment-138155" class="wp-caption-text">Created by Midjourney</p></div>

<p>We&#8217;ve all been marveling at DALL-E 2 for the last few months. For good reason. It&#8217;s stunning.</p>

<p>Well, now there are multiple competitors. I just spent some time messing with the latest one that has a ton of hype, called <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/">Midjourney</a>.</p>

<p class="callout">Midjourney is macOS and DALL-E is the Linux CLI.</p>

<p>The obvious question for both beginners and experts is, &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference?&#8221;</p>

<p>The easiest way to answer that is to say that Midjourney is like using a Mac. And DALL-E is like using the Linux command line. This is true in three main dimensions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ease of Use: Midjourney does better with simpler prompts.</li>
<li>Weaker But Safer: Midjourney is less powerful, but does better if you are lazy.</li>
<li>A Bias Towards Beauty: Midjourney produces better-looking output with very little effort</li>
</ol>

<div id="attachment_138156" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138156" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/midjourney-showcase.png" alt="midjourney-showcase" width="650" height="629" class="size-full wp-image-138156" /><p id="caption-attachment-138156" class="wp-caption-text">Some samples from the Midjourney Showcase</p></div>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>I just wrote another post for the site about censorship vs. company autonomy, and I wanted to use Midjourney to make the blog header image. I used the prompt:</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>An art piece showing the violence between internet censorship vs. free speech.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s what DALL-E gave me:</p>

<div id="attachment_138160" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138160" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/dalle-censorship.png" alt="dalle-censorship" width="650" height="157" class="size-full wp-image-138160" /><p id="caption-attachment-138160" class="wp-caption-text">Interesting but not immediately compelling</p></div>

<p>And after only a few minutes from research to creating, I got this from Midjourney:</p>

<div id="attachment_138162" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138162" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/midjourney-censorship.png" alt="midjourney-censorship" width="650" height="353" class="size-full wp-image-138162" /><p id="caption-attachment-138162" class="wp-caption-text">Midjourney&#8217;s attempts at the same prompt</p></div>

<p>I have tried some other queries where I went from basic to extremely nuanced DALL-E queries (vs. Midjourney), and I was able to get DALL-E to win. But it took a lot of time. A lot of trial and error. Midjourney gets to something very cool with very little prompt engineering.</p>

<p class="callout">It&#8217;s like DALL-E was trained off of all art, and Midjourney was trained off of <em>Deviant Art</em>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s almost like Midjourney was trained off of images that people already love, whereas DALL-E can generate much more, but with a correspondingly larger Margin for Meh. To say that another way, I&#8217;ve made a million DALL-E images that were total throwaway misses. With Midjourney, almost everything you make is at least a little bit cool.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<h2>Interface differences</h2>

<p>The other big difference is that DALL-E is run from a full website or via API. Midjourney on the other hand is run via Discord bot. It&#8217;s an interesting choice, and likely a brilliant one. It&#8217;s basically taken over the mindshare within the gaming world very quickly, with so many people there being 1) inclined towards pretty looking DeviantArt-like images, 2) not super interested in reading a 75-page prompt engineering book, and 3) already highly familiar with Discord.</p>

<p>Bottom line: you <strong>have</strong> to go play with this thing. So:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you&#8217;re a hardcore AI and/or Art person, you should be messing with DALL-E first and Midjourney second.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re light on the AI stuff and more interested in gaming or NFTs or just having cool art for various purposes, start with Midjourney.</li>
</ol>

As in most cases, a careful review of the source material reveals this not to be true.</p>

<p class="note">I can&#8217;t say for sure if we perfectly align on the grey areas.</p>

<p>Because it appears I almost perfectly align with Sam on this, I&#8217;m going to give and defend my own perspective on this topic. The source material in question seems to have been <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/triggernometry/id1375568988?i=1000576426254">the Triggernometry Podcast</a> where Sam appeared recently.</p>

<p>The pivotal quote was something like, &#8220;There was a liberal conspiracy to keep Trump out of office and that was ok.&#8221; This melted the minds of the hosts, and Sam quickly explained the meaning of his comment. Note: he didn&#8217;t retract it; he explained it.</p>

<p>He said it all depends on what you mean by conspiracy, which is completely valid. He said if it means a bunch of people sitting around in a room plotting how to keep him from being elected again, then that qualifies, and it definitely happened.</p>

<p>Again, completely logical.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>His analogy was a conspiracy to stop an asteroid from hitting the earth. Are there people sitting around plotting against the asteroid? Damn straight. Same with Trump. Of course we can disagree on whether or not he&#8217;s an asteroid, but once it&#8217;s granted that some people do belive that, his point stands.</p>

<p>He then went on to clarify that he didn&#8217;t mean stuffing ballots or doing anything <em>illegal</em> to keep him out of office. It can be a conspiracy and be completely legally carried out.</p>

<p>So yeah, that was the main lightning rod statement from the interview as far as I can tell. Now onto the bigger point of companies being able to self-sensor.</p>

<p>Sam&#8217;s point there was that it should be ok, in 2022, to have a podcast only for tall pretty people. So like Sam wouldn&#8217;t be allowed on there (his words, lol). He said he wouldn&#8217;t support such a thing a few decades ago, but he would now.</p>

<p>This is where the grey starts for me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m with Sam on this. That&#8217;s where the free market, and the freedom of a company should come in. But here&#8217;s the problem: what happens when all identifying attributes can become the source of discrimination.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<ul>
<li>Men</li>
<li>Women</li>
<li>Non-binary</li>
<li>Not funny</li>
<li>Funny</li>
<li>Tall</li>
<li>Athletic</li>
<li>Beautiful</li>
<li>Black, White, Asian, Hispanic</li>
<li>Comedians</li>
<li>Professionals</li>
</ul>

<p>There are infinite ways to slice things and people if you try. And people do try. So the question is if you try to go on the new TallnPretty Podcast network, but you are 6&#8217;3&#8243; and you&#8217;re rejected, what does that mean?</p>

<p>And what if you&#8217;re also considered pretty, but the show has never had a gay person on it yet. Were you rejected because you were gay or because you weren&#8217;t pretty enough? Nobody on the outside will ever know the reason. And this would be theoretical if we didn&#8217;t have cake makers saying they don&#8217;t want to make cakes for gay couples.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s my cognitive dissonace right there. Here it is in steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes, companies should be able to choose who to have and not have as customers, or on a media show</li>
<li>But not if they&#8217;re discriminating based on something harmful and toxic to society, like race or gender</li>
<li>Ok, fine, but what about all the other things that aren&#8217;t as bad as race and gender, but are still very similar?</li>
</ol>

<p>That&#8217;s where it all turns grey and falls apart.</p>

<p>Oh, and then you have the public square issue.</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">

<p>Twitter isn&#8217;t just one twitter among many. It&#8217;s the only one. Or one of very few anyway.</p>

<p>Censorship is supposed to only apply to the government disallowing things, but in our changing reality it&#8217;s starting to arguably become &#8220;that with overwhelming force&#8221;. That would still include government of course, but it would also encompass bigger things like &#8220;the media&#8221; or monopolistic media platforms, like Twitter.</p>

<p>So, what is one to do? I don&#8217;t know, and neither does anyone else. This is hard.</p>

<p>Here are some guidelines though:</p>

<ol>
<li>Companies should start with the ability to do whatever they want, except for as it pertains to discrimination based on historic and toxic discrimination like race and gender.</li>
<li>If you want to only allow tall and beautiful people on your podcast, you should be allowed to do that. No organization should be able to compel you to invite and host short and less attractive people. That&#8217;s super gross and dysfunctional.</li>
<li>In other words, any company should be able to publish a policy and follow it. Such as banning Jones and Trump. Ideally such a policy would be fair, but in the case of Twitter it seems to be highly biased against the right. But perhaps because the right is more often violating their policy. Again, that policy is up to them.</li>
<li>However, once a company hits a certain size or influence (or lack of competition), perhaps it should lose some of these freedoms in the spirit of the government-aimed free speech laws? That seems logical. I do so Twitter as something like a Town Square. And it does seem clearly biased towards the left. But I don&#8217;t know what to do about that other than to start another company like Truth Social to counter it. And if Twitter were to try to stop that somehow in a gross way now we&#8217;re in monopoly conversations.</li>
<li>So fundamentally the market should help us fight out of this problem by having a biased actor get penalized by the customer. </li>
</ol>

<p>The irony here, which Sam has brought up multiple times, is that this is normally the conservative argument. But now they&#8217;ve somehow forgotten it because they really want to be on Twitter. Too bad. Free market, remember?</p>

<p>And a bunch of liberals are somehow mad at Sam and others making similar arguments, as I am here. Sam and I have only voted for Democrats in our lives. No Republicans. Ever.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div>

<p>Yet somehow we&#8217;re making the free market argument against Conservatives, who want the government to force Twitter to go easy on the Right.</p>

<p>Strange world.</p>

<p>Bottom line here is that this is really hard, but the principles above are the somewhat lighted path.</p>

<ol>
<li>Freedom by default</li>
<li>Except for historic discrimination</li>
<li>And if the thing gets too big with no competition, maybe exert some kind of corrective force to fix things</li>
</ol>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

</p>

<p>Our creativity is like a daily pool of water within each of us.</p>

<p>When we use it, it depletes a bit. When we’re distracted it quickly drains. And when we’re alone with our thoughts it replenishes.</p>

<p>In an ideal world you’d wake up and have a full day of creativity ahead of you. You’d just sit down and create, and your reservoir would grow a thousand ideas.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>But the modern world has tapped our daily reserves with continuous distraction. Most notably our phones. When we stare at a screen our ideas dry up like a cracked lakebed, and somehow it makes us want to eat more dust to quench our thirst.</p>

<p>Showers are an exception. In the shower we become an idea firehose. Why is that?</p>

<p>The reason you become creative in the shower is because it’s (mostly) impossible to be distracted. You’re just there—naked—with your own thoughts. And suddenly you become a genius.</p>

<p>Showers reveal that the natural state is to have ideas, and to be creative. It&#8217;s what happens when you are not distracted, and you can prove this by just sitting in a quiet place with no inputs for 5-30 minutes. You&#8217;ll overflow with thoughts.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<p>This also works with solitary walks. No phone. No podcasts. No audiobooks. Just you and your surroundings. Like in the shower, the ideas will spill from you.</p>

<p>So what’s the lesson here?</p>

<ol>
<li>In our natural, idle state we produce a replentishing pool of creative water.</li>
<li>Being distracted siphons off that creativity into nowhere.</li>
<li>If you value being inspired, spend time alone with nothing but your mind. </li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/one-medical-amazon.png" alt="one-medical-amazon" width="630" height="394" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-138126" /></p>

<p>A number of security people have come out against Amazon buying One Medical.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s to be expected, as most security people are rightly worried about big corporations getting a hold of more personal data. And the timing couldn&#8217;t have been worse, with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-ring-gives-footage-cops">the story about Amazon sharing Ring footage with police</a> only a few weeks old.</p>

<p><center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Why is <a href="https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Amazon</a> acquiring <a href="https://twitter.com/onemedical?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OneMedical</a> bad news?&quot;<br><br>Let&#39;s explore.<br><br>1. Horizontal integration at Amazon scale of a company that now has the right to access my medical records under HIPAA opens up a huge problem for abuse.</p>&mdash; Corey Quinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1550130226830516226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center></p>

<p>But I have a different take. The opposite, actually.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>First, I agree that Amazon sharing footage without permission is sketch. And I expect them to fix that. Soon.</p>

<p>But when I hear something new is bad, I don&#8217;t just jump on with everyone else. First I ask how things are currently going. So how about it?</p>

<p>Do you like the current security level for medical records? For small businesses in the medical field? For hospitals? For the government?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t. I think it&#8217;s all rubbish. I think medical records are not only broken in terms of interoperability, but so is the security of most of the companies that maintain them.</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the thing&#8212;I think the only force that can possibly make that better is someone big enough to actually get security.</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">

            <div>
            <div class="mc-field-group">
            <input  placeholder="your best email" type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL">
            <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="button text-system">
            </div>
            <div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292_49fdb7d723" tabindex="-1" value=""></div>
            </div>
            </form></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If I had to pick a place to put my records I&#8217;d go with a company that, say, runs the infrastructure of most of the internet. Like the company that runs AWS. Like Amazon.</p>

<p>I simply don&#8217;t see a world in which they decide it&#8217;s a good idea to be cavalier with peoples&#8217; medical data. It&#8217;s not in their interest. The thing that&#8217;s in their interest is being trusted with that data, and doing a good job protecting it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like Google&#8217;s ad-focused model, but guess what? If they got everyone&#8217;s medical data it wouldn&#8217;t be that bad either. I&#8217;d be more worried than with Amazon, but I think both companies are smart enough to know what to sell and what not to sell.</p>

<p>And when it comes to knowing how to secure their data and products, I&#8217;ve not seen many companies better than Amazon.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=2></div>

<p>So that&#8217;s my argument: Amazon will be better at securing medical data than One Medical or any other medical startup. And they&#8217;re not likely to abuse that power because of how bad it would be for their business.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s about to be important, because all the big companies are likely to play there soon. See Apple. And yeah, probably Google as well at some point.</p>

<p>Sign me up. It&#8217;s not ideal, but it&#8217;s better than whatever it is we have now.</p>

<p>Sam Harris just had Marc Andreessen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppgKMz-pqLM">on his show</a> and I heard a concept in the episode that intrigued me.</p>

<p>They were talking about their current politics and Marc said he&#8217;s now seeing things according to James Burnham&#8217;s model of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managerial-Revolution-What-Happening-World/dp/0837156785">Managerial Capitalism</a>, which is an instance of the Principal-Agent problem.</p>

<p>The Principal-Agent problem is where owners (Principals) put managers (Agents) in charge of their businesses or assets, and there are misaligned incentives between the agent and the principal.</p>

<p>Burnham argued in his books in the 1940&#8217;s that there&#8217;s a new type of Capitalism on the rise, powered by managers rather than owners, and that this was a bad thing. Andreesen uses that model to say that our current systems are all horribly broken due to this effect. Basically, government, media, education, etc.&#8212;they&#8217;re all impotent and stagnant because nobody wants to take any risks. Why? Because they&#8217;re all agents, or managers, instead of being owners.</p>

<p>This rhymes strongly with things like <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, and other Ayn Rand books, where the creators and builders were seen as the heroes while the rest of the world was wasting away in mediocrity and bureaucracy.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p class="callout">I&#8217;m not with you in abandoning current systems until you have a plan for replacing them.</p>

<p>The model resonates with me, which I hope means it has some truth to it. But lots of models have truth to them. And one of the biggest problems I think smart people have is taking a nice model and dialing it from a 6 to a 17&#8212;which turns it from a model to an ideology.</p>

<p>At that point it goes from being a tool to being a lens. Which would be fine if the lens were swapped out with other lenses, but those that tend to fall into this trap want to use that one model for everything, and they reject other models or data that would indicate their model is imperfect.</p>

<p>Sam pushed back on this. He mentioned the danger of worshiping all-powerful &#8220;principals&#8221;, or creators, or owners&#8212;which gets us to a North Korea type situation. Marc pushed back by saying that&#8217;s an extreme, and you can have middle ground where someone decides to create a city, for example, like happened with LA.</p>

<p>Sam&#8217;s other example was Trump being banned by Twitter. He exposed Marc&#8217;s (or at least many Libertarians&#8217;) cognitive dissonance that they usually argue private companies should be allowed to do anything they want, because it&#8217;s their company. Marc responded to this very poorly, basically saying,</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">

<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s funny when liberals suddenly find libertarianism when it&#8217;s convenient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be fair, he did say he couldn&#8217;t fully respond because of ongoing litigation, but it definitely felt like a defensive response to Sam uncovering inconsistency in his argument.</p>

<h2>Libertarian nihilism</h2>

<p>As for me, I found the Principals vs. Agents model, and the idea of Managerial vs. Bourgeois Capitalism, to be very interesting. I like the model, and I think it has explanatory power. But I feel like I was exposed to a serious dose of Libertarian Nihilism.</p>

<p>One of Marc&#8217;s main lines in the discussion was having virtually no trust in institutions, and thinking that any trust people do have is undeserved. His solution was new institutions.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a super opinion to have when you&#8217;re a billionaire. I&#8217;m not anti-billionaire, or anti-wealth. And I agree with his main model for how things are failing. I&#8217;m just saying abandoning trust in our government and media and other core institutions isn&#8217;t a great idea unless there&#8217;s a plan for a replacement.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=2></div>

<p>Rich people with startups in those spaces is not the same thing as a plan.</p>

<p>Anyway, I really enjoyed the conversation. And I especially enjoyed seeing this Thielian type of libertarianism (at least I think this is the same breed) come face to face with someone like Sam. Sam tried to tell him multiple times he wasn&#8217;t some raving Leftist&#8212;that he was just asking logical questions.</p>

<p>If you have any other thoughts on how the discussion went, feel free to reach out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/dalle-bougey.png" alt="dalle-bougey" width="650" height="586" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-138078" /></p>

<p>In my reading the term (and concept) <em>Bourgeoisie</em> comes up so often that I cannot afford to have a light grasp of it. I have learned, mis-learned, forgotten, and relearned its definition so many times that I&#8217;m forced to create this page to remind myself.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my summary:</p>

<p class="note">Other languages also have a town-like word that also starts with something like &#8220;burg&#8221;.</p>

<ul>
<li>The term comes from &#8220;city&#8221;, or town, which is where the &#8220;bourg&#8221; bit. Think Hamburg. Berg means town. It&#8217;s French, from Old French, from Old Frankish. Burg. So the bourgeoisie were a class of people rising up in prominence from cities.</li>
<li>City is important because of what came before that, which was feudal and land-based. So basically in the old world you were important if you owned land, and then when the industrial revolution happens you have the creation of machines and lots of wealth starts getting concentrated in cities.</li>
<li>In the 18th century the bourgeois and bourgeoise (male and female versions) also represented the rich among the common people, meaning among the people who were not part of the aristocracy. So they were the &#8220;people&#8221; who ousted the King and the aristocracy in the French Revolution.</li>
<li>Since the 19th century the term has come to mean the ruling class of a capitalist society, and its also associated with a social class based around economic materialism and hedonism. Think Great Gatsby.</li>
<li>Early on this was made up of people who lived in cities and included people like craftsmen, artisans, and merchants. They are between the owners and the peasants. This slowly grew to include managers of such people. But still not the owners.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s another connotation of the term which is materialistic to the point of being philistine, i.e., unsophisticated and unrefined. Think someone who&#8217;s shallow and would rather go to a high-end mall rather than to an art gallery to see and discuss actual art.</li>
<li>In the late 20th century we saw terms like &#8220;bougie&#8221; or &#8220;boujee&#8221; being a negative term meaning someone of lower or middle class who is doing pretentious things like driving EVs or eating avocado toast try to appear upper class.</li>
<li>The transition of <em>bourgs</em> to cities in Central and Western Europe happened in the 11th century. So, around the year 1000-1100. Guilds were a big part of this. </li>
</ul>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/bougey-650x386.png" alt="bougey" width="650" height="386" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138076" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Kings had a problem with Feudal lords because they were a threat to power, and so they partnered with this new ruling class in cities (the bourgeoisoi) to topple the feudal lords and thus feudalism, resulting in the move towards capitalism.</li>
<li>Feudalism &#8211;> Capitalism, helped by cooperation between monarchies and the bourgeoisie. </li>
<li>According to Marxist thought, the bourgeoisie were supporters of the concepts of constitutions, natural rights, and opposition to the idea of divine right to rule.</li>
<li>The English Civil War, American War of Independence, and French Revolution were motivated by the bourgeoisie wanting to abolish not just the feudal rule over them, but also the royal rule over them.</li>
<li>This is the start of liberalism, <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-difference-between-classical-liberalism-and-libertarianism/">which I wrote about here</a>, which is fundamentally the idea of throwing off a controlling authority to gain one&#8217;s own freedom.</li>
<li>According to Marx, the bourgeoisie were originally self-employeed business people, like merchants, bankers, or entrepreneurs (this is during the middle ages). But after the industrial revolution (1750-1850) they became the owners and the ruling economic class. Specifically, they owned the means of production and also the means of cohesion (police, military, prisons, etc.).</li>
<li>This is where the transition took place of bourgeoisie vs. the worker. So it&#8217;s bourgeoisie vs. the proletariat or the working class.</li>
<li>In English bourgeoisie means middle classes, but in French it means both middle and upper classes. The bourgeoisie in France and many French-speaking countries consists of five tiered social layers: petite bourgeoisie, moyenne bourgeoisie, grande bourgeoisie, haute bourgeoisie and ancienne bourgeoisie.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What GPT-3 thinks</h2>

<div id="attachment_138082" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138082" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/modern-bougie.png" alt="modern-bougie" width="650" height="650" class="size-full wp-image-138082" /><p id="caption-attachment-138082" class="wp-caption-text">What GPT-3 thinks a modern bourgeois party looks like</p></div>

<p>Here&#8217;s what OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3 thinks bourgeoisie means:</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term bourgeoisie refers to a social class who are considered to be the elite of society. They typically have a high level of education and hold positions of power and influence. They are often characterized by their wealth and luxurious lifestyle.<br /><br /><cite>GPT-3</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this one is weighted towards elite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The word &#8220;bourgeoisie&#8221; is used to describe the middle and upper class of a society. These people are typically educated and have high-paying jobs. They often enjoy a comfortable lifestyle with many material possessions.<br /><br /><cite>GPT-3</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one says middle and upper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The word &#8220;bourgeoisie&#8221; is used to describe the middle class in a society. It is typically used in countries where there is a significant difference between the wealthy and poor classes. The bourgeois class is typically seen as being wealthy, but not as wealthy as the aristocracy. They are also often considered to be more educated and cultured than the working class.<br /><br /><cite>GPT-3</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this one says middle, but mentions that they&#8217;re more educated and cultured than the workers.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>These GPT-3 summaries are quite interesting, and they capture well the conflicting messaging in the basic points in the content above.</p>

<p>Basically, there seem to be two main definitions and uses, and it&#8217;s hard to know exactly which one is using without more context. 1) Middle class in a society where there are poor people and super-rich or aristocrats, and 2) the upper class.</p>

<p>I think if you&#8217;re talking about a historical context, the term means a city-based middle class that broke away from the poor to gain increasing power in society. And if you&#8217;re talking about a more modern interpretation, the bourgeoisie are merged with the rich to become the upper class.</p>

<p>I feel most at home inside of a shell. Specifically a <code>zsh</code> shell.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve done <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Adanielmiessler.com+shell+%7C+bash+%7C+zsh&#038;oq=site%3Adanielmiessler.com+shell+%7C+bash+%7C+zsh&#038;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.14863j0j4&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8">dozens of shell optimization posts</a> over the years, and I thought it was time for an update. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m currently using and why.</p>

<p class="note">Every shell I use on every box looks identical to this.</p>

<h2>Shell Basics</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> MacOS</li>
<li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Terminal (built-in)</li>
<li><strong>Terminal Font:</strong> Meslo LG L Regular Nerd Font Complete 15 </li>
<li><strong>Shell Upgrade:</strong> Oh-My-Zsh</li>
<li><strong>Shell Icons:</strong> <code>lsd</code></li>
<li><strong>Theme:</strong> af-magic</li>
</ul>

<p>The top image is the result of an <code>ls -lah</code> in my home directory on this box. Couple of things to notice:</p>

<p class="note"><code>lsd</code> requires that you install Nerd Fonts.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<ol>
<li>If you&#8217;re wondering why everything looks so awesome, it&#8217;s because I have <code>lsd</code> installed, which gives you those sick-looking colors and icons. It also makes stuff way more human-readable. It&#8217;s just generally a must.</li>
<li>I use a super-minimal <code>PS1</code> prompt, which is from the <code>af-magic</code> theme in <code>oh-my-zsh</code>. It&#8217;s super clean on the left side, but also gives you user@host in grey on the right side. Love. It.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Vim Basics</h2>

<div id="attachment_138013" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138013" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/vim-conf-650x473.png" alt="vim-conf" width="650" height="473" class="size-medium wp-image-138013" /><p id="caption-attachment-138013" class="wp-caption-text">Editing my vim config using my vim conf</p></div>

<p class="note">Explaining why I use <code>neovim</code> over <code>vim</code> will take a while.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vim Base:</strong> NeoVim</li>
<li><strong>Colorscheme:</strong> afterglow</li>
<li><strong>Powerline:</strong> vim-airline</li>
</ul>

<p>My Vim window is ideally decorated for my taste:</p>

<ol>
<li>Buffer indicator in the top left.</li>
<li>Mode and path in bottom left.</li>
<li>Filetype.</li>
<li>Location information.</li>
<li>Any issues with the file (such as trailing spaces).</li>
</ol>

<div id="attachment_138017" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138017" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/vim-options-650x396.png" alt="vim-options" width="650" height="396" class="size-medium wp-image-138017" /><p id="caption-attachment-138017" class="wp-caption-text">My vim plugins directory</p></div>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<p>The pieces above are mostly about appearance. Here are some of the main things I do to improve my shell&#8217;s functionality:</p>

<h3>Basic Mappings</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>jk</code> for ESC</strong>: As I talk about in <a href="/study/vim/">my Vim tutorial</a>, I use <code>jk</code> as my ESC key.</li>
<li><strong><code>'</code> for Mapleader</strong>: I use Leader shortcuts a lot, and it&#8217;s nice to be able to just slide my right pinky over one key to activate them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Zsh-Plugins</h3>

<p class="note">My most common leader shortcuts are <code>'-s</code> and <code>'-sp</code> for spelling stuff, and <code>'-n</code> for line numbers.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>zsh-autosuggestions</strong>: This gives you fish-like autocomplete for commands. Trust me, it&#8217;s rad.</li>
<li><strong>zsh-syntax-highlighting</strong>: This one gives you either red or green feedback based on whether you&#8217;ve typed a valid command. Combined with autosuggestions it&#8217;s a massive shell upgrade.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CLI Enhancements</h3>

<div id="attachment_138023" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138023" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/vim-mode-650x396.png" alt="vim-mode" width="650" height="396" class="size-medium wp-image-138023" /><p id="caption-attachment-138023" class="wp-caption-text">Vim commands on the CLI for the win</p></div>

<p>One of my favorite parts about Vim is being able to use it to navigate and edit my command line.</p>

<p>So if I mess up something on the command line, I can type <code>jk</code> to move into <code>NORMAL</code> mode, use my Vim commands to move around the command with <code>w</code> or <code>b</code>, press <code>i</code> to go back into <code>INSERT</code> mode, and continue on. Plus I can scroll through my command history using <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>If you enjoy the power of UNIX and Linux, and you spend a lot of time in the shell, it&#8217;s worth making that time as efficient and good-looking as possible.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>zsh</code></li>
<li><code>oh-my-zsh</code></li>
<li><code>lsd</code></li>
<li>Zsh Plugins to make <code>zsh</code> work like <code>fish</code>.</li>
<li>Zsh and Vim plugins to make them stand out visually.</li>
<li>Config changes to make both <code>zsh</code> and <code>vim</code> more efficient.</li>
</ol>

<p>Plus, hacking is 349% more fun if your shell is 🔥, and there&#8217;s no pride like having someone gush over your setup 👀.</p>

<p>So yeah—even if you don&#8217;t use my exact settings I hope this inspires you to do some upgrades!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/push-pull-650x325.gif" alt="push-pull" width="650" height="325" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-137981" /></p>

<p>Companies are doing something smart (and sometimes a bit gross) during this economic…<em>whatever this is</em>. They&#8217;re using the downturn as an opportunity to get rid of people they don&#8217;t like, which solidifies their workforce.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the move:</p>

<ol>
<li>They have to remove people anyway because of the recession.</li>
<li>Find the groups of people who have annoyed them in the last few years.</li>
<li>They put out a public message designed to repel them.</li>
<li>Use those extra heads to save money or hire people who want to work there.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Meta says <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/07/01/mark-zuckerberg-meta-wants-to-oust-workers-who-shouldnt-be-here/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">some of their employees probably shouldn&#8217;t work there</a>.</li>
<li>Elon <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-tesla-remote-work-return-to-office/#:~:text=Elon%20Musk%20has%20had%20it,work%20is%20no%20longer%20acceptable.%22">stopped most work from home</a>.</li>
<li>Netflix said <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-to-employees-if-you-dont-like-our-content-you-can-quit-11652478092">if you don&#8217;t like our content you should quit</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s smart, but it also feels pretty slippery&#8212;especially if/when it was the company&#8217;s misbehavior that caused the people to be unhappy in the first place.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>Anyway. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s happening at every company. Or at yours. But it is happening.</p>

<p>Maybe now you&#8217;ll notice it more, and you&#8217;ll be able to ask the two natural follow-up questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Who are they trying to get rid of?</li>
<li>What statements have they made to expedite that?</li>
</ol>

<p>The US&#8217;s terminal conflict will be an internal one, fought between people who only see America&#8217;s flaws and those who pretend they don&#8217;t exist. And of course, both are wrong.</p>

<p>The US has done some horrific shit in its history, and we still have many problems. But we&#8217;re still one of the best places in the world for an oppressed person to move in search of freedom.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re Black, or non-CIS in any way, or follow a non-dominant religion, the US and some parts of Western Europe are your absolute best places to move, which is why immigration flows so heavily into those areas. If America were 1/10th as bad as the extreme left thinks it is, it wouldn&#8217;t be <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/161435/100-million-worldwide-dream-life.aspx">the top desired destination</a> (Gallup) for immigrants. Which it is.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>Yet at the same time, we just overturned Roe. We run prisons as an industrial complex. And we are failing to educate most of our children. So, as usual, both of the extremes fail to understand <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-difference-between-both-sidesing-all-lives-matter-and-acknowledging-complexity/">the principle of Multiple Truths</a>. America is simultaneously a mess and one of the best countries in the world.</p>

<p>Sadly that&#8217;s only because most of the rest of the world is truly horrific when it comes to human rights for Black people, women, the queer community, and those who have unorthodox beliefs. So it&#8217;s a low bar, but we&#8217;re absolutely still at the top. If you doubt this, the cure for your ailment is spending more time traveling outside the US and Europe where we talk incessantly about how horrible we are.</p>

<p>We need to both hate and worship ourselves less&#8212;and find ways to pursue the mentality once captured by Bill Clinton:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There isn’t anything that’s wrong with America that can’t be fixed with what’s right with America.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>
</blockquote>

<p>I like that a lot. I&#8217;m not sure I believe it, but I want to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/cybersecurity-ravine-650x643.png" alt="cybersecurity-ravine" width="650" height="643" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-137949" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s common to hear that it&#8217;s hard to get into cybersecurity, and that this is a problem. That seems to be true, but it&#8217;s informative to ask a simple follow-up:</p>

<p class="note">The current cybersecurity jobs gap sits at around <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/06/21/hiring-cybersecurity-practitioners/">2.7 million people</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A problem for who?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think what we&#8217;re facing is an instance of the Two-Worlds Problem that&#8217;s now everywhere in US society. It&#8217;s where the vast majority of people are feeling pain from an issue, but there&#8217;s an elite that lives in a reality where the problem doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re living in two different worlds.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is parenting getting more difficult? <em>Ask your nannies to spend more time with them</em>.</li>
<li>Are groceries more expensive? <em>Have your assistant shop at both Whole Foods and Trader Joe&#8217;s</em>.</li>
<li>Is gas expensive? <em>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re a Tesla family</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s the same for security hiring. For MANGA and Unicorn companies&#8212;henceforth known as Mangacorns&#8212;hiring cybersecurity talent is a nanny browsing Whole Foods with a Platinum Amex.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>They get the best of the best. The best candidates, from the best schools, as well as named talent from throughout the industry. And when these fresh college graduates ask for over 200K in base salary, and the named talent asks for over a million in total comp, they plop down the Mangacorn Amex.</p>

<p class="callout">At Mangacorn recruiting, most of their days involve the logistics of &#8216;giant garbage trucks of cash&#8217;.</p>

<p>So, for them, everything is fine. Cybersecurity skills shortage? Never heard of it. Everyone wants to work here and they love what we pay!</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s one world, and just like the parents with nannies and the families with Teslas and shopping assistants, they have a real hard time understanding complaints about gas and grocery prices. The problem is everywhere and everyone else. So in other words, the other 95%.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<p>For everyone else there are problems on both the hiring side and on the getting-hired side. It&#8217;s both hard for companies to find <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/day-1-skills-required-to-land-an-entry-level-cybersecurity-job/">qualified people</a>, and <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-problem-with-cybersecurity-hiring/">it&#8217;s hard for early-career applicants to get taken seriously</a> enough to get their first shot.</p>

<p><center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Long thread but serious talk.<br><br>Seeing a massive problem in the security industry today. We have brand new candidates lacking &quot;hands on&quot; experience coming into the workforce and finding it extremely difficult to find a job. 1/10</p>&mdash; Dave Kennedy (@HackingDave) <a href="https://twitter.com/HackingDave/status/1537594916586520576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center></p>

<p>One can absolutely argue that it isn&#8217;t Mangacorn&#8217;s responsibility to fix this, but that’s the problem isn’t it? That’s the difference between a healthy society and an unhealthy society. In the unhealthy one, you hear people say a lot that it’s not their responsibility, and in the healthy one people find things that are not their responsibility and they make it so.</p>

<p>From the title you might be thinking I&#8217;m down on Capitalism and I&#8217;m about to go all Marx you. Nope. I think Capitalism is still&#8212;by far&#8212;the best of our bad options for managing such things. The problem is the above: responsibility. Or more specifically, in a world where there&#8217;s a thriving 5% at the top of any system, who&#8217;s going to take responsibility for the other 95%?</p>

<p class="callout">If you ask any French cybersecurity recruiter in 1799 they&#8217;ll tell you it&#8217;s the 5%&#8217;s problem as well.</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">

            </div>
            </form></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The natural move there is to say the government, but that only seems to work when everyone agrees on the matter&#8212;including the 5%. That&#8217;s why the Viking countries thrive with a blend of capitalism and government: <em>their 5% have taken responsibility for their 95%</em>.</p>

<p class="callout">We need to frame this as responsibility instead of blame.</p>

<p>So, yeah, back to security. In the US we have a lack of someone taking responsibility for building a cybersecurity pipeline. We have a happy 5% in the Mangacorns, and we have a struggling 95% in most SME businesses and startups.</p>

<p>Fairness is not the default state of nature; it&#8217;s something you have to struggle to maintain. The default state is a system of have, have-less’s, and have-nots. And the Mangacorns didn&#8217;t create this broken system we have now; they&#8217;re just benefitting from what came naturally.</p>

<p>But it is time to start blaming them for benefiting from it without doing something about it.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div>

<p>If you want to be the Finland of cybersecurity jobs, the Mangacorns have to take responsibility for the other 95%.</p>

<p>What that means tactically is up for debate, but it starts with the 5% taking responsibility and investing in the pipelines. Maybe that involves some government. Maybe it involves the universities and junior colleges. Maybe it involves big training companies like SANS. And it&#8217;s probably all of the above. My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jhaddix/">Jason Haddix</a> and I talk a lot about what this might look like, and he&#8217;s doing a series of talks about it as well.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re both happy to take any ideas you may have on that front, and to work actively on practical solutions.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you ever find something that’s broken for most of society, and you wonder why it is broken, ask yourself if it’s still working for the top 5% and whether that 5% has taken responsibility for the success for the other 95%. If not, there’s your answer.</p>

<p><em>We&#8217;ve been wrong for decades/centuries/millennia about the most important questions in life&#8212;such as dating, success, and happiness&#8212;and data science is just now starting to provide real answers that are often counter-intuitive.</em></p>

<p><a name="content"></p>

<h2>Content Extraction</h2>

<p></a></p>

<p class="note">All quotes here are from the book itself unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<p class="callout">The discipline of data science can be seen as &#8220;Moneyball for life.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>An analogy he uses in the book is &#8220;Moneyball for Life&#8221;, which is the idea of using high quality data analysis to find ways to get advantages in life that others don&#8217;t know about</li>
<li>This is based on something that happened in Baseball where someone figured out they could buy less expensive players and win way more than they should because the popularity of players did not correspond to their actual effectiveness</li>
<li>One example is the emotional expressiveness of salespeople. It&#8217;s obvious that negative emotions probably won&#8217;t work, but many think being super emotionally positive might work best. But the data science says a more even keel is most effective</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can make better life decisions. Big Data can help you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Marriage</h3>

<ul>
<li>Marriage might be the most important life decision a person makes</li>
<li>People have been trying to figure out how to make a good match for thousands of years</li>
<li>There are now massive datasets to use in answering this question</li>
<li>Common attributes looked at include demographics, attractiveness, sexual tastes, interests and hobbies, mental health, values, etc.</li>
<li>Analysis of all this data turned out to say that you couldn&#8217;t much from it; there weren&#8217;t any big factors that predicted romantic success</li>
<li>It&#8217;s easy to predict what people will like, but not what will be a good match</li>
<li>They looked a lot at dating data and found that certain things were true on dating sites</li>
<li>Attractive people got more responses</li>
<li>Tall men, but not tall women</li>
<li>Race was unfortunately a major factor in who responded to who</li>
<li>Black females responded least to Black males of all races</li>
<li>Income had the biggest response effect for males</li>
<li>After income the occupation mattered a lot as well</li>
<li>Sexy names mattered a lot</li>
<li><strong>The biggest predictor for success with a given person was the answer to:</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Were you satisfied with your life before you met Sally?</li>
<li>Were you free from depression before you met Sally?</li>
<li>Did you have a positive affect before you met Sally?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>These mattered more than anything about Sally. The effect was four times stronger than all the traits of the partner combined.</strong></li>
<li>His summary of the analysis:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the dating market, people compete ferociously for mates with qualities that do not increase one&#8217;s chances of romantic happiness.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>REMARKABLE!</li>
<li>Most likely best mates: someone satisfied with life, secure in themselves, who constantly tries to better themselves</li>
<li>WOW</li>
<li>After looking at all the data the best thing they could say was that if you&#8217;re happy now you&#8217;re more likely to be happy later</li>
</ul>

<h3>Parenting</h3>

<ul>
<li>TLDR: Parenting matters way less than people think</li>
<li>Genetics matter most, and way more than parenting</li>
<li>When you raise biological kids apart, they tend to reach the same levels of success</li>
<li>When you raise adopted kids together they tend to have different levels of success based on their genes</li>
<li>Breastfeeding, TV exposure, and lots of other popsci factors didn&#8217;t have much impact</li>
<li>Including being bilingual</li>
<li>But there is one thing that has a massive impact! NEIGHBORHOOD!</li>
<li>A major study looked at siblings who moved as kids to see how much neighborhoods mattered for good outcomes</li>
<li>By looking at kids that moved you could control for things outside of the neighborhood</li>
<li>The best places for increases in adult income were: Seattle, Minneappolis, Salt Lake City, Reading, and Madison</li>
<li>But it wasn&#8217;t just city; it was neighborhood</li>
<li>They found three major predictors for neighborhoods doing well (the people raised there do well)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Percent of residents who graduated college</li>
<li>Percent of two-parent households</li>
<li>The percent of people who return their census forms</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>So, educated parents who are in a stable family who care about being good citizens</strong></li>
<li>Role models also mattered, e.g., seeing female inventors and Black fathers in the neighborhood</li>
<li>So the adults you expose your kids to really matter</li>
</ul>

<h3>Athletic success</h3>

<ul>
<li>Many sports come down to mostly genes, but some more than others</li>
<li>Every inch of height nearly doubles one&#8217;s chances of being in the NBA</li>
<li>So a man under 6 feet tall has a 1 in 1.2 million chance while someone over 7 feet has a 1/7 chance</li>
<li>There are also body types for sports. Phelps has freakishly long arms and freakishly short legs, for example</li>
<li>Twin studies help differentiate this as well, by how many twins are in a given sport</li>
<li>He found that NBA ability was 75% nature</li>
<li>He found that football and baseball were 25% nature</li>
<li>Highest were Olympic Track and Field, Olympic Wrestlers, Olympic Rowers, and NBA</li>
<li>Lowest were Baseball, Football, Shooters, Cyclists, Fencers, etc</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who&#8217;s Rich in America?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rich people own stuff</li>
<li>Only 20% of the top .1% of earners make most of their money from wages; the rest own businesses</li>
<li>The top businesses with the most millionaires:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Lessors of real estate</li>
<li>Activities related to real estate</li>
<li>Other financial investments</li>
<li>Independent artists, writers, and performers</li>
<li>Durable goods wholesalers</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Get rich checklist:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Do I have a business</li>
<li>How do I avoid ruthless price competition?</li>
<li>How do I avoid getting dominated by a behemoth?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Grinding to success</h3>

<ul>
<li>A 60-year-old startup founder has a 3x higher chance of creating a valuable business than a 30-year-old</li>
<li>Average age of successful tech startup founder is 42.3 years</li>
<li>Outsiders are said to have an advantage from unique perspective, but it&#8217;s the insiders that normally win</li>
</ul>

<h3>Counter-counterintuitive Ideas</h3>

<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s a lot of wisdom that was considered accepted, then got turned on its head, and has again been shown to be true</li>
<li>The most successful employees actually found the most successful firms</li>
<li>NBA players are most likely to come from middle-class, two-parent backgrounds</li>
<li>Jokes are most looked for when people are happy, not sad</li>
<li>IQ advantage doesn&#8217;t level off at a certain point</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hacking luck</h3>

<ul>
<li>Everyone gets opportunities, and luck</li>
<li>The question is how you manage and maximize that luck</li>
<li>The art world is a great example, where you can be X good at art but you will basically have no chance of being seen unless you&#8217;re hustling to get your stuff in galleries and shows</li>
<li>The Mona Lisa become popular due to a fluke, not because it was special</li>
<li>Once the artist becomes successful, it magnifies the value of all their art</li>
<li>People like Dylan and Springsteen and Picasso have something in common: they produced a massive amount of content</li>
<li>More content is more chances to get lucky</li>
<li>More chances to start a snowball</li>
<li>You can use the Picasso dynamic for dating as well</li>
<li>Unattractive men going after attractive women have low odds, but if you simply make lots of attempts you will get responses. Same as Picasso</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nerd Makeovers</h3>

<ul>
<li>Pictures of people and how competent they look is a powerful predictor of who wins elections</li>
<li>The more competent picture person won in 72% of elections by one analysis</li>
<li>Same with military careers and faces that appeared more &#8220;dominant&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Change your life by leaving your couch</h3>

<ul>
<li>We misjudge what makes us happy</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a difference between how bad pain is during a prolonged event vs. how we remember it</li>
<li>An app called Mapiness pinged users throughout the day and asked them:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>What are you doing (different activities)</li>
<li>How are you with?</li>
<li>HOw do you feel from 1 to 100?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>They collected this for multiple years and had over 3 million measurements from over 60,000 people for 40 activities</li>
<li>Sex made people happiness</li>
<li>Theater/Dance/Concert was next</li>
<li>Exhibition/Museum/Library</li>
<li>Sports/Running/Exercise</li>

<li><p>Browsing the Internet</p></li>
<li><p>Notably, reading was only 26. Gaming was 22. Relaxing and sleeping was only 29.</p></li>
<li>Top overrated activities: resting/relaxing/sleeping, gaming, watching TV, eating, browsing the internet</li>
<li>Top underrated activities: museum/library, exercise, drinking, gardening, shopping/errands</li>
</ul>

<li>Most people don&#8217;t know the data around the most important decisions in our life</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve often been told so-called wisdom that&#8217;s very wrong about these decisions</li>
<li>Sometimes the real answers are counterintuitive, and other times they&#8217;re counter-counterintuitive</li>
<li>Happiness perhaps isn&#8217;t as complicated as it seems: hanging with friends and walking by lakes do wonders</li>

<p class="note">I value practical books by how they change my actual behavior.</p>

<p>Here are the tangible behavior updates I&#8217;d consider updating routines around:</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div>

<ol>
<li>If you&#8217;re a high-strung parent, relax. It&#8217;s mostly genetics.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re about to raise a kid, find a place with lots of educated, two-parent households with high census response numbers.</li>
<li>Try to exposure your kids to lots of high-quality adults that they might want to model after</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for a mate, know that the biggest predictor of happiness with them is how happy and stable they are before they met you</li>
<li>Also know that there&#8217;s no magical combination of traits and attributes that will lead to a good or bad match</li>
<li>Your best bet is to do like Picasso and meet lots of paintings</li>
<li>Spending time with your romantic partner, or friends, in nature, is some of the best time you can spend</li>
<li>Maybe try to avoid lots of the activities that the data show don&#8217;t give much happiness</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re going to be doing something fun, maybe drink before and/or after rather than during (and obviously do so responsibly while watching for addiction)</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?linkCode=kpe&#038;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_EY16HQMNNFZTDX5JEFCB&#038;asin=B0983M7Z7H&#038;tag=kpembed-20&#038;amazonDeviceType=A2CLFWBIMVSE9N&#038;from=Bookcard&#038;preview=inline" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the whole book</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The book&#8217;s final summary on happiness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be with your wife, on an 80-degree sunny day, overlooking water, having sex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—</p>

<p>Alright, that&#8217;s it for this book capture, analysis, and summary. You can find my other summaries <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/projects/reading/">here</a>.</p>

</p>

<p>In this post I’m going to convince you why everyone needs a blog. Here’s the TL;DR:</p>

<p><strong>People used to be defined by where they work, and now they’re defined by their knowledge, capabilities, and opinions.</strong></p>

<p class="note">Only authors wrote down their opinions, and they were considered superhuman.</p>

<p>Everyone in the 1950s had a resume; it was unthinkable not to have one. Why is that? The reason is that the primary communication of value and worth was from the person to a company you wanted to work at. Your value was what you could provide to a company, not what you could provide to other humans outside your circle.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/corp-to-humans-1-650x405.png" alt="" width="650" height="405" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-137798" /></p>

<p>That’s different now. Humans are now more important than companies. And because of that, the resume is no longer the main artifact of your public worth. The replacement is the blog. Or, more specifically, having a domain name where you put all your stuff. A digital avatar of yourself.</p>

<p>The easiest way to see how much you need a blog is to do this thought exercise. Imagine going back in time to a 21-year-old in 1952 and asking them what their opinions are, and where you could find a book of those opinions. Here’s what they would say.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(looking behind them before turning back) Um, are you talking to me? I don’t … why … why would anyone care what I have to say?</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">

<div class="text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-lg">Get a weekly analysis of what's happening in security and tech—<em>and why it matters</em>.</div>
<div class="mt-2"><form action="https://danielmiessler.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292&amp;id=49fdb7d723" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="mc-embedded-subscribe-form validate inline" novalidate > 
            <div>
            <div class="mc-field-group">
            <input  placeholder="your best email" type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL">
            <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="button text-system">
            </div>
            <div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292_49fdb7d723" tabindex="-1" value=""></div>
            </div>
            </form></div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of you are thinking that right now, in 2022. Why would anyone want to know what you have to say?</p>

<p>That right there is why you need a blog. It’s not the 1950’s anymore. You are not your resume. You are a human with preferences, interests, and opinions. And many of those will resonate with others in ways you can’t imagine before you put them out there.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean live-streaming every peanut butter sandwich you eat. Not everything people do is interesting. But you are interesting. What made you. What you believe. And why. That’s worth capturing, and worth sharing. Even just for yourself.</p>

<p>I can’t even convey to you how challenging it is to create <a href="/about">an about page</a>. Try it. Try to capture what you’re about. Try to capture your beliefs, and why you believe them. Try to capture your interests. Write yourself down.</p>

<p>It’s unbelievably difficult, and tremendously rewarding. It forces you to ask yourself who you are, and it’s frightening when you don’t initially have good answers. But once you do, and once you can articulate yourself, there you are!</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=2></div>

<p>Now go put yourself out there. Be yourself. Not for a job. Not for an interview. Not for a company. But because you are a human on this planet. And because you matter, all by yourself.</p>

<p>That’s why everyone needs a blog.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://danielmiessler.com/images/dalle-2-nft-artwork-miessler.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/dalle-2-nft-artwork-miessler-650x263.png" alt="dalle-2-nft-artwork-miessler" width="650" height="263" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138006" /></a></p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve not heard, there are these things called NFTs. I think they&#8217;re simultaneously <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/nfts-are-digital-signaling/">the future of digital signaling</a> and currently mostly hype. But whatever&#8212;that&#8217;s not what this post is about.</p>

<p>Most NFTs rotate around a piece of collectible art in a baseball card-like format. So you look at something like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and it&#8217;s a bunch of personalized apes with stylization.</p>

<p>So the art is a big piece of it. You still need to hype it, get people to believe in its value, etc. But the art is the starting point, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/24-year-old-artist-made-over-300000-dollars-in-10-months-selling-nfts.html">many artists are finding new life</a> in creating these art collections.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E 2</a> for a few weeks now&#8212;which is an AI project from OpenAI that generates customized art based on prompts. I&#8217;ve been telling everyone who&#8217;ll listen about how this is the clearest example we&#8217;ve ever seen of AI cutting into a previously-human domain of creativity. It&#8217;s one thing to do spreadsheets faster, but DALL·E 2 can make you multiple examples of &#8220;A Synthwave Dog Riding a Rocket Skateboard&#8221; in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about how this will directly affect human jobs in the artistic space, but I was just jostled awake by an idea of telling DALL·E 2 to make NFT art. Like, <em>specifically</em> NFT art.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>

<p>So I started with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an nft of an 80&#8217;s giraffe wearing headphones, digital art</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which was decent:</p>

<div id="attachment_138012" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138012" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/nft-giraffe-dalle-miessler.png" alt="nft-giraffe-dalle-miessler" width="650" height="263" class="size-full wp-image-138012" /><p id="caption-attachment-138012" class="wp-caption-text">My first attempt at NFT art using &#8216;digital art&#8217; as a prompt</p></div>

<p class="note">The trick is prompt it with the text you would likely read in the caption describing it.</p>

<p>But within a couple of iterations I got to this:</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>an nft of a steampunk giraffe wearing headphones, digital art</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://danielmiessler.com/images/dalle-2-nft-artwork-miessler.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/dalle-2-nft-artwork-miessler-650x263.png" alt="dalle-2-nft-artwork-miessler" width="650" height="263" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138006" /></a></p>

<p>At a glance those look identical to high-quality NFT art. Importantly, they&#8217;ve captured the &#8220;NFT-ness&#8221; element to the artwork, which you would have trouble even trying to describe. I&#8217;m guessing it has something to do with the gradient background combined with a type of quasi-reality.</p>

<p>Anyway, the point is&#8212;that&#8217;s precisely what DALL·E 2 figures out and does effortlessly! It figures out <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/machine-learning-will-capture-the-je-ne-sais-quoi-of-human-existence/">the Je Ne Sais Quoi of NFT-ness</a>&#8212;whatever that is&#8212;and applies it to content prompt you give it. Let&#8217;s try robots with a similar prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an nft of a steampunk robot wearing a turtleneck and an eye patch, digital art</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">The &#8216;digital art&#8217; prompt at the end is key to the realistic look and feel.</p><div class="inline-auto-newsletter"><div class="inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b">

            <div>
            <div class="mc-field-group">
            <input  placeholder="your best email" type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL">

            <div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292_49fdb7d723" tabindex="-1" value=""></div>
            </div>
            </form></div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="attachment_138014" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138014" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/nft-dalle-robots-miessler.png" alt="nft-dalle-robots-miessler" width="650" height="264" class="size-full wp-image-138014" /><p id="caption-attachment-138014" class="wp-caption-text">NFT robots, Attempt 1</p></div>

<p>Here&#8217;s another pass at something similar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an nft of a steampunk robot with an eye patch, digital art</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="attachment_138016" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138016" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danielmiessler.com/images/nft-dalle-robots2-miessler.png" alt="nft-dalle-robots2-miessler" width="650" height="261" class="size-full wp-image-138016" /><p id="caption-attachment-138016" class="wp-caption-text">Attempt 2 for Robot NFTs</p></div>

<p>I&#8217;m not an expert in the space, but I have to think you could crank through a few iterations (I&#8217;ve spent like 6 minutes doing this so far) and come up with some truly stunning results.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>So I think the short version of this is that&#8212;yes&#8212;DALL·E 2 can already generate pretty convincing NFT art. And that feels weird.</p>

<p>You have this moment with NFTs where quirky artists suddenly have a spotlight shown on them. And out of nowhere DALL·E can suddenly&#8212;and casually&#8212;do a lot of what they can do.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div>

<p>Some think we&#8217;re in an AI winter still, but I feel it&#8217;s more like outer space where a piece of metal facing the sun will be super-heated, while the backside is deeply frozen.</p>

<p>GPT-3, DALL·E, and Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent">Gato</a> represent the sunlight where the theory collides with practicality. Exciting for sure&#8212;but in a scary way.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you find any prompts that create even better NFTs, <a NFT rel="noopener" target="_blank">let me know</a>.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol class="note">
<li>There&#8217;s one aspect of DALL·E where humans still have an advantage for things like NFT collections, and that&#8217;s in making a full set of related art. The problem with DALL·E is that if you iterate 20 times you&#8217;ll get widely different results, and it won&#8217;t be easy to sell the idea that they&#8217;re part of the same collection.</li>
