			<description><![CDATA[<p>That empty building from Part One? It’s a whole lot less empty now. Crew Members are working hard, designing the look of the store – spoiler alert, it looks like its neighborhood! – from wall murals to shelf signs, stocking shelves with your favorite TJ’s products (and some new stuff you haven’t seen yet), and establishing relationships with community organizations focused on ending hunger, so when we open, we’re ready to be a neighborhood store in every possible way.

We’ve made some adjustments to the way our Tasting Panel meets – who knew video conference tasting could be a thing? – but the basic function of the panel remains the same today as it’s ever been… making sure we’re bringing you delicious tastes from around the globe, and offering them at great values, every day. In this episode of Inside Trader Joe’s, we’re taking you inside the Tasting Panel, in today’s format. We’ll talk about how the changes have impacted product development, and we’ll hear about some new initiatives we’ve put in place to help us find vendors who might not have had access to our Tasting Panel process in days past.</p> <p><a href= "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/pdfs/transcript-pdfs/InsideTJs-Episode28-Transcript.pdf"> Transcript (PDF)</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
