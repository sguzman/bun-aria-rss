<p>A common problem for telcos and banks is how to leverage the vast pools of data they own. And for that reason, telcos are looking to embrace partnerships with banks and fintech to collectively leverage this pool and add value for their customers.<br />
With such partnerships, fintech brings rapid innovation and flexibility; and mobile operators provide scaled access to the market with their marketing and powerful distribution channels.</p>
<p>Join Fintech Summit Latam and explore how banks and mobile operators in Latin America are increasingly moving into financial services by becoming virtual banks, and mobile money providers and launching new fintech products including buy now, pay later (BNPL), microlending, mobile wallets, payments, super-apps and much more!</p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://northconcepts.com/blog/2022/01/24/datapipeline-7-1-released/">DataPipeline 7.1 Released</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://northconcepts.com/blog">Data Pipeline</a>.</p>
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DataPipeline 7.1 is now available.  It includes improvements in the areas of file I/O, data mapping, database integration, decisioning, debugging, and more.  You can <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/user-guide/#getting-started">get started with Maven or Gradle</a>, <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/">browse our Java examples</a>, and <a href="https://northconcepts.com/changelog/">review the changelog</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2338"></span></p>
<h2>Upgrade Log4J from v1.2.17 to v2.17.0</h2>
<p>DataPipeline has been using an older version of Log4J that was not affected by the recent set of issues.  However, since we were already moving from 1.x to 2.x, we&#8217;ll step over the issues you&#8217;ve been hearing about.  This release uses the 1.2 API bridge allowing for an upgrade without code changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>EventBus Listeners</h2>
<p>EventBus now uses strong references for listeners by default instead of SoftReferences.  No more disappearing listeners when the JVM runs out of memory.  See EventBus.setUseStrongListenerReference(boolean useStrongListenerReference) to toggle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Database Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a JdbcLookup.autoCloseConnection property to force database connection closing when the lookup is closed</li>
<li>The dynamic SQL code builder classes under <strong>northconcepts.datapipeline.jdbc.sql</strong> now include a Delete class as well as new getParameterValues() methods to retrieve candidate values for insert and update.</li>
<li>GenericUpsert, MergeUpsert, MySqlUpsert, PostgreSqlUpsert, and SybaseUpsert now support upserts with no non-key fields.</li>
<li>The overloaded JdbcConnectionFactory.wrap() to accept driverClassName, url, username, and password for direct connection creation.</li>
<li>JdbcMultiWriter, JdbcReader, JdbcUpsertWriter, JdbcWriter, and JdbcLookup now accept JdbcConnectionFactory to wrap DataSource and other connection creation options</li>
<li>Added JdbcWriter.setJdbcType(Class&lt;?&gt; type, int jdbcType) to allow overriding of the JDBC type sent to the database based on the Java class type</li>
<li>JdbcWriter now uses the type overrides for both null and non-null values</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>API Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added Record.getFieldValueAsBytes(String fieldPath, byte[] defaultValue):bye[]</li>
<li>Overrode the setter methods to return the superclass in the following classes: CSVReader, CSVWriter, ExcelReader, ExcelWriter, FixedWidthReader, FixedWidthWriter, JdbcReader, JdbcWriter, JsonReader, JsonWriter, XmlReader, XmlWriter</li>
<li>Added open() and close() methods to the Filter, Transformer, and Lookup classes as callbacks from the endpoints that use them</li>
<li>Added default constructor to MemoryReader and add(Record record) method</li>
<li>Excluded more method prefixes in DPEL (for example java.security, java.util.concurrent, java.util.prefs, and more)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>I/O Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>FileWriter now flushes on close if autoCloseWriter is false</li>
<li>ParsingReader now accepts a charsetName</li>
<li>Added support for XML 1.1 declarations to XmlSerializable interface: XmlSerializable.writeXml(T bean, StreamResult outputTarget, boolean closeStream, boolean addXml11Delcaration)</li>
<li>Added an <strong>autoCloseReader</strong> property to JsonRecordPipelineInput, XmlPipelineInput, and XmlRecordPipelineInput</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Debugging Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added DebugWriter to ease logging of outgoing records</li>
<li>Added a JdbcWriter.debug property to turn on logging of the generated SQL</li>
<li>The SQL builder classes under the <strong>northconcepts.datapipeline.jdbc.*</strong> packages now support a &#8220;debug&#8221; property</li>
<li>toString() now includes its key-value properties</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>DecisionTable and DecisionTree Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added an optional <strong>defaultOutcomes</strong> property to DecisionTable to explicitly define the results when no rules match/fire</li>
<li>Overloaded <strong>addField(String variable, String expression, boolean includeInOutcome)</strong> on DecisionTable and DecisionTree to easily include a calculated field in the results</li>
<li>DecisionTableCondition now allows null variable names</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pipeline and Dataset Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dataset has several new ways to read its cached data including an overloaded createDataReader() and getRecordList(long offset, int count) methods.</li>
<li>Added an optional <strong>maxColumnStatsRecords</strong> property to Dataset to indicate the number of records to use when calculating column-based stats</li>
<li>Since column stats calculation is done asynchronously, Dataset add a <strong>columnStatsReaderThreads</strong> property for the number of threads to use when processing column stats (default is 2)</li>
<li>Several overloaded waitForColumnStatsToLoad() methods are now in Dataset to block until asynchronous column stats processing completes</li>
<li>Dataset&#8217;s asynchronous data loading and column stats calculation can be terminated with the new cancelLoad() method</li>
<li>Column now includes new counts and date-time inferencing for the data loaded: getNonNullCount(), getNonNullNonBlankCount(), getInferredNumericValueCount(), getInferredTemporalValueCount(), getInferredBooleanValueCount(), getTemporalPatternCount(), getTemporalPatterns()</li>
<li>Added AbstractPipeline now includes a dateTimePatternDetector property to configure the date-time patterns tested during column processing</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Other DataPipeline Foundations Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>FieldMapping now has an optional <strong>type</strong> property for automatic conversion</li>
<li>FieldDef includes a new <strong>example</strong> property to aid in schema documentation</li>
<li>19-digit whole numbers are mapped to <strong>long</strong> instead <strong>BigDecimal</strong> in the JdbcTableColumn class and code generators</li>
<li>Maps on Bean subclasses are now sorted by key when serialized to JSON</li>
<li>DataMapping now implements the JavaCodeGenerator interface for use-cases that need to emit Java code</li>
<li>Added <strong>getTablesSorted()</strong> and <strong>getTablesSortedTopologically()</strong> to JdbcConnection to retrieve tables sorted by name or by dependencies</li>
<li>JdbcTable and JdbcTableColumn now have getNameAsJavaClassName() and getNameAsJavaIdentifier() methods to aide in code generation</li>
<li>Added com.northconcepts.datapipeline.foundations.time.<strong>DataTimePatternMatch</strong>, <strong>DateTimePattern</strong>, and <strong>DateTimePatternDetector</strong> for use in dataset date-time inferencing or on their own</li>
<li>Added GenerateTableDaoClasses and GenerateQueryDaoClasses to generate data access Java beans using the table metadata from a live database</li>
<li>Added GenerateSpringDataJpaClasses to generate Spring Data JPA entities and repositories using the table metadata from a live database</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>DataPipeline Integration Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added AvroPipelineInput, AvroPipelineOutput, ParquetPipelineInput, ParquetPipelineOutput to allow Avro and Parquet endpoints to more easily participate in pipelines</li>
<li>Added ParquetDataWriter.setSchema(String schema) to allow override of the schema used when reading Parquet files</li>
<li>AsymmetricEncryptingReader and AsymmetricDecryptingReader now explicitly rely on PublicKey and PrivateKey respectively for clarity instead of their Key superclass</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>AsyncWriter ensures that its threads are shutdown when exceptions are thrown during the nested endpoint&#8217;s open() and close() methods. This fix also ensures that the JobCallback.onFailure() method is called if an asynchronous failure occurs while JdbcMultiWriter.close() is executing.</li>
<li>XmlReader and XmlRecordReader will always use <strong>sun.xml.internal.stream.XMLInputFactoryImpl</strong> as the XML input factory regardless of the JDK. This release also introduces an optional <strong>com.northconcepts.datapipeline.xml.XMLInputFactory</strong> JVM param to override the Sun class if needed.</li>
<li>getTypedListenerCount() and getUntypedEventListenerCount() now account for nullified SoftReferences before they are removed by the event bus&#8217;s next cleanup. There was a small window in which the count would reflect the old numbers.</li>
<li>Binary deserialization now returns DATETIME field values as java.util.Date instead java.sql.Timestamp while reading in FileReader</li>
<li>CombinedLogReader now explicitly uses Locale.ENGLISH to prevent month name parsing issues outside of English locales</li>
<li>AbstractFieldMapping now clones more types to prevent side effects on the source data during mapping</li>
<li>ExcelPipelineInput now escapes the file path in the generated Java code to open Excel files</li>
<li>OrcDataReader and OrcDataWriter now treat Orc&#8217;s TIMESTAMP type as a local datetime instead of adjusting it for the current time zone</li>
<li>NPE when record doesn&#8217;t contain an optional field during mapping</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy 2022!</p>

<p>Welcome to the DataPipeline 7.0 release.  Since our last update, the DataPipeline team has been hard at work adding more declarative components, new integrations, new transformations, and generally making the framework easier to use. Our goal is to make simple use-cases easy and complex ones less difficult to implement.</p>
<p><span id="more-2286"></span></p>
<h2>Automatic Data Conversion And Validation</h2>
<p>With this goal in mind, we&#8217;ve added schema-based data conversions and validation.  The <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/foundations/datamapping/DataMapping.html">DataMapping</a> and <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/foundations/pipeline/AbstractPipeline.html">AbstractPipeline</a> classes now have optional <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/foundations/datamapping/DataMapping.html#getSourceEntity--">sourceEntity</a> and <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/foundations/datamapping/DataMapping.html#getTargetEntity--">targetEntity</a> properties to validate and convert incoming and outgoing data.  The <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/foundations/schema/EntityDef.html">EntityDef</a> class can now convert data using one or several <code>mapXXX()</code> methods and validate using the <code>validateXXX()</code> methods.   You can also use EntityDef in a job with the new <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/foundations/schema/SchemaTransformer.html">SchemaTransformer</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/foundations/schema">Schema docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/transform-records-using-schema">Schema transformer example</a></li>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/tag/schema/">Schema examples</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Declarative Pipelines</h2>
<p>This release ensures the components in DataPipeline Foundations can be saved and loaded from JSON and XML. This makes it easier to externalize parts of your app in a database or configuration file &#8212; including your own custom components.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NorthConcepts/DataPipeline-Examples/tree/master/src/main/java/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/foundations/examples/flatfile">Custom declarative parser</a></li>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/tag/declarative/">Declarative examples</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Data lineage</h2>
<p>The new data lineage feature optionally adds metadata to your records and fields indicating where they were loaded from. This can help with audits, data reconciliation, and general troubleshooting.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/data-lineage">Data lineage docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/tag/data-lineage/">Data lineage examples</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>LocalDateTime, LocalDate, and LocalTime Support</h2>
<p>In addition to the classic date types (<code>java.util.Date</code>, <code>java.sql.Data</code>, <code>java.sql.Time</code>, and <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code>), DataPipeline now supports <code>LocalDateTime</code>, <code>LocalDate</code>, and <code>LocalTime</code>. These new types are converted behind-the-scenes to and from the classical types. You&#8217;ll find overloaded support in the Field, Record, and transformation classes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/core/Field.html#getValueAsLocalDateTime--">Field.getValueAsLocalDateTime() Javadoc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/core/Field.html#setValue-java.time.LocalDateTime-">Field.setValue(java.time.LocalDateTime)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>BigDecimal and BigInteger Field Types</h2>
<p>Last release we gave BigDecimal and BigInteger their own dedicated field types. This release, we&#8217;ve overloaded methods and constructors throughout DataPipeline and added specific handling to make BigDecimal and BigInteger first class citizens.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/transform/SetField.html#SetField-java.lang.String-java.math.BigDecimal-">SetField transformer Javadoc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/transform/BasicFieldTransformer.html#nullToValue-java.math.BigDecimal-">BasicFieldTransformer Javadoc</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Expression Language Functions</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve improved error messages in the dynamic expression language and added several new functions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>recordContainsValue(), recordContainsNonNullValue(), recordContainsField(), recordContainsNonNullField(), getValue()</li>
<li>toBoolean(), capitalize(), uncapitalize(), swapCase(), substring(String string, int beginIndex)</li>
<li>toDate(), toTime(), and toDatetime() now accept Object instead of java.util.Date to convert from more types (LocalDate, LocalDateTime, LocalTime, ZonedDateTime, OffsetDateTime, Instant, and String)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/expression-language/">Expression language docs</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>JsonRecordWriter and XmlRecordWriter</h2>
<p>The JSON and XML packages now include writers that maintain each record&#8217;s natural structure as if you&#8217;d call toJson() to to Xml() on each one.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/json/JsonRecordWriter.html">JsonRecordWriter Javadoc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/xml/XmlRecordWriter.html">XmlRecordWriter Javadoc</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Encryption</h2>
<p>We now have several readers to handle encryption and decryption. We support both symmetric, secret key encryption as well as asymmetric, public-private key encryption. You can encrypt all fields in records or specify the fields to encrypt.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NorthConcepts/DataPipeline-Examples/tree/master/src/main/java/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/examples/security">Security examples</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Integration Changes</h2>
<p>DataPipeline adds the following integrations with this release.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/tag/parquet/">Apache Parquet</a>: ParquetDataReader, ParquetDataWriter</li>

<p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce the release of DataPipeline version 6.0. This release includes our new DataPipeline Foundations addon that brings decisioning, source-target data mapping, and other cool features to your software.</p>
<p><span id="more-2215"></span></p>
<h2>DataPipeline Foundations</h2>
<p>Last year we made the decision to release some of the tools we use to build apps as part of DataPipeline. The goal was to provide you with building<br />
blocks that are common to many data processing applications. DataPipeline Foundations is the culmination of that effort.</p>
<p>The new library includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data Mapping</li>
<li>Decision Tables</li>
<li>Decision Trees</li>
<li>Declarative Pipelines</li>
<li>Schema-based data Validation</li>
<li>JDBC Metadata API</li>
</ol>
<p>You can learn more about DataPipeline Foundations and get started with it here: <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/foundations/">https://northconcepts.com/docs/foundations/</a>.</p>
<h2>BigDecimal and BigInteger Field Types</h2>
<p>DataPipeline now fully supports large, arbitrary precision numbers natively across the framework. All readers, writers, and transformers have been<br />
updated to handle the new <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/core/FieldType.html#BIG_INTEGER">BIG_INTEGER</a> and <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/core/FieldType.html#BIG_DECIMAL">BIG_DECIMAL</a> field types. In cases where large numbers are not supported (like Excel), the new types are saved as strings and require explicit conversion from string when reading.</p>
<p>See an example of <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/read-bigdecimal-and-biginteger-from-an-excel-file/"> how to read big decimals and big integers in Excel</a> .</p>
<h2>Record Changes</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/index.html?com/northconcepts/datapipeline/core/Record.html">Record class</a> has been updated with several new conveniences.</p>
<ol>
<li>Retrieving a field&#8217;s value at any level of nesting is now easier. The getFieldValueAsXXX(fieldPathExpression, defaultValue) methods were added to return a field&#8217;s value in a single call if the field exists and is not null, otherwise, they return the default value. See <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/core/Record.html#getFieldValueAsInteger-java.lang.String-java.lang.Integer-"><br />
getFieldValueAsInteger</a> and <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/core/Record.html#getFieldValueAsBoolean-java.lang.String-java.lang.Boolean-">getFieldValueAsBoolean</a> for examples.</li>
<li>Checking if a field with a non-null value exists at any level of nesting can now be done in a single call using the new <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/core/Record.html#containsNonNullField-java.lang.String-"><br />
containsNonNullField(fieldPathExpression)</a> method.</li>
<li>All fields in a record can now be retrieved in a safe-to-modify ArrayList using the new <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/com/northconcepts/datapipeline/core/Record.html#getFields--">getFields()</a> method.</li>
<li>The default Java serialization for Record has been overridden to improve performance and reduce the size of data emitted. See <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/serialize-and-deserialize-records/">how to serialize and deserialize records</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve made some improvements to the <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/index.html?com/northconcepts/datapipeline/diagnostic/Diagnostic.html">Diagnostic class</a> to help troubleshoot your setup. Just call log method to see the data on your console or call toString() to capture the contents programmatically. See <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/log-diagnostic-information/">how to log diagnostic info</a>.</p>
<h2>Expression Language</h2>
<p>DataPipeline 6 adds improvements to the dynamic expression language (DPEL) around usability and safety.</p>
<ol>
<li>DPEL now allows you to control which methods can be called by supporting method blacklisting and whitelisting. It also blacklists potentially harmful packages and classes such as System and Runtime by default. You can always whitelist them to allow call if needed. See <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/blacklist-and-whitelist-functions-in-dp-expression-language/">how to blacklist and whitelist functions in the Datapipeline expression language</a>.</li>
<li>Error messages have been improved and standardized across the board. Messages have also been moved to a central class as a precursor to<br />
externalization and translation (I18N) via resource bundles in future.</li>
<li>One specific area of error message improvement is around method call in the expression language. Messages now clearly distinguish between the following causes, calling out the method name and expression:</li>
<li>
<ol type="a">
<li>No method found matching arguments.</li>
<li>No class name specified for a method call. (DPEL requires fully-qualified names or aliases to fully-qualified names.)</li>
<li>Method is blacklisted.</li>
<li>Exception invoking method in expression.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>DPEL now treats null as zero in cases where it&#8217;s appropriate to do so (like addition and subtraction: <code>1 + null == 1</code>). Otherwise, it returns null for expressions containing a null instead of throwing a NullPointerException (like divide and multiply: <code>null / 1 == null</code>).</li>
<li>A few new functions were added to the DPEL (like capitalize, uncapitalize, and swapCase).</li>
<li>The matchesRegex(String string, String regex, int flags) method was replaced with the easier to use matchesRegex(String string, String regex, boolean ignoreCase, boolean dotAll, boolean multiLine).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Older Changes &#8211; What&#8217;s New in DataPipeline 5.2</h2>
<p>DataPipeline 5.2 was soft-released to several customers on an as-needed basis, here are those changes as part of 6.0.</p>
<h2>Jackson Upgrade</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson, JSON library</a> dependency has been upgraded from version 1.x to version 2.x. DataPipeline 6 depends on the latest 2.x version of Jackson (2.11.3).</p>
<h2>JDBC</h2>
<p><a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/index.html?com/northconcepts/datapipeline/jdbc/JdbcWriter.html">JdbcWriter</a> now supports configurable insert strategies via the <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/index.html?com/northconcepts/datapipeline/jdbc/insert/IInsert.html"> IInsert interface</a>. You can see the insert strategies and examples on the <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/jdbc-relational-databases/">JDBC / Relational Databases</a> page along with the list of supported databases.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/index.html?com/northconcepts/datapipeline/jdbc/JdbcUpsertWriter.html"> JdbcUpsertWriter class</a> now includes specialized upsert strategies via the <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/index.html?com/northconcepts/datapipeline/jdbc/upsert/IUpsert.html">IUpsert interface</a> for Oracle, PostgreSQL and Sybase. The list of supported upsert strategies is also on the <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/jdbc-relational-databases/">JDBC / Relational Databases</a> page.</p>
<h2>GitHub Examples</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve moved all our examples onto GitHub. See <a href="https://github.com/NorthConcepts/DataPipeline-Examples">https://github.com/NorthConcepts/DataPipeline-Examples</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll likely stop shipping examples in the zip file in the near future and may do away with the zip distribution altogether. Please email us if this<br />
change will present a problem for you.</p>

<p><strong>Updated: June 2022</strong></p>
<p>With data being produced from many sources in a variety of formats it&#8217;s imperative for businesses to have a sane way to gain useful insight. Data integration is the process of transforming data from one or more sources into a form that can be loaded into a target system or used for analysis and business intelligence.</p>
<p><span id="more-2143"></span></p>
<h2><b>1. <a href="https://northconcepts.com/" target="_blank">Data Pipeline</a></b></h2>
<p><a href="https://northconcepts.com/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2301 size-full" src="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/data-pipeline.png" width="1339" height="591" srcset="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/data-pipeline.png 1339w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/data-pipeline-300x132.png 300w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/data-pipeline-768x339.png 768w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/data-pipeline-1024x452.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1339px) 100vw, 1339px" /></a></p>
<p>Data Pipeline is our own tool. It&#8217;s an ETL framework you plug into your software to load, processing, and migrate data on the JVM.</p>
<p>It uses a single API, modeled after the Java I/O classes, to handle data in a variety of formats and structures. It&#8217;s single-piece-flow approach to data allows it to handle huge amounts of data with a minimum overhead while still being able to scale using multi-threading. This approach also allows it to process both batch and streaming data through the same pipelines.</p>
<p>Data Pipeline comes in a range of versions including a free Express edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>2. <a href="https://github.com/j-easy/easy-batch" target="_blank">Easy Batch</a></b></h2>

<h2>Amazon S3 Streaming Uploads &amp; Downloads</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve introduced a new <code>AmazonS3FileSystem</code> class to help you interact with remote files stored on S3.  The class lets you read and write files with minimal memory overhead without first saving them to disk.  It also let&#8217;s you browse your buckets, folders, and files.</p>
<h3>Read a File from Amazon S3</h3>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">import java.io.InputStream;

public class ReadFromAmazonS3 {

    private static final String ACCESS_KEY = "YOUR ACCESS KEY";
    private static final String SECRET_KEY = "YOUR SECRET KEY";

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {
        AmazonS3FileSystem s3 = new AmazonS3FileSystem();
        s3.setBasicAWSCredentials(ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY);
        s3.open();
        try {
            InputStream inputStream = s3.readFile("datapipeline-bucket", "output/trades.csv");

            DataReader reader = new CSVReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
//            DataWriter writer = StreamWriter.newSystemOutWriter();

        } finally {
            s3.close();
        }
    }

}</pre><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Write a File to Amazon S3</h3>

<h2>JSON Record Reader</h2>
<p>Our existing <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/read-a-json-stream/">JSON reader</a> requires that you identify the fields ahead of time to add to your records.    But what if you want all the fields or don&#8217;t know what the fields are ahead of time?  The new <code>JsonRecordReader</code> is here to help.   You no longer need to specify any fields, just one or more record breaks and Data Pipeline will collect everything it finds into hierarchical records.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">import java.io.File;

import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.core.DataReader;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.core.DataWriter;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.core.StreamWriter;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.job.Job;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.json.JsonRecordReader;

public class ReadJsonRecordsFromFile {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataReader reader = new JsonRecordReader(new File("example/data/output/simple-json-to-file.json"))
                .addRecordBreak("/array/object");
        
        DataWriter writer = StreamWriter.newSystemOutWriter();
        
        Job.run(reader, writer);
    }
}</pre><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>XML Record Reader</h2>
<p>Like the new JSON record reader, XML also has a similar addition.  If you need to collect all subbranches of an XML tree into records without specifying each field, the new <code>XmlRecordReader</code> is exactly what you need.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">import java.io.File;

import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.core.DataReader;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.core.DataWriter;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.core.StreamWriter;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.job.Job;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.xml.XmlRecordReader;

public class ReadXmlRecordsFromFile {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataReader reader = new XmlRecordReader(new File("example/data/output/simple-xml-to-file.xml"))
                .addRecordBreak("/records/record");
        
        DataWriter writer = StreamWriter.newSystemOutWriter();
        
        Job.run(reader, writer);
    }
}</pre><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Buffered Reader</h2>
<p>When dealing with real-time data, you sometimes need to collect out-of-order records together.  In a shipping system, you may need to process packages arriving on the same truck together, even if packages from multiple trucks are mixed together.  The new <code>BufferedReader</code> class uses a configurable strategy to determine when to release incoming records in each of its buffers downstream.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.buffer.BufferedReader;

    private static final int MAX_TRUCKS = 10;
    private static final long MAX_PACKAGES = 200;
    private static final int RECORD_DELAY_MILLISECONDS = 250;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        DataReader reader = new FakePackageReader(MAX_TRUCKS, MAX_PACKAGES, RECORD_DELAY_MILLISECONDS);
        
        // group records by "truck_id" and release all records for each "truck_id" downstream every 10 seconds or 
        // when 10 records for that "truck_id" have been collected
        // and limit the internal buffer size to 100 records
        
        reader = new BufferedReader(reader, 100, "truck_id")
                .setBufferStrategy(BufferStrategy.limitedTimeFromOpenOrLimitedRecords(TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(10), 10))
                ;
        
        DataWriter writer = StreamWriter.newSystemOutWriter();
        
        Job job = Job.run(reader, writer);
        
        System.out.println(job.getRecordsTransferred() + "  -  " + job.getRunningTimeAsString());
    }

    
    //==================================================

            return record;
        }
        
    }

}</pre><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Group By Reader</h2>
<p>If you need to summarize streaming data, <code>GroupByReader</code> can now produce output at a different rate than incoming data.  The <code>CreateWindowStrategy</code> and <code>CloseWindowStrategy</code> classes can now be used together to produce sliding windows that release summarized data even when no new records are available.  They can also be used to create complex windows based on a combination of factors including time and record counts.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

<h2>Bigrams, Trigrams, Ngrams</h2>
<p>Data Pipeline has a new transformer for extracting every n-sequence of words in a body of text.  The new <code>Ngrams</code> class allows you to extract bigrams, trigrams, and other ngrams from any field in a data stream.   The following example finds the top 25 three-word sequences found in the headlines of several Canadian news websites.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">import java.io.BufferedReader;

<h2>Multiple Field Support</h2>
<p>The <code>BasicFieldTransformer</code>, <code>FieldTransformer</code>, and <code>FieldFilter</code> classes can now accept more than one field name.  You no longer have to duplicate lines of code to perform the same operations or filters on multiple fields, just pass them all into the constructors.</p>
<h2>And More</h2>
<p>Version 4.4 also includes improvements in the areas of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-threading</li>
<li>Debugging &amp; diagnostic</li>
<li>The expression language</li>
<li>Job management and cancellation</li>
<li>BigInteger and BigDecimal support</li>
<li>Twitter data readers</li>
<li>XPath expression handling</li>
</ul>

<p>We recently received an email from a Java developer asking how to convert records in a table (like you get in a relational database, CSV, or Excel file) to a composite tree structure.  Normally, we&#8217;d point to one of Data Pipeline&#8217;s <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/tag/xml/">XML</a> or <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/tag/json/">JSON</a> data writers, but for good reasons those options didn&#8217;t apply here.  The developer emailing us needed the hierarchical structures in object form for use in his API calls.</p>
<p>Since we didn&#8217;t have a general purpose, table-tree mapper, we built one.  We looked at several options, but ultimately decided to add a new operator to the <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/examples/find-the-minimum-maximum-average-sum-count/">GroupByReader</a>.  This not only answered the immediate mapping question, but also allowed him to use the new operator with <a href="https://northconcepts.com/docs/user-guide/#sliding-window-aggregation">sliding window aggregation</a> if the need ever arose.</p>
<p>The rest of this blog will walk you through the implementation in case you ever need to add your own custom aggregate operator to Data Pipeline.</p>
<p><span id="more-1873"></span></p>
<p>First let&#8217;s look at what this operator does.</p>
<h2>Input CSV File</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have the following CSV file.  It&#8217;s pretty straightforward: it has a transaction date, the account it applies to, the type of transaction, and the amount applied.</p>
<p><a href="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-input.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1874" src="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-input-300x262.png" alt="Input CSV File" width="300" height="262" srcset="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-input-300x262.png 300w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-input.png 525w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h2>Output Composite Structure</h2>
<p>The goal is to take the input file and create a separate record for each account (123, 456, 789, and 147).  Each of the new account records will contain nested records for the different transaction types, dates, and amounts related to that account.  If the first record were converted to JSON, it would look structurally like the following.</p>
<p><a href="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-output-json.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1876" src="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-output-json-152x300.png" alt="Output JSON Tree Structure" width="152" height="300" srcset="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-output-json-152x300.png 152w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-output-json.png 359w" sizes="(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px" /></a></p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re not creating JSON, the actual Data Pipeline records will look very similar to JSON, but will contain rich types like BigDecimal and Date that JSON hasn’t traditionally supported.  Here&#8217;s the output of Recors.toString().</p>
<p><a href="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-output.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1875" src="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-output-169x300.png" alt="Data Pipeline Output Record Structure" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-output-169x300.png 169w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-output.png 455w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a></p>
<h2>The Data Pipeline Job</h2>
<p>The work to read the CSV file, filter, transform, and aggregate it is seven steps.</p>
<p>1. Read the CSV file.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">DataReader reader = new CSVReader(new File("financial-transactions.csv"))
	.setFieldNamesInFirstRow(true)
	.setSkipEmptyRows(true);</pre><p>2. Filter credit and debit transactions.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">reader = new FilteringReader(reader)
	.add(new FieldFilter("Transaction Type").valueMatches("Credit", "Debit"));</pre><p>3. Select and arrange the output fields.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">reader = new TransformingReader(reader)
	.add(new SelectFields("Account", "Transaction Type", "Date", "Amount"))</pre><p>4. Convert the fields from strings to their actual types</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">.add(new BasicFieldTransformer("Date").stringToDate("yyyy-MM-dd"))
	.add(new BasicFieldTransformer("Amount").stringToBigDecimal())</pre><p>5. Sort the data to ensure child branches are grouped together.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">reader = new SortingReader(reader).asc("Account").asc("Transaction Type").asc("Date").asc("Amount");</pre><p>6. Use the new GroupTree aggregate operator – that we&#8217;ll implement below – to build the new records grouped-by account as the root of each branch.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">reader = new GroupByReader(reader, "Account").add(new GroupTree("data"));</pre><p>7. Write to the desired target.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">DataWriter writer = StreamWriter.newSystemOutWriter();
Job.run(reader, writer);</pre><p>This example writes to the console (System.out), but the developer can implement his custom API calls as a new <a href="https://northconcepts.com/javadocs/index.html?com/northconcepts/datapipeline/core/DataWriter.html">DataWriter</a> subclass.</p>
<h2>Data Pipeline Aggregation API</h2>
<p>Before we get into the GroupTree implementation, you need to understand the classes involved in aggregation and sliding windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-api.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1877" src="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-api-300x222.png" alt="Data Pipeline Aggregation API" width="300" height="222" srcset="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-api-300x222.png 300w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/how-to-convert-tabular-data-to-trees-using-aggregation-api.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>GroupByReader</h3>
<p>GroupByReader is the controlling class and is what we used in the example above.  GroupByReader holds a list of open windows and closed windows (while they still have data to emit).  It also holds the GroupOperations that will be applied in each window along with the window strategies.</p>
<h3>Window Strategies</h3>
<p>The CreateWindowStrategy classes is responsible for determining when new windows should be opened, while CloseWindowStrategy determines when open windows should be closed.  There are several built-in implementations based on time and data.  You can implement your own strategies or combine strategies together using Boolean logic.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Windows receive incoming data while they&#8217;re open and emit their results after they&#8217;re closed.  Open windows take the input records and apply GroupOperations (sum, count, etc.) to them via a GroupField instance.  Once a window is closed, the values in its GroupFields are collected into records and returned by GroupByReader.</p>
<h3>Operators</h3>
<p>You can think of GroupOperation as a factory that creates GroupOperationFields.  Whenever an open window determines that a new aggregate field needs to be created for a record in the output group, it calls GroupOperation.createField().  The window then calls GroupOperationField.apply(Record, Field) for each input record it sees.  Most of the operator&#8217;s logic is actually done inside each implementation of the field&#8217;s apply() method.</p>
<h2>GroupTree Implementation</h2>
<p>First the code.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">package com.northconcepts.datapipeline.group;

import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.core.ArrayValue;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.core.Field;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.core.Record;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.group.GroupOperation;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.group.GroupOperationField;
import com.northconcepts.datapipeline.internal.lang.Util;


public class GroupTree extends GroupOperation&lt;ArrayValue&gt; {
    
    public GroupTree(String targetFieldName) {
        super(null, targetFieldName, false);
    }

    @Override
    protected GroupOperationField&lt;ArrayValue&gt; createField() {
        return new GroupOperationField&lt;ArrayValue&gt;(this) {
            
            private Record rootRecord = new Record();

            @Override
            protected void apply(Record record, Field field) {
                Record parentDataRecord = rootRecord;
                
                FIELD_LOOP:
                for (int i = 1; i &lt; record.getFieldCount(); i++) {
                    Field sourceField = record.getField(i);

                    ArrayValue dataArray = parentDataRecord.getField(getTargetFieldName(), true).getValueAsArray(true);
                    if (dataArray.size() &gt; 0) {
                        Record lastDataRecord = dataArray.getValueAsRecord(dataArray.size() - 1);
                        Field lastDataRecordField = lastDataRecord.getField(sourceField.getName(), true);
                        boolean sameTreeBranch = Util.equals(lastDataRecordField.getValue(), sourceField.getValue());
                        if (sameTreeBranch) {
                            parentDataRecord = lastDataRecord;
                            continue FIELD_LOOP; 
                        }
                    }
                    
                    Record lastDataRecord = new Record();
                    lastDataRecord.setField(sourceField.getName(), sourceField.getValue());
                    dataArray.addValue(lastDataRecord);
                    parentDataRecord = lastDataRecord;
                }
            }
            
            @Override
            protected ArrayValue getValue() {
                return rootRecord.getField(0).getValueAsArray();
            }
        };
    }
}</pre><p></p>
<h3>GroupTree</h3>
<p>The new operator starts by extending the GroupOperation class and overriding its createField() factory method.  In our example, createField() will be called once for every new account and the resulting field&#8217;s apply() will be called once for every record related to that account.  The apply() method will be responsible for adding each tabular record to the appropriate place in the nested tree record that it will eventually return.  As an example, the simplest apply() method we have is in the GroupCount class and it just increments a counter.</p>
<h3>Get Value</h3>
<p>The created field&#8217;s getValue() method is called by closed windows whenever they are asked by GroupByReader for records.  In this case, it will return the first field in the root record as an array.</p>
<h3>Next Release</h3>
<p>The GroupTree operator will be available in the next release.  If you can&#8217;t wait, just use the code from this blog and get started.</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>

<p><strong>Updated: July 2021</strong></p>
<p>ETL is a process for performing data extraction, transformation and loading. The process extracts data from a variety of sources and formats, transforms it into a standard structure, and loads it into a database, file, web service, or other system for analysis, visualization, machine learning, etc.</p>
<p>ETL tools come in a wide variety of shapes.  Some run on your desktop or on-premise servers, while others run as SaaS in the cloud.  Some are code-based, built on standard programming languages that many developers already know.  Others are built on a custom DSL (domain specific language) in an attempt to be more intentional and require less code.  Others still are completely graphical, only offering programming interfaces for complex transformations.</p>
<p>What follows is a list of ETL tools for developers already familiar with Java and the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to clean, validate, filter, and prepare your data for use.</p>
<p><span id="more-1564"></span></p>
<h2><b>1. Data Pipeline</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://northconcepts.com/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2222 size-full" src="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/datapipeline.png" width="1581" height="617" srcset="https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/datapipeline.png 1581w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/datapipeline-300x117.png 300w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/datapipeline-768x300.png 768w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/datapipeline-1024x400.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1581px) 100vw, 1581px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://northconcepts.com/" target="_blank">Data Pipeline</a> is our own tool. It&#8217;s an ETL framework you plug into your software to load, processing, and migrate data on the JVM.</p>
<p>It uses a single API, modeled after the Java I/O classes, to handle data in a variety of formats and structures. It&#8217;s single-piece-flow approach to data allows it to handle huge amounts of data with a minimum overhead while still being able to scale using multi-threading. This approach also allows it to process both batch and streaming data through the same pipelines.</p>
<p>Data Pipeline comes in a range of versions including a free Express edition.</p>
