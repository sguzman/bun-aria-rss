      <title>Jarrod Green Part 1: Retribution </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On September 30, 1994, 20-year-old Jarrod Green disappeared from Searcy, Arkansas. Jarrod had indicated to his family that he had plans to meet with someone that night. During a phone call with his girlfriend, Jarrod was clearly upset but wouldn't tell her what was wrong. Jarrod had previously given a gun to a friend and retrieved the gun, saying he needed it for protection. Jarrod never made it home that evening and was never seen or heard from again. Days later, Jarrod's car was found abandoned in the parking lot of a local store. The car doors were left unlocked, windows rolled down, and the keys were on the floor. Jarrod's case went cold, his family didn't hear from law enforcement, and it felt like he was forgotten.</p><p>Meanwhile, dark stories continued to grow and spread through the community like a cancer. Not even a year later, someone else in Jarrod's circle disappeared. Another one took his own life and reportedly confessed to playing a role in Jarrod's murder beforehand. Years later, some rookie detectives decided to take a fresh look at this cold case, and there was finally some movement.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information regarding Jarrod Green's disappearance, please call the Searcy Police Department at (501) 268-3531.</p><p>You can follow developments in Jarrod's case on Facebook at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/740692570283456" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Justice for Jarrod</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://thrivecausemetics.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thrive Causemetics</a>- Get 15% off your first order when you visit&nbsp;<a href="http://thrivecausemetics.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thrivecausemetics.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">case submission form</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Case Update: Megan Foglesong</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>21-year-old Megan Foglesong disappeared from Alden, Kansas, around the end of November 2015. When we first covered Megan’s story in 2016, nearly everyone pointed to Megan’s on-again, off-again boyfriend, David Madden. Megan attempted to leave him in the past and told others around Thanksgiving of 2015 that she was leaving him again. Several days later, Megan sent a message to a friend indicating that she was back at David’s, then she went silent. Around this time, David texted the local undersheriff to inform him that Megan had stolen from him and ran off. In hindsight, that story about Megan stealing seems rather convenient, possibly a way to explain her absence. But at that time, no one thought much of it. They figured Megan would pop up somewhere soon. Maybe she left David and was hiding? Time passed, and Megan’s loved ones became more concerned. David didn’t seem interested in finding Megan. Despite rumors and suspicions swirling around town about David’s involvement, Megan’s case went cold. As the years went by, David went on to commit a series of other crimes that left the community convinced that he was responsible for Megan’s disappearance. </p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Megan Foglesong, please contact KBI at 316-337-6100 or the Rice County Sheriff’s Office at (620) 257-7876.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In early June of 2021, 47-year-old Jamie Valdez and his wife, Anna, had just moved to Booneville, Arkansas, from Texas. Their relationship was on the rocks, and Jamie’s wife said that Jamie left their home on June 9, 2021. An old coworker claims that she saw Jamie 30 miles north of Booneville in Ozark several days later, and the coworker invited him over for dinner with her family. She said he planned to go home and patch things up with his wife. Jamie Valdez has never been seen again. His disappearance is filled with many gaps in time, strange coincidences, conflicting stories, and lapses in memory that have turned the search for him into a bizarre obstacle course with very few concrete facts.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Jamie Valdez, please call the Booneville, Arkansas Police Department at (479) 675-3508.</p><p>If you would like to follow Jamie’s story and updates on social media, you can join the group dedicated to finding him at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/881075416154170/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JAMES “JAMIE” VALDEZ MISSING</a>.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://sleepnumber.com/VANISH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sleep Number</a>- Proven quality sleep is life-changing sleep.

A few days before airing our story on Lillianna, we received word that she had been found alive and was reunited with her father, Tyler, a completely unexpected surprise. While this was the ending we hope for in every story, Tyler and Lillianna still had a rough road ahead of them. Lillianna had been missing for nearly six years and was told her father was dead. We recently checked in with Tyler to see how Lillianna is doing with her dad today and what they’ve been through together since they were reunited in June of 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">case submission form</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>16-year-old Toby Anderson had found himself in some trouble during his teen years. Toby’s life wasn’t easy, and he began to act out.

Since Toby had been in trouble, running away didn’t seem far-fetched. Toby’s father searched for him and contacted relatives in other states to see if he had turned up there, but he never did.

        <![CDATA[<p>On March 26, 2020, 45-year-old Eugene Prins planned a short road trip with a friend to drop off a wood splitter. They started out in Woonsocket, South Dakota, and drove about 25 miles east to the tiny town of Fedora. After that, Eugene and his friend were spotted at a bar in Forestburg, which was along their route home. The last confirmed sighting of Eugene was at the bar. The truck they were in was seen on camera driving away from the bar at 7:38 PM. Other bar patrons said that you could tell they had been drinking, but Eugene didn’t appear to be visibly intoxicated, and he had mentioned that he wanted to go home, he had work in the morning. But according to Eugene’s friend, he made a detour to stop at a mutual friend’s farm. He went inside while Eugene stayed in the car. When the friend came out about 20 minutes later, Eugene was gone.

        <![CDATA[<p>On July 11, 1969, 15-year-old Cynthia Constantine took her dog for a walk as she did every afternoon in the family’s hometown of Oakdale, New York. Cynthia loved walking along the railroad tracks alongside a busy highway and often explored the area with her brother. On this day, Cynthia walked with her dog alone, picking up cattails along the way. Cynthia had planned to go check out a muskrat burrow she spotted earlier in the day while with her brother. But Cynthia never returned home, and when the family dog came home without her, the family immediately knew something was wrong.

      <title>George James</title>
      <description>

      <title>Jimmy Don Robinson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On October 1, 1976, Jimmy Don Robinson disappeared from Elmore City, Oklahoma, just a week after his 21st birthday. Jimmy was no longer living at the Robinson family home but stopped by around midnight. His mom had just gotten home after working a late shift and was cooking some dinner for herself. Jimmy briefly spoke to his family, and they noticed there was a man in the passenger seat of the car that Jimmy was driving. They didn't recognize the man, and Jimmy didn't mention who he was. He said he would drop the man off and be back in about 30 minutes. However, Jimmy never returned, and nearly 46 years later, Jimmy's family is still searching for answers.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Jimmy Don Robinson, please contact the Garvin County Sheriff's Office at (405) 238-7591 or Garvin County Crimestoppers at 1-855-211-STOP.</p><p>You can follow Jimmy's case on Facebook at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/WhereIsJimmyDonRobinson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Where is Jimmy Don Robinson?</a>, on <a href="https://twitter.com/whereisjimmydon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whereisjimmydonrobinson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">instagram</a>.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://goodrx.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GoodRX</a>- For simple, smart savings on your prescriptions, check out&nbsp;<a href="http://goodrx.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GoodRX.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">case submission form</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>On October 1, 1976, Jimmy Don Robinson disappeared from Elmore City, Oklahoma, just a week after his 21st birthday. Jimmy was no longer living at the Robinson family home but stopped by around midnight. His mom had just gotten home after working a late shift and was cooking some dinner for herself. Jimmy briefly spoke to his family, and they noticed there was a man in the passenger seat of the car that Jimmy was driving. They didn't recognize the man, and Jimmy didn't mention who he was. He said he would drop the man off and be back in about 30 minutes. However, Jimmy never returned, and nearly 46 years later, Jimmy's family is still searching for answers.

      <title>Isaac Seidel Part 1: A Simple Life</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>36-year-old Isaac Seidel disappeared from Blain, Pennsylvania, on September 12, 2021. By the time Isaac's loved ones realized that anything was wrong, Isaac had already missed a few days of work. When they went to his home, where Isaac lived alone, an eerie scene was left behind. Isaac's bicycle, backpack, and phone were missing, but everything else seemed to be there except Isaac. He had left chicken thawing in the sink. It appeared that he had decided to go for a bike ride and planned to be back later to cook chicken for dinner. Isaac's family thought that perhaps Isaac had been in a tragic accident, so they began scouring the roadways near Isaac's house, looking in ditches and ravines.

      <itunes:summary>36-year-old Isaac Seidel disappeared from Blain, Pennsylvania, on September 12, 2021. By the time Isaac's loved ones realized that anything was wrong, Isaac had already missed a few days of work. When they went to his home, where Isaac lived alone, an eerie scene was left behind. Isaac's bicycle, backpack, and phone were missing, but everything else seemed to be there except Isaac. He had left chicken thawing in the sink. It appeared that he had decided to go for a bike ride and planned to be back later to cook chicken for dinner. Isaac's family thought that perhaps Isaac had been in a tragic accident, so they began scouring the roadways near Isaac's house, looking in ditches and ravines. But there was no trace of Isaac anywhere. Nearly nine months later, they are still searching for answers.

If you have any information about the disappearance of Isaac Seidel, please contact the Pennsylvania State Police at (717) 567-3110. Missing along with Isaac is his dark green Cannondale bicycle.

      <title>William Jamison Part 2: The Cost of Doing Business</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In the early morning hours of March 27, 1981, Bill Jamison disappeared after a night out at a bar and stopping for a quick bite to eat at a diner. When Bill left the restaurant, it was a clear night in the mid to low the 40s. But something happened to Bill after he left the diner. The waitress who served Bill didn’t notice anything was wrong. Bill ordered the same thing he always got during his late-night stops. Bill finished his meal, walked out into the night, and disappeared forever. Yesterday, you learned about Bill’s disappearance and the efforts to find him early on. His family didn’t feel like they were getting enough help from law enforcement, so they started their own search, sometimes using unconventional methods like psychics. They met with law enforcement, begging them to do more. Over the years, family members sent letters to just about anyone they thought might listen or have resources that could aid their search efforts. Forty-one years later, Bill’s disappearance remains just as much of a mystery as in 1981. Today, we will look at some things happening at Bill’s work during the lead-up to his disappearance because a lot was going on. His family has always wondered if that could have something to do with what happened to Bill.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of William Jamison, please contact the Roselle Park Police Department at (908) 245-2300 or the New Jersey State Police Missing Persons Unit at (609) 882-2000.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>William Jamison Part 1: The Drive Home</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>March 26, 1981, was just an ordinary day for 33-year-old William Jamison. He went to work at Haug Die Casting Company in Kenilworth, NJ, where he was the vice president of production. After work, Bill went to a restaurant for dinner. Bill’s next stop was the Chez Lounge inside Linden Lanes Bowling Alley in Linden, NJ. After spending several hours enjoying drinks and good conversation with friends and acquaintances, Bill left and stopped at the St. George Diner in Linden for a quick late-night meal. He arrived around 1 AM and left about 30 minutes later. That’s the last time that anyone ever saw Bill Jamison. It was like he had vanished into the night. Bill’s coworkers were immediately concerned when he didn’t show up at 8 AM as he usually did. One coworker went over to Bill’s apartment, but Bill wasn’t there. They decided it was time to contact Bill’s sister, Katie. Katie jumped into action. She contacted law enforcement and began calling all the hospitals in the area. More than 41 years later, Bill’s family is still looking for answers. This is a mysterious story that goes in many unexpected directions, from sightings of Bill several states away to the theory that this was a mob hit.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of William Jamison, please contact the Roselle Park Police Department at (908) 245-2300 or the New Jersey State Police Missing Persons Unit at (609) 882-2000.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://theouai.com " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OUAI</a>- Go to <a href="http://theouai.com " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">theouai.com </a>and use code VANISHED to get 15% off your entire order.</p><p><a href="http://shopify.com/vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://shopify.com/vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify.com/<strong>vanished</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>ALL LOWERCASE, for a FREE fourteen-day trial and get full access to Shopify’s entire suite of&nbsp;features.</p><p>IMPACT by Interactive Brokers- Download the app today and use code VANISHED to get $30 of stock credit.</p><p>Note: The podcast ad for the IMPACT app is unscripted and being recorded live.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>17-year-old Andrea Cotten disappeared from Corsicana, Texas, in late January of 2004. In 2021, a local resident reached out to us about Andrea- the only missing person in Corsicana. So we started doing research and looking for people who knew her, and would talk to us. We learned that Andrea’s story was far bigger, more scandalous, and stranger than we could have imagined, all with Andrea, not yet an adult but not seemingly considered a child, at its center. There were stories that Andrea was last seen leaving in a truck with two men and other stories pointing to her own family.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about Andrea’s disappearance, please call the Texas Department of Public Safety Highway Patrol division in Corsicana at ​​(903) 872-5633.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>19-year-old Judith Brown disappeared from New York City in April of 1977. Judith lived on her own, so her family wasn’t immediately aware that she was missing. Judith’s family learned she was missing when the FBI came knocking at their door. They were shocked to learn that Judith had disappeared along with someone else, a murderer who had escaped from a local mental health facility. More than 45 years later, both of them remain missing. For many years, Judith’s family kept quiet about this. It was too upsetting to reopen those wounds. As the years wore on, a younger generation of Judith’s family took an interest in finding answers.

      <title>Case Update: Antonio Jordan Neill</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We first brought you Antonio’s story in June of 2018. At that time, Antonio was still missing. His case had gone from a missing person case, to an active homicide investigation, and back to a missing case again. Antonio’s mom was left in limbo, not knowing what had happened to her son. All she had were the strange stories coming from people who had been in the house with Antonio when he disappeared. Was it true that Antonio had stabbed Andrew in the neck, completely unprovoked, then ran out of the house, disappearing forever? Jenny never believed that this version of events was true, but there was no evidence to prove what had happened. Then, six months after our original episode aired, and more than two years after Antonio had vanished, people walking along the shore of Jetty Island made a gruesome discovery.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance and death of Antonio Neill, please contact the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office at 425-388-3393. Crime Stoppers is currently offering a $1000 reward for information on Antonio’s case.

      <itunes:title>Case Update: Antonio Jordan Neill</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>340</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>We first brought you Antonio’s story in June of 2018. At that time, Antonio was still missing. His case had gone from a missing person case, to an active homicide investigation, and back to a missing case again. Antonio’s mom was left in limbo, not knowing what had happened to her son. All she had were the strange stories coming from people who had been in the house with Antonio when he disappeared. Was it true that Antonio had stabbed Andrew in the neck, completely unprovoked, then ran out of the house, disappearing forever? Jenny never believed that this version of events was true, but there was no evidence to prove what had happened. Then, six months after our original episode aired, and more than two years after Antonio had vanished, people walking along the shore of Jetty Island made a gruesome discovery.

If you have any information regarding the disappearance and death of Antonio Neill, please contact the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office at 425-388-3393. Crime Stoppers is currently offering a $1000 reward for information on Antonio’s case. To submit a tip anonymously through Crime Stoppers, go to www.P3Tips.com or call 1-800-222-Tips.

      <title>Andrew Chapman</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In early December of 2006, 32-year-old Andrew Chapman disappeared from the Hilltop area of Columbus, Ohio. At the time, Andrew lived with a couple of roommates on Whitethorne Avenue. Andrew called his mom and told her that he needed her to come by his place because he had something to give her. He seemed to be in a bit of a panic. Andrew's mom, Judy, was very ill at the time and couldn't make the trip to see Andrew that day. In the days that followed, Judy was on the mend and stopped by Andrew's apartment to see what he needed. Judy was shocked to find that Andrew's apartment had been completely cleaned out. Andrew and his roommates were gone. Phone calls to Andrew went unanswered, and no one had any clue where he could be. Andrew's case quickly went cold, and maybe he wanted some time away from family? As the years went by, more perplexing clues began to surface as Andy's sister started digging into the case herself. Today, many questions remain unanswered, but Andrew's family is determined to find out what happened to him.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Andrew Chapman, please contact the Columbus Police Department at 614-645-4545.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://nutrafol.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nutrafol</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://nutrafol.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nutrafol.com</a>&nbsp;and use promo code VANISHED to get $15 off your first order and free shipping.</p><p><a href="http://ritual.com/vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ritual</a>- Visit&nbsp;<a href="http://ritual.com/Vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ritual.com/Vanished</a>&nbsp;for 10% off your first 3 months.</p><p><a href="https://www.nuuly.com/rent/landingpage3?utm_source=Vanished&amp;utm_medium=Podcast&amp;utm_campaign=Spring&amp;utm_term=Wondery&amp;utm_content=" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nuuly</a>- Get $20 off your first month of Nuuly when you sign up at <a href="https://www.nuuly.com/rent/landingpage3?utm_source=Vanished&amp;utm_medium=Podcast&amp;utm_campaign=Spring&amp;utm_term=Wondery&amp;utm_content=" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nuuly.com</a> and enter code VANISHED20.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our <a href="http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">case submission form</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Shane Sprenger</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Shane Sprenger disappeared from Vida, Oregon, on November 2, 2021. Shane was a contractor, and on that day, he was working at a job site near&nbsp;McKenzie Bridge, Oregon. Around 9:30 am, Shane left the job and returned to his home in Vida. No one ever saw Shane again. In the days following his disappearance, Shane's truck was found abandoned on a logging road near the Blue River Reservoir, about 16 miles away from his home. The area where they found the vehicle was one of Shane's favorite mushroom picking spots. It was suggested by some people close to Shane that maybe he had gone mushroom picking and got lost. However, it was later discovered that Shane planned to return to the job site to meet with a subcontractor. It did not make sense that Shane would have stopped to pick mushrooms because all clues indicated that he was planning to return to work after a quick break. Shane's family in Minnesota had no idea that anything was wrong until they got a phone several days after Shane vanished. They made the trip to Oregon to search for him. They began to hear strange stories about the day Shane disappeared, tales that simply weren't adding up.</p><p>If you have any information about Shane Sprenger's disappearance, please contact the Lane County Sheriff's Office at 541-682-4150. </p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://prose.com/thevanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prose</a>- Take your free in-depth consultation and get 15% off your first order today at&nbsp;<a href="http://prose.com/thevanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prose.com/thevanished</a>.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our case submission form:<a href="http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patreon</a></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

The area where they found the vehicle was one of Shane's favorite mushroom picking spots. It was suggested by some people close to Shane that maybe he had gone mushroom picking and got lost. However, it was later discovered that Shane planned to return to the job site to meet with a subcontractor. It did not make sense that Shane would have stopped to pick mushrooms because all clues indicated that he was planning to return to work after a quick break. Shane's family in Minnesota had no idea that anything was wrong until they got a phone several days after Shane vanished. They made the trip to Oregon to search for him. They began to hear strange stories about the day Shane disappeared, tales that simply weren't adding up.

If you have any information about Shane Sprenger's disappearance, please contact the Lane County Sheriff's Office at 541-682-4150.

        <![CDATA[<p>On December 7, 1971, 16-year-old Jamie Grissim left her home in Vancouver, Washington, to catch the bus to school. Jamie attended classes but got out early because she only had two classes scheduled on that particular day. Jamie had told her foster mother that she would walk home and expected to be there around 1 PM. Jamie never made it home and was never seen or heard from again. Jamie’s family was concerned, but local police assumed she was simply a runaway. Months later, in the spring of 1972, some of Jamie’s belongings turned up strewn alongside a country road in rural Clark County, Washington.

It would be several more weeks before Patrick's friends and family learned anything was amiss, after the last people to see Patrick reported him missing.

      <title>Julianne Jaillet</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On June 18, 1985, a man walked into the Bellevue Police Department in Washington to report his 36-year-old wife, Julianne Jaillet, missing. He couldn't recall exactly when he'd last seen her but thought it might have been at the end of May or the beginning of June. He told police that he and his wife of five months had gotten into an argument, and she said she was leaving him, packed her belongings, and walked out. When asked why he hadn't reported Julianne missing in over two weeks, he said he thought she'd come back, that she'd been known to leave for a few days in the past, but never for this long. Things took a strange twist when some of Julianne's belongings were found in a hotel several states away. More than 36 years later, what happened to Julianne remains a mystery.</p><p>If you have any information about Julianne's disappearance, please call the Bellevue Police Department at 425-452-6917.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://bollandbranch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boll &amp; Branch</a>- To experience an entirely new standard of comfort, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://bollandbranch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bollandbranch.com</a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Get 15% off your first set of sheets with promo code&nbsp;MIA.</p><p><a href="http://moinkbox.com/Vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moink</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://moinkbox.com/Vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moinkbox.com/Vanished</a>&nbsp;to get FREE filet mignon for a year.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://sleepnumber.com/VANISH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sleep Number</a>- Proven quality sleep is life-changing sleep.

        <![CDATA[<p>25-year-old Shelton Sanders had everything going for him. He was about to graduate from the University of South Carolina in the coming months. Shelton had big career aspirations and the talent to match. At the time, Shelton lived with his family in Rembert, SC, and would make the 45-minute commute back and forth to school and work in Columbia each day. On June 19th, 2001, Shelton left home to attend classes and work his part-time job at the university. After work, Shelton and a friend were looking at hotels for a friend’s upcoming bachelor party. Shelton was supposed to be the best man at the wedding. The two went to three different hotels, and the friend said that Shelton dropped him off at his home and then left to drive back home to Rembert. After that, it was like Shelton and the vehicle he was driving vanished into thin air. By the following day, Shelton’s family was alarmed when they realized he hadn’t made it home. This was not like Shelton. Concerns quickly turned to the possibility of an accident during Shelton’s commute home late at night. But nearly two years later, after discovering the car Shelton was driving, this case took a completely different turn.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Shelton Sanders, please contact the Richland County Sheriff’s Office at (803) 576-3000 or the Shelton Sanders information hotline at (803) 427-4209.

        <![CDATA[<p>29-year-old Lonene Rogers, or Lonnie, spent January 6, 1981, working as a maid at a hotel. Afterward, she stopped by the babysitter's house to pick up her two young children.

Missing along with Lonnie was her coat, jeans, and boots. Other essential items were left behind at the house, including her car, keys, and purse. But this wasn't a night that someone would choose to walk away from their home or take a casual stroll around the neighborhood. It was freezing cold, and a storm blanketed the area with snow.

His story was that he last saw Lonnie around 12:45 AM when he went to bed. He awoke in the early morning hours of January 7 to find that Lonnie was gone. Missing along with Lonnie was her coat, jeans, and boots. Other essential items were left behind at the house, including her car, keys, and purse. But this wasn't a night that someone would choose to walk away from their home or take a casual stroll around the neighborhood. It was freezing cold, and a storm blanketed the area with snow. What could have happened to Lonnie? Lonnie is still missing more than 40 years later, and her case remains unsolved.</p><p>Any persons with information regarding Lonnie's disappearance are urged to call Pennsylvania State Police at (814)-332-6911, TTY/TDD (814)-724-2985, or anonymously contact the Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers at 1-800-4PA-TIPS (8477) or online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.p3tips.com/tipform.aspx?ID=107" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.p3tips.com/tipform.aspx?ID=107</a>.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://Prose.com/thevanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prose</a>- Take your free in-depth consultation and get 15% off your first order today at <a href="http://Prose.com/thevanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prose.com/thevanished</a>.</p><p><a href="http://Doordash.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Doordash</a>- For a limited time, our listeners can get 25% off and zero delivery fees on their first order of $15or more, when you download the DoorDash app and enter code&nbsp;<strong><em>VANISHED</em></strong>.</p><p><a href="http://Edmunds.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edmunds</a>- Go to <a href="http://Edmunds.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edmunds.com</a> and click on Edmunds Best Car Rankings to research and compare vehicles.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our case submission form:<a href="http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Mark Brunelle</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Mark Brunelle disappeared from Bellingham, Massachusetts, on February 23, 2021. Mark left home to do laundry and never returned. Mark's family quickly jumped into action to try to find him. His truck was later found at a storage facility that Mark rented, and things started to become strange.

      <title>Case Update: Johnthan Hall</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We first brought you the story of Johnthan Hall just over two years ago in December 2019. On Wednesday, February 13, 2019, 30-year-old Johnthan Hall went to work with his dad. The two worked together at a maintenance job in Las Vegas, Nevada. At the end of the day, his father dropped him off at home. Johnthan then left for his second job at a local billiards club not too far away. Johnthan was seen at the club that night around 7:30 PM. No one knows precisely when Johnthan left or where he may have gone. Missing along with Johnthan were the items he always carried with him in his backpack.</p><p>Frustratingly, Johnthan is still missing today, but there has been one major turn of events that reignited John's case. In October of 2020, someone very close to John was arrested by Las Vegas police and accused of stabbing three people. Two of those victims died, and one survived. This was a person that some of John's family members had suspicions about in the original episode, but they were under the impression that he had been ruled out. Investigators told John's family in 2019 that they didn't think this person was capable of murder. But now, they aren't sure what to think.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Johnthan Hall, please call the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department at 702-828-3111.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://storyworth.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StoryWorth</a>- Go to <a href="http://storyworth.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StoryWorth.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;for $10 off your first purchase.</p><p><a href="http://sleepnumber.com/VANISH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sleep Number</a>- Proven quality sleep is life-changing sleep.

      <title>Stephen Millis Part 3: Family Ties</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Last week, we brought you the first two installments of Steve Millis’ story.

      <title>James Foster Chance</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of 2021, James Foster Chance disappeared from Grapevine, Texas. No one knows exactly when James was last seen. It's believed he disappeared sometime between January and March. During that time, Texas experienced a record setting winter storm, leaving most of the state without power for days. It was during this storm that it appears that James made a mysterious trip. James' family was alerted by his landlord that something was amiss.

      <itunes:summary>At the beginning of 2021, James Foster Chance disappeared from Grapevine, Texas. No one knows exactly when James was last seen. It's believed he disappeared sometime between January and March. During that time, Texas experienced a record setting winter storm, leaving most of the state without power for days. It was during this storm that it appears that James made a mysterious trip. James' family was alerted by his landlord that something was amiss. That was when they began piecing together his last movements. What they discovered left them with more questions than answers. This is a story that will leave you questioning how much you can really ever know someone. Do people only show you the side of themselves that they want you to see? What could even your closest loved ones be hiding from you?

      <title>Case Update: Johnathan Hamilton</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We first aired Johnathan Hamilton's story in a two-part series in October of 2017. At the time, we left off with Johnathan's case considered suspended. The Bastrop Police Department believed that they had run down all of the leads, and there was nothing else left to investigate. They believed that Johnathan wasn't in Bastrop. Investigators told Angie that Johnathan wanted to leave his life behind, he was capable, and likely getting insulin from charity programs. Johnathan's mother, Angie, persisted and never gave up fighting for her son. Something didn't seem right about this. She didn't think Johnathan would have left for this long without contact, and she didn't have a single shred of proof that he ever left the town of Bastrop. In the end, Angie was right. Jonathan wasn't living on the streets of Austin, he hadn't made it to Mexico, he wasn't getting insulin from a charity. Something did happen to Johnathan Hamilton in Bastrop, Texas. Four years after Johnathan disappeared, a man swimming at a park in Bastrop made a gruesome discovery, which shifted the focus of this case right back to Bastrop, Texas, and that night back in May of 2015 when this all began.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the death of Johnathan Hamilton, please contact the Bastrop County Sheriff’s Office at (512) 549-5100.

This was just the beginning of the nightmare for Pamela’s family, and more than 15 years later, what happened to Pamela Callahan remains a mystery.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Pamela Callahan, please contact the Concord Police Department at (704) 786-9155.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://upstart.com/Vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Upstart</a>- Find out how Upstart can lower your monthly payments today when you go to&nbsp;<a href="http://upstart.com/Vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Upstart.com/Vanished</a>.</p><p><a href="http://bollandbranch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boll &amp; Branch</a>- Get 20% off your order from 11/12-11/17 with promo code MIA at <a href="http://bollandbranch.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bollandbranch.com</a>.</p><p><a href="http://getquip.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">QUIP</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://getquip.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GetQuip.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;and you'll get your first refill free.</p><p><a href="http://Moinkbox.com/Vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moink</a>- Go to <a href="http://Moinkbox.com/Vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moinkbox.com/Vanished</a> to get FREE ground beef for a year. </p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our case submission form:<a href="http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Case Update: Emily Noble Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We first brought you Emily Noble's story on September 21, 2020. Emily disappeared after spending the evening of May 24, 2020, celebrating her birthday with her husband. They stopped at several restaurants in a popular part of Westerville, Ohio. They then made their way home for the evening. Emily's husband claimed that they went to bed, and during the night, he got up to use the restroom and then went back to sleep in a guest room, not wanting to disturb Emily. When he awoke later that morning, Emily was gone, and her wallet, phone, keys, and car were still at the residence. Emily's disappearance captivated the local community, and rumors swirled from day one. Days before we were due to air Emily's story in 2020, human remains were located not far from her condo. The day after we aired Emily's episode, the Westerville Police Department held a press conference confirming the identification of Emily's remains. On June 17, 2021, her husband Matt was arrested and charged with her murder. In this special two-part update on Emily Noble, we will explore what happened after the original episode aired and what we know today about what happened to Emily.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://Acorn.TV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Acorn TV</a>- Try Acorn TV free for 30 days by going to <a href="http://Acorn.TV " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Acorn.TV</a> and use our promo code <strong>vanished</strong>.

      <title>Marialice Clark</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In August of 1972, 14-year-old Marialice Clark disappeared from Omaha, Nebraska. She had left to visit a friend who lived in the neighborhood but never returned. There isn't much known about the disappearance of Marialice Clark, but if you search for information online, you will find her name tied to the controversial conviction of two men who were affiliated with the Black Panther Party and an anti-fascist political group. When Marialice was just 12-years-old, she was named in a federal ATF affidavit as having reportedly seen a large collection of foreign-made firearms and explosives, which she described in intricate detail. How would a young pre-teen know so much about weapons and explosives and to call the ATF? After Marialice disappeared, her name was almost entirely erased from existence for the next 50 years. Fifteen months ago, we set out to try to find any trace of Marialce that we could possibly uncover.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://thredup.com/Vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thredUP</a>- Get an extra 30% off your first order at&nbsp;<a href="http://thredup.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thredUP.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p><a href="http://shop.analuisa/vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ana Luisa</a>- Head to <a href="http://shop.analuisa/vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shop.analuisa/vanished</a> and you can get 20% off.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.

There isn't much known about the disappearance of Marialice Clark, but if you search for information online, you will find her name tied to the controversial conviction of two men who were affiliated with the Black Panther Party and an anti-fascist political group. When Marialice was just 12-years-old, she was named in a federal ATF affidavit as having reportedly seen a large collection of foreign-made firearms and explosives, which she described in intricate detail. How would a young pre-teen know so much about weapons and explosives and to call the ATF? After Marialice disappeared, her name was almost entirely erased from existence for the next 50 years. Fifteen months ago, we set out to try to find any trace of Marialce that we could possibly uncover.

      <title>Eric Franks Part 1: The Plot Twist</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In March of 2011, 38-year-old Eric Franks disappeared from Saginaw, Michigan. The circumstances of Eric's disappearance were strange, and suspicious figures surrounded the case from the beginning. A unique series of events seemed to protect the suspicious figures. Despite a thorough investigation and execution of many search warrants, law enforcement struggled to come up with anything tangible. It was a frustrating case that went cold over the years. Then, in September of 2020, Eric's car was found after being hidden away in a garage for many years. With this significant development, Eric's cold case suddenly came screaming back to life.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Eric Franks you are asked to call the Michigan State Police at 989-495-5555.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://headspace.com/THEVANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Headspace</a>- Head to&nbsp;<a href="http://headspace.com/THEVANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Headspace.com/THEVANISHED</a>&nbsp;for a free month trial.</p><p><a href="http://sleepnumber.com/VANISH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sleep Number</a>- Proven quality sleep is life-changing sleep.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>310</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>In March of 2011, 38-year-old Eric Franks disappeared from Saginaw, Michigan. The circumstances of Eric's disappearance were strange, and suspicious figures surrounded the case from the beginning. A unique series of events seemed to protect the suspicious figures. Despite a thorough investigation and execution of many search warrants, law enforcement struggled to come up with anything tangible. It was a frustrating case that went cold over the years. Then, in September of 2020, Eric's car was found after being hidden away in a garage for many years. With this significant development, Eric's cold case suddenly came screaming back to life.

If you have any information about the disappearance of Eric Franks you are asked to call the Michigan State Police at 989-495-5555.

      <title>Case Update: Ebby Steppach</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We first brought you Ebby's story back in March of 2017. Ebby's mom, Laurie, told us about her frustrating journey to have her daughter's case investigated properly. At the end of our original episode, there was a new team looking into her disappearance. Laurie was hopeful. A little over a year later, there would be a major break in the case when detective Tommy Hudson decided to search areas of the park where Ebby's car had been found. Areas that her family had been told were searched previously. That was when they discovered Ebby's remains just 60 feet from where her car had been found. In this update, Laurie is joining us again to discuss how Ebby was found and where her case stands today.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance and murder of Ebby Steppach, please call the Little Rock Police Department at (501) 404-3128.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://moinkbox.com/vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moink</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://moinkbox.com/vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moinkbox.com/vanished</a>&nbsp;to get a free year of bacon and then pick the meats you want delivered with your first box.</p><p><a href="http://Nutrafol.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nutrafol</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://Nutrafol.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nutrafol.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;to save $15 off your first order plus free shipping.</p><p><a href="http://thredup.com/Vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thredUP</a>- Get an extra 30% off your first order at&nbsp;<a href="http://thredup.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thredUP.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.

      <title>Case Update: Carolyn Riggins Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Last fall, we brought you the story of 69-year-old Carolyn Riggins. In July of 2020, after a successful night at her favorite bingo hall just a few miles from her Fort Worth, Texas home, Carolyn had disappeared. Just weeks before we originally aired her story, Carolyn’s remains were found inside the backseat of her car in a deeply wooded, remote part of far north Texas. This area was a place so rural, that it is almost completely inaccessible without detailed knowledge of the area. The discovery of Carolyn’s vehicle and body under such mysterious and unexplained circumstances troubled Carolyn’s family, especially with some of the rumors that swirled around the community from the time she disappeared and even after she was found. This week, we will explore some of the stranger aspects that have developed since we first aired Carolyn’s story nearly a year ago.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://vionicshoes.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vionic Shoes</a>- Visit <a href="http://vionicshoes.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VionicShoes.com</a>&nbsp;and use promo code VANISHED for free shipping.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On July 30, 1997, 35-year-old Doug Jones was finishing up some jobs before taking a family trip that he was very much looking forward to going on.

Doug and his wife, Joellen, had plans to go to Disney World with their older child the next day, leaving their infant back home in South Carolina with Doug’s parents. Doug was spotted going about his day at jobs and stores, purchasing plumbing supplies; nothing seemed amiss. Doug never made it home from work that night. His truck was later found abandoned, not far from his home in Simpsonville, South Carolina. 24-years later, Doug’s children have grown up and are now leading the search efforts to find their father.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Doug Jones, please contact the Greenville County Sheriff’s Office at 864-467-5300.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://thredup.com/Vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thredUP</a>- Get an extra 30% off your first order at&nbsp;<a href="http://thredup.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thredUP.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p><a href="http://betterhelp.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BetterHelp</a>- Visit&nbsp;<a href="http://betterhelp.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BetterHelp.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;for 10% off your first month.</p><p><a href="http://stamps.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stamps.com</a>- Just go to&nbsp;<a href="http://stamps.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stamps.com</a>, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in&nbsp;VANISHED.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.

      <title>Ian Eckles Part 3: The Broken Window</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Ian Eckles was last seen leaving his home on May 16, 2020, headed to go hunting with a friend in the mountains of Washington. Ian never met up with his friend, and no one was able to reach him for days.  This sparked a massive search that went on for weeks after Ian’s car was spotted being driven by another man. On June 14, 2020, Ian was still missing, but the man believed to be responsible for his disappearance and murder was apprehended. This man is also believed to have been involved in at least two other deaths. So who is this man, and where is Ian?</p><p>After Jorge Alcantara-Gonzalez was apprehended, he was taken directly to an interview with investigators.  In Part 3, we are sharing parts of this interview with you.

      <itunes:summary>Ian Eckles was last seen leaving his home on May 16, 2020, headed to go hunting with a friend in the mountains of Washington. Ian never met up with his friend, and no one was able to reach him for days.  This sparked a massive search that went on for weeks after Ian’s car was spotted being driven by another man. On June 14, 2020, Ian was still missing, but the man believed to be responsible for his disappearance and murder was apprehended. This man is also believed to have been involved in at least two other deaths. So who is this man, and where is Ian?

After Jorge Alcantara-Gonzalez was apprehended, he was taken directly to an interview with investigators.  In Part 3, we are sharing parts of this interview with you. Tune in to hear what Alcantara claims happened and what investigators believe happened the night Ian disappeared.

      <title>Ian Eckles Part 2: The Manhunt</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>By May 23, 2020, Ian Eckles had not been seen in a week. He had plans to go hunting with a friend but never showed up at their agreed meeting location. The next day, Ian didn't report to work. Ian's family and friends launched a massive search across a vast territory encompassing the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest along the eastern slopes of the Cascade Mountains in Washington. They had been going for days without sleep, searching tirelessly for Ian on nothing but desperation and adrenaline. Then, Ian's silver FJ cruiser burst out of nowhere, bounding down the mountain toward them in what sounded like a horrible nightmare, but it was actually happening. Even more strange was the fact that Ian wasn't driving the car. Ian's friends had a brief altercation with the man behind the wheel, and then he took off. A chase ensued, but they lost sight of Ian's vehicle. This chance meeting with the man driving Ian's FJ Cruiser sparked a massive manhunt for an armed and dangerous fugitive.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://thredup.com/Vanished" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thredUP</a>- Get an extra 30% off your first order at&nbsp;<a href="http://thredup.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thredUP.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p><a href="http://grove.co/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grove Collaborative</a>&nbsp;- For a limited time, when&nbsp;my listeners go to&nbsp;<a href="http://grove.co/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grove.co/VANISHED</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>you will get to choose a FREE gift&nbsp;with your first order of $30 or more.</p><p><a href="http://vionicshoes.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vionic Shoes</a>- Visit<a href="http://vionicshoes.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VionicShoes.com</a>&nbsp;and use promo code VANISHED for free shipping.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.

Yesterday, you heard an expert fire investigator discuss the plausibility of the theory that Angie and Mikey were burned in Clarence Krusen’s home furnace.&nbsp;Was it possible that their bodies were completely destroyed, leaving no physical evidence to be recovered? Today we’re bringing you the final episode in this series. We’re going to take a look at all of the other characters and moving parts in this story. In the end, we’ll leave you with a question: did Clarence Krusen kill Angela and Mikey and burn their bodies as investigators say he did?

Then, in a bizarre plot twist that seemed almost stranger than fiction, the investigating agency announced that the disappearances had been solved and the case closed almost exactly one month after we aired the original episode.

      <title>Amanda Grazewski</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>23-year-old Amanda Grazewski disappeared from an apartment in Derry, New Hampshire, in the early morning hours of March 17, 2020.

In Part 1, we learned that it’s believed Kacey made it to a store blocks away from her father’s home, possibly to make a phone call to ask someone to pick her up. Witnesses spotted her at this location, and her belongings were later found at the store. It remains unclear if Kacey was picked up by someone she knew or possibly went with a stranger. In the early days of the investigation, one person close to her mom stood out. His name is Brian Keith George. Nearly a year after Kacey disappeared, he was arrested for a bank robbery and had something shocking to tell investigators.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Kacey Perry, please call the Portland Police Bureau at 503-823-0000.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://getquip.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">QUIP</a>- Go to <a href="http://getquip.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GetQuip.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;to get a free plastic dispenser with any refill plan.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.

      <title>Kyle Fleischmann</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On the chilly fall evening of November 8, 2007, 24-year-old Kyle Fleischmann went to dinner, drinks, and a show with friends in Charlotte, North Carolina.

However, the night didn't end on a festive note when friends went their separate ways, and Kyle seemingly vanished into the night, leaving behind only a small number of telling but mysterious clues. More than 13 years have passed, and the last sightings of Kyle include some grainy surveillance footage and the eyewitness account of a cab driver, who watched Kyle walk down the street and disappear from view, and seemingly, life.</p><p>If you have any information about Kyle Fleischmann’s disappearance, you are asked to call the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department at 704-336-7600.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://betterhelp.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BetterHelp</a>- Visit&nbsp;<a href="http://betterhelp.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BetterHelp.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;for 10% off your first month.</p><p>DoorDash- For a limited time, our listeners can get 25% off and zero delivery fees on their first order when you download the DoorDash app and enter code THEVANISHED.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.

Leona never showed up at her friend's house and was never seen again. In Part 1, we discussed the circumstances surrounding Leona's disappearance and how those close to her began pointing fingers at others. In the beginning, investigators had many people to look at, but later they began to focus on one man. The more they learned about this man, the more they began to believe he might be the one who made Leona disappear.</p><p>If you have any information about Leona Kinsey's disappearance, please call the La Grande Police Department at (541) 963-1017.

        <![CDATA[<p>21-year-old Adam Castillo left his Willcox, AZ home on the evening of September 13, 2008. His plans that night were to attend a party.

Adam caught a ride to the party that was taking place outside of town, between Willcox and Kansas Settlement, AZ, in an area that locals call "the loop." It has been reported that there were many partygoers there, and they all made it home, except Adam Castillo. The last reported sighting of Adam was around 2 am on the September 14. Law enforcement conducted extensive searches in the area where the party was held, but no trace of Adam has ever been found. Investigators interviewed numerous people who were at the party.

That was until her aunt received a phone call in September of 2019, one of those calls we all dread from the police. They were called to Luzeia's apartment due to a bad smell.

Nico’s story is an uncommon one, with complicated twists of family courts, international law, and diplomacy that often forget the child lost in the midst.</p><p>If you have any information about Nico Johnson, please contact the San Bernardino County, California, District Attorney’s office at 909-677-0591 or the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p>DoorDash- Download the DoorDash App and enter promo code VANISHED to get 25% off your purchase of $15 or more and free delivery on your first order.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.

      <title>Case Update: Grundy County Jane Doe</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>It has been nearly two years since we shared the story of Grundy County Jane Doe, whose remains were discovered in October 1976 by a farmer in rural Seneca, Illinois. When we initially researched her story, we learned that her case was reopened by ambitious Deputy Coroner Brandon Johnson, who works in Grundy County, Illinois. At that time, the coroner’s office had recently exhumed Jane Doe and had sent a bone to a lab for DNA testing,  but results had not come back from the lab. The coroner’s office considered several possibilities for identifying Jane Doe if her DNA was not matched to a profile already in the CODIS database. We spoke to Brandon again recently to hear more about what has taken place in the effort to identify Jane Doe.</p><p>If you have any information about Jane Doe’s identity or her murder, please contact Grundy County Deputy Coroner Brandon Johnson at 815-941-3359 or email him at bjohnson@grundyco.org.</p><p>You can follow Jane Doe’s story on Facebook at&nbsp;<a href="http://facebook.com/grundycountycoldcase" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">facebook.com/grundycountycoldcase</a>.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.

        <![CDATA[<p>We initially told Paige’s story in February of 2020. Since that time, there have been many developments in her case, including the recovery of her remains and the arrest of the person suspected of seriously harming or killing her. At the time we first aired the podcast, Paige’s family was still looking for answers, distributing flyers, conducting searches, and meeting with law enforcement in the hopes of making progress in bringing Paige home. We left off with a brokenhearted family who had been forever changed by Paige’s disappearance and ten years without answers.</p><p>If you have any information about the death of Paige Johnson, please call the Covington, Kentucky Police Department at 859-292-2222. </p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://headspace.com/THEVANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Headspace</a>- Go to <a href="http://headspace.com/THEVANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Headspace.com/THEVANISHED</a>&nbsp;for a free one-month trial with access to Headspace's full library of meditations for every situation.</p><p><a href="http://ring.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ring</a>- Get a special offer on the Ring Welcome Kit when you go to&nbsp;<a href="http://ring.com/VANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ring.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p><a href="http://nutrafol.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nutrafol</a>- Go to <a href="http://nutrafol.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nutrafol.com</a>&nbsp;and use promo code VANISHED for 20% off.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.

While she once had a promising future, Camille had been on a downward spiral for quite some time. Unfortunately, it took months to report Camille missing, and the police didn’t seem very interested in looking for her. Camille’s mom moved to Las Vegas and began spending her free time searching for her daughter, but no one had seen Camille. Mysteriously, Camille’s missing person’s case was closed by the Las Vegas Metro Police Department months later and wasn’t reopened until the early 2000s, when a friend began seeking answers. Today, the search for what happened to Camille continues with her daughter, Ashley, who was just a young child when her mom vanished. During this renewed search, they have found was that in the lead-up to her disappearance, Camille was involved with some violent men, had ties to organized crime, and was possibly working as an informant.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Camille Dardanes Dotson, please call the Las Vegas Metro Police Department at (702) 828-3111.</p><p>You can follow developments in this case on Facebook at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/camilledotsonmissing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Camille Dardanes Dotson - Missing Person</a>.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p>DoorDash- Download the DoorDash App and enter promo code VANISHED to get $5 off your purchase of $15 or more.</p><p><a href="http://headspace.com/THEVANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Headspace</a>- Go to <a href="http://headspace.com/THEVANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Headspace.com/THEVANISHED</a>&nbsp;for a free one-month trial with access to Headspace's full library of meditations for every situation.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.

        <![CDATA[<p>We first brought you Zachary Kennedy's story in January of 2018. Zachary disappeared from Long Beach, California, on October 22, 2017. He was at the home of an acquaintance, Scott Leo, when his phone activity suddenly stopped, and the phone powered down. Scott Leo later stated that Zachary left on foot that night, but he was never seen or heard from again. Six months after he had vanished, police made a gruesome discovery. We all thought that justice would be swift, but we were wrong. It would be two more years before charges were filed against Leo. Join us for an update with Jeff Kennedy and the family attorney, Karen Gold.</p><p>UPDATE: In March of 2022, Scott Leo was found guilty of drug charges in relation to Zachary’s death and sentenced to a maximum of 6 years and 8 months in state prison.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://Headspace.com/THEVANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Headspace</a>- Go to <a href="http://Headspace.com/THEVANISHED" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Headspace.com/THEVANISHED</a> for a free one-month trial with access to Headspace's full library of meditations for every situation.</p><p>Listen ad free with Wondery+.

        <![CDATA[<p>On the evening of May 24, 2020, 52-year-old Emily Noble was out celebrating her birthday with her husband. They stopped at several restaurants in a popular part of Westerville, Ohio, and then made their way home for the evening. During the night, Emily’s husband got up to use the restroom and then went back to sleep in a guest room, not wanting to disturb Emily. When he woke up later that morning, Emily was gone, and her wallet, phone, keys, and car were still at the residence. Emily has not been seen since the evening she went out for her birthday, and rumors and allegations have swirled around this story from day one.</p><p>Last week, human remains were found in a wooded area not far from Emily's condo. At this time, those remains have not been identified.</p><p>On September 22, 2020, the Westerville Police Department held a press conference about the remains recovered last week. They said that the dental comparison was "consistent" with Emily Noble's dental records but that they are going to do DNA test to be sure. The DNA comparison could take some time. The autopsy is not complete, there is no news on a cause or manner of death. They also mentioned that the area was searched by authorities multiple times, at least one time with cadaver dogs. Emily's family has been notified and Matt was notified via his attorney. Our thoughts are with Emily's loved ones at this time.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Emily Noble, you are asked to call the Westerville Police Department at 614-901-6866.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On the evening of February 28, 2019, 20-year-old Matthew Anfeldt disappeared after leaving his mom’s house in Tenino, Washington. He had spent the day with his sister and her boyfriend. The three went out bowling together earlier in the day before returning home. Videos that his sister took that day show Matthew smiling and laughing. They returned to his mom’s home, and Matthew spent more time chatting with his sister. To those who saw Matthew that day, everything seemed normal. Matthew got up to get his cell phone and never came back to his sister’s room. Within minutes, she heard sirens outside and learned that several people had witnessed Matthew’s sudden, panicked behavior nearby. Dispatchers began getting more calls about Matthew from a Speedway a couple of miles down the road. By the time they got there, Matthew had disappeared. It has now been more than 18 months since that fateful night, and no trace of Matthew has ever been found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Matthew Anfeldt, please contact Detective Hamilton at 360-786-5279.</p><p>You can follow Matthew’s story on Facebook at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/452241108879970" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Help Find Matthew Anfeldt</strong></a>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>20-year-old Allyson Watterson disappeared just before Christmas in December 2019. Allyson was a young woman with her entire life ahead of her, trying to figure out what she wanted to pursue as a career path. She was last seen by her boyfriend on December 22, 2019, and his stories about that day were shaky, at best.&nbsp;He claims that they walked into the woods and got separated. His stories on how they got separated vary. Ben emerged from the woods the following day and Allyson was never seen again. While we were working on this story, on June 20, 2020, the remains of Allyson Watterson were found not far from where Ben said he last saw her.&nbsp;Though she is no longer missing, telling her story is still important.&nbsp;This week’s two-part series tells the story of Allyson Watterson, her love of life, the tragic loss her family has endured, and their continued search for answers.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance or death of Allyson Watterson, please contact your local law enforcement agency or the Washington County Sheriff’s Office at 503-846-2700.&nbsp;</p><p>You can follow Allyson’s case on social media at: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/576488619584667/?ref=group_header" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IN LOVING MEMORY: ALLYSON WATTERSON</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

She was last seen by her boyfriend on December 22, 2019, and his stories about that day were shaky, at best. He claims that they walked into the woods and got separated. His stories on how they got separated vary. Ben emerged from the woods the following day and Allyson was never seen again. While we were working on this story, on June 20, 2020, the remains of Allyson Watterson were found not far from where Ben said he last saw her. Though she is no longer missing, telling her story is still important. This week’s two-part series tells the story of Allyson Watterson, her love of life, the tragic loss her family has endured, and their continued search for answers.

If you have any information about the disappearance or death of Allyson Watterson, please contact your local law enforcement agency or the Washington County Sheriff’s Office at 503-846-2700.

More than 16 years have passed since Marcie was last seen and her family feels like they are no closer to finding out the truth.

        <![CDATA[<p>On October 30, 2003, 28-year-old Marcie Crane and her husband were staying at a hotel in Marietta, Georgia. The two had been estranged but were trying to rekindle their relationship. While her husband was out running errands, Marcie disappeared. Before she left, she gave a housekeeper the key to the room and asked her to give it to her husband. That is the last time that anyone heard from Marcie.</p><p>After her disappearance, several suspicious stories began to surface. A man who lent Marcie money had allegedly threatened her.

      <title>Angela Gilbert</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On June 2, 2011, Angela Gilbert was walking on timber land used for logging in Granite Falls, Washington with an acquaintance named Colt White .&nbsp;At some point, Colt returned without Angela. When asked about this, he allegedly said that she had continued to walk along the land near the Stillaguamish River. Unfortunately, no one ever got a chance to ask Colt more about what happened on that warm spring day walk because he disappeared shortly after Angela. Several weeks later, Colt’s body was found in the Stillaguamish River. During searches, some of Angela's belongings were found in the area but police told her family they believe the items were planted.

      <itunes:summary>On June 2, 2011, Angela Gilbert was walking on timber land used for logging in Granite Falls, Washington with an acquaintance named Colt White . At some point, Colt returned without Angela. When asked about this, he allegedly said that she had continued to walk along the land near the Stillaguamish River. Unfortunately, no one ever got a chance to ask Colt more about what happened on that warm spring day walk because he disappeared shortly after Angela. Several weeks later, Colt’s body was found in the Stillaguamish River. During searches, some of Angela's belongings were found in the area but police told her family they believe the items were planted. It has been eight long years since Angela disappeared and her family believes there are more people out there who know what happened.

If you have any information about the disappearance of Angela Gilbert, please call the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office at 425-388-3849.

A few months before Corinna went missing, she had met a man by the name of Yhovanny Peguero. Yhovanny told Corinna that he would be able to help her get a place to stay in New York City. In August of 2017, Corinna picked up and went to the big apple. She only took her cell phone and ID with her. She left all of her other belongings behind. A month later, Corinna disappeared and she is believed to have been the victim of human trafficking.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Corinna Slusser, please call the NYPD Human Trafficking Task Force at 212-384-1000.</p><p>This episode was co-researched and written by Marissa Jones and Erika Gwynn.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On December 26, 2016, 58-year-old Lori Feltz disappeared from Cynthiana, KY. When Lori was young, she was in a terrible car accident. This accident killed her younger brother, who was a passenger in the vehicle, and Lori suffered a traumatic brain injury. This accident would change the course of her life forever.

However, she never made it to see her sister.&nbsp;Her sister, Tricia, was expecting Lori and became concerned when she didn’t arrive but she couldn’t find Lori anywhere.

That was over twenty-five years ago. He has long been described as a man who lived for his baby daughter, had no reason to disappear and showed no signs of mental distress.

If you have any information regarding Sal’s disappearance, please contact the Yonkers Police Department at 914-377-7731.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On October 2, 1976, a farmer and his young granddaughter were riding a tractor through the fields of Seneca, Illinois. The farmer saw what he thought to be a deer laying in a ditch and wanted to show his granddaughter. As he approached, he found a young woman, nude, her head covered in a plastic bag and a sweater. The farmer drove back home and notified authorities. Soon after, the Grundy County Sheriff’s officers arrived and found a young black woman dead of a gunshot wound to the head. Authorities tried to identify the woman but no one came forward.   They were unable to match her to any missing persons reports.

        <![CDATA[<p>On October 2, 1976, a farmer and his young granddaughter were riding a tractor through the fields of Seneca, Illinois. The farmer saw what he thought to be a deer laying in a ditch and wanted to show his granddaughter. As he approached, he found a young woman, nude, her head covered in a plastic bag and a sweater. The farmer drove back home and notified authorities. Soon after, the Grundy County Sheriff’s officers arrived and found a young black woman dead of a gunshot wound to the head. Authorities tried to identify the woman but no one came forward.   They were unable to match her to any missing persons reports. Six weeks later, on Thanksgiving Day, she was buried in an unmarked grave in a local cemetery. 43 years later, she remains unidentified. On this episode of The Vanished, we are taking a look at the other side of missing persons cases; the unidentified.</p><p>Jane Doe's case was re-opened last year.  Deputy Coroner Brandon Johnson and Chief Coroner John Callahan join us to speak about their mission to give Jane Doe her name back.  This episode also includes an interview with Cook County Detective Sergeant Jason Moran who is assisting with Jane Doe's case and also working to identify the remaining unidentified victims of serial killer John Wayne Gacy.  Finally, we spoke to Dr. Colleen Fitzpatrick from the DNA Doe Project about what they are doing to help solve cold cases just like Jane Doe's.  </p><p>If you have any information about Jane Doe’s identity or her murder, please contact Grundy County Deputy Coroner Brandon Johnson at 815-941-3359 or email him at bjohnson@grundyco.org.</p><p>You can follow Jane Doe’s story on Facebook at&nbsp;<a href="http://facebook.com/grundycountycoldcase" target="_blank">facebook.com/grundycountycoldcase</a>.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://lendingclub.com/Vanished" target="_blank">Lending Club</a>- Go to <a href="http://lendingclub.com/Vanished" target="_blank">LendingClub.com/Vanished</a>&nbsp;to check your rate in minutes and borrow up to $40,000.</p><p><a href="http://Headspace.com/Vanished" target="_blank">Headspace</a>- Start your journey to a healthier, happier life by subscribing to Headspace.

For the past 19 years, the police have had one suspect in mind, but their evidence is circumstantial. What they are certain of is that Kathleen didn’t just walk away from her life, the believe that she is a homicide victim. They just need that key piece of evidence to bring her killer to justice.

If you have any information about the disappearance of Kathleen Mohn please call the Upper Merion Police Department at 610-265-3232.

On the afternoon of her disappearance, Katelin texted a couple people but they found the texts to be strange and didn't believe the messages came from Katelin. The last person to see Katelin was her former stepfather, James Branton. He says he last saw Katelin when he dropped her off at a mall several hours before her flight, but has refused to take a polygraph and law enforcement has struggled to break the encryption on his phone.</p><p>Nearly three years have passed since Katelin’s disappearance, and her family is still searching for answers. </p><p>If you have any information about Katelin Akens, please call the Spotsylvania County Sheriff’s Office at 540-507-7102 or the FBI’s ViCAP division at 1-800-634-4097.</p><p>You can follow Katelin’s case on Facebook at “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/HelpFindKatelinAkens/" target="_blank">Help Find Katelin Akens</a>.”</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href="http://thirdlove.com/Vanished" target="_blank">ThirdLove</a>- Go to<a href="http://thirdlove.com/Vanished" target="_blank">ThirdLove.com/Vanished</a>&nbsp;now to find your perfect-fitting bra AND get 15% off your first purchase!</p><p><a href="http://vanished.robinhood.com/" target="_blank">Robinhood</a>-<a href="http://vanished.robinhood.com/" target="_blank">Robinhood</a>is giving listeners a FREE stock like Apple, Ford or Sprint to help build your portfolio!

      <itunes:summary>On the evening of February 7th 2018, 23-year-old tribal member of the Round Valley Indian Tribes, Khadijah Rose Britton was visiting a friend. She lived in the small Mendocino County community of Covelo, California. According to a witness, her ex-boyfriend; 37 year old Negie Fallis IV, and his new girlfriend; 20 year old, Antonia Bautista-Dalson pulled up in a black mercedes sedan.

Negie was seen carrying a gun— said to be a small Derringer pistol, as he approached the door, and demanded that Khadijah come out to speak with him.

A physical altercation broke out and Negie was seen chasing Khadijah around the car, which was being driven by his current girlfriend, he was seen hitting Khadijah, before shoving her into the car before speeding away with her in it.

That witness didn’t come forward right away, and the details are murky.

What we do know is, Khadijah Britton has never been seen or heard from again.

At the time this episode was produced, her reward was $50,000 but has since been raised to $60,000. 

If you have any information about the disappearance of Khadijah Britton, please call the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Dispatch Center at 707-463-4086 or the Sheriff’s Tip line at 707-234-2100.

      <title>Case Update: Enrique Rios and Elijah Moore</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On the evening of October 17, 2016, 16-year-old Enrique Rios disappeared after saying goodnight to his mom.

      <itunes:summary>On the evening of October 17, 2016, 16-year-old Enrique Rios disappeared after saying goodnight to his mom. The following morning, his mom received texts from his phone that she didn't think sounded like her son. Law enforcement initially suspected that Enrique had run away but then Enrique's friend disappeared too. 17-year-old Elijah Moore was last seen cashing his check on November 4, 2016. Their families always suspected that their disappearances were connected and that the boys hadn't run off.

Since they have been missing, many rumors had been going around. All of the rumors kept pointing at the same people. Back in June, 4 men were arrested and charged with their murders.

Enrique's mom, Lola, joined me to discuss these devastating developments.

If you have any information about the murders of Enrique and Elijah, please contact the Yolo County Sheriff’s Office at 530-666-8282 or the Woodland Police Department at 530-666-2411.

      <title>Holly Cantrell</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>40-year-old Holly Cantrell disappeared from McAlester, Oklahoma on January 20, 2017. That morning, she got her kids off to school and then left home for work.

        <![CDATA[<p>In August of 2005, 26-year-old Amanda Jones was pregnant with her second child, a boy that she planned to name Hayden. Amanda was a single mom who was extremely close with her 4-year-old daughter.

When she didn't return, her family grew concerned because she was so close to her due date. They were worried that she may be experiencing a medical emergency. They began frantically searching for her and found her car parked at the Civic Center.

        <![CDATA[<p>On May 10, 1986, 17-year-old Kimberly Moreau had planned to attend her High School junior prom in her hometown of Jay, Maine. She had an argument with her boyfriend, Mike, and she was so upset that she refused to go to the prom.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On January 2, 1999 11-year-old Mikelle Biggs was playing outside with her 9-year-old sister, Kimber. Mikelle was on Kimber's bike while Kimber walked the dog on a leash. The girls could hear an ice cream truck in the distance, but Kimber got cold while waiting and went inside. When Kimber got back to the house, her mom told her to go back and tell Mikelle it was time to come in. Investigators estimate that Kimber was only gone for 90 seconds. In those 90 seconds, Mikelle vanished.

      <itunes:episode>123</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>On January 2, 1999 11-year-old Mikelle Biggs was playing outside with her 9-year-old sister, Kimber. Mikelle was on Kimber's bike while Kimber walked the dog on a leash. The girls could hear an ice cream truck in the distance, but Kimber got cold while waiting and went inside. When Kimber got back to the house, her mom told her to go back and tell Mikelle it was time to come in. Investigators estimate that Kimber was only gone for 90 seconds. In those 90 seconds, Mikelle vanished. In this episode, I'm joined by Kimber to discuss her sister's case.

If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Mikelle Biggs, please call the Mesa Police Department at 480-644-2211.

Kimber runs a Facebook page for Mikelle, you can follow here: Justice for Mikelle Biggs

They were able to match Moye’s DNA to DNA found on a couch in Unique’s residence. While in prison on unrelated charges, Moye confided in another inmate that he had killed a missing girl. At the time of Unique’s disappearance, Moye was wearing a GPS tracker which showed that he was in the area of her apartment that night.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>7-month-old Christopher Abeyta disappeared from his crib on July 15, 1986. His family lived in a quiet neighborhood of Colorado Springs, Colorado and were in the habit of leaving their doors unlocked. No one heard anyone come in and take Christopher that night but by morning, he was gone. Panic immediately set in when no one could find the baby. They ran downstairs to find the front door left open. The investigation focused on the family for a long time but in recent years, a person of interest has been identified. Even though detectives focused so much on the family, that didn't stop the Abeyta's from searching on their own.

      <itunes:summary>18-year-old Desirea Ferris left her home in Liberty, Missouri on May 1st, 2017. She had planned on hanging out with her sister and some friends. It was also her mom’s birthday and she had promised to be home to celebrate but that never happened. The activity on Desirea’s phone stopped in the early morning hours of May 2nd and her family hasn’t seen or heard from her since. They have been able to narrow down the areas of her last cell phone pings but searches of those areas haven’t lead to any clues. There are some horrible rumors circulating about what happened to Desirea that night but no one will talk about where she might be. 




If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Desirea Ferris, you can contact the Liberty Police at 816-439-4701. There is a tip hotline and that number is 816-474-8477. You can call Spike with tips at 816-462-2139. There is also a PO Box that you anonymously send in tips to:

Bring Desirea Home

PO Box 886

Kearney, MO 64060

        <![CDATA[What is happening in Yolo County, California? Back in November, we covered the disappearances of Enrique Rios and Elijah Moore. In this episode, you will hear new information about both cases along with information about the the disappearance of Oscar Alcaraz. Enrique has been missing since October 17, 2016, Elijah vanished a few weeks later on November 4th and Oscar disappeared on January 6, 2017. What do they have in common?

      <title>Aaron Watkins</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Aaron Watkins was just 18 years-old when he vanished from New Jersey on November 11, 2007.  Aaron had a tough childhood going from a home with his mother and siblings into foster care and eventually being adopted by a very strict, religious family.  Before he disappeared, he was struggling to figure out where he fit in this world and who he belonged with.  On November 11, 2007, he made a series of phone calls to those close to him and then the Jeep he was driving was found abandoned on the Driscoll Bridge.  What happened to Aaron?  Did he jump that day?  Did take off and start over somewhere else?  Did someone make his disappearance look like a suicide?

      <title>Lexy Anne Stacy</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Lexy Anne Stacy was a kind-hearted and independent-thinking young woman raised by two loving parents in Colorado's eastern plains. At 21, Lexy's BFF was her mother, Cindy, and she had three years in at the Westminster Walmart, where was named Employee of the Month, was well-liked, and made easy friends. Very much her own person, Stacy's tattoo sleeves and make-up heavy aesthetic were extensions of her vibrant and cheerful personality.  

But Lexy's technicolor world dimmed after she met Daniel Perkins on her 21st birthday. Perkins, a self-professed erudite and ladies' man, soon wreaked havoc in the Stacy household, driving a wedge between Lexy and her parents, and eventually Lexy and her friends. In the spring of 2015, Perkins gave Lexy a laptop to pawn because he didn't have an ID. What he didn't tell her was that he'd stolen it from her friend's house. Soon, a felony warrant was issued for her arrest. 

Things only got worse. Despite his previous failures as a criminal, Perkins robbed a bank in late May 2015, and was swiftly arrested. Nevertheless, Lexy exploited a clerical error to spring her sweetheart from the pokey. They've been on the run ever since. 

Where they are is anybody's guess. In late July 2016, a Missouri woman named Sheena Cox attempted to extort $2,000 from Lexy's heartbroken parents in exchange for information on their daughter's whereabouts. Disturbingly, Sheena implied Lexy was being held against her will, but records also show Sheena has been embroiled in a variety of real estate schemes. 

This week's investigation traces Lexy's whereabouts to a faux-utopia called Astral Valley, where Cox and Co. masquerade as peace lovin' hippies but may very well be involved in darker dealings behind the scenes? How can two cash-poor kids travel unnoticed for so long? We explore these questions and more in this episode of The Vanished.

      <title>Donald "Donnie" Messier</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Donald Messier is as vanished as vanished gets. The 34-year-old Vermont native was on the rebound in October 2006 following a painful divorce. On the night of Oct. 14, 2006, Donnie went to Waitsfield, to enjoy himself at another of the epic parties thrown by a longtime buddy. Those there that night say Donnie left the party by himself between midnight and 2:30 a.m. on October 15, 2006.  No one has seen him or his big-red pickup since. 

Over the following weeks, forests were searched and waters dredged, but the mystery behind Donnie's whereabouts only deepened. After giving it their half-hearted best, Vermont State Police determined Donnie wasn't a victim of foul play, suspecting he skipped out on the only life he's known or, perhaps, killed himself in the backcountry.  

For the last 10 years, his family has believed otherwise.

"I have heard some 'interesting' stories about how [he] just dropped off the face of the Earth with [his] truck," Donnie's father wrote on Facebook on Oct. 15, 2014. "Those responsible need to start looking over their shoulders because what goes around comes around."

In this investigation, Marissa and Nathan eye the conspiracy of silence around the party Donnie went to that night, discovering that if you listen closely enough you begin hearing the secrets others have left embedded in the silence around them.

      <title>Amos Mortier Part 4</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In this final installment of Amos Mortier's story, Vanished producer Nathan Comp gives us a peek into the evidence he says points to someone other than Big Jake Stadfeld, who police have eyed as their main suspect for the last 12 years. Former Det.

      <title>Amos Mortier:  Exclusive Interview with Margie Milutinovich</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Margie Milutinovich has searched for her son, Amos Mortier, since he went missing on Nov. 8, 2004. After questioning tracts of the investigation in the local press, Fitchburg, Wisconsin detective Shannan Sheil-Morgan all but cut Margie out of the loop. As state prosecutors launched a secret John Doe investigation into the circumstances around Amos's disappearance, Margie was left in the dark about whether anything was even being done to find her son. 

Her relationship with law enforcement only deteriorated over time as Margie learned important leads weren't being followed up, as people she suspected of being involved went unquestioned, and as detective Morgan herself made unprofessional comments, such as blaming the investigation for "ruining [her] marriage."

A feature-length documentary film called "What Happened to Amos?" is currently in production. The documentary follows The Vanished producer Nathan Comp's decade-long effort to help Margie find the truth about her son's disappearance. Nathan has shared a lot from that effort over the last three episodes. In part four we will explore detective Morgan's theory and Nathan will unveil his findings for the first time ever. 

In this exclusive interview with Margie, Nathan asks Margie about her experience with law enforcement, what more could be done to find the vanished, and what her hopes are for finding her son. 

SIDENOTE Nathan is writing and co-producing the feature documentary, What Happened to Amos?. Directed by filmmaker Kristina Motwani, the documentary follows Nathan's quest to help Margie get the answers authorities refused to give her.

The film is 40 percent complete, but it needs your help. Production costs are currently being raised via Kickstarter so the film can be finished and released next year. To date, just under $8,000 of the $30,000 goal has been raised. Please help bring this film to the big screen by contributing here at Kickstarter.com . Any amount helps and there are many cool prizes to choose from when you contribute.

Contributions from listeners of The Vanished will be mentioned in the film credits, receive a personal thank-you from Nathan, as well as a framed page of his production notes from the Amos Mortier episodes.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Amos Mortier vanished on November 8, 2004.  Rumors relating to Amos's whereabouts begin to swirl and his core group of friends fall under a cloud of suspicion, as the investigation ramps up. The double-life Amos led comes into clearer focus as those closest to him get caught up in the unrelenting motions of justice –– or in this case, perhaps, injustice.

        <![CDATA[Amos Mortier's friends were puzzled when he stopped returning calls the week of Nov. 8, 2004, but that was a small mystery compared to the mystery they stumbled into when they entered his unlit house in the swampy outskirts of Madison, Wisconsin. In this first installment of a special three-part series, The Vanished  probes the circumstances around the 12-year-old mystery that has confounded everyone from the small town detective on up to the DEA special agent who gave the case a special assist.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>What happens when a young woman from Illinois returns to the small Kansas town that chewed her up and spit her out once already? Megan Foglesong was a warm and energetic girl raised in a loving two-parent home in Oneida, IL, a small Midwestern town that, with its population of 750, must have felt like a big city compared to Alden, Kansas, population 148. But sometimes its in the small towns people find the biggest problems. In Alden, Megan became BFFs with her biological mother, Pam, who was unsettlingly competitive with her daughter. Together they drank, chased men, and took selfies in the bathroom together. But it wasn't all fun and games, especially once love struck a fearful tone, spurring her hasty return home after discovering those who love you can really hurt you the most. But once the bruises healed and her heart had warmed, Megan began to miss the party down in Bleeding Kansas, so she returned to Alden, to mom, to love... to be loved. Then one day –– and no one knows what day it was –– she was gone. Poof! Lost in the prairie dust and howling wind.</p><p><strong>UPDATE- On April 29, 2019, the man Megan had been dating at the time of her disappearance and who had been suspected of having a role in what happened to her, took his own life after he shot the Rice County Sheriff and Undersheriff.  He also killed his father before turning the gun on himself.</strong></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

But once the bruises healed and her heart had warmed, Megan began to miss the party down in Bleeding Kansas, so she returned to Alden, to mom, to love... to be loved. Then one day –– and no one knows what day it was –– she was gone. Poof! Lost in the prairie dust and howling wind.</p><p><strong>UPDATE- On April 29, 2019, the man Megan had been dating at the time of her disappearance and who had been suspected of having a role in what happened to her, took his own life after he shot the Rice County Sheriff and Undersheriff.  He also killed his father before turning the gun on himself.</strong></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Bradley Dale Ross II</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In Episode 47, What Happened to Bradley?, we take you to Coliseum and State, the intersection of two boulevards in Fort Wayne where, around 10 p.m. on Nov. 19, 2004, two men were struck by a 2004 Dodge Stratus that ran a red light. The driver of the Stratus fled and has never been identified. Investigators assumed Bradley Dale Ross was behind the wheel. After all, the vehicle belonged to his fiancée, Sarah. But Bradley’s sister tells The Vanished that he would never have dropped off the grid as many believed he has, not with a child on the way. In this episode, show producer, Nathan, and The Vanished host and creator, Marissa, grapple with a timeline that doesn’t line up as neatly as it should. Things get stranger still when we called detective Cary Young and realized a missed connection may have allowed a murder to slip through the cracks.

        <![CDATA[Mitchel and Bonnie left Narrowsburg, NY on July 27, 1973.  They had planned to hitchhike to Watkins Glen, NY to see Summer Jam.  Summer Jam was a concert that featured The Allman Brothers Band, The Grateful Dead and The Band.  It is estimated that between 600,000 and 800,000 people attended the show.  The two teens never made it back home to Brooklyn.  Did they even make it to the concert?

Susan Baker is currently serving a 25 year sentence in Florida for the abduction of 7 month old Shannon Dedrick.
