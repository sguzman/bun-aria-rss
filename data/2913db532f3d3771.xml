			<description><![CDATA[<p>Much of what you see in the “divine feminine” space online is not actually the divine feminine… The divine feminine is not about being a submissive, male fantasy version of you that swallows her truth and instead uses her sexuality to receive attention, validation and love.</p> <p>In this solo episode for the first time ever, I share an experience as a young woman in a “tantra” workshop in India and how horrific it was. I address the hidden patriarchy that is often present in the polarity space, how women are often used for our innate desire to be loved and why we need to speak about it as a spiritual community. While there is great beauty in true Tantra.. A lot of the practices we see today in the “neo tantra” space are not actually Tantra but used as a form of manipulation.</p> <p>This is a deep, vulnerable, and raw episode about a topic that is often silenced but now, enough is enough. Remember- the feminine is also embodied through rage, power, truth, sovereignty, strength, and everything else in between.</p> <p>If you’re feeling the call to embody more ease, flow, creativity and joy from a cellular level - my Free Embodiment Practice is meant for you: <a href="https://iamsahararose.com/embodiment" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><u>https://iamsahararose.com/embodiment</u></a></p> <p>To receive a free gift, email a screenshot of your review of the Highest Self Podcast to <a href= "mailto:sahara@iamsahararose.com"><u>sahara@iamsahararose.com</u></a></p> <p>Intro + Outro Music: Silent Ganges by Maneesh de Moor</p> <p>Follow me your spiritual bestie to active your fullest expression + laugh along the way:</p> <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/iamsahararose" target= "_blank" rel= "noopener"><u>https://www.Instagram.com/iamsahararose</u></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@iamsahararose" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>https://www.tiktok.com/@iamsahararose</u></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/iamsahararose" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><u>https://www.Facebook.com/iamsahararose</u></a></p> <p>Discover Your Dharma Archetype with my free quiz <a href= "http://www.dharmaarchetypequiz.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><u>http://www.dharmaarchetypequiz.com</u></a></p> <p>Download my Goddess Embodiment Practice:</p> <p><a href="http://www.iamsahararose.com/embodiment" target= "_blank" rel= "noopener"><u>http://www.iamsahararose.com/embodiment</u></a></p> <p>Order My Books: <a href= "https://www.iamsahararose.com/books" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><u>https://www.iamsahararose.com/books</u></a></p> <p>By accessing this Podcast, I acknowledge that the entire contents are the property of Sahara Rose, or used by Sahara Rose with permission, and are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you go on social media and look up #manifestation, you would guess it’s about designer bags, expensive shoes, lavish cars, private jets and exclusive vacations. While those things can be great if you want them.. That is NOT what manifestation is actually about.

We talk about what is missing in the manifestation conversation, what manifestation is truly about, and bringing the spirituality back into manifestation so we can manifest what truly matters.</p> <p>In this episode, I sit with one of my besties + Manifestation through Meditation Author Cassandra Bodzak for another jam-packed episode on the truth about manifestation. Her episode 389: How To Manifest Anything (that is in alignment) is the #1 most downloaded episode on Highest Self Podcast history so I know you’re going to love it.</p> <p>You are a creatrix so far beyond the material possessions.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Oftentimes, our society’s systems tell us that we have to follow a linear progression when it comes to growth.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You are a multi-dimensional sun-being. You deserve to shine your radiant light, share your voice and gifts with the world,  and embody your true nature. </p> <p>That’s why in this week’s podcast episode, I will be sharing affirmations all about tuning into your multidimensional nature and supporting your evolution. If you are moving through an evolution right now where you are desiring to share and embody more sides of yourself than you have before, it can be daunting at first.  </p> <p>These affirmations are here to support you through this time.  </p> <p>Maybe there’s some fear about how people are going to perceive you stepping into this new iteration of yourself, or fear of the unknown… These affirmations are here to support you in knowing that not only is it safe for you to evolve,  but that it is your divine birthright and Dharma (Soul’s purpose). </p> <p>So, if you have felt the call to embody the multidimensional aspects of yourself lately but something has been holding you back, take a deep breath in, and tune in.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you often find yourself in an internal battle between whether you should be doing more, or being more?</p> <p>It’s like when you’re meditating, all you can think about is your to-do list. But when you’re doing, you’re freaking exhausted and can’t wait to take a bath.</p> <p>Why do we believe it’s one or the other?</p> <p>The truth is, your highest form of expression comes when you merge doing and being as one. This is what I call your “sacred doing.”</p> <p>In this episode, I share my own realization coming out of the hustle mentality and realizing my greatest creations come when I’m being. This completely changed the energy from which I expressed my soul’s purpose, and even this podcast.</p> <p>I discuss how your soul’s purpose actually isn’t something you strive for or need to figure out, but rather what naturally arises from a state of being. That doesn’t mean checking out and doing nothing with your life.</p> <p>It means all that you create comes from the intentional place of wholeness. This episode will feel like an exhale and allow you to release all the tension you may unknowingly be holding onto around “figuring out” your dharma and will allow you to rest into your soul’s purpose.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been in a situation that caused you to get EXTREMELY anxious, trying to do everything possible under your power to try to fix it? You can’t even think about anything other than this issue and it’s getting in the way of you thinking clearly, sleeping or enjoying life.</p> <p>Or maybe you’ve been in a situation where you just shut down. You don’t even know what to do and feel complete apathy. It feels so far out of your control, you give up. You may even find yourself disassociating and not even knowing who you are and why you’re here.</p> <p>These are two different states of the nervous system - sympathetic and dorsal.</p> <p>In this episode, I sit down with Polyvagal trained Somatic Practitioner Sarah Baldwin to really dive into the states of our nervous systems and recognizing where our imbalances occur and why. This is a powerful episode to truly understand your body’s response in a deeper way, which brings about a great deal of compassion for WHY you feel the way that you do.</p> <p>I truly believe somatics + nervous system healing are the missing links of our mental health system and this episode is a must-listen to anyone who is ready to step into deeper levels of healing - both for themselves and for the planet.</p> <p>Connect with Sarah at http://www.sarahbaldwincoaching.com</p> <p>Connect with your body’s wisdom with my free Goddess Embodiment Practice free at http://www.rosegoldgoddesses.com/embodiment</p> <p>Ready to integrate your full multidimensional self into a thriving career as a Soul Purpose + Spiritual Life Coach?

You don’t even know what to do and feel complete apathy. It feels so far out of your control, you give up. You may even find yourself disassociating and not even knowing who you are and why you’re here.</p> <p>These are two different states of the nervous system - sympathetic and dorsal.</p> <p>In this episode, I sit down with Polyvagal trained Somatic Practitioner Sarah Baldwin to really dive into the states of our nervous systems and recognizing where our imbalances occur and why. This is a powerful episode to truly understand your body’s response in a deeper way, which brings about a great deal of compassion for WHY you feel the way that you do.</p> <p>I truly believe somatics + nervous system healing are the missing links of our mental health system and this episode is a must-listen to anyone who is ready to step into deeper levels of healing - both for themselves and for the planet.</p> <p>Connect with Sarah at http://www.sarahbaldwincoaching.com</p> <p>Connect with your body’s wisdom with my free Goddess Embodiment Practice free at http://www.rosegoldgoddesses.com/embodiment</p> <p>Ready to integrate your full multidimensional self into a thriving career as a Soul Purpose + Spiritual Life Coach?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re anything like me, you’ve been feeling a lot of anger recently with the blatant infringement on our human rights that has occurred. And this anger isn’t new. It’s deep, ancient, primal, the screams of our grandmothers who never got to choose, whose wombs were a commodity, whose worth was based on who they could birth. We’ve had enough and today, we rise. In this conversation, I sit with mystic poet Maya Luna to discuss divine feminine rage and how we can connect with it, despite our fear. We discuss toxic femininity and how we can find it within ourselves. We dive into the wounds of the patriarchy and within it, share our art. You will want to sit with this episode in sacred space because it is potent, transformative and deep. And a conversation that needs to be had. We invite you to sit with us and reclaim the divine feminine rage within you. She is ready for change and respect.</p> <p>Listen to Maya’s Poetry here: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4F3qNrjVBCjwd43Z2Fozi6 and connect with her here: https://www.deepfemininemysteryschool.com/</p> <p>Connect with your body’s wisdom with my free Goddess Embodiment Practice free at http://www.rosegoldgoddesses.com/embodiment</p> <p>Try Betterhelp for 10% off at <a href= "http://www.betterhelp.com/sahara">www.betterhelp.com/sahara</a></p> <p>*As a BetterHelp affiliate, we may receive compensation from BetterHelp if you purchase products or services through the links provided</p> <p>Intro + Outro Music: Silent Ganges by Maneesh de Moor</p> <p>Follow me your spiritual bestie to active your fullest expression + laugh along the way:<br /> Instagram.com/iamsahararose<br /> TikTok: @iamsahararose<br /> Facebook.com/iamsahararose<br /> + Twitter.com/iamsahararose</p> <p>Order My Books: www.iamsahararose.com/books</p> <p>By accessing this Podcast, I acknowledge that the entire contents are the property of Sahara Rose, or used by Sahara Rose with permission, and are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you feel bloated and like you aren’t digesting anything? Maybe you are gassy or constipated, or the food is going right through you? I recently shared my own digestive issues on my IG stories and was floored by 95% of people following me also experiencing them! I knew something bigger is up. In this episode, I sit down with Mind-Body Connection expert Nate Ortiz to discuss how our digestive and hormonal issues are linked to deeper spiritual causes and suppressed trauma, which we are especially sensitive to as empaths. Nate shares his incredible story from growing up around drugs, gang violence and poverty and even experiencing homelessness throughout his childhood, to overcoming adversities, healing his trauma and helping others heal theirs through his psychosomatic approach. This episode blew me away and is one you will want to listen to again because it is JAM-PACKED with wisdom. I’m also glad to say since being coached by Nate, I have noticed enormous differences in my digestion and body and learned SO much about myself. Let’s dive in!</p> <p>Connect with Nate on Tiktok here: https://www.tiktok.com/@begreatwithnate?lang=en and Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/begreatwitnate</p> <p>Book a session with him at https:/BegreatWithNate.com</p> <p>Join my Free Discover Your Soul Purpose Masterclass at www.iamsahararose.com/masterclass</p> <p>Intro + Outro Music: Silent Ganges by Maneesh de Moor</p> <p>Follow me your spiritual bestie to active your fullest expression + laugh along the way:<br /> Instagram.com/iamsahararose<br /> TikTok: @iamsahararose<br /> Facebook.com/iamsahararose<br /> + Twitter.com/iamsahararose</p> <p>Order My Books: www.iamsahararose.com/books</p> <p>By accessing this Podcast, I acknowledge that the entire contents are the property of Sahara Rose, or used by Sahara Rose with permission, and are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When I was 7 years old, my cousins thought it would be funny to show me Nightmare on Elm Street, the horror film with Freddy Kreuger.

I discuss how our minds don’t know the difference between what we are watching vs what we are in (hence why the porn industry is so big), how our thoughts become our beliefs which become our actions which become our realities and why the scenes from these movies/ shows will last in your subconscious for a lifetime.</p> <p>If you’ve been realizing that you just feel off after watching these movies/ shows and you haven’t been able to quite put it into words, this episode is for you.

			<description><![CDATA[Did you know that creativity and sexuality are both related to your life force energy? In this episode, I sit down with renowned poet Adam Roa to discuss the creative process. He shares his 4 step approach to creativity and how we can overcome the fear of vulnerability in sharing our story. We then dive into his lessons learned from a 10-year relationship break-up and going to sex camp and how our shame of sexuality keeps us hidden in our creativity. We then discuss some real talk about relationships between spiritual women and men and why sometimes they don’t work. We talk about polyamory and how to know whether it’s right for you. He also shares two powerful poems for us on self love and lessons learned in love. Get ready for a heart-opening and creative boosting conversation! <p>Connect with Adam at adamroa.com</p> <p>Doors are opening back up for Dharma Coaching Institute to become a Certified Soul Purpose/ Spiritual Life Coach this March!

These triggers come from traumas, both big T and little t, and only through diving into our own healing journey can we bring them into healing.</p> <p>In this powerful episode, I sit with best-selling author and dear friend Gabby Bernstein as she vulnerably shares how she realized her drug/ alcohol/ work addictions all stemmed from a childhood trauma she experienced that caused her nervous system to cope through hypervigilance.</p> <p>She then shares the most transformative tools she found to heal from these triggers and restore inner peace within her being. We also discuss how often spiritual people may bypass their own emotional healing and how important this part of the journey is. I also share an awakening moment I had through the book about my childhood and relationship with my father, which led to me diving deeper into my own healing journey. This is a deep conversation and one that just may change your life.</p> <p>Get Gabby’s new book Happy Days here.</p> <p>Doors open this Friday for Dharma Coaching Institute!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Writing a book is amazing AND extremely confronting and challenging. In this episode, I sit with one of my besties to talk about it ALL– the excitement, the nervousness, the fears. We get REAL over the behind-the-scenes of writing and launching a book that every author I know has experienced but people really don’t talk about online. We share the lessons we’ve both learned, the challenge in sharing your story when other people are involved and getting over the shame of revealing parts of your past that don’t represent you today. I share about what it was like to write about my story with my family in Discover Your Dharma. Rosie speaks about n the brink of launching her first book, You Are Radically Loved, and the full spectrum of emotions that comes up right before you’re launching your book into the world- quite similar to having a baby! You hear both of our very authentic perspectives to just cue you in on the behind-the-scenes initiation of writing a book.

In this episode, I asked him your questions (and ones he’s never been asked before!) We were actually LAUGHING the whole time!

I thoroughly enjoyed my time with him and his light, humorous energy, despite tackling some of the world’s most major problems and I know you will enjoy witnessing this side of him too.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Your soul’s purpose is your divine calling, your energetic frequency, the big reason why you are here. In this meditation, I will be speaking directly to your highest self, the part of you that remembers.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Back at it this week with demystifying another “spiritual word” people hear, misunderstand then use as a dagger to throw at others who aren’t like them. Toxic positivity. The western world is obsessed with using clinical terms to describe people and often creates more labeling, judgment and division through it. This is another example of that. In this episode I share how the term actually makes no sense, the various forms of healing across culture outside of the Western model, the privilege to even let yourself FEEL sad, cancel culture and what the term was *meant* to mean, which is only something you can dictate for yourself.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, frazzled and in complete despair with the state of the world right now, that’s because your nervous system wasn't designed to know about everything going on across the planet. We have never known about every war, famine, natural disaster, disease or conflict happening in all parts of the world and our minds cannot even begin to comprehend it. In this episode, I share how we were designed to only be aware of our local surroundings and how the state of the media has us in a constant state of overwhelm, without the following peace. I also share two powerful tips to help you move out of despair and into action to truly make a difference in this world in the way you were born to share. This is a powerful episode to reactive your soul and share with others similarly feeling this.</p> <p>Doors are open this week only to Rose Gold Goddesses, my divine feminine mystery school, for a transformational year of embodiment, expression, intuition, womb wisdom + joy.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever watched the movie The Secret? For many it was their opening into spirituality and Law of Attraction, and for others it was very triggering!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re into Ayurveda, dharma, goddesses, yoga shakti, kundalini, meditation and all things Vedic-- you gotta learn about Vedic astrology! It’s the sister science of these practices and the word Jyotish means “the science of the stars.” Jyotish is the eldest form of astrology and accounts for the Earth’s shift in its axis, which Western astrology did not, therefore it measures where the planets and constellations actually are in the sky today. I have found it extremely accurate and helpful in my journey and wanted to share one of the world’s top Vedic Astrologers and Ayurvedic Doctors, as well as a dear mentor of mine Dr. Suhas with my Highest Self Podcast community.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How has your relationship with your sensuality and sexuality been this quarantine? For many of us, not great.

We speak about redefining the word “holy,” communicating your sexual needs + preferences with your partner, the misunderstanding that Buddhism is all about dropping your desires and how your desires are actually pointing you to your highest spiritual embodiment. From breast worshipping to fantasies, we talk about it ALL in this adult’s only episode!</p> <p>Check out her book Desire: https://amzn.to/2WCuLiH</p> <p>Dive into into your sacred alchemy, divine feminine mystic magick and making your life your ceremony this month with our Goddess Isis in RoseGoldGoddesses.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The word “spiritual bypass” has been coming up a lot with recent events and I wanted to dedicate a podcast all about what this word means.

No judgement—just knowledge!</p> <p>Being part of a conscious online community is more important than ever before. Leave your anxiety behind and get the support, connection and inspiration your soul has been craving in Rose Gold Goddesses, the sacred sisterhood all about becoming your highest self.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When we are in fear, we tense up our root chakra, which is related to survival. We feel unsafe, anxious and disconnected from our bodies and Earth (hence the global rush for toilet paper.) In this episode, I talk about why it’s more important than ever before to get into your lower chakras through dance and how dance is the ultimate healer.</p> <p>I speak about the three lower chakras (root, sacral and solar plexus) and their associated dance forms. I also speak about why shaking and twerking is SO crucial for your well-being and why there is such shame around it. Come join me, Goddesses!</p> <p>If you’re ready to join a sisterhood of 2000+ spiritual soul sisters ready to twerk into the new paradigm, come join me in Rose Gold Goddesses, the sacred sisterhood all about becoming your highest self.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When I was 23-years-old I attended Malaika’s African dance class and knew I needed to learn from her. I trained under her in 5Elements Shamanic Dance Activation and she has remained a dear friend and mentor since. In this episode, we dive deep into connecting with Earth, our womb and our bodies during this time.</p> <p>We address the fears and concerns that are arising and why it’s more important than ever we tune into our bodies to feel what feels resonant for us. She then guides us through a meditation to connect to our wombs and anchor into our internal feminine energy. Malaika’s episodes are always amongst my favorite and I’m so glad to have her here on the podcast for the third time.</p> <p>Connect with Malaika at inmyelements.com/</p> <p>Being part of a conscious online community is more important than ever before. Leave your anxiety behind and get the support, connection and inspiration your soul has been craving in Rose Gold Goddesses, the sacred sisterhood all about becoming your highest self.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Why do we eat Ayurvedically? Why do we take care of our bodies? What is the POINT of all this self-care and wellness rituals? To become your highest self. In this straight-to-the-heart episode, I share my philosophy on how health is not the end-goal but rather a means to the end. That end point is your Dharma-- living out your life purpose.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>About four years ago, I bought a one-way ticket to Bali with no idea what to expect but knowing I needed a massive change in my life. I wasn't happy with the direction my life was going and knew there was something more to this human experience, but had no idea what that is (listen all about that part of my life in episode 41.) While studying African dance in Ubud, I met a woman named Malaika. I was enamored by her fierce warrior goddess-like energy and her ability to connect the spiritual with the Earth's wisdom. When I found out she had a 5 Elements Shamanic Dance Activation Facilitator Training Certification, I had to sign up. I ended up working for her to pay for some of it because I had no money to my name but I knew I needed to learn from her.</p> <p>Flash forward four years and everything I had set out for myself has come true, from writing books to being a spiritual teacher. All of this comes back to the foundation work I set in those years, connecting to my body's wisdom and the elements. I am so honored to introduce my teacher, Shaman Malaika Darville, to the Highest Self Podcast. Malaika brings a wealth of earth wisdom having walked the shamanic path for a lifetime.</p> <p>Across the globe, she is known for her ability to re-connect individuals with their inner body spirituality, helping all who practice with her to access to higher realms of consciousness and authenticity. Committed to personal and planetary awakening, Malaika works with the cardinal directions and elements EARTH, WATER, FIRE and AIR. Malaika founded the 5Elements Dance Activaton™ after receiving the gift of the 5th Element ETHER or SPACE during her yoga teacher training and Ayurvedic studies.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About four years ago, I bought a one-way ticket to Bali with no idea what to expect but knowing I needed a massive change in my life. I wasn't happy with the direction my life was going and knew there was something more to this human experience, but had no idea what that is (listen all about that part of my life in episode 41.) While studying African dance in Ubud, I met a woman named Malaika. I was enamored by her fierce warrior goddess-like energy and her ability to connect the spiritual with the Earth's wisdom. When I found out she had a 5 Elements Shamanic Dance Activation Facilitator Training Certification, I had to sign up. I ended up working for her to pay for some of it because I had no money to my name but I knew I needed to learn from her.</p> <p>Flash forward four years and everything I had set out for myself has come true, from writing books to being a spiritual teacher. All of this comes back to the foundation work I set in those years, connecting to my body's wisdom and the elements. I am so honored to introduce my teacher, Shaman Malaika Darville, to the Highest Self Podcast. Malaika brings a wealth of earth wisdom having walked the shamanic path for a lifetime.</p> <p>Across the globe, she is known for her ability to re-connect individuals with their inner body spirituality, helping all who practice with her to access to higher realms of consciousness and authenticity. Committed to personal and planetary awakening, Malaika works with the cardinal directions and elements EARTH, WATER, FIRE and AIR. Malaika founded the 5Elements Dance Activaton™ after receiving the gift of the 5th Element ETHER or SPACE during her yoga teacher training and Ayurvedic studies.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What's keeping you back from living the life you want? For most of us, it's finances. In this episode, I get real with you. Money is the thing that's blocking most of us from having the freedom, education, wellness, travel experience, mental peace and opportunities we so badly desire. There is nothing "unspiritual" about talking about money-- in fact, in order to take care of ourselves and help others, we need it.</p> <p>I share: 1. Why financial self-care needs to be part of our self-care routine 2. Exercise to go back to your oldest memory with money 3. MY oldest memory with money and why I learned young that if you want to choose the ice-cream flavor, you need the dough 4. Why abundance is a mindset 5. The laws of money and the things we are doing that are holding back our flow 6. Why spiritual people need to get more comfortable with thinking about their finances-- and how that's the very thing holding many of us back 7. Why playing small is keeping your impact small 8. The very big thing I did to celebrate my abundance and how it has forever changed my life (and the lives of others) Take your notepads out-- this episode is one you will want to relisten to!</p> <p>Share your #financialselfcare practices on Instagram and tag @iamsahararose to be featured on my story!</p> <p>Be part of a community that supports you discovering your dharma in Rose Gold Goddesses, the sacred sisterhood collective with community, content, creativity and so much more — learn more about rosegoldgoddesses.com.</p> <p>Sponsor a Cambodian child and make a life-changing difference in an entire family's life with cambodianchildrensfund.org<br /> <br /></p> <p>Intro + Outro Music: Silent Ganges by Maneesh de Moor</p> <p>Discover your Dharma with my free quiz at https://iamsahararose.com/</p> <p>Connect with me for daily Ayurvedic and modern spiritual wisdom at: Instagram.com/iamsahararose<br /> Facebook.com/iamsahararose Twitter.com/iamsahararose</p> <p>Order My Books Eat Feel Fresh + Idiot's Guide to Ayurveda: https://www.iamsahararose.com/books</p> <p>By accessing this Podcast, I acknowledge that the entire contents are the property of Sahara Rose, or used by Sahara Rose with permission, and are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws.
