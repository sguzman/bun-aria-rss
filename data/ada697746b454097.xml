			<title><![CDATA[Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed | One Minute Book Review ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>What’s your relationship with failure like? Do you accept it as part of the process of progression or does it debilitate you?</p>
<p>This a question many of us ask ourselves when we inevitably encounter failure. We either use it as a learning opportunity or we become entrenched in our ways of thinking blaming everyone else for the failure. 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>This book examines many different concepts, such as cognitive dissonance, defining failure and achieving small steps over giant leaps. It’s one of the rare books that I read that leaves me questioning many different elements not only of myself but of society as a whole.</p>
<p>How can we all take more responsibility for the role that we have in society and apply these principles to create a better society? I do believe it is by constantly seeking the correct ways of improvement as this book suggests on multiple occasions. But it is also changing the stigma behind failure. Not as a badge of negative connotation, but instead of honour knowing that the same mistake can be prevented in the future. 📚</p>
<p>Another great book that I have read that I recommend. It seems every book I am reading at the moment is 💯.</p>
<p>Appreciate @matthewsyedauthor for writing this, I look forward to reading your other work as well. 👍📚</p>
<p>Have you read this? If so, what were your thoughts? 📚</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Dare To Lead by Brene Brown | One Minute Book Review]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I had heard so much about this book that I almost felt obliged to read it. As you can tell from the amount of highlights in this post, the book wasn’t my cup of tea. (British slang) ☕️</p>
<p>The book focuses on how we can become more open with how we engage with our colleagues at work. It defines the differences between armoured and daring leadership for us to put into practise.</p>
<p>The main issue I had with the book is it wasn’t saying anything original. This is partly due to the subject matter not being revolutionary and my experience with reading around this topic. But I felt the points weren’t expressed in a way that suited my liking. 📚</p>
<p>Even so I do think the book can provide value for anyone wanting to become more vulnerable and open with their interactions at work or elsewhere. 👍</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Essentialism by Greg McKeown | One Minute Book Review ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>💬 What is an ‘essentialist’? &nbsp;&nbsp;An essentialist is someone who can decipher the difference between what is truly important and what is not. Often in life we focus on the things that are not important, substituting them for the things that are. 🤔 &nbsp;&nbsp;This is usually not because we choose to. But rather than we have not been trained to think as essentialists. Becoming an essentialists, whether at home, school or work, is an active choice we make daily. It is making the decision to only do the things that give YOU the most value. 😊 &nbsp;&nbsp;My personal journey to becoming more of an essentialist started when I read this book a couple of years ago. Since then I have been actively making choices to choose the things that give me the most value. I still fail from time to time, but the self-awareness of actively asking yourself these questions transforms your life. 💯 &nbsp;&nbsp;This is the value of re-reading books. The ideas remain true but provide more value as you spend more time acting out the principles in your life. 👍📚 &nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you to @greg for sending me his book and I can’t wait to discuss it more next week on @book podcast. &nbsp;Thank you for watching this video.

			<title><![CDATA[Think Like A Monk by Jay Shetty | One Minute Book Review]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>💬 Are you a @jayshetty fan? &nbsp;&nbsp;Confession, I never really knew who Jay was prior to reading his book. I had seen some clips but didn’t know much about his philosophy. So as soon as his book came out I was intrigued to read his thoughts on life and specifically on being a monk. 🤔 &nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the book didn’t provide that much value for me. However, it is full of wonderful insights. 👍 &nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly enjoyed the section on detachment as I believe we could all be a lot more fulfilled if we detached from this world. Specifically he quotes Imam Ali which made me appreciate his research when writing this book. But this was also the reason why it didn’t provide much value for me. 🙏 &nbsp;&nbsp;When you have an existing religious and spiritual framework that encapsulates how to live properly, it’s difficult for anyone to write something that can add anything more onto it. That’s how I felt reading this book. The points were wonderful and clear, it was thought provoking and definitely can change many people’s lives. However, for anyone who has studied religion they will know most of these principles. 📚 &nbsp;&nbsp;Who is this book for? Well, I think it’s for those that are looking for a framework for how to live that don’t already have one. I am a big believer in religion and spiritually so this book could lead people down that path. For anyone who is already made that commitment this could be an interesting read, but I can’t see it providing too much additional value. ❤️ &nbsp;&nbsp;My assessment of @jayshetty is that I like the message he is presenting and commend him for the work he has done. But, it’s diffcult to encapsulate so much into one book while making it detailed. Nevertheless, it’s valuable for a certain demographic. 👍📚 &nbsp;&nbsp;💬 Comment below if you have read this book or if you’re planning to read it! &nbsp;Thank you for watching this video.

			<title><![CDATA[Love Is Just Damn Good Business by Steve Farber | One Minute Book Review]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Is there a place for love in business? &nbsp;We have been conditioned to believe that love does not have a place in business. Love is reserved solely for our personal relationships. But why can this not be extended into the business world? This is what ‘Love Is Just Damn Good Business’ by @steve.farber examines. &nbsp;&nbsp;Using Steve’s LEAP framework (Love, Energy, Audacity and Proof) we are better able to understand why love rules above the rest. The book is full of practical examples about how we can increase our self-awareness of not only how we define love but also how to create this for ourselves. The book makes us recondition how we define love in the business world. To care for your staff, customers and the community is to love your business as well as value its ability to make money. For the individual it is asking how they want to fulfil their potential. It starts with asking the right questions. Rather than asking, “What’s my passion?” ask “What gives me purpose?”. This slight change in phraseology has a huge impact on our ability to cultivate our passion. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why I like this book is because it affirms a pre-existing idea that I subscribe to. That idea is that passions aren’t found they are created. Only through diligent and persistent action can you cultivate a passion that lasts. Most people sit back and wait for their passions to find them, however often it is due to a lack of action that they cannot find it. &nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the ideal reader for this book is a business leader or an ambitious employee. Whether you run a large corporate organisation, a small start-up or you just entered the job market, having an awareness of how love ( I prefer the use of kindness) determines the longevity of business is crucial. This book also has similarities to ‘The Thank You Economy’ by @garyvee, so I would definitely check out that book as well if you’re interested in this topic. &nbsp;Comment below if you believe love has a place in the business world? &nbsp;Thank you for watching this video.

			<title><![CDATA[Indistractable by Nir Eyal | One Minute Book Review ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>💬How do you control distractions? Are they inherently bad, or are good distractions necessary?</p>
<p>When I think about answering these questions I am left wondering whether there is a concrete answer that is applicable to everyone. Like much of the literature surrounding habits and productivity, it is inherently linked to the type of individual you want to become. Those that read and choose to make adjustments are those that are wanting to make changes in order to achieve their work and personal goals. 📚</p>
<p>Simply put I liked this book for that reason. The author makes it known that we are all susceptible for distraction. Whether it be our phones, computers, TV or any mundane activity, there are distractions lurking at everyone corner. It is too simplistic to simply blame social media, as many commentators do. They request that you immediately delete all accounts and recede to a life of solitude in the forest. For many that is not the goal. The goal is to have a healthy relationship with technology so that it can benefit our career and personal life. 👥</p>
<p>‘Indistractable’ by @nir.eyal teaches us how we can form a better relationship with distractions. The book has similarities with other productivity books such ‘Deep Work’ by Cal Newport and ‘Atomic Habits’ by James Clear in emphasising the importance of time-blocking for distraction free work and environmental design to ensure a positive mental approach to work. 😀</p>
<p>Concise chapter summaries and a wide range of examples made this book not only easy to read, but full of insightful information that I could deploy immediately after finishing the book. If you like reading about productivity and human behaviour I would definitely recommend this book. 👍📚</p>
<p>🎥 The video review will be out tomorrow.</p>
<p>———————</p>
<p>5 Principles I learnt from this book</p>
<p>1️⃣ Analyse how you spend your time and when you are most productive. Block out all your time both for work and distractions to ensure you’re creating the maximal benefit to you and your family.</p>
<p>2️⃣ There is not right balance, there is only what works for you. Don’t feel pressured to create a schedule loaded with work just because others are doing the same. Ask yourself what you find valuable and construct your diary accordingly.</p>
<p>3️⃣ Organise your devices. Something I have done in the past is organise my devices and declutter apps I don’t use and turn off notifications. This is done with the intention of ensuring minimal distraction.</p>
<p>4️⃣ Use others for help. We cannot change inherent traits and habits without the help of those close to us. Use relationship and financial pacts wisely to create maximal chances for positive change.</p>
<p>5️⃣ Schedule in specific time for distractions. We only schedule in time for productive work tasks, but there is value in doing the opposite as well. It ensures that we are becoming maximally efficient with our time without sacrificing the things we also enjoy.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Concise chapter summaries and a wide range of examples made this book not only easy to read, but full of insightful information that I could deploy immediately after finishing the book. If you like reading about productivity and human behaviour I would definitely recommend this book. 👍📚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🎥 The video review will be out tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Principles I learnt from this book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ Analyse how you spend your time and when you are most productive. Block out all your time both for work and distractions to ensure you’re creating the maximal benefit to you and your family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2️⃣ There is not right balance, there is only what works for you. Don’t feel pressured to create a schedule loaded with work just because others are doing the same. Ask yourself what you find valuable and construct your diary accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3️⃣ Organise your devices. Something I have done in the past is organise my devices and declutter apps I don’t use and turn off notifications. This is done with the intention of ensuring minimal distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4️⃣ Use others for help. We cannot change inherent traits and habits without the help of those close to us. Use relationship and financial pacts wisely to create maximal chances for positive change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5️⃣ Schedule in specific time for distractions. We only schedule in time for productive work tasks, but there is value in doing the opposite as well. It ensures that we are becoming maximally efficient with our time without sacrificing the things we also enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman | One Minute Book Review]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Why do we think the way we do? Is our thinking determined by cultural and societal factors or are we true independent thinkers? 🤔 &nbsp;This is what Nobel Prize winning Daniel Kahneman explores in this book. 🤓 &nbsp;The essence of the book is focussed on analysing the differences between the two systems of the mind. System 1 requires little cognitive energy and is automatic. Whereas System 2 requires more cognitive energy. When we look at analysing our thoughts and behaviours we can derive the origins to one of these two systems. 🧠 &nbsp;The book goes on to talk about behavioural heuristics and biases and how and why we make choices. The book is research heavy and can be quite technical to understand when reading it. I would say for beginner readers this wouldn’t be a great book to read because I found myself confused on multiple occasions whilst reading the book. Also, there were not practical frameworks that we could derive from the book. It read more like an elongated peer reviewed journal than a good storytelling narrative. It was nonetheless interesting and a lot to learn from. 📚📚 &nbsp;💬 Let is know in the comments if you have read this and what you thought. &nbsp;https://www.ombrclub.com/</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you read a book and it changes your perspective this is one of those books. 📚 &nbsp;Too often we become entrenched in ways of thinking that have little or no substantial data to back them up. Whether you’re a subject matter expert or not, sometimes we can become so bogged down in the weeds we forget to look up every once in a while. 🤷‍♂️ &nbsp;This books addresses why this is the case. It doesn’t place blames an individuals and systems, but explains that there are instincts within all of us regardless of our relative intelligence that makes us blind to seeing the big picture of what is actually going on. 📚 &nbsp;I couldn’t recommend this book more highly to anyone who is looking for an interesting assessment of human psychology as well as learning a lot about how our world is progressing! 📚🙏</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When we think about defining our career it is easy to get confined by an existing structure. What if we could breakaway and start to design our own career? This is what this book is about. &nbsp;&nbsp;‘The Squiggly Career’ by {insert names} describes that by taking advantage of 5 key career skills, you can put yourself in a position to start designing your own career. These 5 are: &nbsp;1️⃣ Super Strengths &nbsp;2️⃣ Values &nbsp;3️⃣ Confidence &nbsp;&nbsp;4️⃣ Networks &nbsp;5️⃣ Future Possibilities &nbsp;The book is interactive. When you read through the book there are exercises that provide supplementation to the ideas in the book and make you more involved in the reading process. 📚 &nbsp;Honestly, I don’t think this book is aimed at me. As I have only been in the working world for 4 years and looking to start my own business, I have a clear goal on my future as I have used the principles laid out in this book before such as vision boards etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say the book doesn’t have value! For anyone that is looking to create a new career for themselves, regardless of their experience, this book is definitely for you. The interactive nature of the book makes it easy to digest and makes you engrain the ideas into practise which is the most important thing. If you fall into this category then I would definitely recommend this book for you. 👍</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Rare Breed by Sunny Bonnell and Ashleigh Hansberger | One Minute Book Review]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>💬 What does it mean to be a ‘Rare Breed’?</p>
<p>We often are told to conform in most avenues of our life. Whether at school or work, there are norms which often stop us from becoming our unique selves. However, there are some norms that can be broken and this is what this book shows us. 📚</p>
<p>In order to innovate and be truly unique we have to find our voice. This means stepping off the bandwagon of what others are doing and becoming a unique voice. 🗣</p>
<p>The book is split into 7 virtues of a ‘Rare Breed’:</p>
<p>1️⃣ Rebellious</p>
<p>2️⃣ Audacious</p>
<p>3️⃣ Obsessed</p>
<p>4️⃣ Hot-blooded</p>
<p>5️⃣ Weird</p>
<p>6️⃣ Hypnotic</p>
<p>7️⃣ Emotional</p>
<p>All of these virtues when combined present a challenge to anyone who wants to confront you. 📚</p>
<p>This book is for someone who is looking for a reason to find their own voice. The book is full of examples of individuals who used ingenuity, passion and persistence to create a life that they wanted. That possibility is available to most if you’re able to use your own virtues to their potential! 📚</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Mark Manson&apos;s second book that explores the idea around struggle and hope. I think this book is a bit repetitive with his first book, but good for individuals who are beginners. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fshow%2F7cMGOYMqPNKrt4P67MEAOH&amp;amp;v=1q8bmuSt0zM&amp;amp;redir_token=qdelwizv7mP5Zo7MBE_AUufzgGR8MTU5NDIxMTk4MkAxNTk0MTI1NTgy&amp;amp;event=video_description&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman | One Minute Book Review]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>💬 Does entertainment come at price?</p>
<p>It would be easy to say that entertainment comes at the expense of time in the present for something that could be done which is more productive. But in the wider sense, when does entertainment become a vice or barrier to how we actually see the world. 🤔</p>
<p>This is the question that I have been asking myself after finishing this book. 📚</p>
<p>The book gives an honest assesment on the impact that the television had on American society 35 years ago. But, the repercussions of its effects are still being felt today. It’s intereting when reading this book to see what impact it’s actually had on how we see truth. 📖</p>
<p>I would say that this book is challenging. Not only in its language but in its ideas. It’s a complex read that requires your full attention, but if you’re willing to take the leap then it’s full of ensightful arguments. 👍📚</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Al Reis and Jack Trout | One Minute Book Review]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Who has read any marketing books?</p>
<p>I finished reading the ‘22 Immutable Laws of Marketing’ today. It was not a long book at all (132 pages) but gave a good indication about what makes a good marketing strategy. 📈</p>
<p>As someone who doesn’t know much about marketing theory is proved to be an insightful book. The 22 laws seemed reasonable given the book was written 27 years ago, the principles seem to be relevant today on face value. 📚</p>
<p>This book would be good for someone who doesn’t know much about marketing (like me) as an introductory read. But would also be good for anyone who knows the current market and wants to use it as a comparison. 👍📚</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>💬 Who wants to improve their writing?</p>
<p>If yes, ‘The Art of Writing’ by Peter Yang is a great book for you. It simply explains how we can become better writers. The book is split into 4 main principles:</p>
<p>1️⃣ Economy</p>
<p>2️⃣ Transparency</p>
<p>3️⃣ Variety</p>
<p>4️⃣ Harmony</p>
<p>They all work together to make you a better writer. For anyone who wants to improve their writing I recommend this book! 👍📚</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy | One Minute Book Review ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>💬 Have you read this book?</p>
<p>The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy</p>
<p>Overall I enjoyed reading this book. I had many people recommending it to me and I also wanted to know more about the subject. The book starts off with explaining the differences between the conscious and the subconscious mind. From there the author explains across multiple chapters how we can explore the full potential of our subconscious mind. It was a bit repetitive but still holds some value. 👍📚</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Hello and welcome to One Minute Book review, the show that brings books to life, I am your host Aun Abdi. 

Today I will be reviewing 'Can't Hurt Me' by David Goggins. An honest, insightful and at times shocking self-assessment of his own life. David Goggins gives a brief account of how he became a Navy Seal, Army Ranger and Ultra-Athlete. In the book, David provides a full explanation of the obstacles he had to overcome and mental fortitude he needed to reach his goals at every step of the way. The author details his early life explaining the harsh realities of Seal training while not holding back in defining what it takes to be the best version of yourself. The honesty and openness are what I enjoyed about this book the most.  It would have been easy for the author to list all of his achievements without detailing the hardships, but in showing his vulnerability, it makes the book more captivating and makes the reader more engaged. I would encourage all to listen to the audiobook as it provides a different perspective that the written book cannot — a great read. 

This has been One Minute Book Review, thanks for listening.

			<title><![CDATA[Maps Of Meaning by Jordan B Peterson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today I will be reviewing 'Maps of Meaning' by Jordan B. Peterson. Deriving meaning from the world around us is what enables us to live the life that we choose. In this book, Peterson explores how we have formulated maps during our existence to create meaning. The central proponent of the book is that myth creates an action which creates a language which we can then derive meaning. The author focuses heavily on the power of ancient myth in exploring how we have obtained meaning in the past. An in-depth exploration of the Mesopotamian derivation of how myth constituted the formation civilisations where our actions could accurately define the world around us, is explained in this book. The book is complicated and requires the full attention of the reader. It is full of complicated concepts that will need re-reading at times. However, if you want to explore the power of how we create meaning from the past as well as the world around us, I suggest you read this book.

			<title><![CDATA[The Art Of War by Sun Tzu]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today I will be reviewing 'The Art of War' by Sun Tzu. War is not as common in comparison to our recent history, but that does not mean we can't use the strategies of war in today's world. The Art of War uses adages formed in poetic nature to explain the essential points of tactics in war. The book explains the role of general, the anticipation of enemy tactics and the provision of one's army to lead to victory, as well as many other points. What I found interesting was the emphasis on the role of the leader as the focal point in the army no matter the size. This emphasis can have application in all areas of life and can serve as tactics to lead if you read in between the lines. It is a short book, so it is accessible to all and will teach you both strategic and leadership qualities to look out for no matter what you do. The universality of this book makes it a must-read.

			<title><![CDATA[Understanding Human Nature by Alfred Adler]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today I will be reviewing 'Understanding Human Nature' by Alfred Adler. Alfred Adler is among one of the most influential behavioural psychologists of his time. In this book, Adler assesses the factors that determine human nature to understand them more clearly. The topics analysed range from the concept of the soul to feelings of inferiority and characterization during the initial years of life. The complexity of his arguments is something to admire. The majority of is arguments are observational and still remain relevant to this day. What I liked about this book was the ascent from the inner soul to how we can conduct ourselves in the book, as well as prominent topics in between. The complexity of the Adler's explanations matches the language used. For this reason, if you're new to Adlerian psychology, it is better to read a commentary rather than this book. However, if you would like to challenge yourself, then I suggest you read this to broaden your understanding of Adlerian psychology.

			<title><![CDATA[October and November Book Review Recap]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Hello, I am your host Aun Abdi and welcome to the monthly One Minute Book Review podcast, where I break down in more detail the books that I have read and reviewed in the previous month. 

I have done something different for this month's recap episode. I didn't have the opportunity to record for October, so I have decided to combine both October and November for a longer extended podcast.

Those books are: 'How to Write Your Book Without A Fuss' by Lucy McCarragher and Joe Gregory; 'Letters From A Stoic' by Seneca; 'Small Giants' by Bo Burlingham; 'Start Now, Get Perfect Later' by Rob Moore; 'The Courage To Be Disliked' by Ichiro Kishimi and lastly 'Financial Intelligence' by Karen Berman and Joe Gregory.

			<title><![CDATA[Financial Intelligence by Karen Berman and Joe Knight]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today I will be reviewing 'Financial Intelligence' by Karen Berman and Joe Knight. Being financially literate is rare in our world. We are taught many things in school, but only accountants and finance experts know this information in the business world. This book aims to solve that problem. It focusses on explaining critical financial concepts such as the purpose of the profit and loss sheet, balance sheet and cash flow, as well as their relationship to one another. The topics are not too tough as the authors do not go into a lot of depth, but for a beginner, it may take some time to understand. Nevertheless, it will be useful for anyone wanting to understand the financials of the business they work for and if they are looking to create their own business. I can't see this as a book for readers to casually pick and read as it has a purpose behind it. If you want to increase your financial knowledge, you should read this book.

			<title><![CDATA[The Courage To Be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today I will be reviewing 'The Courage to Be Disliked' by Ichiro Kishimi. The courage to take the burden of being disliked is difficult which is why many people refrain from it. This book explores through dialogue between a philosopher and student the trials of discovering your value. They discuss over many conversations the power of perception and interpretation of circumstances based mainly on the philosophy of Alfred Adler or Adlerian psychology. I will admit that this book is different, but I can't define whether good or bad. As it is translated from Japanese the flow of conversation is different, and it impacts the reader. What I like about it is how the book is structured like a conversation, it involves the reader more. However, if you want to know more about Adlerian psychology, it may be best to read a book written by him rather than this commentary. That being said this book is helpful as an introduction to his concepts. An interesting read.

			<title><![CDATA[Start Now Get Perfect Later by Rob Moore]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today I will be reviewing 'Start Now, Get Perfect Later' by Robert Moore. Why do we delay what is best for us or that we know we need to do? Procrastination and perfectionism are usually two barriers that many people have to overcome and this book gives steps on how we can all overcome these. Moore explains through the 4 D's, Delegate, Delete, Delay and Do, that tasks can and should be organised to fit into these categories. Creating leverage lists rather than to do lists also puts pressure on the individual to do what is best at that moment rather than what is easy to do. We all know what we need to do but create environments where we are not held accountable for our actions. This book gives the reader the tools to act when falling short of their goals to proceed to action, but there are no revolutionary concepts in this book. It only inspires us to action, which is enough in itself.

			<title><![CDATA[Small Giants By Bo Burlingham]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Companies that focus on being great instead of being big appreciate the gift of running a business. Burlingham writes about fourteen companies that created businesses that thrived in their communities. The choice to remain great is a conscious choice, as Burlingham explains in this book. To retain control of an idea and mission in business is to do what is right by your customers, suppliers and most importantly your employees. I was fascinated by the lengths at which companies described in this book chose proximity to their values over the financial rewards of size. The book explores the trials and tribulations in this pursuit, but also the logic of making that choice. This book is ideal for those wanting to create businesses that focus on delivering more than just a product. It's for those wanting to create something of value for themselves and the wider community. It inspires the reader to develop a business that genuinely helps everyone involved rather than just the owner.

			<title><![CDATA[Letters From A Stoic by Seneca]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Stoic philosophy is one in which logic and reason are greater than emotion. The letters of Seneca to his student Lucillius speak of the reasons why this is the case. The topics of the letters range from friendship, wealth, the world and eventually to death. The topics discussed are broad and filled with complexity to show the reader the depth of reasoning that the stoic philosophy has. I will admit that this is one of most mentally exhaustive books I have read. It requires the full attention of the reader to extract the relevant information. Being a profoundly philosophical book, it must be read in contemplation to try and understand its contents. I recommend taking notes and highlighting where appropriate. I wouldn't say this book is for everyone. The depth can be overwhelming at times. However, I do encourage those who are interested in stoic philosophy to read this book. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[How To Write Your Book Without A Fuss by Lucy McCarraher and Joe Gregory]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Writing a book can be daunting whether it is your first or your tenth. The steps are unclear without proper guidance from professionals. This is where this book fills that role. It gives prospective writers the knowledge necessary to plan, prepare, write and publish their book. Using the A.U.T.H.O.R and W.R.I.T.E.R model, prospective authors have the framework to write a book that delivers the maximum amount of value to the reader. As someone who predominantly reads, it is nice to find out about the process behind creating a book that fits a specific purpose. The steps laid out in this book are specific to individuals wanting to create business or self-help books, but it seems the process would be similar for fiction with a few changes. Reading a book like this gives anyone the confidence to know that they have the tools necessary for writing a book. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Mastery By Robert Greene]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Becoming the best is difficult, and rightly so, but how can you do so? This is the questions this book seeks to answer. In this book, Greene expresses the areas that ‘true’ masters focus on to become the best. A rigorous development in the apprenticeship phase, followed by years of intensive output, capped off with concentrated dedication is the formula laid out in this book. As easy as it may sound the historical references to Einstein, Mozart and De Vinci show the process is far from easy. What remains consistent is the formula that Greene presents. As an entry into the writing of Greene, I have found this book helpful in describing what made ordinary people become masters. The reason why this book is worth reading is Green focusses on delivering hard facts backed up by historical references rather than clichés. It transforms this book from an informative book, to a book that will remain seminal like the pieces of work discussed inside. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[A Little History Of Economics by Niall Kishtainy]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Understanding the origins of economics can be a critical tool in laying the foundations for international business, trade and socio-economic development. Kishtainy in this book aims to give an insight into the fundamental milestones that formed what we now term economics. The impact of economists such as Smith and Keynes is explained in this book, alongside many others. What I learnt from this book is that the economics that we know today didn't come into existence with ease. The trials and tribulations of past empires caused this definition to change shape and character over time. What remained was a system that best represents the state of global trade at that time. It is interesting to see whether this will change as we change our definition of how business to conducted into the future. A book that must be read to know the origins of economics and the effect it has. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Perennial Seller by Ryan Holiday]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This book seeks to shed some light on the elements that go into creating works that last the test of time. From the inception of the idea to its completion and marketing, this book covers all angles if you want to put yourself into a position to create a perennial seller. As a person you loves to create, I found this book valuable as a way manual to create long-lasting products. The appealing factor was as much as you believe that luck plays a factor, as it should, to create a perennial seller the creator must have a detailed approach from the beginning if they want to be successful. Luck seldom plays a significant role as many continue to believe. This book is for those wishing to create works that will last far beyond when they continue to live. If you fit into that category, then I highly suggest you read this book. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[12 Rules For Life: An Antidote To Chaos by Jordan.B.Peterson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Dr Peterson presents 12 principles that we should all be aware of in this book. The rules vary widely. However, the complexity and depth of his arguments remain constant throughout the book. From developing on the thoughts of famous psychologists such as Freud and Jung, to explaining the moral virtues within a myriad of different religions. This book prepares the reader for the challenges that will inevitably come during this life. The impact of this book comes from its directness towards the reader. We are left exhausted but enlightened after reading it. Why I think this book is so impactful is because of the demographic it targets. Peterson makes sure to leave this book available for anyone willing to read it regardless of their background. It's a book that I will continue to revisit as the years go by and in my mind is a modern-day classic. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This book is a brief history into our development as humans from the plains of Africa to our current place in the animal kingdom. It analyses what steps we took to get there as a species and the challenges we faced along the way. The book highlights the impact that the Agricultural revolution and the Industrial revolution had on technology, business and population growth. It gives the reader an indication of our past whilst also briefly telling what the future may hold for us. I enjoyed reading this book as it gave context for how we have developed exponentially as humans over the last couple hundred of years, and given the current trend how we will continue to do so. The disclaimer in this book is that it refutes the idea of creationism, not really analysing its impact, but on the merits on the book alone I still rate it four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[The 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This book is a revolutionary insight into how we see our own working lives. Ferriss explains that in order to live the life of what he terms the ‘New Rich’ we need to create a structure around us that allows us to be absent from our work yet reap the financial benefits. Ferriss suggests that we make the best use of automated services such as outsourcing personal assistants to reduce costs when initially establishing a business. Focus on increasing productivity during the work day by prioritising and reducing unnecessary tasks can lessen the one's working hours. This book is not directed solely at business owners, but can also provide value for anyone wanting to increase productivity inside and outside work. Following steps such as Pareto's 80/20 rule can really help workers to focus on the tasks that matter the most. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Tribe Of Mentors by Tim Ferriss]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Learning from the world's best is a smart thing to do but finding condensed resources to acquire this information is hard. Ferriss, like in his previous bestseller 'Tools of Titans', details interviews with extraordinary people to find out what makes them so. Unlike his previous book, Tribe of Mentors focusses mainly on five questions that the interviewees answer. The specificity allows the guest to go into a bit more depth than a standard interview, giving the reader more value. The result is a book that is full of wisdom, insights, tips and most importantly lots of book recommendations! What emerges are patterns from the book that we as the reader can highlight and apply to our own lives. These patterns become the driving force behind the book which allows it to become so valuable to anyone who reads it. This book like all of his others is timeless and full of power. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Blockchain Revolution by Don and Alex Tapscott]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Understanding how Blockchain can revolutionise the world we live in is a topical argument at the moment. This book addresses the origin story as well as its potential strengths and weaknesses. A new phenomenon, Blockchain caused a storm from the successes of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, by peeling back the curtain, you can see that this is only the tip of the iceberg. This book aims to assess all the potential uses for Blockchain technology as the platforms develop into the future. I will admit it's complicated to understand at first, yet this book does an excellent job of introducing the principles behind the technology. From disrupting the financial services to enabling billions of individuals to join the western ideals of democracy, the technology behind Blockchain can disrupt the world either way. For anyone wanting to know more about Blockchain, this book is a must-read. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck by Mark Manson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The world we live in demands much from us, leading many to care too much about the things that surround them. How do we care less? Simple, Don't! Manson describes principles that we can all use to create a life on our terms, not beholden to others' influence or demands. The philosophical nature of his arguments is similar to reading academic literature on philosophy but told amusingly and provocatively. Do not be put off by the title. The arguments and thoughts of the author are profound, suggesting ways for us all to find the things that we care about the most and focussing solely on these. I enjoyed the storytelling ability of the author when analysing topics that could be quite dry otherwise. This all culminates into a book that inspires to create a mindset that cannot be influenced by anyone or anything. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[A follow up to Yuval's previous bestseller 'Sapiens', Homo Deus seeks to theorise how humans will evolve in the 21st century surrounded by new technologies. The book describes how humans who had once conquered and were in control of the world, are reaching a point in our evolution where machines and more specifically algorithms run our lives. The agricultural and industrial revolution has now become the humanist revolution where humans facilitate and dictate their divine nature. The book also explores new concepts in algorithmic mathematics where computers and smart devices will know us better than ourselves as they start to become more integrated in our way of living. Personally, I preferred this book to Sapiens for two reasons. Firstly, it was forward-looking and not directed at blaming a specific race or religion. Secondly, it was exciting to hear theories to our future existence as human beings written in an engaging and informative way. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Duhigg explores why we do what we do and how to change certain habits that we have. The book explains how our brains form habit usually driven by a Cue, Routine and Reward mechanism known as a ‘habit loop’. Scientific discoveries studying both animals and humans have described the brains flexibility when adapting to new habits. By understanding the causes of habit formation, we are better able to change them to positively affect our lives. Duhigg does a wonderful job writing this book. He gives clear scientific examples, whilst also describing the impact that a single person’s habits can have on the wider community as seen in the Civil Rights movement. The real-life stories that emerge from this book make it a captivating read. It must be noted that towards the end of the book Duhigg briefly mentions how to change our existing habits, its brief but provides value. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Vagabonding by Rolf Potts]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Vagabonding is defined as the ‘act of leaving behind the orderly world to travel independently for an extended period of time.’ The book describes how modern society has convinced us that long-term travel is only for the super-rich and students. However, what is evident in this book is that this is not the case. Long-term travel is affordable, accessible and realistic if you want it to be. The book explains how vagabonding is a mind-set to how we see the world, not only during our holidays, but in our day to day lives. This book is a practical guide to planning and preparing your long-term travels, but it also gives the reader an insight into vagabonding that many people miss. Adventure can be experienced anywhere, but the impact an experience has is dependent on the open mindedness of the traveller. This book is designed for those wanting to learn about how to incorporate vagabonding into their lives. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ by Daniel Goleman]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This book is an exploration into why EQ or emotional intelligence can be a greater indicator of intelligence than IQ. I have read many articles around this topic from top CEO’s and Entrepreneurs who believe this to be true and recommended this book as an introduction into the topic. What struck me most about this book is how detailed Goleman explains how our experiences, especially in infancy, creates our tendencies and habits as we get older. The book explains details of our emotions, how they are created and are managed on a day-to-day basis. What I took away from the book is that everyone strives to become more intelligent, therefore they read and learn, but by self-analysing how you form relationships and interact with people you gain a competitive advantage in any field. This is a great introductory read and I rate it four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Ask GaryVee Book by Gary Vaynerchuk]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Based on the popular video and podcast series, the book gives an insight into one of the world's most talked about entrepreneurs. The show enables listeners to ask Gary questions on anything whether business, entrepreneurship, consumerism or life to understand how they can apply it to their lives. This book has a different format than a usual business book. Based on questions and answers, the reader feels as if the author is directly answering them similar to listening to or watching the show. One caveat will be that the book was written in 2016 so some of the tactics and strategies might have changed since its publication. If you listen to the audiobook, there are updated answers to that in the book, which some may prefer. If you're in business and more specifically brand development, then there is tremendous value in you getting this book. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[The Obstacle Is The Way by Ryan Holiday]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Under the ancient philosophical teachings of stoicism, obstacles are the foundation to all eventual success. Holiday aims to describe why the Stoics believed obstacles are so necessary for us all the achieve our best. Stoic philosophers such as Seneca, Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus all wrote about the importance of embracing failure and obstacles in the pursuit of what is right. In this book, Holiday clearly articulates the teachings of some of the greatest stoic thinkers, while describing it's application in today's world. I have been fascinated by the Stoic philosophy, and I believe no better author can clearly articulate its teachings than Holiday. The reasons for getting this book are twofold: one, to understand more clearly the instructions of stoicism and two to understand the application of these principles so you can benefit from them. If you fall into that category, then I recommend you get this book. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Astrophysics For People In A Hurry by Neil De Grasse Tyson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[As a prominent author, TV host and all-round science guy. Neil De Tyson in this book explores the inner workings of our universe from tricky topics such as dark matter to delving deeper into Einstein’s theories of relativity and how his work continues to shape modern science. As a fan of Tyson’s work, I believe this is the perfect book for those who want to know a little more about how our universe came into existence from a physics perspective. The book has a perfect mix between introducing new concepts whilst also expanding on generally known concepts such as Newton’s law. As the reader, you are able appreciate how  Tyson explains a complex topic in such a vivid way. This is a book for everyone who is interested about our universe whether you’re a beginner or an expert this book has something for you. A highly recommended 5 stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Crush It by Gary Vaynerchuk]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This book is a practical guide to executing on your passion in the digital social media age. As a successful entrepreneur, Gary predicates his brand on bringing the most value to his followers, he does this exceptionally well in Crush it, the first of five best-selling books. The key message that derives from the book is that passion is everything. Regardless of race, gender or background, if your passion has a deeper personal meaning then the chances are you will be able to monetize it in some way. Even though the book is written in 2009, the concepts and actions that are described in this book still hold true. The reason why I like this book so much is unlike most practical business books it doesn’t leave the reader asking questions, Gary tell you what you need and must do for your dreams to become reality. For these reasons, I give this book a five-star rating.

			<title><![CDATA[Tools Of Titans by Tim Ferriss]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Tim Ferriss is a renowned author, investor, entrepreneur and self-improvement master. In this book he explains the tactics, routines and habits of the world’s best performers whether in business, music, sport and everything in between. Feriss is able to convey what it takes for high-performers to deliver when they need it most.This is not a self-help book, but more an introduction into the minds of the individuals that are to deliver their best on a consistent basis. I have found this  book useful as a source of inspiration to try new things and to test what preconceptions I may have about a certain topic. 
This the perfect read for someone who wants to find inspiration in performing better by finding out about certain routines, exercises and habits to take them to the next level. I highly recommend this book if you fit into that category. For these reasons I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[It is common for us all to know the importance of sleep, but do we truly know 'why' we sleep? Walker with the help of decades of scientific evidence highlights some of the misinformation surrounding sleep. In doing so, Walker emphasises its importance at all stages of life in humans and across the animal kingdom. From curing depression, helping the brain to curate memory and protecting our immune system accurately, sleep is the backbone to long-term health that many people neglect. What this book does well is informing the reader without overloading with scientific information. The use of examples of others who have suffered at the hands of sleep avoidance does a great job in supporting his arguments. I will admit that I didn't respect the importance of sleep, but this book has changed this. As sleep is common to us all this book is no doubt a must read for all. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Ego Is The Enemy by Ryan Holiday]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA['Ego is the Enemy' is an in-depth look into how ego plays a destructive part in the ability to live a productive and fulfilling life. The book is not written on the experience of the author but references famous philosophers such as Seneca explaining that ego can negatively impact an individual. Using historical figures as a reference, the author gives a blueprint for how we as the reader can avoid the unfavourable principles that ego presents. Instead of providing a list of steps to avoid our ego, Holiday explains in detail the adverse impact ego can and most likely will have if gone unchecked. The book is written in such a way to inspire the reader without overwhelming them at the same time. We are all subject to our ego at times of aspiration, success and failure; therefore this book is a must-read for all. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Key Person of Influence by Daniel Priestley]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[A key person of influence as defined by Priestley is a person who is well-known and associated with being a leader in a specific industry. That person enjoys the spoils of being explicitly associated with that industry experiencing the benefits that come with that status. The theme of the book centres on the Five-Step KPI framework that we can follow to be a key person of influence. The five steps are pitch, publish, product, profile and partnership. The book is for entrepreneurs wanting to grow their brand in their own chosen industry. The content described in this book relevant to entrepreneurs and business people alike. If you're a casual reader, I can't see the benefit in reading this. But if you're someone wanting to increase your knowledge about how to grow your brand and business, then this book is definitely for you. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[One of the most influential self-development books written, Carnegie explains principles that can make you more influential. The book is broken down into sections detailing how to be a better leader and how to make you more likeable. The book also includes examples from historical figures as well as examples from its application in business as well as life in general. There is a reason why this book is so revered. The book has a simple message that is laid on in a way that makes it easy for the reader to read and comprehend. I found myself continually highlighting and taking notes while reading and I suggest potential readers do the same. It is a book that you can regularly revisit to refresh the ideas in the book and serve as some personal inspiration. This book has the potential to help a lot of people. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This book explains how to take extreme ownership to become a better leader. The stories in the book detail how both authors experienced high-pressure situations during the war in Iraq, but only by taking ownership of everything around them could they lead with conviction to ultimately win. Leadership is usually synonymous with many adjectives, but I do not recall a book that emphasises ownership as much as this one. The concept that connected with me was the 'dichotomies of leadership'. The authors explain that to be a great leader, you must find the balance between two extremes. I enjoyed listening to this book. The audiobook was well structured, and I felt the emotion of the message coming across from the authors. If like me you appreciate leadership books, I encourage you to pick up this book because it gives a much different angle than most. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Episode #3 - What is 'Logotherapy'?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Welcome to Episode #3 of 'Knowledge Bites', where I discuss some of the concepts, theories and models I come across when reading books for my One Minute Book Review channel. In this episode, I will be giving a brief introduction to 'Logotherapy' and its place in psychoanalysis and individual psychology. I have made a concerted effort to keep this episode simple as it can be over-complicated easily. I came across this concept when reading 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' by Stephen R. Covey and thought due to its impact on me, would be a great addition to knowledge bites.

			<title><![CDATA[A Higher Loyalty by James Comey]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA['A Higher Loyalty' describes what it means to be an ethical, truthful and effective leader through the eyes of former FBI director James Comey. Recalling his journey through the ranks of government, Comey gives an honest account of the characteristics of both effective and ineffective leaders. The latter part of the book delves into Comey's decision making during the controversial events before and after the 2016 Presidential Election. Seeing the events that unfolded which led to Comey's firing, I was excited to read this book to understand what indeed happened. The book felt honest. From Comey's honest descriptions of his family tragedies, to how he conducted himself after being fired, the book felt truthful where many books in the current affairs genre are not. The book does not list ways to be a better leader, but instead gives examples of some of the characteristics that make one. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Steven R. Covey]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today I will be reviewing The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. One of the most influential business books of the twentieth century, Covey delves into the seven habits that separate effective people from the rest. The seven habits range from proactiveness to thinking-win-win and creating synergy, flowing from one to the other. However, the overarching theme throughout the book is the 'Inside Out' approach, which explains how obvious perceived problems can usually be solved by changing our internal perceptions to the question itself. This internal approach to external factors is the most rational and controllable way to deal with any problem. There is no doubt why this book has been so impactful over the past couple of decades. A clear and well-written message at its foundation with a simple laid out gives this book the potential to improve the life of anyone open-minded enough to the habits and principles explained within. There is no doubt that this book is five stars.

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome to Episode #2 of 'Knowledge Bites', where I discuss some of the concepts, theories and models I come across when reading books for my One Minute Book Review channel. In this episode, I will give a brief introduction of 'The Fogg Behaviour Method' and how we can all apply it positively to our lives, which is the aim of 'Knowledge Bites'. I will try and keep this episode as concise as I can, I have read a lot surrounding this topic and will try my best to simplify it as best I can.

In this episode, I will give a brief introduction of &apos;The Fogg Behaviour Method&apos; and how we can all apply it positively to our lives, which is the aim of &apos;Knowledge Bites&apos;. I will try and keep this episode as concise as I can, I have read a lot surrounding this topic and will try my best to simplify it as best I can.

			<title><![CDATA[April Book Review Recap]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Hello, I am your host Aun Abdi and welcome to the monthly One Minute Book Review podcast, where I break down in more detail the books that I have read and reviewed in the previous month. 

In this months episode, I will be discussing Deep Work by Cal Newport. This month was a hectic month outside my One Minute Book Review channel. Work and family pressures meant that only one book was reviewed last month. Many more books were read I am hoping I have the time this month in May to catch up on the reviews.

			<title><![CDATA[5 Reasons Why You SHOULD Read 'Crushing It' by Gary Vaynerchuk]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In today’s episode of ‘5 Reason Friday’, I will be discussing why you SHOULD read 'Crushing It' by Gary Vaynerchuck. 

Gary Vaynerchuk or Gary 'Vee' as he is better known, is an entrepreneur, who has built his brand around motivating an entire generation. After releasing his first book 'Crush It' in 2009, Gary has been able to transform the lives of many wannabe entrepreneurs into the success stories they are today. 'Crush It' was the book that preceded 'Crushing It', the book that I will be discussing in today's Five Reason Friday.

			<title><![CDATA[Deep Work: Rules For Focused Success In A Distracted World by Cal Newport]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today I will be reviewing Deep Work: Rules For Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport. DEEP work is the ability to spend four or more, disconnected, undistracted & entirely focused hours a day practising new skills or generating high-level output while leveraging an expertise. In this book, Cal Newport describes how to become a practitioner of deep work and the impact it can have on your personal and professional life. This book is practical which is one of the reasons why I enjoyed it. The steps that Cal describes to go into a state of Deep work can prove beneficial as it has done for Bill Gates and Carl Jung to name a few. The book is supplemented by a brief PDF that describes some of the key themes and points Cal explains, and I have found this useful when implementing the strategies he outlines. This book is for those who want to increase productivity while also becoming a leader in their field. I rate this book five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Hooked by Nir Eyal]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Hooked is an in-depth analysis of how to build habit-forming products that allow for customer retention. Following the 'Hook Model' consisting of a trigger, action, reward and investment, product forming companies have a model to develop and market in our current system. The book centres on the 'Hook Model' explaining in detail how it can apply in the real world and how it has helped companies such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat to amass such a large following. It goes onto explain habit forming in more depth developing on the 'Habit Loop' made famous by Charles Duhigg. It's a technical book, explicitly made for product developers, to create and distribute exceptional products. I enjoy reading about habit formation, so this book gave me insights that I didn't know before. If you have the same curiosity in habit formation, especially in business, then I highly suggest you read this book. I rate it four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[The 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The 80/20 principle centres on Alfredo Pareto's theory that 80% of wealth is in the hands of 20% of people. Koch explains that this percentage applies to multiple industries, markets and interests. The book gives detailed advice about the ways we can implement the 80/20 principle to achieve more by doing less. For instance, when analyzing individual happiness, it is common to find that 80% of happiness derives from only 20% of one's activities. Koch encourages readers to see that 20% across all areas of their life and implement them. I found this book incredibly informative and practical. It breaks down why you should be living the 80/20 principle day by day and the benefits to individual happiness of doing so. This book is a must-read in today's hectic environment when finding what is important personally and professionally can be hard. However, by adopting the 80/20 mentality, it can make it easier. There is no doubt this book is five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[A Birmingham Story by Ryan Sinclair]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[A Birmingham Story is a short narrative about some of the emotions that we face as humans at specific points in our lives. The feelings explored include trust, jealousy, anger and depression. It follows three characters, with differing circumstances, yet they have more in common than they initially thought. An argument eventually ceases their disagreement to shed light on how differing perspectives on the same situation causes misunderstandings more often than not. I have not read anything similar to this before. But, that does not take away from how much I connected with it. The themes addressed in the story do not get discussed openly enough, but the author does an excellent job telling his story while also explaining how these emotions have affected the characters. I can see the benefit of stories such as this as a medium for more discussion on mental health. This was a good read; I rate it three stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Shoe Dog by Phil Knight]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today I will be reviewing Shoe Dog by Phil Knight. An autobiography of the man behind the establishment and growth of Nike, 'Shoe Dog' gives a first-hand look at its trials and tribulations from day one. I was impressed by the detail provided by the author. As such a large brand Nike seems so significant that one person cannot tell a story to define it. However, it is what Knight does exceptionally well in the book. At times it felt like reading fiction. The characterisation of the people that helped bring Nike to its current position, alongside the sadness surrounding Knight's personal life makes the reader emotionally invested in the story. As a fan of stories, sports and business separately, I have never read a book that intertwines all three so brilliantly. If you're a business owner, this book has countless pieces of wisdom. This book is for anyone who is a fan of great stories, sport and business, or all three! There is no doubt that this book is a five-star read.

			<title><![CDATA[Zero To One by Peter Thiel]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Zero To One describes how to build efficient start-ups from scratch to build a better future. The future as depicted by Thiel is one which we are in control. The book looks in depth at how to properly plan and execute a start-up that can be as impactful as it is successful. Thiel explains the importance of preparing for the market while making sure the foundations of the start-up are solid before securing constant funding.   Knowing little about start-up culture, I enjoyed Thiel's candidness when describing the harsh realities of establishing a start-up. I particularly enjoyed the parts where Thiel emphasises that we are in control of the start-up. Regardless of the market conditions, competitors or funding, if the business has the right balance between intellectual capacity and purpose, it will succeed in the long-term. This book is for anyone wanting to know the ways we can contribute to making the future better. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[The Martian by Andy Weir]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The Martian follows the main character Mark Watney, as a space accident leaves him stranded on Mars, while his crew members escape. The book details his impending doom as Mark tries to find the best method for his survival, with the story, following his trials and tribulations along the way. What I liked about this book was the author's use of Mark's first-person perspective. Chapters in the book were broken down into log's which followed Mark's journey and survival efforts during his time on Mars. The humour that the author puts into the characterisation of Mark makes the story compelling as the reader is surprised by the optimism that he shows in the face of adversity. The author's use of technical knowledge regarding equipment used in space travel elevates the narrative as well as the storyline. I enjoyed reading this book as it had a right mix of humour, optimism and hope. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Crushing It by Gary Vaynerchuck]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This book is a follow up to Gary's bestseller 'Crush It' released in 2009, which defined how everyone can cash in on their passion. 'Crushing It' is an update to that book including testimonials from people who had successfully implemented principles in 'Crush It', to build successful businesses. Gary includes what he believes to be the eight essentials in developing a company that can influence. Examples of the eight include intent, attention and the most important... content. Like 'Crush It' this book looks forward to the future and the tools businesses can use to grow and gain attention. The most significant device being voice recognition using Alexa voice. This book brings a lot of practical value for anyone wanting to build a sustainable business by leveraging social media to their advantage. I would suggest readers begin with his previous book 'Crush It' before moving onto this book. That being said, it's still a great read on its own. Five stars.

			<title><![CDATA[The TB12 Method by Tom Brady]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today I will be reviewing the TB12 Method by Tom Brady. Brady arguably one of the best athletes in the world, describes in this book how he obtains peak performance on and off the field. The book centres on pliability, which is the daily lengthening and softening of the muscles as a way of injury prevention and longevity for not only athletes but everyone. Brady's method also describes how maintaining balance is crucial while making sure nutrition and hydration are maintained to reduce inflammation. I was drawn to this book as I am interested in learning new physical training programmes and I like Brady's emphasis on using resistance bands to supplement strength and conditioning. The book promotes his products at numerous times, and it felt that I wasn't reading an educational book but more an advertisement. For fitness fanatics, there might be some value in the book, but for everyone else, I suggest typing in resistance band training and nutrition in google and learning that way. I rate this book three stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Super Mind : Transcendental Meditation by Norman E. Rosenthal]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Super Mind: How to Boost Performance and Live a Richer and Happier Life Through Transcendental Meditation. Rosenthal explains how we can improve our state of mind by practising TM placing us into a super-mind state of consciousness. This book confused me. I was expecting a 'how to' into how I can perform TM and implement it into my life. Rosenthal during the book explains all the life-changing aspects that TM has but without actually revealing how the reader can achieve it. The author recommends to sign-up for a TM practitioner, however many of us want an introduction before committing long-term. There is little space dedicated to how we can approach learning TM individually, which surprises me. The way it was written left little to the imagination as well as it contained, name-dropping mostly and examples of how TM is life-changing. I don't doubt this, but I was expecting a lot more from this book. I rate it two stars.

			<title><![CDATA[24 Assets by Daniel Priestley]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this book Priestley explains how we can create a digital, scalable, valuable and fun business that will thrive in a fast-changing world. The book is specific for businesses, either new or established, wanting to develop their influence through developing 24 specific assets that contribute to the overall impact of a successful business. The 24 assets are sub-divided into both physical and softer assets such as software assets and brand assets, clearly pointing out what is important for businesses to focus on. From a business owner and entrepreneur point of view, this book provides a tremendous amount of value. In particular, I enjoyed how Priestley explains that businesses need strong overall assets across all 24 categories to keep themselves protected in both booms and recessions. The book is specific for individuals interested in developing their own business but there is also a lot of value for casual readers. I rate this book four stars.

			<title><![CDATA[The Whistler by John Grisham]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today I will be reviewing The Whistler by John Grisham. Grisham well-renowned for his long line of books in the thriller genre continues this theme with The Whistler. The book follows an investigator Lacy as she tries to uncover widespread corruption in the judicial system. What she finds is a never-ending trail of corruption, deceit, murder and money laundering. As she investigates further she finds the level of corruption to be greater than first anticipated, causing the relationships around her to suffer as a result. The author captured my imagination throughout the story as I constantly tried to predict how the story would unfold. The use of multiple characters and locations kept the narrative exciting, whilst not distracting from the story. That being said, I felt that the story as a whole was a little too predictable, I was waiting for a crescendo moment for the narrative to take a 90 degree turn but I was sadly disappointed. A solid book, but I was expecting a bit more. I rate it three stars.

			<title><![CDATA[Principles by Ray Dalio]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Dalio known for his investing and entrepreneurial successes with Bridgewater Associates, analyses in this book what ‘Principles’ he has used to attribute to his success. These are the broken down into Life and Work principles where Dalio is able to explain in depth how we as the reader can benefit from his famous approach of meritocracy. Dalio describes how we can create our own principles from failures in our lives, so that, should we come across them again we know how to deal with them. From an entrepreneurial point of view this book has tremendous value as it highlights what business owners and managers need to focus on. For casual readers, there is little value in the technical  business side of the book, however Dalio encourages readers to create their own principles rather than blindly following others. I enjoy reading books that make me question and reflect on my strengths and weaknesses, and this book is no exception.

			<title><![CDATA[Fire And Fury: Inside The Trump White House by Michael Wolff]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The most talked about book in politics today, Wolff gives frank details surrounding the inner workings of Trump’s presidency. From the campaign trail to tracking his first nine months, Wolff details how the relationships around Trump as well as his own personality has shaped his presidency to date. Filled with accusations and accounts of conversations, the book attempts to shed light on a presidency that has grabbed the worlds attention. The book was enlightening and shocking at times. What stood out was how mismanaged the environment surrounding Trump is, mostly due to his own planning. The author engages the reader throughout the book, however this is more because of the topic, rather than the way it was written. It must be noted as well that the comments and accusations made in this book are alleged and not confirmed.

			<title><![CDATA[The Rules Of People by Richard Templar]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This book is a personal code for getting the best out of everyone. The book includes one hundred rules for becoming the best version of yourself around different people in multiple situations. The rules are categorised into four parts: understanding people, helping people, getting them on your side and difficult people. By doing this the author clearly breaks down the areas of interest for the reader. The book like many in the genre are more of a reference tool than a book to read in one sitting. I recommend this book if you need to improve how to deal with certain kinds of people in different situations, both at work or in day-to-day life. This book was enlightening and provided me with a lot of value. However, I feel that if it were written more like a research book rather than broken down it would have been easier to digest.

			<title><![CDATA[Turtles All The Way Down by John Green]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The book follows the protagonist Aza as she pursues a prize to find a fugitive billionaire and the struggles she goes through. Together with her friend Daisy they investigate his disappearance. However, this book is not so much about Aza’s quest for the prize. It centres on Aza’s struggle with her own thoughts as it tears her up from within breaking down the relationships around her. Not usually a genre I read, I was captivated by the author’s use of humour to bring to light a very serious topic, interweaving it amongst a great storyline. I enjoyed how large parts of the story are played within Aza’s head making the reader feel her pain. The author does a great job in making the reader feel empathy for Aza. This book evokes many emotions taking the reader on a rollercoaster, through happiness, pain and in the end hope. A highly recommended read for everyone.

			<title><![CDATA[Murder on The Orient Express by Agatha Christie]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[A classic murder mystery story, the book follows a detective Hercule Poirot as he tries to find a killer on the lavish Orient Express. The book tells the tale of thirteen strangers stranded on a train, where everyone’s a suspect. Poirot must race against time to solve the puzzle before the murderer strikes again. What Poirot finds is a common history between all the strangers on the train, which plays an integral part in the story. The writer’s style of contrasting characters leaves the reader feeling suspicious of the true killer constantly questioning what their motives might be. The suspense that Christie is able to achieve within the story is why I really enjoyed this book. Countless adaptations on screen have tried to capture this but I believe that the book holds the true power that Christie wished to achieve.

			<title><![CDATA[Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This book is an academic reflection on what it takes to be successful. The author looks at the comparisons between race, income and education to determine what makes a person more likely to succeed. What emerges is interesting. For instance, in the book Gladwell analyses the impact that timing and luck have on the success of not only an individual but a generation as a whole. A decade between two people can mean that one more intelligent person can be less successful than a less intelligent person born in another decade due to the opportunities available. I enjoyed reading this book as it incorporates elements of psychology, sociology and anthropology to assess a commonly debated topic. What emerges is that there is not one thing that separates a successful person from another less successful person, there is a mix of different factors that are mostly external to the individual.

			<title><![CDATA[Artemis by Andy Weir]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[A follow up to Weir’s bestseller The Martian, Artemis follows the journey of the main character Jazz as she tries to find her place in the first city on the moon. Growing up in Artemis she found herself getting into trouble from an early age, smuggling and dealing with crooks. The opportunity to make more presented itself to Jazz as she couldn't resist. The author does an impressive job in detailing the specifics of the city engaging the reader throughout the story. Jazz's internal conflict with her past plays itself out during the story, but new characters emerge making this impossible for her. The story is engaging and the imagery descriptive, however, I felt that the ending left little to the imagination as it felt too predictable. For anyone who likes Sci-Fi I advise that they read this, but for casual readers, I suggest passing on it.

			<title><![CDATA[The Thank You Economy by Gary Vaynerchuck]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This is the second of the Gary's New York Times bestseller books. The book explains the tactics that businesses can use to provide real value to consumers in what he terms the ‘Thank You' economy. In the book, Gary explains that social media has given the power of voice back to consumers, making businesses volatile to any public issues. He explains that businesses that understand the use of social media as a gateway to provide value alongside closer contact with customers rather than a way to gain likes will win in the Thank You Economy. I really enjoyed reading this book as it gave me a real insight into what a leader in the current entrepreneurial environment is thinking about when running his business. This book would provide value for businesses owners in any industry as well as those who are thinking about establishing their own enterprise in the digital age.

			<description><![CDATA[The story of Azarias is rooted in the tragic loss of his wife as he tries to come to terms with who he truly is.
