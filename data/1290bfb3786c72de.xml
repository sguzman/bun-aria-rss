    <copyright>© Realm 2021</copyright>
    <description>2022 Webby Award Winner (Best Scripted Podcast- People's Voice)!  

"Where true crime and witchcraft meet...the show masks digestible magic for the beginner witch underneath a tale that discusses all the wrongs in society, which is really what witchcraft is all about." — Teen Vogue

"A thriller with heart." — Good Morning America

Starring Oscar-nominated actress Gabourey Sidibe: when a Black writer goes missing, a white podcast host with a savior complex takes up the cause of finding her—and collides with a coven of influencers she suspects are responsible. 

After a summer in Westchester soaking up how the other half lives, Jenna Clayton has vanished without a trace. The only clue: a set of voice memos detailing an investigation into a group of influencers she suspected were using magic to achieve their means. 

Elise Edgerton is outraged that no one has found Jenna yet, and decides to take up the cause. But despite believing she is using her platform for good, Elise’s mission threatens to turn her into an even worse villain than a witch: a white savior. 

If I Go Missing the Witches Did It is a Realm production, starring Gabourey Sidibe and Sarah Natochenny and written by Pia Wilson. Listen Away.
