			<description><![CDATA[<p>Some of you know that I was a reproductive rights activist, advocate, litigator, and academic before I became a coach. So I am sadly not surprised by this decision as the writing has long been on the wall. But here's what I have to say as a coach:</p> <p><br /> The Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade.</p> <p>How do we meet this kind of challenge, from a coaching/thought work perspective?</p> <p>Today is a day of mourning for anyone who cares about human autonomy and freedom. This ruling is a violation of the rights of anyone who can get pregnant, and in keeping with a long history of patriarchal control over women/childbearing bodies. As usual, the burden will be worse for people of color, disabled people, poor people, and anyone else living in a marginalized identity or a retrogressive state.</p> <p>Thought work is not about finding a “silver lining” in human rights violations. It is not about seeing oppression as “perfect” because it exists.</p> <p>It is about equipping ourselves to return to the fight.</p> <p>It is about increasing our own resilience, to show up for what we believe, even when we seem to be losing.</p> <p>It is about reclaiming our own ability to make meaning of our struggles and our lives, no matter what circumstances we live in.</p> <p>It is about power in the one place that no one else can control: The inside of our own minds.</p> <p>This work is about liberating ourselves from the inside out, so that we can continue to work to liberate the world.</p> <p>So allow those emotions today. Anger, sadness, fear. Cry, grieve, scream, howl.</p> <p>And when you’re ready, manage your mind. Choose what you want to believe – about this decision, about this world, about yourself, about your capacity to hold your experience, to find joy, to create change, to help others.</p> <p>Many terrible Supreme Court decisions have been overturned in time. It is worth continuing the fight.</p> <p>If we give up in our own minds, we are giving up on the world. That's how the patriarchy wins. Don’t give up.</p> <p><br /> P.S. If you want more guidance: I recommend <a href= "https://unfuckyourbrain.com/31" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Episode 31, What About Sexism,</a> and <a href= "https://unfuckyourbrain.com/70" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Episode 70, Clean v. Dirty Pain</a>.</p> <p><br /> P.P.S. The quickest thing you can do to help equalize abortion access in a post-Roe world is to donate to local and state abortion funds that will pay for women to travel to states where abortion is still available. You can google to find one close to home or you can donate to the National Network of Abortion Funds here: <a href= "https://secure.actblue.com/donate/supportabortionfunds?refcode=nnafwebsite" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://secure.actblue.com/donate/supportabortionfunds?refcode=nnafwebsite</a><br />  Here is another list: <a href= "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/abortion-funds-to-donate-to-how-to-help-1351451/"> https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/abortion-funds-to-donate-to-how-to-help-1351451/ </a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As coaches, we know that our thoughts create our results, right? But in order to coach our clients effectively on their thoughts, we have to understand the CONTEXT from which these thoughts emerged. Someone whose cultural history involves persecution and multigenerational trauma may not resonate with the coaching that “everything will happen as it’s meant to,” just as someone who has learned explicitly and implicitly that their sexuality is wrong or bad won’t respond to coaching that does not take this history into account. In this episode, you will learn how approaching your clients with radical curiosity and learning to spot how their thoughts have been shaped by their cultural context will enable you to coach clients with lived experiences that differ from your own. In this special episode, guest coaches Rachel Hart and Dr. Sonia Wright join Kara Loewentheil for a conversation about why understanding your clients’ context is so important, and how committing to curiosity and nonjudgment will help you navigate your own blind spots as a coach.</p> <p> </p> <p>Get full show notes and more information here: <a href= "https://unfuckyourbrain.com/otwb5" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://unfuckyourbrain.com/otwb5</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Many coaches believe that once they become certified, they will be equipped with the tools to coach anyone on anything. It’s a lovely thought, but maybe not so helpful when you’re in your tenth session with a client who just stares at you blankly as you try to explain, for the 50th time, how their thoughts are creating their results and why that’s a great thing. While there are certainly powerful frameworks out there, the coaching principles we learn aren’t one-size-fits-all. One single tool or framework isn’t going to work for everybody, and that’s ok. In this episode, Kara Loewentheil and Simone Seol will discuss how to bring more openness, nuance, and discernment into your coaching, so you can coach clients of different backgrounds and lived experiences effectively.</p> <p> </p> <p>Get full show notes and more information here: <a href= "https://unfuckyourbrain.com/otwb4" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://unfuckyourbrain.com/otwb4</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Are you hesitant to identify as a feminist? Conversely, do you struggle to understand why any woman WOULDN’T want to identify as a feminist? Cultural messaging around what feminism means is so pervasive that even proud feminists often have to shed cultural narratives that feminists are angry, humorless man-haters. When you look at the history of feminism through an intersectional lens, it becomes even clearer why some women - especially BIPOC women - may not identify with the movement.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this episode, I am joined by four of my Advanced Certification in Feminist Coaching (ACFC) graduates to discuss their discomfort with the label prior to joining the certification, and how ACFC changed their relationship to feminism. Whether you strongly identify as a feminist, or you’re unsure about whether you want to be one and what that even means, this episode will help you understand your own blind spots around why other people may not relate to this movement as you do.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Get full show notes and more information here: <a href= "https://unfuckyourbrain.com/205" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://unfuckyourbrain.com/205</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's episode, I break down why judgment is not serving you, especially as you embark on your thought work journey, and how practicing curiosity instead will open you to a much richer experience.

Curiosity doesn’t have an opinion. Curiosity pays attention. </p> <p>Get full show notes and more information here: <a href= "https://unfuckyourbrain.com/80">https://unfuckyourbrain.com/80</a></p> <p>Join The Clutch today for a community of like-minded feminists: <a href= "https://unfuckyourbrain.com/theclutch/">https://unfuckyourbrain.com/theclutch/</a></p>]]></description>
