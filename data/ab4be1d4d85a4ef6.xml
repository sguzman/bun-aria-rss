<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>Former Pakistan PM says he was shot four times as he reveals extent of injuries</strong></p>



<p>Describing his injuries, a doctor in the room said he was hit &#8220;on the right thigh [with] two bullets&#8221; and on &#8220;the left thigh two bullets&#8221; &#8211; adding that his &#8220;left tibia was fractured&#8221;.</p>



<p>Mr Khan said two shooters tried to assassinate him and they killed one person and injured 11 others. He has insinuated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and intelligence official Major-General Faisal Nasser orchestrated the attack.</p>



<p>The cricketing hero-turned-politician &#8211; who has been calling for new elections since he was ousted from power in April &#8211; has been delivering impassioned speeches at gatherings across the country.</p>



<p>He was six days into a march from Lahore to Islamabad in his push for radical change when the shooting took place.</p>



<p>The news of Imran Khan, the founder of Bradford based charity Imran Khan Cancer Appeal (IKCA), being shot came as a shock to all of us. </p>



<p>Shafiq Rafiq from Imran Khan Cancer Appeal (UK) said: &#8220;The charity supporters, the staff and the wider community is really saddened by the new of an attempt on his life. </p>



<p>&#8220;Our thoughts and prayers are with Imran, the person that died in the attack, the people who got injured and their families.</p>



<p>&#8220;Imran Khan is the former Prime Minister of Pakistan. And yet, he remains most vividly in public memory as the captain who led the Pakistan team to victory at the 1992 Cricket World Cup. </p>



<p>&#8220;The cricket legend has come a long way from sports to philanthropy to politics. Throughout this extraordinary journey, his driving force has remained the same: a desire for social justice and equality.</p>



<p>&#8220;We pray for Imran’s speedy recovery and humbly ask everyone to pray for him and for all those injured in the attack.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital (SKMCH) was the first step and milestone in Mr Khan&#8217;s charity work. </p>



<p>Mr Rafiq adds: &#8220;It [Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital] became a testament to Imran’s resolve and a national achievement that he is proud to have spearheaded. It remains at the forefront of Imran Khan’s ongoing philanthropic works. Thanks to him, free cancer care for the poor of Pakistan became possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shaukat Khanum was a woman who was proud of her heritage. She hailed from a family of proficient cricketers, and a Sufi Warrior Poet. Hers was a pride she instilled in her children, along with an iron resolve. In February 1985, after a long and agonising struggle, Shaukat Khanum’s family lost her to cancer. She was 63 years old.</p>



<p>&#8220;Little did Imran know that the most painful event of his life would pave the way for a hospital that continues to provide hope for millions. Today, Imran Khan is a former Prime Minister of Pakistan. He is also the Founding Chairman of Imran Khan Cancer Appeal and Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital.</p>



<p>&#8220;From the start, Imran was personally involved in the global fundraising effort for the project. Today, he is its Founding Chairman and is still involved in ongoing appeals and awareness campaigns, ensuring 75% of patients receive quality cancer care, free of charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Yorkshire County Cricket Club has announced the appointment of Stephen Vaughan as Chief Executive Officer. He will officially begin the role on 7th November 2022.</p>



<p>Stephen joins the Club following three years at Wasps Group, which he joined as CEO of sports businesses in August 2019.</p>



<p>He became Group Chief Executive in 2020, with additional responsibility for venues, overseeing the securing of stadium naming rights and the return of Coventry City Football Club to the city. During his time there, Stephen was responsible for the rollout of a comprehensive Equality, Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ED&amp;I) strategy, placing this at the heart of the group’s mission and values.</p>



<p>Stephen brings decades of experience in professional sport, having represented Walsall FC as a player, prior to roles as Managing Director of Thomas Cook London 2012 where he led the company’s involvement with the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in London, and seven successful years at Gloucester Rugby.</p>



<p>At Gloucester, he directed the transformation of the Club both on and off the pitch, securing not only impressive revenue growth but also key improvements to the fan experience, as well as establishing a strong set of values for all staff across the organisation. Stephen sat on the Premiership Rugby Board, as well as the finance, audit and nominations committee.</p>



<p>Stephen Vaughan, incoming CEO of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, said: “Yorkshire County Cricket Club is one of the most iconic sporting institutions in the world and it’s truly an honour to take up this position. Without shying away from the significant challenges we have faced over the past year, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the future, both on and off the pitch.</p>



<p>“I had a number of offers, but the opportunity to lead this club back to the forefront of English Cricket and realise our full potential was very attractive.</p>



<p>“The Club is hugely important in the region with a massive fan base of loyal members who want to see us get back to where we should be.</p>



<p>“Working alongside the newly installed Board I am determined to deliver sporting success at Headingley and produce exceptional results, underpinned by robust commercial foundations and our vision to make Yorkshire Cricket a place for everyone.</p>



<p>“I am looking forward to meeting Members over the coming weeks and leading this Club forward. I can’t wait to get started.”</p>



<p>Lord Kamlesh Patel, Chair of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, said: “We’re delighted to welcome Stephen to the Club as the outstanding candidate in a highly talented field. With years of knowledge and experience working across various disciplines within sport he will bring a huge amount of expertise to Yorkshire County Cricket Club. His proven track record and business acumen will be vital to our future success.</p>



<p>“Stephen’s openness in dealing with challenging conditions at Wasps in the wake of Covid demonstrates the strength of character that will be vital to the ongoing transformation of the Club. I look forward to working with him as we continue on our rebuilding journey”.</p>



<p>Alongside Stephen’s appointment, the Club can also confirm that Darren Gough has been permanently appointed as Managing Director of Yorkshire Cricket. He has worked the same role on an interim basis since late 2021 and will continue working with the coaching and medical staff, overseeing on-field performance.</p>



<p>Darren Gough, Managing Director of Cricket, Yorkshire County Cricket Club: “I have a long-established connection to the Club and am very happy to be part of our future by signing a permanent contract. We were all disappointed with the conclusion of the men’s XI season but we are determined to get back to the top as soon as possible and regain our Division One status.</p>



<p>“There is much to be optimistic about, not least the exceptional young talent coming through, and I am excited about the signings we have made to improve the team. The hard work starts through the winter, and I am looking forward to working together with Ottis and the coaching team in the years ahead to bring success on the cricket field back to Yorkshire.”</p>

<h2>By: Nazim Ali</h2>



<p>It was a great honour, and I was profoundly humbled to arrange the 10th annual &#8216;Creating Smiles&#8217; gifts initiative to celebrate the birthday and life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>



<p>As well as delivering gifts to poorly children in Ward 17 at Airedale Hospital, we provided roses to the nursing staff in recognition of their exceptional hard work. They do a tremendous job!</p>



<p>We were celebrating the Islamic date of 12th Rabbi Ul Awwal in the Islamic calendar, the date of the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>



<p>We also provided roses and chocolates to members of the public in Keighley Town Centre to spread peace, love and harmony.</p>



<p>Roses symbolise love, happiness, inclusively and to this end I feel we were successful as so many people were touched by the gesture and loved the cards with each gift with sayings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>



<p>It truly was wonderful to see the smiles galore on the faces of the hospital staff, the youth, elderly and people from all communities and all walks of life!</p>

<p>I dedicate this gift giving and roses and chocolates distributions to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on his birthday as he is loved and revered by the world&#8217;s almost two billion Muslims. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) has inspired through his life and teachings British Muslims like myself to engage in civic renewal which I have done proactively and steadfastly for 25 years. They taught me irrespective of faith or ethnicity to help others.</p>



<p>I express my gratitude to Shiraz Ahmed &amp; Fairaz Ahmed (Managing Directors) of Bradford-based Saveco Cash &amp; Carry for their kind and selfless on-going support.</p>



<p>My dear friends Mohammed Azeem and Haji Adnan Fiaz (Friends of Airedale Hospital) once more accompanied me to Airedale Hospital as well as helping me in selecting and purchasing the gifts.</p>



<p>Mohammed Azeem spent 61 days in hospital of which 41 were in a coma as he successfully battled against Covid-19 and thanks to Allah (God) he made a full recovery. Prior to Covid-19 he successfully battled against cancer.</p>



<p>It can be a stressful time for parents to have children in hospital. We dropped off over 30 Gifts (for poorly children ranging from 0 &#8211; 16 years) at the Children’s Ward 17 of Airedale Hospital. The diverse range of gifts included cuddly toys, play sets, babies toys and so forth with a mixture for boys and girls.</p>



<p>It was a gesture of kindness and to show that members of the wider community do care and think about them (poorly children) and ultimately uplift their spirits.</p>



<p>The gifts were for all children in the ward irrespective of faith. The essence of the Islamic celebration of the birthday of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) &amp; his life&#8217;s teachings has the universal concept of kindness and compassion to all particularly those in need. It is these values that bring all people together regardless of belief and we hope we have achieved this at some level.</p>



<p>We realise this is a period of reflection for Muslims. However, it is also a period where we should reflect and support the most vulnerable in society. To this end we felt the need to make a proactive difference.</p>



<p>As a child I spent a significant period in hospital due to my struggle with TB and can empathise with what the children are going through. To date thousands of pounds worth of gifts have been distributed from my now 33 visits to Children’s Wards to Bradford Royal Infirmary and Airedale Hospital Children’s Wards and those hundreds of smiles of innocent poorly children has certainly enriched me and humbled me.</p>

<p>The reinstated Suella Braverman has admitted to sending government documents to her personal email address six times during her first stint as home secretary. This is on top of the security breach that led to her resignation.</p>



<p>Since her reinstatement by Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman’s reappointment has been embroiled in a row with opposition parties and even some Tory MPs.</p>



<p>But Downing Street says Mr Sunak has &#8220;full confidence&#8221; in her &#8211; but she is likely to face questions from opposition MPs in the Commons at some point.</p>



<p>Asked whether Prime Minister Rishi Sunak believed MI5 had confidence in Ms Braverman, his official spokesperson said: &#8220;Yes, the home secretary continues to have strong relationships with all the operational bodies that report into the Home Office and are focused very much on keeping the country safe.&#8221;</p>



<p>Asked if Mr Sunak was concerned security analysts might be reluctant to share information with the Home Office, the official said: &#8220;No, and any suggestion of that would be entirely false.&#8221;</p>



<p>Separately, opposition parties and some Tory MPs have also questioned Ms Braverman&#8217;s reappointment as home secretary after she admitted sending an official document to someone not authorised to receive it.</p>



<p>She stepped down from her cabinet position on 19th October 2022, and after admitting two breaches of the ministerial code by sending confidential material via a private email account. She admitted committing a &#8220;technical infringement&#8221; of the rules.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility; I resign,&#8221; she wrote in her resignation letter.</p>



<p>However, just six days later Mr Sunak reappointed Ms Braverman as home secretary.</p>



<p>It came two days after Ms Braverman had thrown her support behind him in the contest to replace Ms Truss, in what was widely seen as a significant endorsement by an influential figure on the right of the Conservative Party.</p>



<p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the new prime minister of giving Ms Braverman a job in exchange for her support.</p>



<p>Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for inquiries into Ms Braverman&#8217;s appointment.</p>



<p>Jake Berry &#8211; who served as party chairman under Ms Truss but was fired by Mr Sunak &#8211; has also questioned Ms Braverman&#8217;s return to the cabinet, saying there had been &#8220;multiple breaches&#8221; of the rules.</p>



<p>He told Talk TV that Ms Braverman had sent a document &#8220;from a private email address to another MP, she then sought to copy in that individual&#8217;s wife but accidentally sent it to a staffer in Parliament&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;To me, that seems to be a really serious breach &#8211; the cabinet secretary had his say at the time. I doubt he has changed his mind in the last six days,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>New party chairman Nadhim Zahawi defended Ms Braverman&#8217;s reappointment, saying he believed in &#8220;redemption&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;The prime minister looked at this case and he decided to give her a second chance,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Three people have been arrested after a joint operation between the National Crime Agency and the Belgian Federal Police foiled an attempt to smuggle migrants to the UK using a high-powered rigid hulled inflatable boat (RHIB).</p>



<p>Belgian officers arrested two men, aged 34 and 44 from Basingstoke, on suspicion of people smuggling offences as they arrived on the coast near Nieuwpoort at 4.30am on Sunday 30 October. Twelve migrants, believed to be Albanian nationals, were also detained.</p>



<p>A third man, aged 46, was arrested by the NCA in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, later the same day on suspicion of assisting unlawful immigration. He remains in custody and is being questioned.</p>



<p>The group are alleged to be part of a gang organising a series of people smuggling runs to the UK from Europe.</p>



<p>NCA Branch Commander Colin Williams said: “We believe this operation has disrupted a suspected organised crime group involved in bring people to the UK illegally.</p>



<p>“Attempts to reach the UK by small boat are extremely dangerous and people smugglers do not care about the safety of their passengers.</p>



<p>“Working closely with partners including Belgian Federal Police, Border Force and Immigration Enforcement, these arrests show that the NCA will work across international borders to target people smuggling gangs.”</p>



<p>Belgian Public Prosecutor Frank Demeester said: “The fight against organised human smuggling is an absolute priority for the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of West-Flanders.</p>



<p>“That is why the Belgian Federal Police have deployed significant resources to thwart these acts of human smuggling. We want to avoid at all costs, that people are put in danger on the North Sea. By now it is common knowledge that international cooperation with British colleagues from the NCA and with our European partners is very good within this phenomenon.”</p>



<p>The NCA alone has more than 60 live investigations into networks or individuals in the top tier of organised immigration crime or human trafficking.</p>



<p>Much of this criminality sits outside of the UK and the NCA has built up our intelligence sharing effort with law enforcement partners in Belgium, France and beyond.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of teenagers in the UK who have not yet claimed their matured Child Trust Funds savings could have thousands of pounds waiting for them, reminds HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>



<p>Child Trust Funds are long-term savings accounts set up for every child born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011. To encourage future saving and start the account, the government provided an initial deposit of at least £250.</p>



<p>The savings accounts mature when the child turns 18 years old. Eligible teenagers, who are aged 18 or over and have yet to access their Child Trust Fund account, could have savings waiting for them worth an average of £2,100.</p>



<p>If teenagers or their parents and guardians already know who their Child Trust Fund provider is, they can contact them directly. This might be a bank, building society or other savings provider.</p>



<p>Alternatively, they can visit <a href="https://www.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOV.UK</a> and complete an online form to find out where their Child Trust Fund is held.</p>



<p>Many eligible teenagers who have yet to claim their savings might be starting university, apprenticeships or their first job. The lump-sum amount could offer a financial boost at a time when they need it most.</p>



<p>Angela MacDonald, HMRC’s Second Permanent Secretary and Deputy Chief Executive, said: “Teenagers could have a pot of money waiting for them worth thousands of pounds and not even realise it. We want to help you access your savings and the money you’re entitled to.</p>



<p>An estimated 6.3 million Child Trust Fund accounts were set up throughout the duration of the scheme, containing about £9 billion. If a parent or guardian was not able to set up an account for their child, HMRC opened a savings account on the child’s behalf.</p>



<p>Teenagers aged 16 or over can take control of their own Child Trust Fund if they wish, although the funds can only be withdrawn once they turn 18 years old.</p>



<p>Where children have a Child Trust Fund, families can still pay in up to £9,000 a year tax-free. The account matures once the child turns 18 years old and no further money can be deposited. They can either withdraw the funds from the matured Child Trust Fund account or reinvest it into another savings account.</p>



<p>Until the child withdraws or transfers the money, it stays in an account that no-one else has access to.</p>



<p>The Child Trust Fund scheme closed in January 2011 and was replaced with Junior Individual Savings Accounts (ISA).</p>

<ul class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><li>81% of South Asian’s surveyed said that nurses have made a positive impact in their life or the life of a loved one</li><li>Just over two in five&nbsp;(41%)&nbsp; South Asians surveyed agree they&nbsp;would consider a career in nursing</li><li>The new ‘We Are The NHS’ campaign highlights the rewarding and diverse range of nursing roles available within the NHS</li></ul>



<p>Now in its fifth year, NHS England&#8217;s ‘We Are The NHS’ campaign has been revamped to champion the extraordinary work of South Asian nurses and inspire a new cohort to consider a career in the health service.</p>



<p>The campaign highlights the range of nursing specialisms across the NHS, including in learning disabilities, mental health, adult and children’s nursing. It features a South Asian nurse, who is proud to showcase the many ways that nursing has a positive impact every day, on patients and on himself.</p>



<p>Pratap Perseeddoss, a nurse at Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, and now star of the new ‘We Are The NHS’ campaign said: “It’s a very rewarding role. </p>



<p>&#8220;I enjoy interacting with patients and listening to any concerns or feedback they might have &#8211; this is absolutely crucial to ensuring you can provide the best possible care.”</p>



<p>After completing his nursing degree at London South Bank University, Pratap is now a Nurse Consultant. </p>

<p>Candidates for university nursing courses have access to a support system to guide them step by step through the application process, alongside tailored support. Annual payments of at least £5,000 are also available to help nursing students with their studies.</p>



<p>“A career in nursing is one of the most dynamic and rewarding roles the NHS has to offer,” said Pratap. </p>



<p>“With ongoing training and endless opportunities to progress, I am sure a career in nursing will transform your life, as it has done mine. </p>



<p>&#8220;Being in a workplace that allows you to grow and bring your whole authentic self to work everyday is what enables me to deliver the best possible healthcare.&#8221;</p>



<p>After graduating, nursing is the UK’s most employable profession with 94% of graduates gaining employment within the first six months of leaving university. Once qualified, there are many opportunities to further develop through additional training or by focusing on specific areas, such as trauma, orthopaedics or neonatal care.</p>



<p>To help those who are unsure of what to specialise in, the ‘We Are The NHS’ campaign has also launched a quiz to raise awareness of the plethora of nursing roles available and to help people find out which nursing role they would be best suited to which is available <a href="https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/we-are-the-nhs/nursing-careers/quiz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a></p>



<p>The campaign aims to increase applications for both degree courses and direct entry jobs, seeking to build upon the existing 1.2 million-strong workforce and to shine a light on the incredible work they do in multicultural adverts across TV, cinemas, radio and billboards.</p>



<p>Dr Navina Evans, recently appointed Chief Workforce Officer at NHSE, said: “I am proud to support this new recruitment campaign. </p>

<p>&#8220;The NHS’s greatest strength is in the diversity of our people. Nurses from multicultural communities across the UK are the backbone of our national health service and the contributions they make every day must be celebrated.”</p>



<p>Marimouttou Coumarassamy, Founder and Chair of the British Indian Nursing Association, commnted: “When I first arrived from India to work as a nurse in the UK, I was pleasantly surprised by the respect given to the nursing profession. </p>

<p>&#8220;Throughout my career, I have been supported through various learning opportunities, which have helped me to grow as a compassionate and inclusive leader. </p>



<p>&#8220;I am proud to be part of the NHS family and would encourage others to choose a career in nursing.&#8221;</p>
