  <title>Russia’s Dirty Bomb Claim Is a Dirty Lie</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/russias-dirty-bomb-claim-dirty-lie</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;In the latest in a series of outlandish &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/russias-claim-chemical-bio-labs-ukraine-ruse"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; and nefarious &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/how-russia-might-deploy-nukes-ukraine-war"&gt;threats&lt;/a&gt; involving weapons of mass destruction during its war on Ukraine, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/24/dirty-bomb-russia-ukraine-war/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3835fe3%2F6356b9f2f3d9003c581988dc%2F596c38359bbc0f20865611c8%2F16%2F72%2F6356b9f2f3d9003c581988dc&amp;wp_cu=606b268a0619370b8a17d2a4df8be7b3%7CC0E249D8BBEB3FB5E0430100007FF646"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; now asserts that Kyiv plans to explode a “dirty bomb” on its own soil, blaming the radioactive act on Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Russian &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/24/dirty-bomb-russia-ukraine-war/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3835fe3%2F6356b9f2f3d9003c581988dc%2F596c38359bbc0f20865611c8%2F16%2F72%2F6356b9f2f3d9003c581988dc&amp;wp_cu=606b268a0619370b8a17d2a4df8be7b3%7CC0E249D8BBEB3FB5E0430100007FF646"&gt;allegation&lt;/a&gt; reportedly came in phone calls last weekend between Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and some Western defense ministers, including U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-hits-ukraine-homes-evacuates-kherson-warns-escalation-2022-10-24/"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; reportedly is going to bring this issue before the U.N. Security Council this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/24/dirty-bomb-russia-ukraine-war/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3835fe3%2F6356b9f2f3d9003c581988dc%2F596c38359bbc0f20865611c8%2F16%2F72%2F6356b9f2f3d9003c581988dc&amp;wp_cu=606b268a0619370b8a17d2a4df8be7b3%7CC0E249D8BBEB3FB5E0430100007FF646"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; rejected the latest Russian disinformation attempt out of hand, seeing it as an effort to justify the significant escalation in violence recently meted out by Moscow’s forces on Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyiv also offered to open two nuclear sites to inspectors from the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/iaea-preparing-inspect-two-sites-ukraine-over-dirty-bomb-claims-2022-10-24/"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; to debunk Moscow’s accusation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow also likely is trying to undermine outside support for Kyiv with this outrageous allegation, believing that Washington, Paris, London, and NATO would see such a plan by Kyiv as particularly egregious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so what is a so-called dirty bomb?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dirty bomb is a weapon that uses conventional high explosives to spread radioactive material that could be potentially gathered from common research, industrial, energy, and medical (e.g., nuclear medicine) sources and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a bomb might be planted on foot or moved in a vehicle to the location of the target. A sophisticated missile or delivery system is not required; a dirty bomb can be relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the explosive yield of the weapon and the amount of radioactive material contained within, it could be used to target a relatively small area such as an important government building, civilian apartments, or a few city blocks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a dirty bomb is not a nuclear weapon per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explosion of a dirty bomb wouldn’t produce the tremendous pressures, temperatures, and electromagnetic pulses characteristic of a strategic or tactical nuclear weapon found today in Russia’s, China’s, or America’s military arsenals, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be no classic mushroom cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon detonation, a dirty bomb would disperse invisible, potentially life-threatening levels of radioactivity, which then possibly could move beyond the blast area via wind currents, affecting more people as well as food and water sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the explosive yield of the dirty bomb, it might not even cause a significant number of casualties. But victims who are not killed by the blast could be harmed over time by exposure to the radioactive material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release of radioactive material in an area likely would hamper rescue and recovery operations—even make the blast area uninhabitable for a period due to the contamination. Chaos and refugee flows are possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a dirty bomb is more a weapon of mass disruption than a weapon of mass destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of its potentially significant political and psychological impact, the availability of materials, and relative simplicity of construction, serious concern arose about terrorist use of a dirty bomb after the 9/11 attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, that never came to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the likelihood of Kyiv’s detonating a dirty bomb on its own soil—but blaming Moscow—is zero, Russian use of a dirty bomb (or other nuclear weapon) in Ukraine is not, considering the recent desperate state of Russia’s military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escalation across the nuclear threshold in Ukraine with a Russian tactical nuclear weapon—or dirty bomb—is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is for sure: Russia’s attempts at &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/russias-claim-chemical-bio-labs-ukraine-ruse"&gt;disinformation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/how-russia-might-deploy-nukes-ukraine-war"&gt;nuclear blackmail&lt;/a&gt; are sure to continue as Moscow presses its widely destabilizing, unjust war on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The Battle Over Parents’ Rights in Education Is Just Getting Started</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/the-battle-over-parents-rights-education-just-getting-started</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise that parents have been fighting for their rights so vociferously when it comes to public education. They’re fighting because they sense that those rights are under attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/health/restrictions-lockdowns-confusion-coronavirus-intl/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;lockdowns in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time, many parents suddenly saw, courtesy of online conferencing apps like Zoom, what their kids were being taught. And they didn’t like it: &lt;a href="https://www.city-journal.org/yes-critical-race-theory-is-being-taught-in-schools" target="_blank"&gt;Toxic and divisive ideas about race&lt;/a&gt;—disguised as lessons on slavery and racism—contradicted the belief in racial equality that most Americans—whatever their politics—shared with civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But critical race theory is far less shocking than the radical&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/10/health/gender-identity-explainer-wellness/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; gender ideology&lt;/a&gt; that seems to have overtaken our nation’s schools. It teaches children that “some people are boys, some people are girls, some people are both, neither, or somewhere in between”’—as &lt;a href="https://www.prideandlessprejudice.org/book-gallery/it-feels-good-to-be-yourself" target="_blank"&gt;one popular children’s book&lt;/a&gt; puts it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools are promoting the notion that some kids—perhaps many kids if recent trends continue—are born in the wrong body. Suddenly, from Florida to Texas to Wyoming, parents are discovering that schools are teaching, seemingly across the curriculum, that an internal sense of gender trumps biological sex. Worse, some schools are changing, at their students’ request—but &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/08/20/gender-transition-identity-montgomery-county/" target="_blank"&gt;without their parents’ knowledge&lt;/a&gt; or consent—their students’ names and pronouns to conform to a child’s surprising new “gender identity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/americas-school-choice-moment-cant-be-missed-midterm-elections"&gt;America’s School Choice Moment Can’t Be Missed at Midterm Elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When parents come to school board meetings to complain, far too many are met with silence or risible accusations that they are politicizing education. Parents have the primary right and responsibility to raise and teach their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many parents delegate part of the teaching task to schools, in an act of trust. Rather than acting as faithful stewards of that trust, too many schools have decided that it’s their job to alienate kids from “regressive” views of their parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it any wonder that this has proved controversial?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could dissipate some of the heat by increasing the rights of parents over their children’s schooling. States should connect school money to children, rather than to school buildings. Universal school choice for everyone—rich and poor, conservative and liberal—would not just make schools better and more competitive. It would make them less of an arena for the culture war that is otherwise roiling our culture.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How the Media’s “Save Democracy” Crusade Threatens Democracy</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/commentary/how-the-medias-save-democracy-crusade-threatens-democracy</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Americans are getting fed up with the mainstream media using leftist narratives that undermine trust in democracy and our election system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent New York Times/Sienna poll found &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/majority-registered-voters-media-threat-democracy-poll-finds" target="_blank"&gt;59 percent of Americans&lt;/a&gt; consider the “mainstream media” a threat to democracy—outranking either President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it has been corporate media such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and MSNBC that have driven the absurd narrative that American democracy is on death’s door. These media outlets have obligingly helped the left establish a template for explaining away a potential shift to the right in the 2022 midterms: blame Republican voter suppression. If the left can’t convince voters that Republicans are dangerous “election deniers” who will stamp out democracy, they’ll simply deny the legitimacy of the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tactic may seem familiar by now. Last year, corporate media happily hopped &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/flashback-cnn-msnbc-ran-jim-crow-voter-suppression-claims-georgia-record-turnout" target="_blank"&gt;on board&lt;/a&gt; with Stacey Abrams labeling as “Jim Crow 2.0” the commonsense election integrity laws passed by Georgia and some two dozen other states. Echoing Abrams, they smeared these reforms—such as extending voter ID to absentee ballots, requiring accurate voter registration rolls, and restricting ballot harvesting—as “voter suppression” or “restrictive voting laws.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/commentary/dont-fall-democrats-voter-suppression-myths"&gt;Don’t Fall for Democrats’ "Voter Suppression" Myths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These laws neither suppressed nor restricted voting. These states have since experienced massive turnouts for both primaries and early voting. But petty facts haven’t dampened the left’s narrative or the media’s willingness to keep parroting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/midterm-elections-voter-restrictions-republicans-rcna51465" target="_blank"&gt;MSNBC pundits&lt;/a&gt; still insist voter ID laws put the “thumb on the scale” for the Republicans. Vox seemed almost disappointed at the large number of people voting after the reforms took effect, doggedly insisting in a September headline that “&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/19/23356904/voter-suppression-midterm-elections" target="_blank"&gt;High voter turnout doesn’t cancel out voter suppression&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early this year, Biden wrote in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/potus/status/1483444483140329479" target="_blank"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, “Jim Crow 2.0 is about two insidious things: voter suppression and election subversion.” And, at a press conference, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-election-legitimacy-comments-white-house-clarification/" target="_blank"&gt;Biden said&lt;/a&gt;, “I think it easily could be—be illegitimate,” and “I’m not going to say it’s going to be legit” unless Democrat voting legislation passed Congress. The legislation didn’t pass, and it seems likely that final tallies on Nov. 8 will make it difficult to sell the narrative that Republicans rigged the elections with voter suppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than scrutinize Democrat legislation pushed by Biden that would effectively nationalize elections and nullify clean election laws, The New York Times dutifully ran a headline, “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/19/us/biden-voting-rights-filibuster" target="_blank"&gt;Democrats Fail to Change Filibuster Rules as Republicans Block Action on Voting Rights&lt;/a&gt;.” Other &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/politics/biden-atlanta-voting-rights-speech/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-voting-rights-filibuster/2022/01/11/ada7ce66-72dd-11ec-b202-b9b92330d4fa_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-under-pressure-chart-voting-rights-path-atlanta-speech-n1287255" target="_blank"&gt;desired&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://time.com/6138696/joe-biden-voting-rights-filibuster/" target="_blank"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-supports-changing-filibuster-rule-pass-voting-rights/story?id=82187118" target="_blank"&gt;characterization&lt;/a&gt; of being for voting rights or against voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/desantis-voter-fraud-arrests-are-voter-suppression-tactic-n1300040" target="_blank"&gt;Democrats and the media&lt;/a&gt; are accusing one of the left’s boogeymen, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, of voter suppression because the state’s Office of Election Crimes and Security oversaw dozens of arrests for alleged voter fraud in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of these defendants say local government employees misled them into registering to vote when they were ineligible. That might well be the case. Even if you accept the premise that the arrests went overboard, the arrests were of ineligible voters. To qualify as voter suppression, they would have had to prevent eligible voters from either registering or voting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the media tamely follows the left’s narrative on election integrity, the general public doesn’t seem to buy it. A recent &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/403052/eight-americans-favor-early-voting-photo-laws.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt; found that 79 percent of Americans support voter ID laws, with majorities across racial and partisan demographics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, Rolling Stone tried a new wrinkle on the old narrative. Marrying two of the left’s obsessions, the magazine &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/transgender-rights-voter-id-republicans-voting-1234615400/" target="_blank"&gt;ran a piece&lt;/a&gt; citing a UCLA study claiming that voter ID laws disproportionately harm the transgender community. Rolling Stone’s claim is that about 65,000 transgender people in battleground states won’t have the right ID to vote, and “That’s enough suppressed votes to swing an election.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/commentary/election-integrity-and-the-american-republic"&gt;Election Integrity and the American Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxpayer-funded PBS took a more historic tack. Its story, “&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/low-literacy-voters-struggle-to-cast-ballots-in-the-face-of-restrictive-voting-laws" target="_blank"&gt;Low literacy voters struggle to cast ballots in the face of restrictive voting laws&lt;/a&gt;,” trotted out the &lt;a href="https://www.congressionalresearch.org/SecretBallot.html" target="_blank"&gt;same argument&lt;/a&gt; used in the late 1800s to oppose the secret ballot. Some of these arguments deal with ballot harvesting—the practice of political operatives collecting and distributing mass quantities of ballots. Ballot harvesting clearly opens the door to violating the principle of a private ballot, since political operatives can stare over people’s shoulders while they vote. It also raises chain-of-custody questions and poses a danger of ballot tampering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s highly unlikely that these fearmongering predictions of “voter suppression” will ever pan out. Just as voting increased in 2022 after the discredited “Jim Crow 2.0” rhetoric, &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25522" target="_blank"&gt;various studies&lt;/a&gt; show voter ID laws have never negatively affected voter turnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a stretch to say the media actually threatens the existence of democracy, as the New York Times poll suggests a majority believes. But a free and honest press is vital to our political system. And when the bulk of media outlets remain committed to a partisan narrative despite a plethora of facts and evidence to the contrary, it isn’t healthy for the press or democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is the Administrative State Causing American Decline?</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/the-administrative-state-causing-american-decline</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Americans have been losing trust in key institutions for nearly two generations. The reality is that those institutions—government, media, corporations, and education—have been in a state of decay for decades, the real-world effects of which are beginning to manifest on increasingly large scales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="110px" src="https://embed.acast.com/620434e2b240340012574bcd/636286d2ee449b0013687c56" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yuval Levin joins today’s episode of The Kevin Roberts Show to detail the origins of the current state of our institutions, why Americans have lost trust in them, and the standards we ought to hold them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuval shares how his experience becoming a U.S. citizen has informed his worldview and helped to forge his career path defending the constitutional principles we hold dear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuval Levin, Ph.D., is the Director of Social, Cultural, and Constitutional Studies at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). He is the founder and editor of National Affairs and is an opinion writer at the New York Times. Under George W. Bush, Dr. Levin was a member of the White House domestic policy staff and the executive director of the President’s Council on Bioethics.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>America’s School Choice Moment Can’t Be Missed at Midterm Elections</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/americas-school-choice-moment-cant-be-missed-midterm-elections</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;The politics of education have changed so much, so quickly in the COVID-19 era that universal school choice—an unattainable ideal for generations of reformers—has suddenly become a middle-of-the-road position for most Americans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universal education choice should be a ripe campaign issue for state candidates this fall and the top policy priority for newly elected state legislatures in the new year. The watchword is very simple: trust parents, not bureaucracies; and fund students, not systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just a slogan. In Arizona, it’s now policy. Thanks to legislation signed by Gov. Doug Ducey this summer, from now on, instead of sending dollars to school districts, every student in the state will receive $7,000 in an Education Savings Account to use at any school or for any educational approach, every year, from kindergarten through high school.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reason other states—Texas, in particular—should not follow suit. The Lone Star State is surrounded by neighbors that have embraced education choice: Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. And let’s be frank: because of its size and influence, Texas achieving universal school choice would create even greater momentum for passing similar legislation in other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/parents-lead-the-nation-school-choice"&gt;Parents Lead the Nation on School Choice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gov. Greg Abbott and the 88th Texas legislature are perfectly positioned to earn a mandate for enacting universal statewide education choice, and then to lead a state-by-state movement to make parental empowerment and ESAs the new standard of reform nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not far away in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis continues to support expansions of the state’s education savings account, voucher, and tax credit scholarship programs, which are enabling nearly 200,000 students to select a learning environment that fits their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A February poll by RealClear Opinion Research found that 72 percent of Americans (including 68 percent of Democrats) support school choice, while only 18 percent oppose. A majority of Americans now rate public schools as unsatisfactory, and some 1.2 million schoolchildren have transferred out of them since the beginning of the pandemic. Arizona, a purple state with two Democrat senators and a blue congressional delegation—just created the nation’s first universal school choice program: an education savings account option open for every single Arizona family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These trends may surprise political insiders who accept the media’s framing of school choice as a controversial idea. But they shouldn’t. It’s not just that most Americans support school choice; between private and magnet schools, charters, homeschooling, and parents who chose their residence for the school district, most American families already exercise some kind of school choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This School Choice Moment is the silver lining of the left’s disastrous mismanagement of American schools since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The teachers' unions, elected progressives, and media elites who long styled themselves as defenders of public education now brazenly debase it: closing schools, masking and indoctrinating students in defiance of scientific and historical fact, conspiring against parental authority, even covering up crimes and siccing the FBI on moms and dads who objected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lest anyone forget, America’s K-12 schools were in crisis before COVID-19. The vast majority of students perform below grade-level proficiency in reading, writing, civics, history, and math. That was the case pre-pandemic, and it continues today. Boys, in particular, have fallen so far behind that U.S. classrooms are no longer equal opportunity environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Great Awokening" and COVID-theater school closures only slathered racist, homophobic, anti-family sociopathy, and anti-scientific superstition onto an already dysfunctional system desperate for reform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that however far Left the education establishment has lurched since 2020—"Math is racist! Kindergartners are trans! Parents are idiots! America is evil! And oh by the way, we’re still going remote, suckers!"—the Overton Window has shifted just as far in the opposite direction.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In education today, it’s the status quo that is harmful and divisive; school choice is the non-partisan compromise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/arizona-parents-show-how-beat-the-teachers-unions"&gt;Arizona Parents Show How To Beat the Teachers’ Unions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservatives have never had an opportunity like this on the education issue before. Come to think of it, conservatives haven’t had an opportunity like this on any issue, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to seize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is there any reason for conservative reformers to aim lower. We both support measures to protect students from the racist ideas of critical race theory in classrooms, protect girls’ sports, and the like. But conservatives should not miss the forest for the trees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universal education choice would do more to combat woke indoctrination and student endangerment than all those targeted reforms put together.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not often that politics and policy line up so neatly, especially for conservatives. But right now, the question Americans are asking is not whether parental choice in education is a good idea, but instead how it should be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering that question is how the right can craft a successful and popular governing agenda for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Scholz Kowtows to Beijing</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/scholz-kowtows-beijing</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 3-4, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will lead a delegation of German business leaders to Beijing, &lt;a href="https://www.thelocal.de/20221026/explained-why-is-olaf-scholzs-stance-on-china-so-controversial-in-germany/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;becoming&lt;/a&gt; the first G7 leader to visit China since the start of the pandemic. His timing is inopportune. The visit comes amid a firestorm of controversy ignited by the German Cabinet’s approval of Chinese state-owned COSCO’s purchase of a 24.9% stake in a terminal in Hamburg, Germany’s largest port.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision was pushed through by Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) over the objections of his coalition partners. The foreign ministry, led by the Greens Annalena Baerbock, is said to be apoplectic, as are the government ministries led by the Free Democratic Party (FDP). The Greens and FDP reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/german-cabinet-approves-investment-by-chinas-cosco-hamburg-port-terminal-sources-2022-10-26/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;drafted a note&lt;/a&gt; saying the decision, "disproportionately expands China's strategic influence on German and European transport infrastructure as well as Germany's dependence on China."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPD argues that COSCO’s stake is less than the 35% they had desired, and the Chinese enterprise cannot exceed its current stake without passing further investment review. That may be true, but it’s cold comfort for Scholz’s coalition partners, who have lately felt put upon.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholz’s decision also runs counter to an overarching trend in the U.S. and Europe, at least in terms of infrastructure acquisitions, toward greater wariness of the security risks associated with Chinese investments. Given all we know about China’s predatory business practices, total disregard for human rights (Xinjiang concentration camps, crackdowns on dissent in Hong Kong), and utter contempt for the laws of sovereign nations (recent revelations of illegal Chinese “police” stations in the Netherlands), Germany’s decision seems even more jarring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/europe/commentary/3-seas-initiative-americas-opportunity-europe-advance-national-interests"&gt;3 Seas Initiative: America’s Opportunity in Europe to Advance National Interests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision is, however, consistent with Scholz’s determination to strengthen Germany’s already deep economic ties with China. He is following a path blazed by his predecessor, Christian Democrat Chancellor Angela Merkel. For six years running, China has been Germany’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/14/germany-drawing-up-new-china-trade-policy-vows-no-more-naivety.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;largest trading partner&lt;/a&gt;, and even that may understate the importance of the Chinese market for German exports. For instance, China remains the largest market for Germany’s politically powerful automotive industry. More than one out of every three German cars produced is sold in China.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though aware of his nation’s dependence on China, Scholz does not wish to backtrack. He recently stated that, “Decoupling is the wrong answer.” Rather, he hopes that over time, Germany can diversify its investments and export market enough to lessen its dependence on China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hope appears to be untethered from current reality. German companies continue to pour money into China. BMW, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/scholz-plans-china-visit-around-nov-3-4-ahead-of-g-20-summit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchased&lt;/a&gt; “a controlling stake in its car-making joint-venture… [and] opened a multibillion-dollar factory extension early this year in Shenyang.” Other German firms like Audi and chemical giant BASF are soon to open large plants in China.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, Germany’s FDP economy minister &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-new-china-policy-will-not-be-naive-economy-minister-2022-09-13/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; “no more naivety” in regard to Germany’s trading relations with China. Scholz isn’t naïve, yet unfortunately believes he has no better option. He continues to court the CCP despite every known risk. In line with this view, since taking office, he has consistently &lt;a href="https://euobserver.com/tickers/153903" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sought to resuscitate&lt;/a&gt; the thankfully comatose China-EU Investment Agreement, a deal with myriad pitfalls.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even putting the security risks aside, the Scholz approach entails long-term economic risks. Chinese firms are cannibalizing Germany industry, using intellectual property gained via partnership arrangements or outright theft to gain market share in China as well as in Europe. China’s solar industry has already decimated its German rivals. Now, German carmakers are fighting tooth and nail for electric vehicle market share inside China, even as their Chinese rivals &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/791720d0-df91-4973-99cc-e847a8caab39" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launch a renewed&lt;/a&gt; push to gain a foothold in Germany’s domestic EV market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key factor for the German government is the overall health of the economy. Germany can no longer rely on cheap Russian energy to keep its economy humming. Energy costs in Germany are now 7-10 times what they were a year ago. This is having an especially deleterious impact on German manufacturing, causing many companies to move production away from Europe to cheaper shores, including China.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/asia/report/responding-the-china-challenge-blueprint-20"&gt;Responding to the China Challenge: Blueprint 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholz, however, fails to appreciate the symbiotic relationship between China and Russia. Strengthening ties to China means strengthening Russia’s hand in Europe. This weakens the West’s collective ability to push back against Beijing’s and Moscow’s systematic assault on democratic principles.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Germany’s moral position is compromised by its relations with Beijing. Scholz raised “the situation of the Uighurs in Xinjiang,” in his &lt;a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/chancellor-scholz-un-2128398" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;September speech&lt;/a&gt; at the UN General Assembly. But by doubling down on trade ties and departing post haste for Beijing on the heels of Xi’s latest consolidation of power and continuing belligerence toward Taiwan, he undermines any serious effort to hold China accountable for its abuses.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Chancellor, the precarious state of the German economy undoubtedly confirms his belief that its reliance on China is a strength to be drawn on rather than a liability. Yet, burrowing deeper into economic dependence on Beijing isn’t healthy in the long run and raises serious issues in the here and now—none of which the Scholz government seems to have an answer for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor’s upcoming visit to China and Hamburg port decision are a slap in the face of his coalition partners. These acts have also opened rifts with other European nations like France. And they have surely confirmed to Washington that too many in Europe remain comfortable with the Faustian bargain inherent in arriving cap in hand at the court of Xi.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>“Is There a U.S.-China Cold War” Is the Wrong Question</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/asia/commentary/there-us-china-cold-war-the-wrong-question</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s not call the U.S.-China competition a “cold war.” This ongoing conflict ought to have a name all its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the term “Cold War” encourages oldthink. It suggests that we’ve been here before and therefore can manage this challenge in the same way we managed—and won—the decadeslong standoff with the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a dangerous idea. Today’s standoff with Beijing is as different as World War II was from World War I. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union was a monstrous military machine and a struggling economic power. China is a massive economic competitor and a rising military challenge. The threats have to be seen differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/asia/commentary/americas-dependence-china-crisis-the-making"&gt;America’s Dependence on China Is a Crisis in the Making&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is simply not going to “contain” China. Indeed, Beijing already poses a global threat far beyond the scope of what Moscow ever achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, what the two competitions share is that we want to “win without fighting.” Of course, that doesn’t mean that force has no place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, for instance, Moscow underwrote wars with the U.S. in Korea and Vietnam, as well as global terrorism and insurgencies in Africa and Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, China has been happy to greenlight Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Still, Beijing and Washington don’t want a direct war with each because neither wants to risk the horrific consequences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, then, the Cold War comparison is apt. Both sides act like they are in a marathon and their goal is to finish far ahead. In the 1940s, George Kennan labeled this kind of competition as “measures short of war,” meaning a competitive, adversarial relationship that pulls up shy of a shooting war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t really care what we call this kind of war, as long as we acknowledge that it is a kind of war. And thus far, the Biden administration has not done that. It continues to act as if China is just a foreign-policy problem that can be managed by “competing where we must and cooperating where we can.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a complete misread of what must be done. Washington must understand that we are now in an existential struggle with China. Our interests do not and will not align.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To survive and thrive, the U.S. must conduct and win an economic war against China. Why? Because China is already waging economic warfare against us. The designs of the Chinese Communist Party are serious and dangerous. Beijing’s goal is a world without America. Uncontested, China has the vision and resources to achieve that objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/asia/commentary/the-china-challenge-xi-prepares-his-third-term-and-beyond"&gt;The China Challenge: Xi Prepares for His Third Term and Beyond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting the U.S. economy from Beijing’s debilitating exploitation and consequent malicious actions requires an offensive-defensive mix. Washington must vouchsafe Americans and their interests from Chinese actions that undermine U.S. competitiveness and prosperity. It must also take active deterrence measures to significantly reduce Beijing’s ability to threaten America and our allies. The U.S. must have a plan that will make economic aggression unaffordable for Beijing, while allowing the American economy to grow and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To win this kind of war, the U.S. must have a decade or more of unprecedented growth. That means removing needless Washington-imposed restraints on growth, re-establishing American energy dominance (including fossil fuels and nuclear energy), and curbing federal spending and the burgeoning national debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means also strengthening the U.S. military so China is deterred from thinking it could survive—let alone win—a military conflict. Washington has allowed our military to shrink and hollow out to the point that, for the first time ever, the annual “Index of U.S. Military Strength” now rates our hard power as “weak,” compared to mounting global threats. This trend must be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a new kind of war. Neither hot nor cold, but deadly serious. It’s time for Washington to acknowledge the danger and get serious about fighting back and winning. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The Blue City Murder Problem</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/report/the-blue-city-murder-problem</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Facts are powerful and stubborn things. Unfortunately, some on the Left have tried to advance their arguments by using facts about state murder rates that, while technically true, are at best meaningless when taken out of context and at worst misleading and downright dangerous when used as the basis for public policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the “Red State Murder Problem.” It sounds ominous, but it’s not. It is also highly misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those on the Left know that their soft-on-crime policies have wreaked havoc in the cities where they have implemented those policies. It is not hard to understand why “reforms” such as ending cash bail, defunding the police, refusing to prosecute entire categories of crimes, letting thousands of convicted felons out of prison early, significantly cutting the prison population, and other “progressive” ideas have led to massive spikes in crime—particularly violent crime, including murder—in the communities where those on the Left have implemented them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left-wing politicians and their backers recognize that rising crime rates and the lack of a general sense of safety that follows are a problem for them and their chances for reelection. In fact, recent polls show that voters care a lot about rising crime—an issue that is second only to rising, rampant inflation and the lackluster economy. So the Left is engaging in political traditions as old as time: obfuscation, finger pointing, and blame shifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One liberal organization—The Third Way—even went so far as to publish a “study” arguing that Republicans are actually to blame for the spike in murders across the country. The not-so-subtle suggestion the study pushes is that those on the Left are not responsible for rising crime rates because crime is rising everywhere—especially in Republican-led states. Fighting for their political survival, Left-wing politicians such as Gavin Newsom and Larry Krasner have recently started to parrot the “results” of this study.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Gavin Newsom@GavinNewsom, Twitter, October 18, 2022, 10:16 AM, https://twitter.com/gavinnewsom/status/1582375031278927872 (accessed November 2, 2022); Snejana Farberov, “Lefty Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner Says Crime Is Worse in ‘Trump States’ in Fiery Interview,” New York Post, September 30, 2022, https://nypost.com/2022/09/30/philly-da-larry-krasner-says-crime-worse-in-trump-states/ (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But crime tends to be a hyper-localized phenomenon. State-level data are generally meaningless—except as a tool with which to score political points. More to the point, when the crime statistics from the deep-blue big cities within these otherwise deep-red states are removed, what happens? The state-level crime rates fall—in some cases, dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Crime Trends&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, crime, including violent crime, has been declining across the United States since the peak of the last crime wave in 1992.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See William P. Barr, “Rising Crime Rates Are a Policy Choice,” The Wall Street Journal, October 26, 2022, https://www.wsj.com/articles/safe-streets​-are-a-policy-choice-incapacitation-incarceration-state-federal-prison-violent-crime-1990s-reagan-bush-barr-obama-sentencing-bail-11666785403 (accessed November 2, 222).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not surprisingly, since incarceration trails crime waves, incarceration rates have also been falling dramatically since they last peaked in 2008.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Barry Latzer, The Myth of Overpunishment: A Defense of the American Justice System and a Proposal to Reduce Incarceration While Protecting the Public (New York: Republic Book Publishers, 2022), p. 88.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, however, the 25-plus year drop in crime since 1992 has ended for many cities across the United States. The rise in crime, especially violent crime, started taking place around 2015 after the confluence of a series of events that took place over the course of a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those events include police-involved shootings of black community members,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post has a comprehensive database of every fatal shooting by an on-duty police officer in the United States since January 1, 2015. Since its inception, there have been more than 5,000 such shootings (as of October 18, 2022), including 1,695 blacks, 1,135 Hispanics, 3,204 whites, and 259 others. That represents 41 blacks per million, 29 Hispanics per million, 16 whites per million, and five per million for others. Over 95 percent of people shot and killed are males, more than 50 percent of whom were between 20 and 40 years old. See The Washington Post, “Fatal Force,” https://​www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/ (accessed November 2, 2022). Some of the names of those shot and killed by the police have been household names and rallying cries in the so-called social justice movement in the United States, which started in earnest in 2014 after the death of Eric Garner in July 2014. Subjected to a choke hold by NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo, Garner said “I can’t breathe” numerous times and later died. His death was classified as a homicide, but the officer was not indicted, and an uproar followed across the country. A month later, in Ferguson, Missouri, Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown after Brown had resisted arrest, fled, and then attacked Officer Wilson. Wilson was not charged. After 2014, other blacks shot by police that rose to national attention and fueled racial strife and unrest across the country included Freddie Gray in Baltimore in 2015; Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2020; and George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, also in 2020.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the defund the police movement,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Democratic mayors, city council members, state legislators, and Democratic Members of Congress have all called for defunding the police in recent years. The Republican Study Committee has compiled a list of Members of Congress who have called for defunding the police. See Republican Study Committee, “Looking Back: Democrats Push to Defund the Police,” https://rsc-banks.house.gov/democrats-push-defund-police (accessed November 2, 2022). Eventually, calls to defund the police backfired on the Democrats as it became clear that cutting the size of police departments, especially in high-crime areas, only harmed the residents of those cities and caused voters, including Democrats, to feel unsafe in their own cities. No doubt realizing that calling for defunding the police was an albatross around the Democratic Party’s neck, President Joe Biden, during his March 2022 State of the Union Address to the nation, said, “We should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.” See “Remarks of President Joe Biden—State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery,” The White House, March 1, 2022, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/01/remarks-of-president-joe​-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-delivered/ (accessed November 2, 2022). Emphasis in original. Despite the President’s rhetoric and attempt at damage control, the fact is that defunding of police department budgets and repeated calls to defund the police have become a political liability going into the 2022 midterm elections.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the election of rogue prosecutors funded or inspired by George Soros and other elitist billionaires,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Charles D.

Crime was rising in select cities across the country before the global COVID-19 pandemic struck in March 2020, but it rose even more significantly after the death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cumulative effect of these events contributed to and in large part set the conditions for increased crime across much of the country, especially in cities where the toxic trio of rogue prosecutors, defund the police zealotry, and demonization/demoralization of the police existed. In those cities and others with some mixture of this toxic trio crime has exploded across most categories, including but not limited to murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the old saying goes, the best defense is a good offense. So instead of defending their calls to defund the police, the elections of pro-criminal rogue prosecutors, or their pattern and practice of demonizing police, some on the Left have decided to flip the narrative and argue that it is the Republican states that have the real crime rate problem, especially when it comes to murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Red State Murder Herring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 15, 2022, a left-wing advocacy organization called The Third Way published a 15-page study with the provocative title “The Red State Murder Problem.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Kylie Murdock and Jim Kessler, “The Red State Murder Problem,” Third Way Report, March 15, 2022, http://thirdway.imgix.net/pdfs/the-red-state​-murder-problem.pdf (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Written by Jim Kessler, a long-time Democratic policy director to Representative/Senator Charles “Chuck” Schumer, and Kylie Murdock, a former intern for Congresswoman Barbara Lee and volunteer for Elizabeth Warren for President, the study states that “murder rates are far higher in Trump-voting red states than Biden-voting blue states.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Ibid., p. 2.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So that the reader won’t miss the political drift, the authors add, “And sometimes, murder rates are highest in cities with Republican mayors.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “crime rate” is the number of crimes reported to law enforcement agencies for every 100,000 persons within a given population. It is calculated by dividing the number of reported crimes by the total population. The result is then multiplied by 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, dozens of media outlets, including &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Dana Milbank, “It’s Just Murder Living in a Red State,” The Washington Post, October 11, 2022, https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022​/10/11/republican-states-crime-rates-tuberville/ (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Hill&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Jim Kessler, “We Have a Murder Problem in America—Especially in Red States,” The Hill, April 20, 2022 https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign​/3274797-we-have-a-murder-problem-in-america-especially-in-red-states/ (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Inside Edition&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Inside Edition Staff, “Red States Have Higher Murder Rates Than Blue States, According to New Study,” Inside Edition, April 6, 2022, https://www​.insideedition.com/red-states-have-higher-murder-rates-than-blue-states-according-to-new-study-74227 (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Politifact,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Jill Terreri Ramos, “In Claim About Crime in Other States, Context Needed,” Poynter Institute, PolitiFact, April 16, 2022 https://www.politifact.com​/factchecks/2022/apr/16/crystal-peoples-stokes/claim-about-crime-other-states-context-needed/ (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Daily Beast,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Michael Daly, “McCarthy Blames Crime on Dems While It Rages in His GOP-Led Hometown,” The Daily Beast, updated June 11, 2022, https://www​.thedailybeast.com/kevin-mccarthy-blames-crime-on-dems-while-it-rages-in-his-gop-led-hometown (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Magazine&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Jason McGahan, “Why You’re Far More Likely to Be Murdered in Fresno or Bakersfield than San Francisco or L.A., Los Angeles Magazine, March 31, 2022, https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/why-youre-far-more-likely-to-be-murdered-in-fresno-or-bakersfield-than-san-fran-and-l-a/ (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;i&gt;San Francisco Examiner&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Gil Duran, “Let’s Obliterate the Myth that Republicans Are Solving Crime and Overdoses,” San Francisco Examiner, updated June 2, 2022 https://​www.sfexaminer.com/our_sections/forum/opinion/let-s-obliterate-the-myth-that-republicans-are-solving-crime-and-overdoses/article_f34ecfac​-5f70-5682-8a27-49d650a14405.html (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; NBC News&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Sahil Kapur and Jon Schuppe, “‘Overall Crime Decreased in 2020 in the U.S.,’ Report Finds,” NBC News, September 12, 2021, https://www​.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/overall-crime-decreased-2020-united-states-report-finds-n1278938 (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and others, picked up the “study” and breathlessly reported on its “findings.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Cory Allen Heidelberger, “Trump States Have Higher Murder Rates; South Dakota Leads Region in Chance of Death at Neighbors’ Hands,” Dakota Free Press, March 19, 2022, https://dakotafreepress.com/2022/03/19/trump-states-have-higher-murder-rates-south-dakota-leads-region-in​-chance-of-death-at-neighbors-hands/ (accessed November 2, 2022).

&lt;p&gt;We have a pretty good idea, and many voters apparently are starting to figure it out as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors and those reporting its results took advantage of the fact that the average reader does not know much about crime trends, how crime rates are calculated, and at what level (city/county/state, etc.) these statistics should be reviewed. Because of that, The Third Way’s study sounds important and shocking to most readers who visit these “news” websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, however, most crime is hyperlocalized, so the fundamental flaw with the study and the reason it does not deserve any serious consideration is that the “murder rate” in each state is largely a function of the large number of murders in a state’s biggest city or cities.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Rafael A. Mangual, “Dems’ Shameless Ploy to Blame Crime Rise on ‘Red States,’” New York Post, October 11, 2022, https://nypost.com/2022​/10/11/dems-shameless-ploy-to-blame-crime-rise-on-red-states/ (accessed November 2, 2022), and “Crime in American Cities, and Myth of ‘Red State Murder Problem,’ with Rafael Mangual and Jennifer Castro,” The Megyn Kelly Show, Episode 410, October 12, 2022, https://player.fm/series/the​-megyn-kelly-show/crime-in-american-cities-and-myth-of-red-state-murder-problem-with-rafael-mangual-and-jennifer-castro-ep-410 (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A super majority of those cities, even in otherwise red states, are deep blue and run by left-wing ideologues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you remove the crime-infested, homicide-riddled cities from the state murder rate featured in the Third Way study, you dramatically lower the murder rate for that state, upending their conclusions and exposing the piece for what it really is: a straightforward attempt at political projection dressed up as a “study.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said another way, Kessler and Murdock did their level best as political operatives to blame their political opponents for the very thing—rising crime—that leftist policies at the city and county levels have caused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a state’s murder rate is perhaps politically interesting, a more accurate reflection of what is actually happening on the ground is gained by reviewing localized murder rates, such as murder rates in a city or county. What does this review show?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 lists the 30 cities with the highest murder rates in the United States as of June 30, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="LM315 Table 1" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6e030915-0fda-4265-907c-48be88229275" src="https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/LM-blue-city-murder-problem-tables-page1_0.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, of those 30 cities, 27 have Democratic mayors, the exceptions being Lexington and Jacksonville, which have Republican mayors, and Las Vegas, whose mayor is an Independent. And within those 30 cities there are at least 14 Soros-backed or Soros-inspired rogue prosecutors. Those Soros bought-and-paid-for or inspired rogue prosecutors include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jason Williams, New Orleans Parish District Attorney;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore City State’s Attorney;&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;On July 22, 2022, Marilyn Mosby was defeated in the primary for the office of State’s Attorney for the City of Baltimore.

	&lt;li&gt;Kim Gardner, St. Louis Circuit Attorney;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John T. Chisholm, Milwaukee County District Attorney;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Larry Krasner, Philadelphia District Attorney;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Kim Foxx, Cook County (Chicago) State’s Attorney;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Raul Torrez, Bernalillo County (Albuquerque) District Attorney;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mike Freeman, Hennepin County (Minneapolis) Attorney;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Glenn R. Funk, Nashville District Attorney General;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Santana Deberry, Durham District Attorney;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Alvin Bragg, Manhattan District Attorney.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 2,554 homicides in those 30 cities through June 2022. In the 14 cities with Soros-backed rogue prosecutors, there were 1,752 homicides, representing 68 percent of homicides in the 30 top homicide cities in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Soros rogue prosecutor listed above is a Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A More Detailed Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a deeper dive into the numbers, we performed a more detailed analysis by examining how states’ homicide rates are influenced by particular high-crime counties. Although the authors of the “The Red State Murder Problem” provide the state-by-state data used in their study, they do not directly provide the county-level data necessary to answer this question.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Murdock and Kessler, “The Red State Murder Problem,”﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; County Health Rankings &amp; Roadmaps (CHR&amp;R), a program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, however, does provide these comprehensive data.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;County Health Rankings &amp; Roadmaps, https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/ (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Specifically, CHR&amp;R provides detailed data on health care, education, economic, and demographic variables, including homicide rates and overall state populations on a county-by-county basis all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 2 provides homicide rate rankings across all 50 states based on homicide data from 2014–2020.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;For full details of our methodology, see Appendix, infra.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the Third Way “study” either intentionally neglected or simply don’t understand that the “criminal justice system” within the 50 states is not a homogeneous nationwide system, but rather an amalgamation of thousands of microcosms consisting of federal, state, county, and local law enforcement agencies and prosecutors and unique approaches to the enforcement of state law. There are, for example, 3,143 counties in this country. Violations of state law are prosecuted largely at the county or city level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your public safety as a resident is dramatically impacted by your district attorney and whether he or she is a Soros rogue prosecutor or a law-and-order prosecutor, by your police department, and by whether the local politicians support and adequately fund the police and prosecutor’s offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the Soros rogue prosecutor movement has concentrated its fire at identifying, recruiting, and funding candidates for local district attorney races. By elevating pro-criminal, anti-victim zealots into office, the rogue prosecutor movement destabilizes the safety of the community, treats criminals as victims and the police as the criminals, and ignores real victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether a state as a whole voted for Donald Trump or Joe Biden has nothing whatever to do with the homicide rates within its constituent parts. The authors of the Third Way “study” are either oblivious to this fact or, as we suspect, aware of this but nonetheless determined to flip the political narrative. As we demonstrate, however, the high murder rate is almost exclusively cabined in cities run by Democrats and with Democrat district attorneys, many of whom are Soros bought-and-paid-for rogue prosecutors or inspired by Soros, groups like the egregiously misnamed Fair and Just Prosecution, and other battering rams of the movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Table 2 illustrates, Washington, DC, has the nation’s highest homicide rate at 19.846 homicides per 100,000 residents yet is completely neglected in “The Red State Murder Problem.” Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi are also highly ranked with homicide rates ranging from 13.390 to 10.728 per 100,000 residents).&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;While we recognize that the District of Columbia is not a state, for the sake of simplicity and clarity and because of the District’s unique constitutional status and the ongoing debate about whether it should be a state, we include it here. Neither we nor The Heritage Foundation endorse the District of Columbia’s becoming a state, especially by a simple act of Congress. See Zack Smith, “Does D.C. Statehood Require a Constitutional Amendment?: You Better Believe It,” Ohio State Law Journal Online, Vol. 83 (2022), pp. 17–28, https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/101092/OSLJ_Online_V83_017​.pdf?sequence=1 (accessed November 2, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louisiana’s homicide rate is heavily dependent on Orleans Parish, which has a homicide rate of 36.126 homicides per 100,000 residents. Removing this locality drops the state’s homicide rate from 13.390 to 11.302, a 15.59 percent reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alabama’s overall homicide rate is also heavily influenced by a few localities. For example, removing Jefferson County drops the state’s homicide rate from 10.728 to 9.001, a 16.10 percent reduction, and removing Montgomery County drops the homicide rate to 10.220, a 4.74 percent reduction. Dropping both lowers the homicide rate to 8.314, a 22.51 percent reduction, and would lower the state’s ranking in Table 2 from fourth to eighth in the nation. These dramatic drops are illustrated in Chart 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missouri’s overall homicide rate is marked by similar behavior. St. Louis City and St. Louis County heavily influence the state’s homicide rate, having 46.235 and 14.387 homicides per 100,000 residents, respectively. Removing St. Louis City lowers the state’s homicide rate from 9.363 to 7.482 per 100,000 residents, a 20.09 percent reduction. Removing St. Louis County lowers the homicide rate to 8.395 per 100,000 residents,) a 10.34 percent reduction, while dropping both counties reduces the state’s homicide rate by 35.17 percent to 6.070 homicides per 100,000 residents. These reductions are apparent in Chart 2. Looking at Table 2, removing both counties drops Missouri’s homicide ranking from fifth to 20th in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Mexico’s homicide rate is heavily dependent on Bernalillo County, encompassing the City of Albuquerque. Bernalillo County is the state’s most populous county and has a homicide rate of 10.241 homicides per 100,000 residents. Removing this county lowers the state’s homicide rate from 8.403 to 7.511 per 100,000 residents, a 10.62 percent reduction, and lowers the county’s homicide rate from eighth to 11th in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia’s homicide rate is heavily influenced by crime in Atlanta, encompassing Fulton and DeKalb Counties. Dropping these two counties (which have homicide rates of 13.407 and 13.272 per 100,000 residents, respectively) causes the state’s homicide rate to fall from 7.264 to 5.999, a 17.3 percent reduction, and the state’s ranking in Table 2 to fall from 13th to 21st in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arkansas’ homicide rate is impacted by Pulaski County, which has 17.199 homicides per 100,000 residents. Removing this county drops the state’s overall homicide rate from 7.688 to 6.256, a 18.63 percent reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tennessee is heavily influenced by crime in Memphis and Nashville. Removing Shelby County (with a homicide rate of 23.424 per 100,000 residents) surrounding Memphis results in a reduction from 7.783 to 5.327 (per 100,000 residents), a 31.56 percent change. Dropping Davidson County (with a homicide rate of 12.074 per 100,000) surrounding Nashville results in a reduction from 7.783 to 7.299 (per 100,000 residents), a 6.22 percent change. Dropping both counties brings down the state’s homicide rate to 4.432 per 100,000 residents, a 43.05 percent reduction, and lowers the state’s national ranking in Table 2 from ninth to 27th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Cook County, Illinois, is another highly influential county. Home to Chicago, Cook County boasts a homicide rate of 13.99 homicides per 100,000 residents, and dropping it from the state’s overall homicide rate calculation lowers the state’s rate from 7.746 to 3.476, a 55.1 percent reduction. (See Chart 3.) This reduction causes the state’s ranking in Table 1 to plummet from 10th to 32nd in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is apparent that some states’ homicide rates are determined heavily by crime in certain counties. It is thus naïve and nonsensical to make partisan claims about states’ overall crime rates while completely neglecting how various localities contribute to these rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Policies, Not COVID&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Left’s talking points is that the COVID-19 caused or at least contributed to the general rise in crime and that the rise in crime started during the pandemic. There are no reputable studies that prove that crime increased as a direct result of COVID lockdowns—which makes sense. Many people across the country were locked down, including in the inner cities where most crime takes place. What the data do show is that crime, including violent crime, was rising in cities with the toxic trio prior to&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Stimson and Smith, “‘Progressive’ Prosecutors Sabotage the Rule of Law, Raise Crime Rates, and Ignore Victims.” See also The Heritage Foundation’s Daily Signal series on rogue prosecutors (The Heritage Foundation, “Rogue Prosecutors,” https://www.heritage.org/rogue-prosecutors), which outlines the rising crime rates for each rogue prosecutor immediately after the elections and imposition of that prosecutor’s pro-criminal, anti-victim policies.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the onset of the pandemic and that the death of George Floyd, which happened in May 2020, led to a rise in murders and auto theft in key cities.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Mikaela Meyer, Ahmed Hassafy, Gina Lewis, Prasun Shrestha, Amelia M. Haviland, and Daniel S. Nagin, “Changes in Crime Rates During the COVID-19 Pandemic,” Statistics and Public Policy, Vol. 9, No. 1 (2022), pp. 97–109, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/2330443X.2022​.2071369?needAccess=true (accessed November 2, 2022). Also, around the world, urban crime fell by over a third during the COVID-19 shutdowns, as evidenced by a University of Cambridge study. Significantly, the study found that theft and robbery almost halved on average in 27 cities across 23 countries in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and the Middle East. See Amy E. Nivette, Renee Zahnow, Raul Aguilar, Andri Ahven, Shai Amram, Barak Ariel, María José Arosemena Burbano, Roberta Astolfi, Dirk Baier, Hyung-Min Bark, Joris E. H.

Eisner, “A Global Analysis of the Impact of COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Restrictions on Crime,” Nature Human Behaviour, Vol. 5 (July 2021), pp. 868–877, https://www.nature.com​/articles/s41562-021-01139-z (accessed November 2, 2022) .

&lt;p&gt;But numbers themselves do not begin to tell the whole story of why crime rates in these homicide hellholes have risen. Starting in 2016, with the election of the first Soros rogue prosecutor, Kim Foxx, in Chicago, cities with rogue prosecutors have imposed policies that all—each and every one of them—inure to the benefit of criminals, as we have detailed in our scholarship for the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those policies include but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refusing to prosecute entire categories of misdemeanor crimes, including theft, drug possession, shoplifting, receiving stolen property, breaking and entering, destruction of property, disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Forbidding prosecutors from including sentencing enhancements or allegations of prior convictions or special circumstances for egregious crimes or actions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Forbidding prosecutors from seeking the death penalty in any case.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Forbidding prosecutors from seeking life without parole sentences for any crime.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Refusing to prosecute violent teenagers in adult court for such crimes as murder, child abuse, and rape.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Requiring prosecutors to ask for the release of duly convicted violent felons, whose appeals have been denied, after these felons have served as least 15 years of a longer sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prohibiting or limiting prosecutors from asking for bail to ensure the presence of the defendant at the next court hearing and/or taking into consideration the defendant’s prior criminal record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foregoing policies—and dozens of other pro-criminal, anti-victim policies—have contributed to the lawlessness across blue cities and the steep rise in crime rates. To suggest now that Republican elected officials who have followed different policies have contributed to crime increases is at best laughable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Appendix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We utilized 2021 homicide data from County Health Rankings &amp; Roadmaps (CHR&amp;R), a program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. CHR&amp;R provides point and interval estimates for county-level and state-level homicide rates from 2014–2020 and population estimates from 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took point estimates of these rates and county-level population statistics to compute the raw number of homicides in each county. These estimates were rounded to the nearest integer to avoid fractional homicides and subsequently summed to generate an overall pooled estimate of the state’s raw number of homicides from 2014—2020, which were then divided by the state’s population to determine an overall state-level homicide rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These state-level homicide rates differ slightly from the overall state homicide rates reported in CHR&amp;R, likely because the authors of the dataset used a population figure that is different from what is available in the dataset. Nevertheless, the alternative state rankings presented in Table 1 do not differ appreciably from these rankings using the dataset’s original homicide rates. Furthermore, these alternative rankings are necessary for an understanding of particular counties’ impact on overall state-level homicide rates as examined in this report.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The Ministry of Truth (and Energy): FERC’s Proposed Candor Rule</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/government-regulation/report/the-ministry-truth-and-energy-fercs-proposed-candor-rule</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the Biden Administration (reluctantly) abandoned its plan to create a new Disinformation Governance Board within the Department of Homeland Security. Yet the Administration remains convinced that unpoliced speech threatens its ability to govern, and its hunt for disinformation in all corners of American life continues apace. Thus, the truth-vetting functions have not disappeared with the ill-fated board; instead, they are scattering to other executive agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August, the Commission, which regulates wholesale markets for oil, natural gas, and hydroelectric power, issued a notice of proposed rulemaking announcing its intention to adopt a new “candor rule.” This rule would allow the Commission to scrutinize communications by any individual or entity with “the Commission, Commission-approved market monitors, Commission-approved regional transmission organizations, Commission-approved independent system operators, jurisdictional transmission or transportation providers, or the Electric Reliability Organization and its associated Regional Entities,”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Fed. Energy Reg. Comm’n, Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Aug. 12, 2022) [hereafter NPRM], § 1(d).1, https://www.ferc.gov/media​/m-1-rm22-20-000.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; so long as that communication relates to a subject within the Commission’s jurisdiction. The proposal empowers FERC to take punitive action not only when parties’ communications contain false information, but when they contain “misleading information, or omit material information” as well.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. ¶ 1.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed expansion of Commission authority is breathtaking. For years, the Commission used a tailored rule to protect the integrity of its markets by requiring candor in communications from energy wholesalers. Now the Commission desires to regulate an array of new parties who communicate with the entities listed above whenever those parties discuss matters merely “related” in some way to the range of subjects within the Commission’s jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FERC might seem like an unlikely entity to deputize in the federal government’s new war on misinformation, but one should recall that the Commission regulates the permitting, production, and sale of energy from a wide variety of sources. Its jurisdiction sits at the nexus of energy policy and environmental policy, two areas of keen public interest and heated public debate whether it concerns grid reliability, domestic economic considerations, local or climatological environmental degradation, or even energy independence and its connection to national security. Moreover, if the recent practice of other agencies is any indication, FERC will interpret the scope of its authority in a maximalist way as, for instance, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) did when it determined that its authority over workplace hazards included the power to mandate vaccines for 80 million members of the nation’s workforce. When considered in this light, FERC’s power to police communications relating to subjects in its purview for their truthfulness becomes a matter of serious concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic taught the nation that career federal administrators are, to put it mildly, not necessarily disinterested pursuers of truth. A variety of motivations—some noble, some less so—can lead them to downplay or dismiss credible opinions as invalid when those opinions dissent from views the government is not inclined to question.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See, e.g., Jayanta Bhattacharya, Martin Kulldorff, The Collins and Fauci Attack on Traditional Public Health, Brownstone Institute (Jan. 2, 2022) https://​brownstone.org/articles/the-collins-and-fauci-attack-on-traditional-public-health/; Kerrington Powell and Vinay Prasad, The Noble Lies of COVID-19, Slate (July 28, 2021), https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/noble-lies-covid-fauci-cdc-masks.html.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Of course, the government is not required to &lt;i&gt;adopt&lt;/i&gt; dissenting views, but the authority to &lt;i&gt;penalize&lt;/i&gt; dissenting views and push them out of the public discourse is a powerful tool of suppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concern is heightened here by the lack of well-defined standards constraining the Commission’s review. Agencies often decline to articulate concrete standards in favor of a “flexible” approach to enforcement, as FERC has done in its proposed candor rule. This raises several questions. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could FERC penalize communications that it labels a denial of anthropogenic climate change?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Could a discussion of the benefits of domestic liquid natural gas be deemed misleading because it omits a discussion of the local environmental impacts of pipeline construction that the Commission finds “material”?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If a market participant states that wind-energy reliance impacts grid reliability without mentioning its offset to carbon emissions, is he misrepresenting the merits of renewable energies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC does not tell us, but the rule is broad enough to enable what we might call a politicized application of expertise; that is, the quasi-official adoption of certain scientific hypotheses as a standard of truth, which entails the suppression of alternative hypotheses and dissenting views. Thus, skepticism is warranted when, as here, an agency appoints itself the final arbiter of whether a statement is truthful, material, or misleading while telling the public little about how it will accomplish this task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concern is only heightened by the fact that there is no pressing or obvious need for the new rule. The current candor rule applicable to wholesalers was adopted in response to a specific crisis created by wholesalers’ intentional misstatements. Here, by contrast, the impetus for FERC’s new, considerably broader rule is obscure. This suggests that the rule is less a response to a particular problem in the wholesale markets and more an effort to enlarge the Commission’s jurisdiction permanently by establishing an expansive precedent. What’s more, the Commission need not exercise its censorious power to be effective; so long as the fear of prosecution and uncertain penalties looms, participants in the energy market will be wary about anything they put in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layman’s wisdom suggests that an energy regulator might not be the natural arbiter of what is truthful and complete. As it turns out, that wisdom corresponds with legal hurdles the Commission faces in its efforts to adopt the new candor rule. As discussed below, by adopting the sweeping new candor rule, FERC may be acting outside the authority conferred on it by Congress. FERC has also acted arbitrarily by not adequately supporting its conclusion that the new rule will address the Commission’s own concerns and by disregarding the considerable regulatory burdens it intends to foist upon parties who are not prepared to bear them. Moreover, concerns with respect to market functionality and free speech loom large against a rule that threatens to chill the sharing of information that is important to experts and market actors alike. All of this is on top of the likelihood that the Commission seems to be trying to solve a problem that is more imagined than real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Misusing Regulatory Authority to Address a Phantom Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission’s Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) describes a problem of inaccurate communications affecting the energy markets, but FERC offers nothing to substantiate its view that the problem is concrete. That is, the Commission nowhere indicates that the supposed gaps in the existing requirements of honesty, candor, etc. actually undermine its ability to discharge its regulatory mandate of ensuring that wholesale energy prices are “just and reasonable.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;NPRM ¶ 36.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Notice contains not a single example of a currently unregulated communication that introduced inaccuracy into the wholesale energy markets or the Commission’s regulation thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At various points, the Notice speaks in broad hypothetical terms about “inaccurate information inhibit[ing] the Commission’s regulatory oversight”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. ¶ 3.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which “could lead to substantial harm”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or the possibility that the “omission of material information…could lead the Commission to make decisions it otherwise would not have made.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. ¶ 26.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But the Notice gives the impression that this harm is purely theoretical and that the Commission is not aware of, or has yet to identify, instances where inaccuracies in unregulated communications have come to the Commission’s attention, let alone caused discernible market aberrations. In other words, the proposed rule is a solution in search of problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contrasts with the impetus for 18 C.F.R. § 35.41(b), also known as Market Behavior Rule 3, which the Commission invokes as the basis for the proposed extension of the duty of candor. When the Commission adopted Market Behavior Rule 3 in 2003, it did so in response to a specific, well-documented failure in the western states energy markets.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Investigation of Terms &amp; Conditions of Pub. Util. Mkt.-Based Rate Authorizations, 105 FERC ¶ 61,218, 62,142 (2003).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Then, as now, the Commission opined that the “integrity of the processes established by the Commission for open competitive markets rely on the openness and honesty of market participant communications.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;NPRM ¶¶ 17, 34.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, in response to a documented crisis in the western states, the Commission deemed it sufficient to impose explicit duties of candor only on sellers in the wholesale market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with no crisis apparent and no specific failures identified, the Commission has determined without a reasoned explanation that Market Rule 3, which is nearly two decades old, has suddenly become inadequate. The Commission acknowledges that, in addition to communications by sellers, existing duties of candor and oath requirements already cover filings with the Commission, periodic and annual reports, as well the submission of evidence, testimony, and written statements in connection with Commission investigations. The Commission then puzzlingly concludes that these duties are “limited”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. ¶¶ 8, 15.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and goes on to malign the current network of requirements as a “patchwork.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. ¶¶ 2, 7, 36.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The existing duties are limited in the sense that they cover a smaller range of speakers than the Commission now proposes to regulate, but rather than seeing these duties as a “patchwork,” they are better viewed as targeted toward those speakers and that speech most likely to affect the Commission’s mandate. The fact that other speakers and other speech could be regulated does not mean that there is a reason for the Commission to do so. If the current candor duty is truly inadequate, then at some point in the nearly two-decade existence of § 35.41(b) one would expect to see evidence thereof, such as instances where inaccurate communications have manifested as actual market problems. The problem is that the Notice identifies none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accuracy in all communications “relat[ing] to a matter subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission” may be desirable, but the Commission is not authorized to pursue this without regard to the costs. “[N]o legislation pursues its purposes at all costs. . . . [I]t frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the statute’s primary objective must be the law.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U.S. 522, 525–26 (1987) (emphasis omitted).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To show that the proposal’s benefits are worth its costs, the Commission must begin by identifying benefits of some sort, and that means identifying a problem the proposal would address. But here, “conclusory statements” that inaccurate communications by unregulated parties could inhibit the Commission’s mandate “do not suffice to explain its decision.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 224 (2016).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Commission is not entitled to rest its regulation on “unsupported speculation,” but instead must provide some “factual basis for this belief” that speech or speakers outside the scope of the current candor rules realistically threaten its ability to ensure just and reasonable energy pricing.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;New York v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F.3d 42, 83 (2d Cir. 2020).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission’s failure to apprise the public of the scope or gravity of the problem posed by unregulated, inaccurate communications makes it impossible to evaluate the proportionality of the proposed rule and its attendant costs, which are discussed further below. It is the Commission’s responsibility to show that its proposed rule would do more good than harm; the failure to do so is arbitrary and capricious.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Md. People’s Counsel v. FERC, 761 F.2d 768, 779 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (an agency’s failure to show that “more good than harm will come of its action” is arbitrary and capricious).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Moreover, a regulation responding to a specific problem is “highly capricious if that problem does not exist.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Alltel Corp. v.

&lt;h3&gt;Exceeding the Commission’s Lawful Jurisdiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed candor rule extends the Commission’s regulatory reach beyond the bounds of its jurisdiction. “FERC is a creature of statute, having no constitutional or common law existence or authority, but &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; those authorities conferred upon it by Congress.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Atl. City Elec. Co. v. FERC, 295 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although the Commission is authorized to “ensure the integrity and smooth functioning of the [energy] markets,”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;NPRM ¶ 36 (quoting Kourouma v. FERC, 723 F.3d 274, 276 (D.C. Cir. 2013)).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that authority is limited “to rules or practices that &lt;i&gt;directly&lt;/i&gt; affect the [wholesale] rate.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;FERC v. Elec. Power Supply Ass’n, 577 U.S. 260, 278 (2016).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This limited authority is the basis for the existing duty of candor in § 35.41(b).&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;FERC v. Coaltrain Energy, L.P., No. 2:16-CV-732, 2018 WL 7892222, at *23–24 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 30, 2018).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given the demonstrated ability of sellers’ communications with the Commission to affect wholesale markets, as exemplified by the western states energy crisis, it was reasonable for the Commission to conclude that regulating these parties’ communications was within its jurisdiction. Sellers are entrusted by the Commission with market-based rate authority, and no imagination is needed to appreciate how these entities affect wholesale market rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No similar justification exists for the proposed extension of the duty of candor, which would cover a varied host of new speakers. The Commission now proposes to regulate the communications of every “entity,” including organizations and individuals as well as their employees, agents, and contractors so long as the communication “relates” to a matter within the Commission’s jurisdiction.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;NPRM ¶¶ 40–41.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet the Commission has given no apparent consideration to whether communications from these sources have any capacity to exert direct influence on the wholesale energy markets. Consequently, the Commission has failed to show that the proposed rule’s scope would cover only (or mostly) communications that exert a direct influence over wholesale energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the direct influence of communications on wholesale energy markets is considered, it becomes apparent that the existing candor rule is not artificially “limited” but intentionally “targeted” at actors in the wholesale markets with the power to affect those markets directly. While sellers are able to influence the wholesale markets, the likelihood of more attenuated actors being able to do so through their communications seems remote. Whatever effects these communications could produce on the wholesale energy market, they appear more likely to be “indirect or tangential impacts” which “fall outside FERC jurisdiction.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Coal. for Competitive Elec., Dynegy Inc. v. Zibelman, 272 F. Supp. 3d 554, 572 (S.D.N.Y. 2017).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission nonetheless maintains that the “underlying rationale” of § 35.41(b) “applies more broadly” beyond sellers.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;NPRM ¶ 33.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Of course it does. But that is precisely why the Supreme Court prevented the Commission from adopting a “hyperliteral” reading of its governing statutes: to protect the public from the excesses of the Commission’s unrestrained exercises in logic and to keep the Commission’s regulatory mandate from “assuming near-infinite breadth.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;FERC v. Elec. Power Supply Ass’n, 577 U.S. at 278.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While the proposed regulation is not infinite in scope, as written and interpreted, it is likely to cover a large number of communications that do not and cannot directly affect wholesale energy markets. Adopting a regulation that exceeds or disregards known limitations on the Commission’s jurisdiction is arbitrary and capricious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Failure to Consider the First Amendment Implications of the Proposed Rule&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed rule raises weighty First Amendment concerns which are not adequately addressed by the Notice of Proposed Rule Making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed rule encompasses any communication relating to any matter subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction so long as the communication is made to one of the numerous listed entities. “The word ‘relates’ is highly general,” and courts tend to “interpret[] it broadly.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25, 38 (1996); see also United States v. Slatten, 865 F.3d 767, 780 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (“We have noted that the ‘ordinary meaning’ of ‘relating to’ is a broad one and that ‘a statutory provision containing the phrase therefore has ‘broad scope.’”).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A literal interpretation of “relates to” could result in the Commission regulating a nearly unlimited number of subjects, provided some nexus can be found with the immediate subjects of the Commission’s authority.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See FERC v. Elec. Power Supply Ass’n, 577 U.S. at 278 (“As we have explained in addressing similar terms like ‘relating to’ or ‘in connection with,’ a non-hyperliteral reading is needed to prevent the statute from assuming near-infinite breadth.”).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even if the Commission interprets the subjects falling under this rule less expansively, as FERC Commissioner James Danly noted in his dissent to the proposed rule, the Commission’s core subject matter areas involve “matter of political, social, or other concern.” This observation is confirmed by the fact that the Commission’s jurisdiction covers interstate transmission of electricity and natural gas, including the reliability of both, as well as environmental matters related to natural gas. These matters intersect or overlap with important areas of scientific and policy debate concerning the relative merits of energy sources, their reliability, and their sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could matters of scientific debate under these headings be labeled disinformation by those wielding the federal government’s regulatory power? Recent experience informs us that this is a real possibility.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Bhattacharya and Kulldorff, supra note 3.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If so-called climate-change deniers communicate with a Commission-regulated entity, could their words serve as the basis for imposing federal penalties? Perhaps market participants critical of the unreliable nature of current renewable energy sources will have their communications reviewed with particular attention. Should the Commission’s composition shift, those critical of pipeline construction’s environmental impacts might have their communications closely examined for material omissions. After all, to find an omission, one need only take an expansive view of what is material to the discussion at issue. If the Commission wanted to target falsehoods in permit applications or statements that directly influenced market rates, it could have done so. But it didn’t. Instead, the Commission drafted a rule both flexible in application and capacious in scope such that it could be applied against otherwise lawful communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the Commission’s authority to ensure fair and just rates in the wholesale market, it is not the Commission’s job to police the boundaries of discussion on unsettled matters touching on energy policy or related environmental concerns. The shadow of broadened enforcement power cast by the proposed rule and its “flexible standard” of enforcement may chill discussion of these issues among actors in the wholesale energy markets, particularly as those actors struggle to divine what information is material and cannot be omitted from their communications.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;FERC’s bid to extend its jurisdiction through the NPRM also raises concern about the proposed rule’s interaction with the criminal penalties in 18 U.S.C. § 1001. That section states in relevant part that “whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully…makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or [] makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry; shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years….” By bringing a new range of communications and speakers under its jurisdiction, FERC potentially renders those communications the basis for criminal penalties under § 1001 as well. Unlike the proposed rule, § 1001 requires that the statements be made knowingly and willfully, but as with many other aspects of the proposed rule, the NPRM does not consider the chilling effect that is added when the Commission’s civil penalties are supplemented by the possibility of criminal sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To these concerns, the Commission’s citation to &lt;i&gt;Kourouma v. FERC&lt;/i&gt; is no answer. In that case, an energy trader, Kourouma, &lt;i&gt;admitted&lt;/i&gt; to filing false information with the Commission in an application for approval of his new energy trading firm. The court of appeals treated Kourouma as a seller, meaning that he was squarely within the Commission’s jurisdiction over wholesale markets. The only challenge Kourouma asserted to § 35.41(b) was that it provided “no notice that FERC would read the Rule so broadly and might move against those who lacked intent to deceive FERC or regional transmission organizations.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Kourouma, 723 F.3d at 279.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The district court easily disposed of this intent-based challenge because the regulation’s text made it clear that only those who had exercised diligence would be excused and because “Kourouma’s actions were worse than careless.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 278.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, &lt;i&gt;Kourouma&lt;/i&gt; was not a close case. Because a seller conceded that he made false statements directly to the Commission, the court had no opportunity to consider whether such phrases as “omit material information,” “relates to a matter subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission,” or “exercises due diligence” give reasonable notice as to what might be encompassed within them and whether they are overbroad especially as applied to the new range of regulated communications between customers and other market participants. Thus, &lt;i&gt;Kourouma &lt;/i&gt;is not a prospective judicial blessing for the proposed rule, and the decision provides virtually no guidance to the host of newly regulated speakers who are not making patently false statements directly to the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the Notice evinces no serious consideration of the significant First Amendment concerns raised by the proposed rule. To the extent the Commission has failed to consider these concerns, that failure is both arbitrary and capricious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Failure to Consider Adequately the Costs Imposed by the Proposed Rule&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission opines that “the burden associated with the proposed regulation should be minimal” because “almost all entities…regularly communicate with accuracy and honesty,” and most such “communications already regularly occur with due diligence exercised.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;NPRM ¶ 48.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Commission seems to concede that the proposed regulation will not actually affect the behavior of wholesale market actors, meaning that any improvement in the accuracy of communications will either be minimal or nonexistent, which begs the question: Why adopt a new rule?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the proposed rule is not likely to produce a net positive effect on the accuracy of communications, the Commission has either ignored or discounted potentially considerable costs arising from its proposal. Extension of this broad duty of candor and the corresponding requirement of diligence creates considerable uncertainty for parties that are not accustomed to proving the rigorous accuracy of their communications. Because due diligence is an affirmative defense, the burden falls on the speaker to come forward with evidence of its efforts.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Coaltrain Energy, L.P., 501 F. Supp. 3d at 526.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, the issue is not necessarily that these parties’ communications are untruthful; the issue is that it would now be incumbent on parties to demonstrate that each communication was both factually accurate and properly contextualized or that the communication was formulated according to a process meant to ensure accuracy and guard against error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The few judicial decisions interpreting § 35.41(b) indicate that evidence of some such process is the bare minimum of what is needed to prove due diligence. To the extent there is some lesser requirement for individuals or less sophisticated entities, the Commission provides no meaningful guidance on what that requirement is. Thus, the Commission foists the greatest degree of uncertainty onto the parties that are least able to bear the associated costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extended duty of candor means that each communication touching on matters of Commission jurisdiction would entail a greater but still uncertain risk. That uncertainty is amplified by the amorphous nature of key concepts in the proposed regulation like materiality and due diligence combined with the Commission’s highly discretionary approach to enforcement. Increased uncertainty about the risks of covered communications and the vagueness regarding penalties inhibits rational assessment of how newly regulated entities should respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, two responses to the proposed rule—both costly—are likely. One is for entities to commit more resources than needed to compliance. Adopting or augmenting processes to ensure accuracy will inevitably entail compliance costs whether these are incurred on systems for document retention and storage, on compliance staff, on precommunication internal reviews, on centralized monitoring of communications with other market participants, or on consultation with lawyers regarding risk assessments and questions of materiality or due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals and entities that are not willing or able to commit more resources to compliance are likely to curtail their communications at least as they relate to matters within the Commission’s jurisdiction. This too comes at a cost. Rather than increasing the accuracy of information, the proposed rule may simply decrease the flow of information without meaningfully affecting the quality. By inhibiting the free flow of communication both between market actors and from market actors to the Commission, the proposed rule will make the wholesale energy markets more opaque and thus less functional as participants will have less information to guide their decisions. This outcome is antithetical to the Commission’s objective: “to promote a free market in wholesale electricity” and “enhance competition.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Louisville Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. FERC, 988 F.3d 841, 844 (6th Cir. 2021).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not evident from the Notice that the Commission has factored these costs into its assessment of whether the proposed rule is an advisable extension of existing duties, but failure to consider the likely negative consequences of the proposed rule would also be an arbitrary and capricious decision-making failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision-making process behind FERC’s proposed candor rule was patently inadequate. The Commission should therefore end its efforts to adopt the rule or, at a minimum, issue a supplemental notice addressing the defects in its current proposal. If the rule is ultimately adopted and broad applications ensue, FERC will have set a dangerous precedent that will be noted by other federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;i&gt;Federal Register&lt;/i&gt;, there are 434 agencies within the federal government. Their jurisdictions meander across areas such as elections, health care, labor, national security, agriculture, and the environment, to name but a few. Which among these agencies could not claim that accurate information is indispensable to its regulatory mandate? Might some of them look at FERC’s example and conclude that their own authority includes the power to probe communications touching on their respective subject matters for material omissions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the many facets of American life already touched on by federal agencies, the scope of overlapping speech regulations could bring an alarming number of communications under the scrutiny of the administrative state. When agencies assert the right to suppress disinformation and the right to define the concept as well, a likely byproduct is the withering of public discussion and debate in precisely those areas where it is most needed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why Does the Media Continue to Mislead Americans About the Border?</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/why-does-the-media-continue-mislead-americans-about-the-border</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a catastrophic crisis underway at our southwest border, a crisis that’s been raging since Joe Biden first took office and undid the Trump-era border security policies that I helped craft and implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That crisis has been readily apparent to anyone willing to take off the political blinders and &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/press/time-excuses-over-hold-them-accountable-mark-morgan-tom-homan-blast-new-september-fy2022"&gt;just look at what’s happening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, though, most of the political establishment in Washington, the coastal elites in their gated communities, and the open-borders bureaucracy have shown they are unwilling to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that includes most of the U.S. corporate media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/biden-border-crisis"&gt;The Biden Border Crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some journalists have done exemplary work covering the border crisis for months—Bill Melugin and Griff Jenkins of Fox News, Townhall’s Julio Rosas, Jennie Taer of the Daily Caller, NewsNation’s Ali Bradley, and Newsmax’s Jaeson Jones all come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, however, the media has not only largely ignored the border crisis, but has actively participated in the left’s campaign to mislead and deceive Americans about the scope, scale, and causes of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experienced that deception firsthand last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Heritage Foundation, where I serve as a visiting fellow, was contacted by two reporters from the Arizona Republic—Rafael Carranza and Daniel Gonzalez—who wanted to speak with someone about the number of illegal aliens who have entered the United States since Joe Biden took office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question has major public policy ramifications, particularly for Arizonans, who are seeing the crisis literally play out on their doorsteps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happily agreed to the interview, and despite encountering everything from skepticism to fierce resistance to the case I made, I laid out in great detail the facts about who has entered this country under Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the Arizona Republic published a piece that actively misleads its readers. Carranza, whose name appeared on the byline, first failed to accurately report &lt;a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics"&gt;the number of individuals who have improperly entered&lt;/a&gt; the country, &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/21/us-mexico-border-security-immigration-issues-election-2022/10462644002/"&gt;under-counting the right number&lt;/a&gt; by more than half a million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more egregiously, he failed to make &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; mention of the massive number of “got-aways” who have illegally crossed into our country and never been apprehended by Border Patrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known got-aways, or those who Border Patrol knows come across the border because they’re caught on cameras, sensors, or even seen by agents, have totaled &lt;a href="https://www.fairus.org/press-releases/border-security/fair-analysis-55-million-illegal-aliens-have-crossed-our-borders"&gt;more than one million&lt;/a&gt; since Joe Biden assumed office. And that number continues to grow as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anna_giaritelli/status/1582068015809429504"&gt;more and more agents are pulled off the frontline security mission&lt;/a&gt; to process and release historic numbers of illegal aliens being detained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Border Patrol also knows that every month, a certain number of illegal aliens slip across the border and are never &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/immigration-statistics/BSMR/ndaa_border_security_metrics_report_fy_2019_0.pdf.pdf"&gt;even tracked&lt;/a&gt;. As someone who used to oversee the Border Patrol, I can tell you this number can be up to twice as many as the known got-aways. &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/record-number-suspected-terrorists-crossed-us-mexico-border-opinion-1754869"&gt;That’s another 1-2 million unknown got-aways&lt;/a&gt; under Biden, easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carranza included &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of these figures, nor others I gave that added even more to the overall total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, he reported a conclusion about the number of improper border crossings that was inaccurate and misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the piece was a further attempt to downplay the crisis, or make excuses for why it’s occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He even went so far as to blame historic levels of apprehensions on repeat offenders (recidivists). The problem is that recidivism has always been tracked by CBP, not just the past 18 months. More importantly, whether it’s a first-time offender or someone crossing for the tenth time, that individual demands Border Patrol time and resources, and pulls more attention away from actual border security. The effect is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we know the cartels are taking advantage of fewer agents on the line. We see the consequences in &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/the-got-away-crisis-our-southern-border"&gt;increasing numbers of got-aways and deadly narcotics flowing across the border&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One has to ask to all this dishonesty: Why? What agenda was he advancing that is more important than the truth? Why are so many in corporate media not only ignoring the crisis, but actively trying to deceive Americans when they do cover it? How did this piece make it past an editor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/the-next-congress-should-impeach-dhs-secretary-alejandro-mayorkas"&gt;The Next Congress Should Impeach DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidents like this demonstrate why trust in corporate media is at &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/403166/americans-trust-media-remains-near-record-low.aspx"&gt;all-time lows&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of reporting the facts and letting Americans make up their own minds, they withhold vital information that would provide more context and clarity. They withhold the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s the case across corporate media. Most of the time, these outlets &lt;a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/jul/19/inside-beltway-year-media-silence/"&gt;are content to simply ignore the crisis&lt;/a&gt;, pretending it doesn’t exist. But when they weigh in, they either miss the truth or mislead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-09-20/editorial-immigrants-flights-buses-political-posturing"&gt;Los Angeles Times op-ed&lt;/a&gt; asserted, “There is no question that there is a crisis at the border…But it is a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by political posturing, not one caused by an uncontrolled border.” A columnist for the Arizona Daily Star &lt;a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/investigative-commentary-signs-show-border-panic-is-overblown-politically-motivated/article_e34e0904-2b8a-5dcb-a558-7000d7ac3748.html"&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; the “five ways you can tell today’s border panic is trumped up.” And without any irony, apparently, a CNN “fact check” posited &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/politics/desantis-border-covid-fact-check/index.html"&gt;in August 2021&lt;/a&gt;, “While migrants continue to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border in record numbers, it’s false to claim that the border is ‘open’…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporters may disagree with the vast majority of Americans who support secure borders and enforcing the law, but they’re not entitled to their own facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Americans &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; entitled to increasingly tune them out.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Government Officials Need To Ban TikTok From Operating in the U.S.</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/homeland-security/commentary/government-officials-need-ban-tiktok-operating-the-us</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;At an Oct. 24 press conference on “significant national security cases,” Attorney General Merrick Garland announced several developments involving Chinese Communist Party espionage on U.S. soil. Noticeably absent was any mention of TikTok, China’s most valuable spying tool, which is used every day against American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, Beijing has used TikTok to steal personal information about its users and influence the direction of our country. The app’s “surreptitious data practices” include the mass collection of browsing histories, keystroke patterns, biometric identifiers, draft messages, and metadata as well as the text, images, and videos that are on a device’s clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capitalizing on the paralysis of U.S. regulators, ByteDance has used its ever-expanding social media reach to access critical information, posing a direct threat to our national security. The initial delay to ban TikTok from the devices of U.S. service members jeopardized troop movements and the data of our military men and women. While the application is now banned from the devices of military personnel, many Americans are still being targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last week, documents obtained by Forbes revealed that ByteDance intended to “use the TikTok app to monitor the personal location of some specific American citizens.” In other words, ByteDance plans to have their employees track the location of “high value” American citizens from their desks in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/technology/commentary/biden-directive-mitigating-threats-tiktok-other-foreign-owned-apps"&gt;Biden Directive on Mitigating Threats From TikTok, Other Foreign-Owned Apps Is Insufficient&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TikTok is much more than a social media hosting site. It’s a powerful surveillance tool for the CCP. Since President Donald Trump’s unsuccessful effort to ban TikTok, the app has further entrenched itself in our lives, and its parent company, ByteDance, has expanded its surveillance capabilities. It’s time for lawmakers to end their aimless debate on how to regulate this state-sponsored spying operation and do what they should have done years ago: Ban TikTok from operating in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alarming new development comes as TikTok’s lobbyists and communications consultants pitch their latest PR stunt, “Project Texas,” to lawmakers in an effort to avoid regulatory action. After years of privacy experts sounding the alarm that TikTok poses a serious threat to the U.S., one would hope our elected officials would be wise enough not to trust the company’s promises. Unfortunately, mere weeks after a report revealed that TikTok has been “keylogging” its users—meaning that the company has been tracking and storing “passwords, credit card information and other sensitive user data,” the Biden administration entered a preliminary security deal to allow the app to continue operating in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, and after countless reports that have outlined the growing security threats we face from TikTok, only Mr. Trump has been willing to take on this CCP operation. As the current administration takes a victory lap over its recent arrests of 13 Chinese nationals on charges ranging from espionage to recruitment, Americans should not forgive their failure to act against TikTok. Instead of standing up to China, the Biden administration has negotiated a sweetheart deal that allows TikTok the maneuverability needed to avoid further regulation while continuing to spy on Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/asia/report/responding-the-china-challenge-blueprint-20"&gt;Responding to the China Challenge: Blueprint 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a recent visit to Australia, Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, acknowledged that “Donald Trump was right on TikTok years ago.” Mr. Warner went on to say, “If your country uses Huawei, if your kids are on TikTok, if your population uses WeChat as a social media platform, the ability for China to have undue influence is, I think, a much greater challenge and a much more immediate threat than any kind of actual, armed conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senator also noted that the Pentagon has ordered service members not to have the app downloaded to their devices. This raises the question: If TikTok isn’t safe for members of the armed forces, why is it safe for the rest of us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of calling for more investigations, waiting for more leaks from ByteDance, or debating a so-called security deal that lets TikTok continue to shovel data back to Beijing, Congress must act to end this threat to our privacy and our national security. Lawmakers should disregard the press releases from TikTok, decline to take calls from their lobbyists, and ban this company from operating in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>China’s Growing Political Autocracy Limits Its Economic Prospects</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/asia/commentary/chinas-growing-political-autocracy-limits-its-economic-prospects</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping’s attempt to build a more socialist economy with excessive Communist Party control contradicts more market-oriented reforms China has tried to implement since the late 1970s. On October 16, the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party reaffirmed Xi’s control over the country and his party for a &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/10/25/bolder-and-more-confident-what-to-expect-for-xi-jinpings-third-term/"&gt;third term&lt;/a&gt; and, in doing so, endorsed his dangerously flawed economic policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The belated release of official figures after the Party Congress adjourned showing 3.9% year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 2022 was an attempt to downplay Xi’s gross mismanagement of the economy as he tries to claim success for a gradual economic recovery. However, there are growing questions about the accuracy of the economic figures the Communist Party is publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, China’s economy is unlikely to gain steam anytime soon. Its leadership looks poised to continue the same policies that slowed growth in recent months, including the &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/04/14/in-china-public-health-takes-back-seat-to-politics/"&gt;“zero-COVID”&lt;/a&gt; and “&lt;a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-common-prosperity-what-does-it-mean-for-foreign-investors/"&gt;common prosperity&lt;/a&gt;” policies. The common prosperity policy includes imposing new regulatory crackdowns and higher taxes on large private companies in the education, finance, and e-commerce industries to rein in rich individuals and corporations from growing too powerful in the eyes of the Communist Party.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impacts of these and other autocratic policies can be seen throughout the Chinese economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment in the real estate and residential property sectors fell by 8% and 26% respectively in the first nine months of 2022. The September unemployment rate (5.5%), and especially youth unemployment rate (18%), have remained high, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/"&gt;National Bureau of Statistics of China&lt;/a&gt;. And external trade has not yet returned to levels before the large-scale economic lockdown in several important cities from April to June due to the zero-COVID policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade statistics from China’s important trading partners also reveal the country’s weakening economic conditions. Taiwan’s and South Korea’s annual exports to China registered the largest decline in September (compared to the previous eight months of this year) according to &lt;a href="https://www.mof.gov.tw/eng"&gt;Taiwan’s Ministry of Finance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://unipass.customs.go.kr/ets/index_eng.do"&gt;Korea Customs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two countries are the main suppliers of key components for China’s manufacturing production. The reduction in their exports to China implies a slowing down in its domestic manufacturing industry. &lt;a href="https://www.moea.gov.tw/Mns/dos/content/ContentLink.aspx?menu_id=9423"&gt;Taiwan’s official figures&lt;/a&gt; also show that orders for shipments from China and Hong Kong in September decreased significantly—by almost 30%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some extent, slowing economic growth is expected as China transforms from a labor-intensive manufacturing economy to a higher value-added manufacturing- and service-oriented economy. The same patterns were experienced by other countries transitioning from producing low-value- to high-value-added products. What makes China’s case unique is that its economic transformation is being driven by government initiatives instead of by market forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To climb the ladder in the global supply chain network, the Chinese government has forcefully pulled labor-intensive manufacturing production (e.g., textile, plastics, etc.) out of China for more than a decade by enforcing wage hikes and strict environmental rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the government has thus far failed to transform China into a key technology hub. China only has been able to achieve the manufacturing of “high technology” products (e.g., smartphones, computers, robots, etc.) through the importation and assembly of key components and equipment from abroad.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s heavy reliance on foreign technology has made it easier for the &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/07/26/china-is-us-toughest-adversary-gop-congressman-says/"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/choking-chinas-access-future-ai"&gt;choke off development of its high tech industry&lt;/a&gt;, notably its semiconductor chips and artificial intelligence components. New U.S. export restrictions on semiconductor chips and equipment to China may further slow its technological ambitions and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-24/china-s-plunging-market-has-become-a-high-risk-bet-on-xi-jinping?sref=InMWfBxD#xj4y7vzkg"&gt;China’s plunging stock market&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-stocks-slide-leadership-overhaul-012926088.html"&gt;weaker currency&lt;/a&gt; have further stoked &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/07/07/chinas-stars-dim-for-investors/"&gt;investors&lt;/a&gt;’ worries about the country’s near-term economic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in the long run, China’s export prospects are likely to be squeezed between competition from developing countries’ growing manufacturing strength and China’s inability to climb the global supply chain network due to its technological limitations. The bleak export outlook might constrain the growth of its income per capita, thus restraining the consumption potential of its citizens, and that’s in addition to the potential constraints already being imposed by the fact that it has an increasingly aging population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/02/01/government-interference-in-economy-isnt-way-to-compete-with-china/"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; considered its active involvement in the global economy as a panacea to boost its own economy. But in fact, globalization has been a double-edged sword. While the nation intends to continue to reap the benefits from its greater investment and trade with other countries, it has become much more reliant on foreign technology and on U.S. and European market demand to sustain its economic development.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of understanding of its position in the global economic system has resulted in its complacency. Its high-speed economic growth over the past few decades emboldened its ambition to compete with the United States in high-tech industry. But because of its increased reliance on communist ideology to overshadow any hints of capitalist reforms, it continues to fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Communist Party-appointed leadership team that joins Chairman Xi in his third term does not seem to understand the challenges, opportunities, and reforms needed to better integrate with the global capitalist economy. Instead, they remain committed to Xi’s vision for economic policy—one based on the same Marxist-Leninist ideology that has failed to deliver solutions to some of China’s most daunting economic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The Real Dispute at Heart of Affirmative Action Cases Now Before High Court</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/courts/commentary/the-real-dispute-heart-affirmative-action-cases-now-high-court</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court is again examining whether universities may consider race when trying to build diverse student bodies, reviewing admissions policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can a court be blind to what must be necessarily known to every intelligent person in the state?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So wrote Judge Lorenzo Sawyer 136 years ago in a case challenging a San Francisco licensing ordinance regulating laundry businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ordinance made no mention of race. Instead, it purported to be about safety, but everyone knew that it was enforced only against Asian laundry owners to help their white competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On appeal, the Supreme Court &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/"&gt;cut through the obfuscation&lt;/a&gt; and saw the racial discrimination behind the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oral arguments in two cases Monday challenging colleges’ racial admissions policies suggested that at least some justices are willing to turn a blind eye to present-day &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/01/31/harvards-method-of-discrimination-is-affront-to-individual-dignity/"&gt;anti-Asian&lt;/a&gt; discrimination if that discrimination comports with modern ideas about “racial justice.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two cases were brought by Students for Fair Admissions, a group representing Asian college applicants, challenging the way that Harvard and the University of North Carolina &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/10/03/a-judges-wrongheaded-ruling-saves-harvards-non-colorblind-admission-policy/"&gt;use race&lt;/a&gt; to give preferences to black and Hispanic students at the expense of white and Asian applicants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court has long held that race-based policies are inherently suspicious and contrary to the ideal that all men and woman are created equal. Still, the court has permitted colleges to use race in admissions because it trusts colleges when they say that they create diversity on campus and that diversity yields certain educational benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the court’s permission was strictly limited: Colleges may not use racial quotas; race may be only one factor among many; and racial-preference policies must be temporary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing those precedents, the schools say that they consider race as part of a “holistic” review of applications to create broad diversity of races, experiences, and viewpoints, which yields educational benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challengers contend that the schools secretly do much more than that, putting a significant thumb on the scale in favor of some racial groups and against others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both schools give some minorities (primarily blacks and Hispanics) a “plus factor” in admissions. But the schools are careful to argue that these are only given out on an individualized basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the evidence, particularly in the case against Harvard, strongly suggests that the schools racially balance their student bodies. The share of Harvard’s student body that goes to each racial group is remarkably consistent over time. The evidence also shows that black and Hispanic students are admitted at much higher rates than white and Asian students with the same academic credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, at Harvard, an Asian applicant with academics in the top 10% has a 12.7% chance of getting in, but with the same grades and test scores, a black student has a 56.1% chance. In fact, race is determinative for at least 45% of black and Hispanic applicants to Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this is troublesome is that college admissions are a zero-sum game. There are only so many spots. So, a plus factor for one applicant is, necessarily, a minus factor for someone else. And Harvard and UNC, it seems, impose a significant minus on Asians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asians do very well academically. If academic achievements were all that mattered, they would be admitted at a rate higher than their percentage of the total population—what some call “overrepresentation.”  That’s a problem for universities that want to balance the racial composition of their student bodies with the racial composition of the population at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challengers argue that the schools respond to this fact by discriminating against Asians. Harvard, for example, consistently marks Asians lower than any other group on its “personal rating,” which measures subjective categories, such as personality, empathy, and social skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At oral argument, Justice Samuel Alito asked Harvard’s lawyer what explains this lower rating. Either Asians, as a group, do indeed have worse social skills, or the school is &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/10/08/harvard-says-it-uses-racial-discrimination-to-sculpt-a-diverse-class-this-is-a-dangerous-path/"&gt;discriminating&lt;/a&gt; against them. Harvard’s lawyer had no answer to that, simply insisting over and over again that there’s no discrimination against Asians at the elite school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many of the justices seemed unwilling to be blind, especially given the history of Harvard’s personal rating system, which it created in the 1920s and 1930s to exclude Jews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice Clarence Thomas drilled right to the heart of the issue by asking one of the lawyers defending the University of North Carolina: If this case had been brought against a school in 1960 that was discriminating against black students on the basis that segregation yielded educational benefits, would we have deferred to that judgment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawyer had to concede that, of course, the court would not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Principle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That exchange highlights the real fight at the heart of this case; namely, the struggle between principle and popular notions of “racial justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle at stake is the principle that made the civil rights movement so compelling; specifically, that every American is equal in the eyes of the law, &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/08/06/judge-defends-equal-justice-against-tide-of-critical-race-theory-disparate-impact/"&gt;regardless of race&lt;/a&gt;. But the colleges and their defenders recognize, rightly, that there are still disparities between racial groups. They argue that the principle of racial equality must yield in the pursuit of “social justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many of the justices—Thomas in particular—are aware that what is “justice” today is not necessarily “justice” tomorrow. Thomas’ question about a school in 1960 was not hypothetical. Many intellectuals in that day &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4197212"&gt;genuinely believed&lt;/a&gt; that segregation yielded many of the same educational benefits that proponents of racial diversity claim today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To him, history proves that it is too dangerous to trust anyone to implement racial policies in a way that is benign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice Sonia Sotomayor loudly disagreed with him, arguing several times that past race-based policies caused the disparities that persist today and that, accordingly, we must turn those race-based policies around to fix those disparities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For her part, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson (who sat for the North Carolina case, but was recused from the Harvard case because of a past affiliation with the university) simply doubted that there was any discrimination against Asians at all. How could we conclude that, she wondered, when the admissions policy is holistic and considers more than 40 factors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could the Supreme Court say that San Francisco’s 1880s laundry ordinance discriminated against Asians when it appeared only to be based on safety concerns?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How ironic that in defense of race-conscious preferences, Jackson would blind herself to the fact that racial discrimination in favor of one group necessarily harms another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Labels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackson seemed also to be unconcerned about the arbitrariness of the race labels. What makes a student Asian or black or Hispanic or white?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The label “Asian,” as Harvard’s lawyer conceded, applies to 61% of the world’s population. It includes everyone from Afghanistan to Vietnam. “Black” includes African immigrants, the descendants of slaves, wealthy people from the Hamptons, and poor people from Harlem.  “Hispanic” is an ethnic, not racial, group and includes white people from Spain and dark-skinned people from Peru. Lastly, “white” includes Europeans, Middle Easterners, and some Africans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do such arbitrary labels, Alito wondered, produce any sort of actual diversity?  The schools’ defenders said that race informs who people are, at least to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s their personality and experiences that matter, not race alone, right? No, said the schools’ lawyers, race is also at least a little bit relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several justices asked how so, and Thomas asked the lawyers to clarify the link between racial diversity and these “educational benefits,” but no clear answer was forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackson responded by arguing that because no student is required to check a race box on the application, then there’s no problem with the colleges using the race information they have. But it was apparently lost on her that this only makes the use of race more arbitrary, because the colleges’ information is poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alito, in a telling exchange, revealed just how poor the information really is. He asked, when can a student honestly claim to be a member of a minority racial group?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that they can self-identify. What if a great-grandparent was a member of a certain minority racial group, is that enough? Great-great-grandparent?  What if it’s family lore that an ancestor was an American Indian? Is that enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, UNC’s lawyer said that the school defers to the student, because what matters is how they identify, but when Alito got to “great-great-grandparent,” the lawyer said that the applicant’s claim would be “less plausible.” And when Alito got to the American Indian example, the lawyer said that the school would no longer think that race was relevant even if the student sincerely identified as an American Indian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the point of checking the box?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ending&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its previous cases permitting racial admissions policies, the court said that they must end eventually. So, when do these ones end? The schools had no answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, they wanted the freedom to continue using race in admissions until they decide that “justice,” however they define it, will be done without race-based policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as Thomas well knows from living through Jim Crow, as Jews well know from being kept out of Harvard in the 1920s, and as Asians well know today from being punished for their devotion to education, “justice” changes with the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that remains constant is the principle that all men and women are created equal.   &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>9 Reasons Why the F-35 Needs a New Engine</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/9-reasons-why-the-f-35-needs-new-engine</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Fighter engines are incredibly complex machines. We may think of them as things that merely produce thrust, but every engine is born with indelible traits and functions that culminate in the success of the fighter it powers. Thrust is at the top of the list, but an engine’s appetite for fuel, its ability to provide cooling and electrical power for system components and its durability establish the paradigms of performance for the weapons system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once fielded, increasing the demand on those capabilities ultimately becomes a zero-sum game, where satisfying the demand on one area comes at the cost of the others. Collectively, the demands on the F-35 weapons system have now outpaced the capabilities of its F135 powerplant. So, right now, the &lt;a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2022/09/general-electric-finishes-testing-adaptive-engine-but-will-it-power-the-f-35/"&gt;Air Force is weighing&lt;/a&gt; two options: make incremental upgrades to the current F135 engine, or pivot to a new program of record by selecting a winner from two competitors from the service’s Adaptive Engine Transition Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least nine reasons why the Air Force should forgo upgrading the current engine and move to acquire the AETP winner if it wants to get the most out of its future F-35s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The F-35 needs more thrust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://man.fas.org/dod-101/sys/ac/docs/m06231998_m104-98.html"&gt;design&lt;/a&gt; of the F-35’s Pratt and Whitney F135 engine was crafted around the conceptual dimensions, weight and performance requirements of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).  Each of the three jets are now &lt;a data-featherlight="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/F-35_A_B_C_Config.png"&gt;13 percent longer, have wingspans&lt;/a&gt; that are more than 16 percent wider and are at least 30 percent heavier than their &lt;a href="https://www.fighter-planes.com/info/jsf.htm"&gt;original JSF designs&lt;/a&gt;. This has compromised key performance parameters such as acceleration. Rapidly gaining separation from an engagement can mean life or death for a pilot, and the JSF’s additional girth, paired with its engine means the F-35A, F-35B, and F-35C require more time—8 seconds, 16 seconds, and a crippling 43 seconds, respectively—to accelerate from 0.8 Mach to 1.2 Mach. The jet needs more thrust than the F135 can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The F-35 needs more range.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design objectives for the JSF prioritized a significant increase in fighter combat radius, or the range an aircraft can travel from takeoff to target and then return home. Unfortunately, the jet’s increased size and weight, coupled with increased aircraft cooling demands reduced the &lt;a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/pentagon-agrees-to-f-35a-combat-radius-reduction/104390.article"&gt;combat radius&lt;/a&gt; of all three variants some 15 percent below the program’s objectives. The F-35 needs a more powerful, fuel-efficient engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. System cooling requirements already exceed F135 design specifications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like electricity, the demand for subsystem cooling is measured in kilowatts. The F135 was designed to handle a 15 kilowatts cooling demand, but that requirement has already doubled to an estimated 30 kilowatts. Cooling air is generated primarily by pulling bleed air from the engine and running it through heat exchangers. The F135 meets the 30 kilowatts demand by pulling more bleed air from the engine, which further reduces thrust. By the time Block 4 version of the F-35 is fully fielded in 2028, aircraft sub-systems &lt;a href="https://aviationweek.com/defense-space/new-leadership-reimagines-us-air-force-fighter-fleet-structure"&gt;will need a minimum of 47 kilowatts&lt;/a&gt; of cooling, and the amount required to meet follow-on capability demands range as high as 60 kilowatts. The F-35’s power plant will need to generate twice the cooling the F135 engine delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The F-35’s overtaxed engine is getting old much faster than expected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The higher cooling demands-to-higher bleed air linkage is where the zero-sum game raises its ugly head with this engine. As more bleed air is pulled for cooling, the engine burns more fuel and runs hotter than it was designed to operate. A higher fuel burn ratio decreases the F-35’s range, and the higher temperatures have already resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.defensedaily.com/pratt-whitney-looks-to-enhanced-f-35-engine-for-cooling-advanced-weapons-and-saving-billions-in-life-cycle-costs/air-force/"&gt;markedly higher engine wear&lt;/a&gt;, failure rates and repair cycles for the F135.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The F135 engine will not meet future electrical power requirements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the demands for thrust, range and cooling, the &lt;a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2003/11/mil-031105-hamilton-sundstrand01.htm"&gt;voltage generation specification&lt;/a&gt; that was designed into the JSF was wholly sufficient for the subsystems envisioned in 2001. However, the performance and tactical effective range of subsystems like a new APG-85 radar [&lt;a href="https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FY2023-UPL_Air-Force.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;] and enhanced electronic warfare systems that will come with the F-35 Block 4 will require more electrical power. Add upgrades that are on the horizon like directed energy weapons, and you start hitting voltage stops. The F-35 Joint Program Office has &lt;a href="https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2018/06/13/pratt-whitney-is-pitching-a-new-version-of-the-f-35-engine/"&gt;already identified&lt;/a&gt; this challenge and signaled the need for an engine that can produce more kilowatts of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Incremental engine improvements will only address part of the problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pratt has proposed an incremental, scalable engine upgrade called the Enhanced Engine Program (EEP) that can increase thrust by &lt;a href="https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/program-management/f135-upgrades-reengining-considered-new-f-35-propulsion-road-map"&gt;6 to 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/program-management/f135-upgrades-reengining-considered-new-f-35-propulsion-road-map"&gt;increase fuel efficiency&lt;/a&gt; from 5 to 6 percent. Pratt had previously claimed it could increase thrust by 15 percent and fuel efficiency as much as 20 percent in the same upgrade. It could also deliver up to a 50 percent increase in cooling capacity. The initial cost of EEP is, indeed, projected to be much lower than buying a new engine, but the projected gains will remain estimates until the upgraded engine is paid for and fielded and, even if they pan out, will still fall short of future F-35 weapons system demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. The AETP engine is proven, exceeds current demands and will enable future F-35 upgrades.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goals for the adaptive engine test program were to prove a &lt;a href="https://www.100knots.com/adaptive-engine-transition-program-aetp-a-revolutionary-propulsion-mechanism-for-the-f-35/"&gt;three-stream architecture&lt;/a&gt; that improves engine fuel efficiency by 25 percent, increases thrust by 10 percent and significantly improves thermal management (cooling). Pratt and General Electric (GE) were selected to build AETP prototypes. While Pratt’s XA101 is still under development, GE’s XA100 has completed testing and has proven to increase fuel efficiency by 25 percent (enabling 30 percent greater range) and increase thrust by 10 percent to 20 percent (delivering 20 percent more acceleration than the F135). The XA100 provides twice the cooling capacity, and its ceramic matrix composite turbine blades can withstand 500 degrees Fahrenheit—more heat than the F135 engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pratt’s XA101 also shows great promise, and there is every reason to believe that at the end of its testing, the Air Force will have two great options for a next-generation engine. While developing AETP’s technology was essential for the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) family of systems, it will also support every Block 4 upgrade currently envisioned for the F-35 — and that weapons system desperately needs an injection of competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Competing the next engine for the F-35 will elevate performance and drive down costs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition has been missing from the JSF engine program since the JSF’s second engine, the GE’s F136, was cancelled in 2011. From that point on, Pratt has held the engine monopoly on the F-35 program, leaving no compelling reason for the company to compete on price. With that, the F135 was the only major F-35 sub-system that failed to cut its acquisition costs to reach weapons system program targets, which made bringing the cost of the F-35A below its $80 million target that much more challenging. Having Pratt and GE compete side by side for future engine contracts will force both to maximize the performance and minimize the cost of their engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Proven performance, then price should be the driving factors for the future F-35 engine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost estimates for a fielded AETP engine generally exceed $6 billion. If cost were the primary driver, the $2 billion price tag for EEP would win hands down—at least at first glance. But the EEP is a band aid approach to addressing the F-35’s fundamental powerplant challenges, and to be successful that “band aid” would have to grow over time. Selecting EEP would mean waving a hand to those additional costs, and the incremental nature of those upgrades would do more to constrain the capabilities of the F-35 weapons system than propel them forward. It would mean ignoring the performance issues that drove competition back into fighter engine procurement in the 1970s. By design, the AETP program would reinvigorate competition and elevate the trajectory of the F-35 for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when the U.S. is likely to be outnumbered by its adversaries, particularly in a fight in the Indo-Pacific, it’s important that our aviators have the best fighters America can provide. Air combat is unforgiving when it comes to second best. Putting one of the AETP engines in the F-35 is clearly the best choice for U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Biden’s Tales of an Economic “Recovery” Don’t Mesh With Reality</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/markets-and-finance/commentary/bidens-tales-economic-recovery-dont-mesh-reality</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/gdp3q22_adv.pdf"&gt;Commerce Department announcement&lt;/a&gt; that GDP had grown at a 2.6% real rate in the third quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/27/statement-by-president-biden-on-third-quarter-gdp-report/"&gt;President Joe Biden declared&lt;/a&gt;, “Today we got further evidence that our economic recovery is continuing to power forward.” But soft spots in the GDP report point to problems ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans are facing high prices and declining stock market portfolios. Tight labor markets and the feedback of inflation on wages are keeping nominal wage increases elevated and wiping out the wage-growth gains the American people experienced from 2017 through 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the gain in GDP comes from the value of exports, which rose 17% in real terms from the second quarter, accounting for 1.63 percentage points of the 2.6% increase in GDP. Due to Russian President Vladimir Putin cutting off natural gas supplies to Europe, the global price of energy has risen dramatically, far higher than inflation. This has led to higher prices for U.S. energy exports, which deliver an upward kick to GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden applauds higher GDP, but he has been desperately trying to lower oil prices. &lt;a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/10/11/biden-admin-begged-saudis-delay-oil-production-cuts-until-days-before-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;He has asked the Saudis to produce more&lt;/a&gt;. He has &lt;a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/10/05/biden-admin-reduce-sanctions-opec-member-cartel-cuts-production/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;taken sanctions off Venezuela so Chevron can restart production there&lt;/a&gt;. He has &lt;a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/10/18/biden-admin-pay-three-times-refill-strategic-reserves/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;taken oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/markets-and-finance/commentary/fdrs-new-deal-bidens-tax-and-spend-policies-have-been-economic"&gt;Like FDR’s New Deal, Biden’s Tax-and-Spend Policies Have Been an Economic Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the United States is a major oil producer, President Biden could lower oil prices by taking steps to increase future production. Rather than going to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia for oil, or tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, he could instruct his agencies to speed up the pace of new drilling permits, reapprove existing drilling permits and approve more pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason GDP rose was due to federal government spending, which increased by almost 4% on an annual basis. State and local government spending also rose. This is not the sign of a healthy economy, but of future inflation ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-inc="2"&gt;Real final sales to private domestic purchasers were disappointing. They rose by only one tenth of 1% from the prior quarter, compared with a rate of 1.3% during the first half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although third quarter GDP numbers are positive, no one knows whether the Federal Reserve, through its rate increases, will drive America into a recession in 2023. As the Federal Reserve continues to raise the federal funds rate, borrowing becomes more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies cut back on proposed projects because borrowing costs more than the potential rate of return. People find that their mortgage, credit card and auto loan payments are higher, and they have less money to buy goods and to eat out. With purchases postponed and lower use of services, GDP growth is lower than would be the case otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is troubling that this is already happening. Real private consumption, a driver of GDP growth, slowed to 1.4% from 2% in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy and food prices are taking a bite out of people’s incomes, and they can’t afford to spend as much as they did last year. This squeeze in consumption spending is likely to continue as interest rates rise and people need to spend more on mortgage payments, auto loans, and credit card balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/markets-and-finance/commentary/government-micromanagement-running-economy-ground"&gt;Government Micromanagement Running Economy Into Ground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline in residential investment of 7.4% from the prior quarter, due to rising interest rates, is the sixth consecutive quarterly decline. This is the outcome of rising mortgage rates. As housing continues to decline, people will not need to spend as much on appliances and furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden’s future economic policy depends on the next Congress taking a number of politically unpalatable steps: raising taxes; substantially increasing government spending, including entitlement payments; enabling federal agencies to impose burdensome regulations on businesses and ordinary Americans; increasing union power; and forfeiting America’s energy independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing alone, each initiative would be harmful to America’s economy. Combined with future Federal Reserve rate hikes, these initiatives would slow the economy in 2023 and following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American consumer and the American economy would be better off if these provisions stall in a new Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The Biden Administration’s Electric Vehicle Gambit Is Illegal and Costly</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/government-regulation/commentary/the-biden-administrations-electric-vehicle-gambit-illegal-and</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Congress has repeatedly rejected radical climate change policies that would increase the price of energy. Now, President Joe Biden is circumventing the legislative branch by moving to force people into using electric vehicles. This plan would impose the costliest regulatory burden ever inflicted on the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of people don’t support phasing out and eventually banning the sale of internal combustion engine cars. At a time of record high inflation and a very expensive new and used vehicle market, these regulations raise the cost of gas-powered cars to push people toward EVs that are, on average, $18,000 more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening gambit of Biden's plan has three main components. First, the Environmental Protection Agency promulgated new emissions standards for cars and trucks—standards that can be met only by electrification of at least 17% of the new fleet. Second, the EPA and the Department of Transportation worked together to bless California’s reimplementation of its separate (and illegal) greenhouse gas vehicle emissions standards and electric car mandate. Third, the Transportation Department set fuel-economy standards that cannot be achieved without electrification and that explicitly incorporate California’s electric car quota into their “baseline.” Manufacturers that don’t sell enough EVs have to buy credits or pay fines, increasing the price of all nonelectric cars. The EPA estimates the price hikes will reach thousands of dollars per car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/energy-economics/commentary/washington-knows-best-what-car-you-should-drive-electric-vehicles"&gt;Washington Knows Best What Car You Should Drive: Electric Vehicles. Seriously?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act grants the Transportation Department &lt;i&gt;sole &lt;/i&gt;authority to regulate fuel economy for the entire nation and forbids states from making laws that are even “related to” fuel economy. Moreover, the law explicitly prohibits the department from “considering” electric vehicles in setting these standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Clean Air Act, Congress gave the EPA authority to regulate pollutants from the tailpipe. California could request permission to impose separate standards under a narrow set of circumstances, given its unique topography and challenge with smog. Historically, the EPA and California have not used this authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars, both because it’s a stretch under the Clean Air Act and because there is a direct, scientifically verified relationship between fuel economy and carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court directed the EPA to change course in 2007, stating that there was no reason to believe the Transportation Department and the EPA could not regulate harmoniously. Both the Obama and Trump administrations issued joint rules by both agencies trying to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a bid to phase out conventional vehicles, the Biden administration has tried to sidestep the prohibition on DOT considering electric vehicles by having the EPA first issue its standards in a separate rulemaking and then restore California’s Clean Air Act “waiver” for its own standards and electric car quota. This completely inverts the statutory system, transforming it into a tool for forcing electrification rather than the technology-neutral, performance-based system Congress created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/coal-oil-natural-gas/commentary/we-dont-need-costly-mandated-detour-electric-cars"&gt;We Don’t Need a Costly, Mandated Detour to Electric Cars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress should use every means possible—whether through oversight, appropriations, or legislation—to expose and rein in the Biden administration’s power grab, which pursues its climate change agenda without regard for economic consequences or the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most promising route to restrain this overreach is through litigation. States such as Ohio and Texas and more than a dozen trade groups are fighting the administration’s moves under the Major Questions Doctrine. Under &lt;i&gt;West Virginia v. EPA&lt;/i&gt;, the Supreme Court said for agencies to change policy so drastically, as Obama wanted to do to force power plants to change to renewable fuels, they must have clear direction from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No such clarity can be found here. And this case is even more influential. The regulations coming out of the EPA and the Transportation Department are the most expensive in U.S. history. They are designed to remake, not to regulate, our energy systems. The courts should reject the administration’s cynical attempt to circumvent Congress’s prerogative.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Twenty-First Century Illicit Drugs and Their Discontents: The Scourge of Illicit Fentanyl</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/report/twenty-first-century-illicit-drugs-and-their-discontents-the-scourge</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Job 9:23 (King James)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the last decade of the 20th century, America has been gripped by a tremendous increase in the number of its citizens who are suffering from the overuse and misuse of opioids. The result has been called an epidemic, but another term might be more apt. As one physician described it, “The proliferation of opioid use in the United States is called an epidemic, but it more resembles metastatic cancer.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;David Brown, Opioids and Paternalism, Am. Scholar 22, 23 (2017); see Jon Kamp et al., How Two Mexican Drug Cartels Came to Dominate America’s Fentanyl Supply, Wall St. J., Aug. 30, 2022, https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexico-drug-cartels-fentanyl-overdose-sinaloa-jalisco-11661866903 (“Fentanyl metastasized into a broader crisis in the 2010s, as drugs flowed from China, sometimes through Mexico, and the cartels ramped up their own production. The eastern half of the U.S. was particularly hard-hit as powdered fentanyl was mixed into the heroin supply, sometimes catching users off guard and leading to an increase in fatal overdoses.”). Numerous studies, books, and articles discuss the provenance and extent of that epidemic. See, e.g., Understanding the Epidemic, Cntrs. For Disease Control &amp; Prevention (Dec. 19, 2018), https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic​/index.html [https://perma.cc/SFQ6-RLKF]; Scott Higham &amp; Sari Horwitz, American Cartel: Inside the Battle to Bring Down the Opioid Industry (2022); Anna Lembke, Drug Dealer, MD (2016); American Epidemic: Reporting from the Front Lines of the Opioid Crisis (John McMillan ed., 2019); Barry Meier, Pain Killer: An Empire of Deceit and the Origin of America’s Opioid Epidemic (2018); Sam Quinones, Dreamland: The True Tale of America's Opiate Epidemic (2016); Patrick Radden Keefe, Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty (2021).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cancer could be a more appropriate label, given the number of fatalities that opioids have caused. As U.S. Senator Tom Cotton and U.S. Representative David Trone, co-chairmen of the Commission to Combat Synthetic Opioid Trafficking, explained earlier this year, “The overdose crisis in the United States claims more lives each year than firearms, suicide, homicide, or motor vehicle crashes.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Commission on Combatting Synthetic Opioid Trafficking, Final Report vii (Co-Chairs Letter) [hereafter Synthetic Opioid Comm’n].&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More people than even AIDS killed during its worst years.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Ben Westhoff, Fentanyl, Inc.: How Rogue Chemists Are Creating the Deadliest Wave of the Opioid Epidemic 4 (2019).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;i&gt;Legal Memorandum&lt;/i&gt; is another in a series of Heritage Foundation papers under the overall title “Twenty-First Century Illicit Drugs and Their Discontents.” This one will focus on the synthetic opioid fentanyl. It will explain why fentanyl has become a modern-day Old Testament scourge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Dilemma That Opioids Pose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulbs of the poppy plant produce a gum that has been known for its analgesic properties for thousands of years.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See, e.g., Gene M. Heyman, Addiction: A Disorder of Choice 23–25 (2009); Brodie Ramin, The Age of Fentanyl: Ending the Opioid Epidemic 9 (2020); John J. Coleman &amp; Robert L. DuPont, Fentanyl as Sentinel: The Deadly Threat of Illegal Synthetic and Counterfeit Drugs, The Heritage Found., Backgrounder No. 3436, at 2 (Sept. 4, 2019).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The word &lt;i&gt;opium&lt;/i&gt; comes from the Greek word &lt;i&gt;opion&lt;/i&gt;, meaning poppy juice.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Ramin, supra note 4, at 9.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In the 19th century, chemists identified the poppy component responsible for the plant’s analgesic effects and purified that substance into the drug known as morphine, named after Morpheus, the Greek god of sleep. Just before the turn of the 20th century, the Bayer company modified morphine to produce diacetylmorphine, which the company called &lt;i&gt;heroin&lt;/i&gt; after the German word &lt;i&gt;heroisch&lt;/i&gt;, which means heroic or mighty.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Coleman &amp; DuPont, supra note 4, at 2.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Touted as a powerful cough suppressant and a less addictive painkiller than morphine, heroin was seen initially as an invaluable medicament at a time when tuberculosis and pneumonia killed thousands.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opioids remain the premiere analgesic today.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See, e.g., Jerrold S. Meyer &amp; Linda F. Quenzer, Psychopharmacology: Drugs, the Brain, and Behavior 305–06 (2d ed. 2018) (“As a class, [opioids] are the very best painkillers known to man.”).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They have that effect by generating a cascade of the naturally produced pleasure-inducing molecule dopamine in the reward center in the brain, the &lt;i&gt;nucleus accumbens&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See generally Moheb Costandi, Neuroplasticity (2016); Robert L.

Koob et al., Drugs, Addiction, and the Brain (2014); Nora D. Volkow et al., Neurobiologic Advances from the Brain Disease Model of Addiction, 374 New Eng. J. Med. 363 (2016).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Think of it as “the brain’s Grand Central Station, a junction for addictions and anxieties and obsessions.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Zachary Siegel, A Hole in the Head: Can a Brain Implant Treat Drug Addiction?, Harpers 25 (Sept. 2022) (punctuation omitted).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dopamine is exceptionally helpful in some circumstances. To produce it, physicians prescribe opioids to relieve the intense pain and suffering caused by recent surgery or end-stage cancer, which dopamine accomplishes well.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Coleman &amp; DuPont, supra note 4, at 2.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Opioids, like antibiotics and vaccines, are a modern-day pharmacological success story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet therein also lies a dilemma: “[O]pioids give pleasure, and pleasure is a trap.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Ramin, supra note 4, at 9 (footnote omitted).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Opioids seduce people into believing that they are the ticket to earthly paradise. A problem is that long-term (and some short-term) users get waylaid into physical dependence or addiction. The former describes the state in which your body needs a certain drug to avoid becoming physically ill; the latter, a state in which using a drug becomes the &lt;i&gt;raison d’étre &lt;/i&gt;for your life.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between the two concepts: “While all morphine and morphine substitute chemicals produce analgesia and brain reward, prolonged use may lead to analgesic tolerance in patients treated for pain and to compulsive intake by opioid addicts. Long-term use also may produce physical dependence, a condition manifested by somatic withdrawal symptoms in the absence of the drug. Withdrawal symptoms may include pain, insomnia, and diarrhea, which are, in effect, a reversal of the drug’s therapeutic effects. Physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms can be resolved medically by gradual dose reduction over several weeks or months, and is known in the lingo as ‘tapering.’ [¶] More worrisome, however, is ‘addiction,’ a serious disease referred to in the literature today as substance use disorder (SUD). This condition is often misunderstood in the discussion of chronic opioid use. Unlike physical dependence, a SUD involving opioids is not easily managed by gradual dose reduction because of a strong desire or craving that the addicted person has for the abusable substance, even following periods of forced or voluntary abstinence. Unlike tolerance or physical dependence, both of which typically respond well to medical management, a SUD is a life-threatening chronic disease characterized by compulsive use of psychoactive substances despite their harm.” Coleman &amp; DuPont, supra note 4, at 3 (footnotes omitted); see also Volkow et al., supra note 9, at 364 Box 1.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Addiction treatment physician Dr. Brodie Ramin has described the problem as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Addiction is about dopamine. Addictive substances push dopamine to high, often massively elevated levels, in the nucleus accumbens, the reward centre of the brain. This is the &lt;i&gt;high&lt;/i&gt; of the street vernacular. You get high, then you come down. You get dope, then you get dope sickness. You use. You need a fix, a drink, a toke. Stimulating the opioid receptors leads to a cascade in the brain that ends with increased dopamine…. Floating on a cloud is a common description of the first high.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Ramin, supra note 4, at 15 (footnote omitted; emphasis in original).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ramin explained the highs and lows of opioids as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pamela told me that heroin is like an abusive lover; it gets under your skin and into your mind. Opioids make you feel high and then bring you down. They make you feel calm and safe and then smother you in your sleep. All you can think about is your next point of heroin or your next pill of Percocet, but more than anything you want to stop using. You want to get away. You fight, but the opioid fights back. It gives you chills and drenching night sweats; it makes you vomit; it makes you want to jump out of your skin; it makes you crazy with revulsion and desire. It is the perfect biological weapon, designed to target the pleasure centres of the brain.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Ramin, supra note 4, at 2, 9; see also, e.g., Martin Booth, Opium: A History (1996); David T. Courtwright, Dark Paradise: A History of Opiate Addiction in America (2009); H. Wayne Morgan, Yesterday’s Addicts: American Society and Drug Abuse, 1865–1920 (1974). For personal accounts of the effect that addiction can have on the user and his or her family, see, for example, James Frey, A Million Little Pieces (2005); Beth Macy, Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors, and the Drug Company that Addicted America (2018); Sigrid Rausing, Mayhem (2017); David Sheff, Beautiful Boy: A Father’s Journey Through His Son’s Addiction (2009); Nikki Sixx, The Heroin Diaries (2007).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of addiction leads to a rewiring of the brain or “neuroplasticity”—viz., “systematic changes in the synaptic signaling, or communication, between neurons in various reward regions of the brain”:&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Volkow et al., supra note 9, at 366 Box 2.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Opioids affect the brain’s response to stimuli and impair decision-making. We are all creatures of habit, and addiction is a deeply ingrained habit…. When you smell your favorite food, you start salivating before a morsel has passed your lips. So it is with drugs. Entering a room where you have used drugs or taking out the equipment to smoke or inject a drug leads your dopamine-producing cells to start firing in anticipation of the rush to come. Repetition turns opioid use into an automatic and compulsive behavior. These changes in the brain endure; they last for years after drug use stops, which is why addiction is a chronic disease.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Ramin, supra note 4, at 16 (footnote omitted). For a pictorial depiction of the stages of the addiction cycle, see Volkow et al., supra note 9, at 365 Fig. 1.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is like seeing Dante Alighieri’s &lt;i&gt;Divine Comedy&lt;/i&gt; played in reverse. Opioid use can take people from the &lt;i&gt;Paradiso&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Purgatorio&lt;/i&gt; through the &lt;i&gt;Inferno&lt;/i&gt;, ultimately entombing them in a far worse form of misery than whatever physical or psychological anguish they had hoped to leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The tragedy for nearly all people who use drugs is that they never return to that initial state of bliss. With repeated use, smaller and smaller amounts of dopamine are released. People need to increase the quantity and frequency of opioid use. Even worse, they become less sensitive to the stimulation for non-drug-related rewards, and they lose motivation to do quotidian and necessary activities such as show up at work and maintain their relationships. The joys of drug use plateau and then decline, but so do the joys of life. Food doesn’t taste as good, careers become a barrier to using drugs, and love feels less like love.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Ramin, supra note 4, at 17–18.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, even that absence of ordinary sources of gratification and happiness is not the nadir of an addict’s life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It gets worse. Not only does the brain’s reward system flatline, but there is a concurrent rise of the brain’s anti-reward system, the network of brain pathways involved in stress and negative emotions. Chronic drug use makes the anti-reward system overactive. That is why people who use opioids chronically are more likely to develop depression and to stop caring about every other aspect of life other than drugs. People who use opioids are pulled to the rewards of drugs while also being pushed to avoid withdrawal, depression, and pain. Over a short period of time, a person transitions from taking drugs in order to get high to using them to get a brief respite from depression. Rather than using to get the feeling of floating on a cloud, people begin to use opioids to make the pain stop.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 18 (footnote omitted); see also id. at 19–20; Volkow et al., supra note 9, at 366 &amp; Box 2 (“Experience-dependent learning (such as that which occurs in repeated episodes of drug use) may invoke both long-term potentiation, in which the transmission of signals between neurons increases, and long-term depression, in which signal transmission decreases…. In this way, environmental stimuli that are repeatedly paired with drug use—including environments in which a drug has been taken, persons with whom it has been taken, and the mental state of a person before it was taken—may all come to elicit conditioned, fast surges of dopamine release that trigger craving for the drug…motivate drug-seeking behaviors, and lead to heavy ‘binge’ use of the drug. These conditioned responses become deeply ingrained and can trigger strong cravings for a drug long after use has stopped (e.g., owing to incarceration or treatment) and even in the face of sanctions against its use.”) (footnotes omitted); see Ramin, supra note 4, at 21–24.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far too many Americans fell into that trap over the past century by overusing prescription opioids or illicit substitutes to address physical pain or to avoid psychological distress that can be no less real and disabling. Nonetheless, illicit opioid use can have tragic consequences. Approximately half of the people who use heroin become addicted to it; for every first user, “it is a coin toss” whether addiction will follow.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Ramin, supra note 4, at 24.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Congress sought to prevent heroin’s use by prohibiting its sale more than a century ago. Nonetheless, just as prohibiting the production and distribution of alcohol did not prevent people from becoming alcoholics, outlawing heroin has not kept heroin from ruining or claiming numerous lives.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914, ch. 1, 38 Stat. 785; 21 U.S.C. §§ 812(c) Schedule I &amp; 841 (2018); see John Kaplan, The Hardest Drug: Heroin and Public Policy (1983); David F.

&lt;h3&gt;The Opioid Epidemic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, physicians were reluctant to prescribe opioids except in limited circumstances, given their addictive potential.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Coleman &amp; DuPont, supra note 4, at 3 (noting that opioids were used for “providing end-of-life care for patients whose physical dependence on the medication was not a relevant risk factor”).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Several factors coalesced to change that attitude in the 1990s. Prompted by the work of patient advocacy groups, pain—whether caused by disease or by injury and whether acute or chronic—came to be seen as the fifth vital sign (atop temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, and blood pressure).&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See, e.g., Coleman &amp; DuPont, supra note 4, at 3; D. Andrew Tompkins et al., Providing Chronic Pain Management in the “Fifth Vital Sign” Era: Historical and Treatment Perspectives on a Modern-Day Medical Dilemma, 173 Drug &amp; Alcohol Dependence Supp. 1 S11–S21 (2017).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Insurers for managed health care programs demanded that physicians increase the number of their patients and declined to reimburse non-opioid pain treatments. Pharmaceutical companies claimed to have developed forms of opioids that had a very low risk of addiction. Physicians feared patients’ ability to rate the quality of their treatment on social media. As a result, doctors found that they could satisfy all of those groups by regularly prescribing opioids to manage chronic pain.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See, e.g., Lembke, supra note 1.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sadly but perhaps predictably, beginning late in the 1990s, “America has witnessed an increase in drug overdose deaths in numbers partaking of Biblical proportions,”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Paul J. Larkin, Jr. &amp; Bertha K. Madras, Opioids, Overdoses, and Cannabis: Is Marijuana an Effective Therapeutic Response to the Opioid Abuse Epidemic?, 17 Geo. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y 555, 557 (2019).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; due principally to overuse and misuse of opioids, legal and illegal.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See, e.g., id. at 561–62, 588. As one report summarized: “Beginning in the late 1990s, prescribing of opioid pain relievers spread far beyond traditional indications. Opioids had long been used with considerable success to treat acute pain in general and chronic cancer pain in particular. Chronic non-cancer pain began to be recognized as a serious and prevalent problem in America in the 1990s. In this period, U.S. pharmaceutical companies argued that the appropriate response to this real problem was a dramatic expansion of opioid prescribing. Companies such as Purdue Pharma organized ‘pain lobbies’ of doctors and patients to urge widespread and prolonged use of new potent opioids, such as OxyContin—not just for severe pain in terminal patients but also for ordinary injuries, bad backs, and wobbly knees. Beguiled doctors started prescribing opioids to wide segments of the U.S. population—from injured high school athletes to older people suffering from arthritis. The pharmaceutical companies cynically and duplicitously promoted the aggressive prescription of opioids, knowing they could lead to substance dependence. Worse, the pharmaceutical companies not only suppressed revelations about how supposedly harmless opioids in fact stimulated substance dependence, but also managed to capture or neutralize almost every U.S. institution charged with protecting the public from such malfeasance—from the medical schools to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Substance dependence rose fastest in the places most aggressively targeted by pharmaceutical companies’ promotions, and those with the most ‘pill mills’ and unscrupulous doctors and pharmacies. These included vulnerable communities with declining income and lack of economic and educational opportunities, such as in West Virginia, a state that became associated with prescription opioid — and later other opioid—use disorder and misery.” Vanda Felbab-Brown et al., The Opioid Crisis in America: Domestic and International Dimensions: Overview, Brookings Inst. 3–4 (June 2020) (footnotes omitted).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epidemic hit the nation in three successive “waves” of increasing severity.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Ramin, supra note 4, at 3 (footnote omitted) (“We have been hit by three waves, so far, of the North American opioid epidemic. In the 1990s, as more doctors prescribed more opioids to ease pain, patients began to die from those medications. That was the first wave. The second wave began in 2010, as heroin became increasingly competitive with prescription opioids in terms of cost and purity, and new heroin distribution networks spread across the continent. The third wave began only a few years later, in 2013. We are being hit by the third wave now [viz., 2020], and it’s much worse than the wave of the 1990s, worse than what occurred in 2010. The third wave is being driven by fentanyl.”). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2019–2022 eclipsed the opioid epidemic, but the latter did not disappear.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wave 1 involved the overprescription and overuse of opioids.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In Wave 2, once the federal and state governments limited opioid prescriptions to address the spreading overdose crisis, opioid users turned to heroin because it was easier to obtain and less expensive.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See, e.g., Paul J.

	&lt;li&gt;Wave 3, the most recent and still-ongoing stage, involves a synthetic analgesic, fentanyl.&lt;/li&gt;

Westhoff, supra note 3, at 37. Its introduction, however, was momentous. “China White represented a fish-crawling-onto-land moment: it was the first popular illicit drug synthesized by a rogue chemist that was new, rather than simply a copy of something already on the medical market. And thus, alpha-methylfentanyl was the first in a long line of new psychoactive substances that came to include K2, Spice, ‘bath salts, and all the other psychoactive substances this book is about.

&lt;p&gt;During the Obama and Trump Administrations,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Felbab-Brown, supra note 49, at 8–9 (describing the Administrations’ effort to enlist China’s aid).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the United States urged China to control its production and export of fentanyl and its analogues—drugs that have only minor variations from fentanyl in their chemical structure that leave its effect unchanged but allow manufacturers and shippers to evade the regulatory scheme.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Synthetic Opioid Comm’n, supra note 2, at 7.

In 2019, however, after engagements at multiple levels, including a meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping, China changed its fentanyl regulatory scheme. The Chinese government included all fentanyl analogues within its schedule of controlled substances and banned their export without a special government-issued license.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id.; Felbab-Brown, supra note 49, at 9.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The result was to shift the nature of China’s involvement in fentanyl trafficking.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Disrupt, not stop.

The Synthetic Opioid Commission described those effects as follows: “First, the ban halted the continued generation of new fentanyl analogues and reduced the supply of these drugs directly from the PRC to the United States. Multiple experts in the U.S. government and other reports and data attest to this; the numbers of new fentanyl analogues appearing for the first time in drug seizures from domestic U.S. markets fell dramatically. This was accompanied by a sharp decline in the numbers of air-based seizures at ports of entry (POEs) arriving by mail to the United States from the PRC, starting around the time that the two countries were discussing classwide scheduling of all fentanyl-related substances. Nevertheless, despite the success in stopping direct shipments into the United States, these measures did not end the problem of illegal manufacture or import of synthetic opioids. [¶] Second, with the full ban on fentanyl-related compounds, producers in the PRC adapted and began trading in chemicals not listed under the country’s law. These chemicals include the emergence of nonfentanyl synthetic opioids, such as the benzimidazole class of opioids (e.g., etonitazene, isotonitazene), which started showing up in greater frequency in death and seizure data in 2019. At the same time, exports of uncontrolled fentanyl precursors, such as 4-AP and 4-piperidone, to TCOs in Mexico increased. According to federal authorities, since 2019, criminals in Mexico have been the primary source of fentanyl illegally imported into the United States using precursors from the PRC and elsewhere.” Id. at 7 (footnotes omitted).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether China will vigorously enforce its scheduling law remains to be seen, but the prognosis is a bleak one.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Felbab-Brown et al., supra note 26, at 10 (“Though proud of its tough counternarcotics stance, China is unlikely to closely collaborate with the United States. The significant deterioration of U.S.–Chinese relations may undermine China’s willingness to diligently enforce the fentanyl regulation. Only when China starts to experience its own opioid epidemic—for example, because international pharmaceutical companies set off abuse of prescription opioids—will China likely crack down on the illicit fentanyl trade robustly. In the meantime, Felbab-Brown recommends a four-pronged approach: 1) with respect to the government of China: delinking counternarcotics policy from the U.S.–China global rivalry; 2) with respect to Chinese pharmaceutical companies: mandating that all companies selling legal fentanyl in the United States institute verifiable internal monitoring of their production facilities and contribute opioid samples to a U.S. or international database; 3) with respect to prominent Chinese pharmaceutical and chemical industry officials: the development of packages of leverage; and [4]), with respect to drug traffickers: the development of legal indictment portfolios.”); Felbab-Brown, supra note 49, at 5 (“The question now is how likely it is that China will diligently enforce the new regulation and crack down against individuals and companies that illegally traffic fentanyl to the United States and elsewhere in the world. That is a question of both capacity and will.

Vested interests of industry representatives and government officials then often hamper regulation and its enforcement, even when China is in violation of its international treaty obligations and there are intensely negative public health consequences for Chinese citizens…. [¶] Moreover, geostrategic considerations tend to trump other domestic and international considerations pertaining to regulation in a wide variety of regulatory domains. [¶] All this does not bode well for tight enforcement of China’s new fentanyl regulations—at least not until a synthetic opioid epidemic arrives in China as a result of aggressive and unscrupulous marketing of prescription opioids there by the same pharmaceutical companies responsible for the U.S. opioid epidemic and already operating in China, as well as their Chinese business partners (or from Chinese drug traffickers selling fentanyl to Chinese heroin users).”); id. at 10 (“[E]nforcement is frequently left up to local officials whose political careers and political survival are far less dependent on enforcing regulations than on advancing the economic interests of the Chinese government—namely, revenue and job generation—which the government deems essential for preservation of CCP rule and stability in China.

&lt;p&gt;Yet even if China were to collaborate aggressively with the United States to stem illicit fentanyl manufacturing, China’s efforts might not count for very much.

India’s large pharmaceutical industry is even more poorly regulated than China’s. It is also politically powerful, and aggressively promotes the sale of opioids in India and abroad, for example in Africa, where its sales of tramadol contribute to an intensifying drug epidemic. But, Felbab-Brown notes, U.S. counternarcotics leverage with India will be severely constrained by the U.S. desire to cultivate India as a geopolitical counterweight against China…. [¶] U.S. capacity to generate anti-fentanyl law enforcement actions in Myanmar is also severely constrained—both by the ongoing and intensifying civil war in the country and by geopolitical considerations. A myriad of militant groups and pro-government militias have been implicated in the production or taxation of illicit drugs. For decades, the Myanmar military has allowed the ethno-secessionist groups to trade in anything, including drugs, as an inducement to get the groups to agree to and maintain ceasefires with the government. It has similarly allowed progovernment militias to self-finance through the production of methamphetamine and heroin. The military has mostly undertaken counternarcotics actions when militants or militias crossed its domestic redlines, such as by trading with militant groups against which the military is engaged in active hostilities. New broad U.S. sanctions are unlikely to change this calculus while undermining other U.S. objectives.”).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geopolitics plays an unavoidably large role in the fentanyl problem. Foreign nations often expect or demand some type of quid pro quo to help the United States solve a problem they do not share. Our government must decide whether obtaining the assistance of nations like China, India, and Myanmar is a priority and, if it is, what we are willing to offer to enlist their help. Complicating those negotiations is any tension or enmity between those nations (or their leaders) and ours. For example, China, hypersensitive to criticism, is loath to accept responsibility for any part in America’s fentanyl crisis. The CCP has consistently blamed America for any fentanyl overdose and fatality problem, saying that the United States must reduce its demand for illegal drugs, change its culture of drug use and addiction, and step up its enforcement of our laws. China also has been reluctant to partner aggressively with the Drug Enforcement Administration in the investigation of illicit fentanyl labs and smuggling activities within that country.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Felbab-Brown, supra note 49, at 21–22.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Finally, China’s recent adventurism in Southeast Asia toward Taiwan makes it unlikely that China would welcome or empower new American law enforcement officers on Chinese soil anytime soon.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;As Felbab-Brown of the Brookings Institution concluded in 2020: “China is thus most unlikely to mount cooperation with the United States on synthetic opioids as extensive as its collaboration with Australia to suppress methamphetamine production and trafficking from China. The level of collaboration is likely to fall as direct trafficking of synthetic opioids from China to the U.S. continues to decrease and trafficking is increasingly routed through intermediary countries. China already exhibits limited interest in cracking down on the flows of precursor agents from China to Mexico. In response to previous efforts by the Mexican government to lobby China to stop fentanyl and precursor trafficking, Chinese government officials tended to reply: ‘It’s a problem for Mexico to deal with. It’s a problem with your customs. There’s nothing we can do.’ Similarly, since the early days of the Obama administration, neither the United States nor Mexico have [sic] been able to persuade China to crack down on the vast amount of methamphetamine precursor agents transshipped from China to Mexico and fueling a devastating high-potency methamphetamine addiction in both the U.S. and Mexico. Once again, the pattern appears to be one of China enforcing counternarcotics controls only to the extent necessary to achieve plausible deniability and push the visible element of the problem abroad.” Id. at 23 (footnotes omitted).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, whatever saps this nation’s energies strengthens China’s position relative to ours. Scheduling fentanyl’s analogues in 2019 and now sitting back and doing nothing (or next to nothing) gives China a cost-free way to avoid international criticism while harming its most powerful rival. As Napoleon is reputed to have mused, never interfere with the enemy when he is in the process of destroying himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mexico&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Mexico has always played an important role as a transshipment point for the smuggling of China’s fentanyl into this country.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Mexico also plays the major role in the smuggling of heroin into America.

&lt;h3&gt;Why Fentanyl Is a New Scourge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fentanyl differs from well-known “hard” drugs, such as heroin, in three ways. Each one is relevant to the problem we face today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Difference No. 1: Fentanyl is extremely potent&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The first difference is that fentanyl is extraordinarily powerful because it binds more efficiently to neuroreceptors than plant-based analgesics like heroin do.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Pardo et al., supra note 30, at 2.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fentanyl is 50–100 times more powerful than morphine, the drug that serves as the baseline for measuring analgesic effectiveness.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;CDC, Fentanyl, supra note 11; Pardo et al., supra note 30, at 2. The potency of drugs is measured in terms of their Morphine Equivalent Dose, or MED. Pardo et al., supra note 30, at 3.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (For perspective, heroin is five times as powerful as morphine.) And some analogues of fentanyl, such as carfentanil, which is used to tranquilize elephants, are &lt;i&gt;ten thousand times as&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;powerful as morphine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See, e.g., Pardo et al., supra note 30, at 2; Westhoff, supra note 3, at 31–32.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Only a few grains—&lt;i&gt;grains&lt;/i&gt;, not &lt;i&gt;grams&lt;/i&gt;—of carfentanil are fatal to humans.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;“Because of its incredible potency, fentanyl is extremely difficult to dose properly. It can be lethal at only two milligrams, an amount barely visible to the eye and far smaller than a dose of heroin. Traffickers ‘cut’ fentanyl into other drugs to give them more kick, unbeknownst to users. Thus, many fentanyl victims think they are taking heroin, cocaine, meth, or prescription pills.” Westhoff, supra note 3, at 3.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Only a miniscule amount of fentanyl is necessary for it to have its anaesthetic or analgesic effect. A smidgeon more and death follows like the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. “It takes only 2 milligrams to be lethal. That’s not even enough to cover the year on the front of the penny in your pocket.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Andrew Olivastro, Fentanyl’s Wake, Am. Mind, May 25, 2022, https://americanmind.org/salvo/fentanyls-wake/; Synthetic Opioid Comm’n, supra note 2, at 2. Unfortunately, fentanyl and its analogues are not the end of the development of powerful synthetic opioids. More are being developed regularly. See, e.g., Jon Kamp &amp; Arian Campo-Flores, This Is U-47700, Once a Lab Experiment, Now a Killer Opioid, Wall St. J., Nov. 4, 2016, https://www.wsj​.com/articles/this-is-u-47700-once-a-lab-experiment-now-a-killer-opioid-1478269461?mod=article_inline (“In a high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse, overseas labs are churning out new synthetic drugs at a furious pace, often staying a step ahead of authorities and helping to fuel America’s rampant opioid crisis.

That problem is beyond the scope of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Difference No. 2: Fentanyl can kill instantly&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;The second difference is that because of its potency, fentanyl can kill instantly.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Westhoff, supra note 3, at 3.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There is very little room between the curves defining the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of fentanyl needed to achieve its analgesic effect and the minimum fatal dose.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;For a discussion of those concepts, see T. Liu et al., Estimation of Maximum Recommended Therapeutic Dose Using Predicted Promiscuity and Potency, 9 Clinical Transl. Sci. 311 (2016).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Put differently, there is little margin for error. A person who, wittingly or not, uses more than the small amount of fentanyl to achieve the sought-after blissful euphoric state might not have any such margin. As Illinois’ Madison County Coroner Stephen Nonn put it, “‘When we go to a death scene and you still see the needle in the arm, we know it was fentanyl because it works that quick[ly].’”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 125.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That feature alone explains why fentanyl is a far bigger threat than heroin. Heroin turns people into “addicts”—viz., individuals who were more than physically dependent on a drug and would start “jonesing” for it if its use were discontinued. Addicts—a term that is no longer widely used but that still accurately summarizes a relevant concept—are individuals whose drug use dominates their lives so completely and deeply that they compulsively use a drug and do whatever is necessary to obtain it, despite the damage it does to their professional, family, and personal lives, because their brains have become rewired and demand it.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See Coleman &amp; DuPont, supra note 4, at 3.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, unlike fentanyl, drugs like heroin offer what is called the “gift of desperation”—that is, the opportunity to seek treatment after hitting “rock bottom” and realizing that death is “just a shot away.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;The Rolling Stones, Gimmie Shelter (Decca Records 1969).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Heroin addicts can enter treatment for their substance use disorder, and though escaping an addiction is quite difficult, some are able to do so successfully. Fentanyl doesn’t give people that chance. It is merciless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Difference No. 3: Fentanyl is easier and cheaper to produce, smuggle, and distribute than heroin&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;The third difference is in the production processes for poppy-based opioids like heroin and synthetic drugs like fentanyl.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;“From a supplier standpoint, illegally manufactured synthetic opioids have several advantages over plant-based heroin in terms of production and distribution…. Operationally, it takes a few days to produce a batch of fentanyl, while poppy takes months to come to harvest. A single lab employing a trained technician can substitute for a field of poppy that employs scores of laborers. Further, poppy is subject to blight, drought, and eradication. A synthetic opioid can be produced in a small lab, sometimes in a single container, that is easier to conceal from authorities than hectares of poppy would be.” DEA Nat’l Drug Assessment, supra note 30, at 19 (footnote omitted); see also, e.g., Westhoff, supra note 3, at 4–5; Pardo et al., supra note 30, at 2–4.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Synthetic opioids—and other Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS)&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Westhoff, supra note 3, at 33 (“Historically, only a few handfuls of different compounds have been used reliably to get people high, but over the past hundred years or so, humankind has learned to synthesize the active chemicals in laboratories and to manipulate chemical structures to invent new drugs—the numbers of which began growing exponentially in the 2010s. Anyone with computer acumen can acquire hundreds of psychoactive compounds that didn’t exist even a few years ago.

The traditional plant-based drug trade has an hourglass shape—with many producers at the top, many retail-level dealers at the bottom, and fewer importers and exporters in the middle (this is illustrated in Figure 4.1). In contrast, the supply chain for illegally produced synthetic opioids is a pyramid that cuts off the large number of producers at the top. Instead, fewer chemists or producers make fentanyl or other synthetic opioids that are shipped via importers and exporters to wholesale and retail distributors. Online distribution and mail-order delivery streamline the process further, by cutting out exporters and sending small amounts of fentanyl directly from producer to users or to importers for further distribution. Consolidating supply chains makes them far more efficient, reduces risks to suppliers, and increases revenues retained by the remaining segments in the chain.” Synthetic Opioid Comm’n, supra note 2, at 20.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroin is the product of the opium poppy. Because heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance, it cannot be lawfully cultivated within, imported into, or manufactured in the United States. It must be produced elsewhere and then smuggled into this country.

A tiny amount of fentanyl can kill unseasoned users.”); Georgetown Behavioral Hosp., supra note 34; Friedman et al., supra note 33.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this problem will only worsen over time.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See DEA Nat’l Drug Assessment, supra note 30, at 17 (“The heroin and fentanyl markets, already intertwined, will continue to grow as traffickers mix heroin with fentanyl to stretch heroin supplies and maximize revenues. Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids will likely continue to contribute to high numbers of drug overdose deaths in the United States in the near term, as fentanyl availability either by itself or mixed in with other drugs—particularly heroin—continues to persist. However, overdose deaths involving heroin alone may stabilize or continue to decline in the near term. The low cost, high potency, and ease of acquisition of fentanyl may encourage heroin users to switch to the drug should future heroin supplies be disrupted. As Mexico is the dominant supplier of heroin entering the United States, additional restrictions or limits on travel across the U.S.–Mexico border due to pandemic concerns will likely impact heroin DTOs, particularly those using couriers or personal vehicles to smuggle heroin into the United States. Another possibility may be a decrease in the price level for heroin as DTOs and street-level dealers maximize associated profit margins by increasingly mixing fentanyl into distributed heroin. DTOs may come to view heroin as simply an adulterant to fentanyl. Mexican TCOs will remain the primary source of supply for heroin and fentanyl smuggled into the United States, using precursors primarily sourced from China, and they will continue to use their extensive infrastructure in both Mexico and the United States to supply lucrative U.S. opioid markets.”).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fentanyl shows that enterprising chemists are able to create new synthetic opioids, and the Mexican cartels are willing to expand their operations to create new drugs for both existing and new markets.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See, e.g., DEA Nat’l Drug Assessment, supra note 30, at 14 (“DEA reporting indicates that Mexican TCOs are significantly involved in fentanyl production. The Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) appear to be increasing the production of wholesale quantities of fentanyl in both powder and pill forms. Additionally, these TCOs are diversifying their precursor chemical sources of supply, and moving to precursor chemicals further down the synthesis chain to avoid international chemical controls.”); Pardo et al., supra note 30, at xvi (“Much as the synthesis of heroin in the late 19th century displaced morphine and forever changed the opiate landscape, the country may again be standing at the precipice of a new era: Inexpensive, accessible, and mass-produced synthetic opioids might displace heroin, which could have important and hard-to-predict consequences.”); Westhoff, supra note 3, at 33 (“According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, 150 new illicit drugs were bought and sold between 1997 and 2010. Another 150 appeared in just the next three years, and since then, in some years as many as 100 new chemicals have appeared, with synthetic cannabinoids especially common.”), 82–90 (discussing the development of synthetic cannabinoids, such as K2), 158 (“In the United States, fentanyl has been hugely profitable for the [Mexican] cartels, and despite its staggering death count, it may have only scratched the surface.”).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given Mexico’s economic problems, Mexican TCOs also have no shortage of young men willing to join their ranks for the money and prestige that comes with cartel membership.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;“They have this saying here, ‘Mas vale vivir cinco anos campo rey que cincuenta como guey,’ said Deborah Bonello.

&lt;h3&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fentanyl is the Black Mamba of illicit drugs. Its fangs contain a quick-acting, extremely aggressive, highly potent, merciless, and remorseless venom that kills in the blink of an eye. “Never…has an opiate—or any other drug, for that matter—killed so many annually as the fentanyl epidemic.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Westhoff, supra note 3, at 25.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Illicit fentanyl use is a public health problem of historic proportions.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See, e.g., CDC, Fentanyl, supra note 12 (“Rates of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, which includes fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, increased over 16% from 2018 to 2019.

More than 36,000 people died from overdoses involving synthetic opioids in 2019. The latest provisional drug overdose death counts through May 2020 suggest an acceleration of overdose deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.”) (footnotes omitted).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As a 2018 Brookings Institution report noted, “Replacing drugs derived from plants (e.g., heroin, cannabis) with synthetic analogues (e.g., fentanyl, Spice/K2) could be the most disruptive innovation in the history of the international drug trade.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Vanda Felbab-Brown et al., How Synthetic Opioids Can Radically Change Global Illegal Drug Markets and Foreign Policy, Brookings Inst., Apr. 30, 2018, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/04/30/how-synthetic-opioids-can-radically-change-global-illegal-drug-markets-and​-foreign-policy/; see also, e.g., Keith Humphreys et al., Opioids of the Masses, 97 Foreign Affs. 118 (May/June 2018).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The recent federal Commission to Combat Synthetic Opioid Trafficking concluded that “the trafficking of synthetic drugs into the United States [is] not just a public health emergency but a national emergency that threatens both the national security and economic well-being of the country.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Synthetic Opioid Comm’n, supra note 2, at ix, x.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Medical and law enforcement professionals agree on the nature of the problem and the need to stop its murderous assault on the nation.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;See, e.g., Pardo et al., supra note 30, at xv, 11–12 (noting that overdose fatalities involving fentanyl or an analogue outnumber overdose death from heroin or semisynthetic drugs by a 2:1 ratio), 35 (suggesting that illicit fentanyl might be replacing heroin in some locations); Westhoff, supra note 3, at 4 (“‘Today we are facing the most deadly crisis in American history,’ then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during a 2018 press conference. ‘We’ve never seen anything like it.’”); id. (“‘Fentanyl is the game changer,’ Special Agent in Charge James Hunt of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) told Vice. ‘It’s the most dangerous substance in the history of drug trafficking. Heroin and cocaine pale in comparison to how dangerous fentanyl is.’”); id. at 25 (“Never…has an opiate—or any other drug, for that matter—killed so many people annually as the fentanyl epidemic.”); id. at 51 (“[By 2016,] fentanyl had shot past heroin and was killing more Americans annually than any other drug in American history. And the fentanyl analogues, which are being developed and marketed at a rapid clip, threaten to make the problem worse.”); cf. id. at 20 (“The former director of the DEA’s Special Operations Division, Derek Maltz, used stark terms to describe the fentanyl-driven opioid epidemic. ‘Where it becomes a national security emergency is the connectivity between the drug traffickers and the terrorists that are out there that are trying to destroy our way of life,’ he said in November 2018.”).&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A joint federal–state response is necessary because this threat will not pass into the night and the states cannot handle it alone. As the Commission to Combat Synthetic Opioid Trafficking concluded earlier this year, given all the features that make fentanyl dangerous—its relatively greater potency than plant-based opioids, its relatively simple and inexpensive production and distribution process, the vast areas in Mexico where the drug can be synthesized, the cartels’ demonstrated willingness to exploit every advantage that the United States offers for drug trafficking, and the refusal of Presidents López Obrador and Joe Biden to stop fentanyl smuggling from Mexico into the United States&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement alone cannot eliminate fentanyl abuse; both supply-side and demand-side approaches are necessary. See Synthetic Opioid Comm’n, supra note 2, at x (“The difficult truth is that there is no easy solution to the synthetic opioid problem. The supply of illicit fentanyl cannot be permanently stopped through enforcement alone—only temporarily disrupted before another cartel, trafficking method, or analogue steps in to fill the market that addiction creates. U.S. and Mexican efforts can disrupt the flow of synthetic opioids across U.S. borders, but real progress can come only by pairing illicit synthetic opioid supply disruption with decreasing the domestic U.S. demand for these drugs.”); Frank &amp; Pollack, supra note 112, at 606 (“Within the policing arena, traditional drug-enforcement approaches emphasize use reduction. Given the dangers of a substance such as fentanyl, use reduction can indeed benefit public health by deterring distribution, sale, and use. Cracking down on illegal laboratories and other links in the supply chain would probably help disrupt the fentanyl market. [¶] Over time, however, use reduction has often provided too little incentive for illegal-market participants to reduce public health risks. Indeed, law-enforcement policies can aggravate public health harms. For example, intensive policing interventions—particularly those targeting buyers caught with syringes—increase needle sharing, raising the risk of HIV transmission.”); id. at 607 (“Fentanyl’s low production costs and high death toll pose a distinctive challenge that requires a concerted response. We believe a full package of prevention, treatment, and harm-reduction interventions is the best bet for reducing a frightening public health threat and saving lives.”); Nora Volkow &amp; Francis S. Collins, The Role of Science in Addressing the Opioid Crisis, 377 New Eng. J. Med. 391 (2017); Nora Volkow et al., Medication-Assisted Therapies—Tackling the Opioid Overdose Epidemic, 370 New Eng. J. Med. 2063 (2014). A future Heritage paper will discuss some responsive steps.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—“a transition from heroin or diverted prescription opioids to more-potent synthetic opioids is here to stay.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Synthetic Opioid Comm’n, supra note 2, at 3, 6.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Jim Crotty, Deputy Chief of Staff at the Drug Enforcement Administration from 2019 to 2021, fentanyl “is in fact the most pernicious, the most devastating drug that we have ever seen.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Kamp et al., supra note 1.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Adding a little bit of black humor, Crotty said that if fentanyl “were an athlete, people would call it ‘The G.O.A.T.’”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All jokes aside, the facts show that Crotty is right. We have long known that while opioids can relieve pain, they also can destroy life. Generally, they work slowly by reducing users to the ever-hungry souls in a Buddhist afterlife. Sometimes, though, they act more quickly, leaving no opportunity for the inexperienced user or for someone who succumbs to reuse after becoming “clean.” Fentanyl, however, does not give many users the opportunity for redemption; it can kill in the blink of an eye. Worse still, fentanyl can kill unwitting or novice users. Opioid users once had the chance to survive a poor choice—to walk away after youthful experimentation or to hit rock bottom after being hooked but then realizing that they needed to turn their lives around. Now users frequently do not get that second chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to educate people about fentanyl’s danger, persuade them not to run the risks it poses, and stop the sale of poison to our fellow citizens. Andrew Olivastro, a colleague of mine at The Heritage Foundation, once wrote, “In this war, the drugs are winning. The battle must be joined.” Fentanyl proves that he is right.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Nonparty Subpoenas: The Latest Lawfare Threat to the First Amendment</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/the-constitution/report/nonparty-subpoenas-the-latest-lawfare-threat-the-first-amendment</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Liberal advocacy groups and the U.S. Department of Justice have recently served broad-ranging, nonparty subpoenas on conservative organizations, seeking their internal and external communications with other groups and elected representatives dating back many years. It seems clear that these subpoenas are intended to harass those who are on the conservative side of policy debates in order to chill their speech, to deter their active participation in the democratic legislative process, and to discourage individuals and potential partners from contributing to or otherwise affiliating with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These abusive discovery requests threaten the First Amendment rights of those organizations and their members to engage in free speech, associate with others who share their beliefs, and speak to their elected representatives and other government officials about public policy issues that concern them. Membership organizations need to fight this discovery lawfare vigorously, and courts must protect the basic First Amendment rights of citizens—rights that are vital to a functioning republic—by quashing such discovery requests and sanctioning the lawyers and parties who engage in such abusive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Applicable Civil Procedure Rule&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subpoenas in civil lawsuits are authorized under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 45 and allow parties to the suit to require testimony and the production of documents, electronically stored information, and other “tangible things,” including from nonparties. The extent to which parties can engage in such discovery is outlined by FRCP 26(b)(1), which states that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefits.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;FRCP 26(b)(1), https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_26.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRCP 45(d)(1) also provides that subpoenas should not impose an “undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;FRCP 45(d)(1), https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_45.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Courts are directed to “protect a person who is neither a party nor a party’s officer from significant expense resulting from compliance.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;FRCP 45(d)(2)(B)(ii).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The factors outlined in FRCP 26 guide the analysis of what constitutes an undue burden,&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Watts v. SEC, 482 F.3d 501, 509 (D.C. Cir. 2007).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and courts are directed to quash or modify any subpoena that “(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or (iv) subjects a person to undue burden.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;FRCP 45(d)(3)(A)(iii) and (iv).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Example of an Abusive Subpoena&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this type of lawfare is the broad, voluminous subpoena that was served on the Eagle Forum of Alabama on August 10, 2022, by the U.S. Justice Department.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Eknes-Tucker v. Marshall, Case No. 22-184 (M.D. Alabama August 9, 2022), Subpoena to Produce Documents. A similar subpoena was served on the Southeast Law Institute.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Eagle Forum of Alabama is a small, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. It has one full-time employee and one part-time employee. Virtually all of its work on issues of interest to its members is done by volunteers. It is the quintessential, uniquely American grassroots membership organization that French historian Alexis de Tocqueville lauded in &lt;i&gt;Democracy in America&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America, University of Chicago Press (2000), https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/805328.html.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Motion to Quash the government subpoena filed by the Eagle Forum on September 7 says, one issue of concern to its members is “gender-altering medical treatment to minors” and the “permanent and adverse effects of such medical procedures on those minors.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Eknes-Tucker v. Marshall, Case No. 22-184 (M.D. Alabama Sept 7, 2022), Nonparty Eagle Forum of Alabama’s Objection to and Motion to Quash Document Subpoena, or in the Alternative Motion to Modify Subpoena, p. 2, https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.112.107/v3x.f9c.myftpupload.com/wp​-content/uploads/2022/09/Motion-to-Quash-DE-151-Sept-7.2022.pdf.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Those serious, lifelong effects deeply concern many physicians and parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the Eagle Forum made their concerns known by taking actions that every American has an absolute right to take: They spoke out, made speeches, organized meetings, talked to other residents and organizations in Alabama, and contacted their elected state representatives.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id., Declarations of Becky Gerritson and Margaret S. Clarke.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More specifically, they exercised their constitutional rights to engage in “freedom of speech,” “peaceably to assemble,” and “to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;U.S. Const. amend. I.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They also exercised their right to associate in concerted action with other citizens who are similarly concerned about this important public policy issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, perhaps, of the concerns expressed by these groups and other constituents, the Alabama Legislature passed the Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act (the Act), which became effective on May 8, 2022. The Act bans puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery to alter the biological sex of a minor.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Act No. 2022-289, Senate Bill 184 (2022), https://legiscan.com/AL/text/SB184/2022.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state was immediately sued over the new law by plaintiffs represented by lawyers from a variety of left-wing organizations, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders, and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Eknes-Tucker v. Marshall, First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (August 9, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Justice Department intervened in the lawsuit, echoing their claims that the new Alabama law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Eknes-Tucker v. Marshall, United States Motion to Intervene (April 29, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eagle Forum is not a party to the lawsuit. Yet the Justice Department subpoena demanded that the Eagle Forum (and its members) turn over all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Materials that the Eagle Forum considered connected to the legislation or any draft, proposed, or model bills, including medical studies, opinions, or evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Documents concerning the Eagle Forum’s “legislative or policy goals, initiatives, and/or strategies relating to medical care or treatment of transgender minors, or minors with gender dysphoria.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Communications with—and testimony, letters, reports, etc., sent to—state legislators or their staff and any other government agencies and officials in Alabama over the legislation or medical care “related to gender identity, transgender minors or youth, ‘transidentifying’&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;The Merriam-Webster dictionary does not list “transidentifying” as a recognizable word. See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary​/transidentifying.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; minors or youth, or youth with gender dysphoria.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Communications with all other nongovernmental organizations, consultants, or lobbyists related to the gender issue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Internal minutes and records of meetings, polling and public opinion data, video presentations and speeches, newsletters and emails, and social media postings related to the legislation and the gender issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the Justice Department wanted to turn the Eagle Forum of Alabama inside out, forcing it to disclose all of the records of its activities—and of its volunteer members—related to this public policy dispute. This would let government lawyers and lawyers representing the other organizations in this lawsuit that are ideologically on the opposing side of this highly contentious issue paw through and scrutinize everything the Eagle Forum does, including personal discussions and communications with other private citizens and nonprofit organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to imagine what possible relevance any of the documents sought by the Justice Department has to the pending lawsuits. Whether it is the “social media postings” of members of the Eagle Forum or the organization’s “polling and public opinion data” or its internal “policy goals” or “strategies,” all of this information is completely immaterial to the question of whether the Alabama Act violates the U.S. Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three nonprofit organizations and membership associations, federal and state legislators, and individual citizens&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;The author is one of the amicus parties in his former capacity as a member of the Federal Election Commission and Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Justice.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; filed an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief supporting the Eagle Forum’s Motion to Quash and objecting to the Justice Department subpoena, outlining the significant threat that it poses to fundamental First Amendment activity.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Boe v. Marshall, Case No. 22-184 (M.D. Alabama Sept. 20, 2022), Brief of 53 Organizations, Federal and State Legislators and Individual Citizens as Amici Curiae in Support of Nonparty Eagle Forum of Alabama’s Objection to and Motion to Quash Document Subpoena.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The amicus brief starkly outlines the conflict between such intrusive discovery of nonparties and the First Amendment rights of membership organizations and individual citizens to engage freely in protected political, petitioning, and associational speech and activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the amicus brief states, this subpoena is a “transparent use of the civil litigation process to chill the speech and political organizing of those who hold views contrary to those” of the Department of Justice and the other parties in the lawsuits.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 2.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It is threatening enough when private parties demand such discovery. It becomes even more dangerous and intimidating when the law enforcement arm of the federal government engages in such egregious and outrageous demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such harassing discovery “harms not just members of the public across all ideological and political spectra, who will be inhibited from open discourse and petitioning, but also legislators themselves, who benefit from hearing from their constituents without those citizens fearing subsequent federal investigations seeking reams of protected materials.” There is little doubt that such subpoenas will, and were intended to, inhibit citizens and their member issue organizations from speaking to and petitioning their representatives, which is fundamental to the democratic process.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Legal Precedent on the Dangers of Abusive Discovery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pivotal legal precedent on the dangers of such abusive discovery and the constitutional threat that it poses is the 1958 case of &lt;i&gt;NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson&lt;/i&gt;, in which the Supreme Court of the United States in a unanimous decision stopped Alabama from demanding that the NAACP turn over its membership rolls as a condition of being qualified to do business in the state. Alabama was attempting to deter the activities of the NAACP by violating the free speech and associational rights of the organization and its members under the First Amendment. The Court held—and correctly so—that the privacy rights of such organizations and their members are “indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 462 (1958). The Supreme Court held in 1925 that the First Amendment is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Furthermore, the Court added, “it is immaterial whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association pertain to political, economic, religious or cultural matters, and state action which may have the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is &lt;i&gt;subject to the closest scrutiny&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;NAACP, 357 U.S. at 461 (emphasis added).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, in &lt;i&gt;Americans for Prosperity v. Bonta,&lt;/i&gt; the Supreme Court weighed in on California’s demand that all charitable organizations soliciting funds in the state file copies of their IRS Form B, which lists their major donors, with the state’s attorney general.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Americans for Prosperity v. Bonta, 141 S.Ct. 2373 (2021).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In reversing the Ninth Circuit’s holding that nonprofits (such as the Eagle Forum, The Heritage Foundation, and a variety of other groups across the political spectrum) have to turn over such information, the Supreme Court said California’s requirement was facially unconstitutional and did not survive exacting scrutiny, which requires that a government-mandated disclosure regime be narrowly tailored in that there must be “a substantial relation between the disclosure requirement and a sufficiently important governmental interest.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 2383.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Court added that “[e]very demand that might chill association” is constitutionally suspect.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 2387.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious that if the Supreme Court views the forced public disclosure of donors to disfavored or “dissident” organizations as constitutionally suspect because it can subject them to harassment and intimidation, deterring their participation, so does forced disclosure of the identity and internal and external communications of the volunteer members of such issue organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to its now-overturned holding in &lt;i&gt;Americans for Prosperity&lt;/i&gt;, when nonparty subpoenas were served by gay rights advocacy groups on supporters of California’s Proposition 8, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman, seeking all “internal campaign communications relating to campaign strategy and advertising,” the Ninth Circuit quashed the subpoenas, overruling the district court. It held that such “discovery would have the practical effect of discouraging the exercise of First Amendment associational rights.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 591 F.3d 1126, 1131–32 (9th Cir. 2009).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ninth Circuit applied a burden-shifting analysis over the assertion of First Amendment privilege. The target of the subpoena had to show that the discovery demand would “result in (1) harassment, membership withdrawal, or discouragement of new members, or (2) other consequences which objectively suggest an impact on, or ‘chilling’ of, the members’ associational rights.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 1140 (citations omitted).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Once this prima facie showing has been made, the burden shifts to the government to “demonstrate that the information sought through the [discovery] is rationally related to a compelling governmental interest [and] the ‘least restrictive means’ of obtaining the desired information.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. (citation omitted).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Circuit has held that when a subpoena is directed to a nonparty, discovery “must be limited even more” because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[B]ystanders should not be drawn into the parties’ dispute without some good reason, even if they have information that falls within the scope of party discovery…. [C]ourts must give the recipient’s nonparty status “special weight,” leading to an even more “demanding and sensitive inquiry” than the one governing discovery generally.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Virginia Dept. of Corrections v. Jordan, 921 F.3d 180, 189 (4th Cir. 2019), citing In re Pub. Offering PLE Antitrust Litig., 427 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2005).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent that the party issuing the subpoena, such as the Justice Department, tries to argue that the activities of a private organization like the Eagle Forum (or The Heritage Foundation) and its communications with legislators is relevant to the intent of legislators in passing particular legislation that is being challenged, that argument is contrary to the holding in the recent &lt;i&gt;Dobbs &lt;/i&gt;decision. In that case, citing the 1968 decision in &lt;i&gt;U.S. v. O’Brien&lt;/i&gt;, the Supreme Court emphasized once again that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Inquiries into legislative motive “are a hazardous matter.” Even when an argument about legislative motive is backed by statements made by legislators who voted for a law, we have been reluctant to attribute those motives to the legislative body as a whole. “What motivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 142 S.Ct. 2228, 2256 (2022) (quoting U.S. v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 384 (1968)). See also Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367 (1951) (The Court’s many previous holdings that “it was not consonant with our scheme of government for a court to inquire into the motives of legislators, has remained unquestioned.” Id. at 377).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 11th Circuit has similarly said that when “the import of words Congress has used is clear…we need not resort to legislative history, and we certainly should not do so to undermine the plain meaning of the statutory language.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;CBS Inc. v. PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture, 245 F.3d 1217, 1222 (11th Cir. 2001).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State courts have followed the same rule. In Alabama, for example, the state supreme court has said that the “intention of the Legislature, to which effect must be given, is that expressed in the statute, and &lt;i&gt;the courts will not inquire into the motives which influenced the Legislature or individual members in voting for its passage&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;State v. 223,405.86, 203 So. 3d 816, 831 (Ala. 2016) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If statements by individual legislators are not relevant to determining intent, then the statements, communications, and speeches of private organizations and individuals that have no authority or power to pass legislation are even further removed from having any relevance in determining the intent of a legislative body in passing specific legislation. It also seems clear that the chilling effect on the political speech and interactions of citizens with their legislators far outweighs any possible relevance their actions could possibly have to determining the constitutionality of a statute or the actions of a legislative body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As summarized by The Heritage Foundation in its objection to a similarly egregious Rule 45 document demand in a Texas case in which it was also not a party:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the Supreme Court has made clear that inquiry into the motives of &lt;i&gt;legislators—&lt;/i&gt;who choose a life of public scrutiny—is legally out of bounds, then it simply goes without saying that, &lt;i&gt;a fortiori&lt;/i&gt;, it is unduly burdensome to force private citizens and their association to produce for inspection their protected communications with the very state officials whose motivations are irrelevant. Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot express a legitimate basis for the requested documents, let alone a compelling need sufficient to justify infringing Heritage’s First Amendment rights.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;La Union Del Pueblo Entero v. Abbot, Case. No. 21-844 (W.D. TX), Nonparty The Heritage Foundation’s Objections to Plaintiffs’ Rule 45 Request for Production of Documents (March 25, 2022), p. 5.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of the amicus brief supporting the Eagle Forum, the Justice Department is trying “to use its party status to issue subpoenas to acquire sensitive information it could never otherwise obtain in compliance with the First Amendment.” In fact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mere issuance of this subpoena—even if it is ultimately quashed—severely chills First Amendment rights because individuals will now fear that their communications on any controversial issue—either now or in the future—will be subjected to a subpoena issued by an Assistant United States Attorney on behalf of the federal government.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems little doubt that such individuals will “curtail their political activities as a result.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Amicus Brief at 9.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Moreover, such discovery demands, which the Fifth Circuit in a similar case found “disturbing,” would force an issue-oriented membership organization “to turn over &lt;i&gt;to a public policy opponent&lt;/i&gt; its internal communications, setting a precedent that may be replicated in litigation anywhere.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Whole Woman’s Health v. Smith, 896 F.3d 362, 373 (5th Cir. 2018), as revised (July 17, 2018) (emphasis in original) (holding that compelling an ecclesiastical association to reveal internal communications regarding its view on the treatment of fetal remains through a subpoena and subjecting the association to sanctions constituted a substantial burden).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of discovery abuse also implicates the right of citizens to freely petition the government and communicate with their legislators. The Supreme Court has identified this right as one of “the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights,” a “right that is implied by ‘[t]he very idea of a government, republican in form.’”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;BE&amp;K Const. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U.S. 516, 525–26 (2002) (quoting Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn., 389 U.S. 217, 222 (1967)). See also U.S. v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1876).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The right to petition entitles citizens to communicate freely with government officials, including legislators, to advance their ideas and advocate for particular causes.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Borough of Duryea, Pa. v. Guarnieri, 564 U.S. 379, 388–89 (2011).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That protection applies in the context of compelled discovery that would substantially burden such core First Amendment activity.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;AFL-CIO v. FEC, 333 F.3d 168, 175–76 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citing Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 64–68 (1976)).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a new tactic of the Left and the current Justice Department to use discovery lawfare to harass conservative organizations like the Eagle Forum that are not parties to a lawsuit. The intent is to create expense and hassle for the target of these subpoenas or to hope that the organization cannot afford to fight to quash or limit the scope of those subpoenas. This allows ideological opponents to obtain communications and documents that are irrelevant to the underlying lawsuit but that can be used to embarrass the analysts, staff, and volunteers of those organizations, as well as their members and coalition partners, politically; damage the organization with respect to the ongoing policy dispute that triggered the lawsuit; and deter the type of coalition building and activism that the conservative legal and advocacy world uses to convince state governments to implement beneficial legislation and government policies in many areas, including election reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Heritage Foundation, Heritage Action for America, and the Public Interest Legal Foundation, among other groups, have been hit with similar subpoenas and discovery demands in other lawsuits filed by liberal groups.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;La Union Del Pueblo Entero v. Abbott, Case No. 21-844 (W.D. Texas) (Rule 45 Request for Production of Documents to Heritage Foundation); In re Georgia Senate Bill 202, Case No. 21-55555 (N.D. Georgia) (Rule 45 Subpoena for Documents to Heritage Action). These lawsuits all involve claims that election reform legislation passed by state legislatures are somehow discriminatory under the Voting Rights Act or unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Revised Justice Department Subpoena as Objectionable as the Original&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 7, 2022, after the Motion to Quash the Justice Department’s third-party subpoena was filed by the Eagle Forum and the amicus brief supporting that motion was filed, the Justice Department suddenly filed a notice with the court that it was narrowing the scope of its subpoena and now only wants the Eagle Forum to turn over “any medical studies or literature referenced in Section 2” of the new Alabama law.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Boe v. Marshall, Case No. 22-184 (M.D. Alabama October 7, 2022), Notice Regarding Subpoenas to Third Parties Eagle Forum of Alabama and Southeast Law Institute.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 2 contains a series of findings by the legislature. The Justice Department is apparently referring to paragraph (14) of Section 2 in which the legislature stated that “Several studies demonstrate that hormonal and surgical interventions often do not resolve the underlying psychological issues affecting the individual.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This revised subpoena, albeit narrower in scope, is just as objectionable as the original. If the Justice Department wants to know what studies this legislation is referring to, it should obtain that information from the legislators who sponsored and voted for the bill, not a nonparty like the Eagle Forum or its volunteers who are not legislators and did not and do not have the power and authority to enact this—or any other—bill into law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a hearing held on October 14, Judge Liles C. Burke castigated the Justice Department for its “vastly overbroad and unduly burdensome” subpoena. In fact, he asked, “how in the world could what the Department of Justice is asking for possibly be relevant to this case and its outcome,” given that the issue is “whether or not this statute is constitutional”?&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Eknes-Tucker v. Ivey, Case No. 22-184 (M.D. Alabama Oct. 14, 2022), Transcript of Hearing Before the Honorable Liles C. Burke, pp. 9 and 3.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When the judge asked the Justice Department lawyer, Jason Cheek, why the department had suddenly gone from “asking for [an] ‘everything we can think of subpoena’ down to [a] ‘we just really actually only need one thing’” subpoena, the only answer the lawyer seemed to be able to give was the “amicus briefs filed by numerous organizations” and his complaint that the Eagle Forum did not first have a “conversation” with the department to negotiate a narrowing of the scope of the subpoena.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 6, 7, and 10.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, only vigorous opposition that entailed cost and legal representation to multiple organizations caused the Justice Department to withdraw its outrageous subpoena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawyer for the Eagle Forum, John Graham, pointed out that FRCP 45 “imposes no such obligation” on the target to try to negotiate a “deal” with the Justice Department. The rule requires those “serving a subpoena—the federal government in this case—to take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden and expense on the recipient of the subpoena, and authorizes sanctions on a party or attorney who fails to comply,” Graham added. “Rule 45 leaves no room for a party or attorney to issue an untimely, facially overbroad and unduly burdensome subpoena and expect to work out the details later.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 34.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, Justice Department lawyers failed entirely to abide by their ethical and professional duty to ensure that they do not engage in abusive discovery that is burdensome and, as the judge said, “not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence” as required by FRCP 26(b)(1).&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 3.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Judge Burke warned the department about the dire consequences of its misbehavior:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Administrations change every four years, or at least every eight. Is the new standard going to be that these kind of subpoenas go out in legislation to any advocacy organization, and they want emails to their members, they want social media posts, they want things that the group just considered in their advocacy? And that’s all the things you are asking for. Is that where you think the Department of Justice thinks we need to go in this country? Because I promise you this, at some point this will be aimed at the Southern Poverty Law [Center] and the ACLU, and their efforts, as well. Is this where we need to go?&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 18.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 24, Judge Burke issued an order quashing the subpoenas served on the Eagle Forum (and the Southeast Law Institute), including the supposedly “narrowed” subpoena.&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Boe v. Marshall, Opinion and Order (Oct. 24, 2022).﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; He held that the Justice Department is seeking “material outside the scope of discovery” that is “unlikely to reveal or lead to any information that would help resolve the fundamental issue in this case,” which is whether the Act “is constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 5.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “the burden of the requested material” on nonprofit organizations that are “staffed almost entirely” by volunteers “greatly outweighs any slight relevance it may have.” Judge Burke also chastised the government for providing “neither evidence nor argument to refute these conclusions.” In fact, Burke said, “the Government’s eleventh-hour ‘narrowing’ of the requested material suggests that the subpoenas, as written, are overly broad and unduly burdensome given the limited resources of the nonparties.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Id. at 5–6. In a footnote, Judge Burke noted that the Justice Department’s supposedly “narrowed request” “does not fit squarely into any of the eleven categories of evidence listed” in the original subpoena. Burke stated that he took “no position on whether the Government’s narrowed request falls within the scope of discovery.” Id. at 6, note 14.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that judges reviewing challenges to nonparty subpoenas will have to review each such challenge on a case-by-case basis, as such issues tend to be fact-intensive inquiries. Judges must understand, though, that intrusive, compelled disclosure requests such as the one issued by the Justice Department to the Eagle Forum of Alabama are not only an unacceptable burden under the applicable rules of civil procedure, but also “likely to affect adversely the ability of the group and its members to pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs which they admittedly have the right to advocate.”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;NAACP, 357 U.S. at 462–63.﻿&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such discovery requests to nonparties violate the First Amendment rights of the targeted organizations to speak, advocate, associate, and petition the government freely. The actions of nonparties who are not legislators or government officials and who have no power or authority to pass or enforce legislation are immaterial and irrelevant when the issue is the constitutionality or legality of a particular statute. Neither the government nor private litigants have a compelling interest that justifies such discovery demands and the violation of fundamental rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonprofit membership organizations, regardless of ideology, should vigorously contest these types of subpoenas and discovery requests by immediately filing motions to quash them. Any attempt to reach an accommodation or negotiate a compromise will only encourage the use of such tactics in future cases. A no-holds-barred, no-quarter-given attitude broadly adopted by all similarly situated organizations that presents a united front could help to short-circuit the further use and development of this type of discovery lawfare, which, as the Supreme Court warned in 1958, endangers the fundamental workings of our democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Judge Burke concluded in the Alabama case, he hoped that we are “not going to go down this road with any organization in addition to Eagle Forum…. I understand why they are here today, and they should be here today”&lt;span class="annotation__highlight" data-annotation="&lt;p&gt;Transcript at 41.&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;&lt;span class="annotation-link"&gt;REF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to fight this type of abusive discovery. It is lawfare at its worst.&lt;/p&gt;

And the stakes are high for Taiwan’s security and freedom. No one wants to see Taiwan become another Ukraine. But, the stakes are also high for the U.S. A CCP takeover of Taiwan would dramatically undermine U.S. economic and geostrategic interests, not just in the Indo-Pacific theatre, but throughout the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>2 States That Should Be Able to Sue Over Biden’s Student Loan Bailout</title>
  <link>https://www.heritage.org/courts/commentary/2-states-should-be-able-sue-over-bidens-student-loan-bailout</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden’s student loan bailout &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4250322"&gt;is illegal&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not a hard call, but before a court can consider the merits of Biden’s scheme, a plaintiff must have what the law refers to as “standing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing is a doctrine that says that a court doesn’t have jurisdiction to hear a case unless the plaintiff has suffered a concrete injury caused by the defendant that a court has the power to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six states &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/09/29/6-states-sue-to-block-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-scheme?_gl=1*1g6as2n*_ga*MTM3OTE5NDAwOC4xNjY2OTczMDI3*_ga_W14BT6YQ87*MTY2Njk3MzAyNi4xLjEuMTY2Njk3MzAzMS41NS4wLjA."&gt;sued to block&lt;/a&gt; Biden’s student loan bailout, claiming that it harmed their financial interests, but a federal district court judge ruled that the states lacked standing. The states appealed, and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed Biden’s bailout plan while it considers the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The district court was wrong about some of the states, and the 8th Circuit should reverse the lower court’s decision. The states with the strongest arguments for standing are Missouri and Arkansas, because of how the student loan bailout harms their state-run loan servicers, which, in turn, harms the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missouri has a state agency (the Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri) that services student loans, including those that Biden plans to cancel. A servicer handles all the administrative tasks associated with loans: communicating with borrowers, processing payments, tracking balances, reporting that information to the federal government, etc. For all this work, a servicer gets paid by the government at a fixed rate per loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s bailout &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4250322"&gt;will harm&lt;/a&gt; these servicers by eliminating millions of the loans they service (and the revenue they make as a result) and by increasing the servicers’ administrative costs by forcing them to administer the bailout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Missouri’s college loan agency is a “public instrumentality,” harms to it are harms to the state. Missouri has what the law calls “proprietary” interests in the financial health of its college loan agency because it participates in the loan-servicing market through the authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missouri also has “quasi-sovereign” interests in the loan agency’s health because money that it makes is invested in other state programs—such as financial assistance programs for students and schools—that benefit Missouri’s citizens. Biden’s bailout will directly harm these interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bailout will also impose secondary financial harms on Missouri’s college loan agency. The direct financial harm, coupled with the uncertainty over whether future “forgiveness” programs might impose those harms again, is likely to decrease the value of the loan agency’s bonds. That in turn would decrease the agency’s bond revenue, meaning that it would have even less money to invest in state programs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all means that Missouri has standing to sue to stop Biden from harming its college loan agency and, by extension, the people of the state of Missouri.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arkansas likely has standing too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arkansas also has a loan servicer (the Arkansas Student Loan Authority) that holds loans from the Federal Family Education Loan program, which aren’t going to be forgiven under Biden’s bailout. (Biden initially said he would forgive these loans, but changed his mind in an apparent attempt to eliminate Arkansas’ standing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these loans won’t be forgiven, borrowers can convert them into direct loans that would be forgiven. Since Biden announced his bailout, tens of thousands of borrowers have done so. As a result, the Arkansas student loan authority has lost millions of dollars of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arkansas’ student loan agency is structured similarly to Missouri’s: It is a state entity and its revenue is used to fund education in Arkansas. As people convert their Federal Family Education loans into direct loans, the Arkansas agency loses those loans and the revenue they provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Missouri, Arkansas can sue to stop Biden from imposing those harms on its student loan agency and its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our prediction, therefore, is that the 8th Circuit will reverse the district court and allow the states’ lawsuit against the Biden bailout to proceed. If the appeals court does do this, it also should preserve its temporary stay of the bailout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legal argument that Biden has advanced in support of his student loan bailout is dubious in the extreme. He relied on a law meant to give the president the power to grant military service members temporary reprieve from loan payments while they’re deployed overseas during times of emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the COVID-19 emergency, Biden said, he can use this law to forgive student loans for everyone. No matter that he just said “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-calls-pandemic-over-says-u-s-troops-could-defend-taiwan-11663554391?mod=mhp"&gt;the pandemic is over&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no matter that the Supreme Court has said that the president &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/07/08/ruling-in-west-virginia-v-epa-was-victory-for-representative-government/"&gt;cannot expansively rewrite laws&lt;/a&gt;. Biden did it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that Biden does not really believe that his loan bailout is lawful. Instead, he’s playing for time, hoping that he can forgive some or all eligible student loans illegally before a court can stop him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds familiar, it’s because Biden did something similar a year ago when he renewed the eviction moratorium imposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That moratorium was unlawful, and &lt;a href="https://reason.com/2021/08/06/biden-admits-new-cdc-eviction-moratorium-runs-counter-to-the-bulk-of-the-constitutional-scholarship/"&gt;Biden admitted&lt;/a&gt; as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the president did it anyway, because, &lt;a href="https://reason.com/2021/08/06/biden-admits-new-cdc-eviction-moratorium-runs-counter-to-the-bulk-of-the-constitutional-scholarship/"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, “by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we’re getting that $45 billion out to people who are, in fact, behind in the rent and don’t have the money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden is doing the same thing again with his student loan bailout. He likely knows it’s unlawful, but he doesn’t care. He just hopes he can get away with it for a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 8th Circuit shouldn’t let the president get away with this bad behavior a second time.&lt;/p&gt;
