      <title>Past Gas #160: Australia’s Favorite Race Car Driver Loved Crystals</title>
      <description>Australian motorsport legend Peter Brock spent years driving for Holden, an Australian subsidiary of General Motors. But when he became a little too interested in New Age theory in the late 1980s, he not only destroyed his longtime business partnership with Australia’s largest automaker, but nearly killed his illustrious career in motorsports. How did Peter Brock, a true wrencher, come to embrace the New Age? Why did this racing legend, who had spent a lifetime gaining the trust and loyalty of an Australian autosports powerhouse, risk it all for a box of crystals? Who was to blame? Today on Past Gas - the true story of Peter Brock and his energy polarizer.

      <title>Past Gas #159: How Semi-Trucks Built America</title>
      <description>Ahhhh, the glorious open road. Cruisin’ USA. In America, the road trip is a rite of passage, a tradition passed down from generation to generation, and it wouldn’t be possible without the American Interstate Highway system, one of the greatest public works projects ever executed in this country. How long did such a behemoth task take to complete? How many roads were constructed? Who paid for it? How did it affect American culture and industry? And maybe most importantly, what’s the friggin’ coolest 18-Wheeler? On this week's Past Gas – The History of The US Highway System and The Growth of Trucking.

      <title>Past Gas #158: What Happened to Suzuki?</title>
      <description>Before 2020, Suzuki hadn’t taken home a MotoGP championship in two decades. But then one young Mallorcan rider turned it all around… for a single season.
Today on Past Gas – How did Suzuki switch from building looms to crafting some of the best motorcycles on the planet? Why did they pull their cars from the US market? And are they getting out of racing, for good?

      <title>Past Gas #156: When Castro Kidnapped an F1 Superstar</title>
      <description>Professional racecar driver Juan Manuel Fangio was eager to meet up with his friends and soak up the beautiful February evening in downtown Havana. After winning his fourth consecutive Formula One Drivers’ Championship, Fangio had been invited to Cuba by the president himself. But Fidel Castro’s comrades from the 26th of July movement had other plans. How did Juan Manuel Fangio go from his modest upbringing to become one of the most famous sports figures in the world? What makes his career in Formula One so special? And why on earth was he thrust into the middle of Cuba’s volatile political crises?! Today on Past Gas - the career and kidnapping of Juan Manuel Fangio.

As driver Rolf Stommelen eased the Porsche into the pits, his teammate, Paul Newman, scampered out with the crew to -– wait what? Paul Newman? Butch Cassidy Paul Newman? He was a driver at Le Mans? How the heck did a pretty-boy actor manage to gain the respect of the racing world? How did he START his racing career in his mid-40s, and not only compete, but win? Today on Past Gas, the racing career of the late, great Paul Newman.

      <title>Past Gas #154: Leaded Gas Was Really Bad</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas is the insidious story of how GM scientists developed a type of gasoline that caused insanity, sickness, and maybe even murder. This story is so devious that it might feel like a cheap dime store novel, but everything we’re going to tell you is true. Why was lead added to fuel in the first place? Who was the scientist behind it? How did the American government let this happen? And did leaded fuel actually lead to an increase in serial killers?! Let’s find out.

      <title>Past Gas #153: Duryea, A Road Trip!</title>
      <description>It’s 1903, and an out-of-work doctor, Horatio Nelson Jackson, is fiercely defending the world’s most exciting invention – the automobile – against a group of men who are POSITIVE that the car was just a fad. Jackson was so sure of himself that he bet $50 that he could take a car from San Francisco to New York City… a feat that had never been done before. Yes, he was going to embark on a road trip at a time when there were no highways, no road maps, no street signs, no gas stations, and no Red Roof Inn’s. Was the automobile even capable of such a journey? How would Horatio Nelson Jackson, an altogether inexperienced driver, complete this treacherous mission? And would he ever see that $50 again? Today on Past Gas, the story of the first cross-country road trip.

      <title>Past Gas #151: IndyCar vs. CART vs. ChampCar</title>
      <description>Tony Stewart was about to run his first Indy 500. It should have been the best day of his life.. but he was the only star who showed up. That fateful day is now known in racing lore as part of “The Split.” But how did open-wheel racing get to that point? What exactly is the difference between CART and IndyCar and Champ Car and all the other names we call this sport? And why does it always seem to be in turmoil? Today on Past Gas, it’s a brief history of the many dramatic twists and turns in the world of IndyCar.

      <title>Past Gas #150: Jeremy Clarkson's Strong Arms</title>
      <description>Jeremy Clarkson is one of the world’s most famous authorities on cars. As Top Gear’s most notorious host, Clarkson has been a major part of car culture since he first started hosting the show in 1988. But to many outside of the car community, he’s despised for his offensive and controversial opinions. How did it come to this? Why is Jeremy Clarkson so revered by car enthusiasts, yet reviled by almost everyone else? Are we able to separate the art from the artist, or are his actions unforgivable? All that and more, for today’s 150th episode of Past Gas – on the notorious Jeremy Clarkson.

      <title>Donut Media Presents: Donut Racing Show</title>
      <description>In the first episode of Donut Media's new Formula One-centric podcast, hosts Nolan Sykes (Donut Media), Alanis King (Business Insider, Jalopnik), and Elizabeth Blackstock (Jalopnik) take you through the highs and lows of Sunday's French Grand Prix. From driver Charles LeClerc's horror movie scream to boyish radio bickering during the battle for third, we're gonna cover it all!
More about the show: 
Donut Racing Show (DRS) brings a cheap beer mindset to the champagne-popping podium of Formula One racing. If you only watch the race on Sunday, you’re missing 70% of the picture... and that’s where we come in. Let Donut Media’s Nolan Sykes, and motor-journalists Alanis King (Business Insider, Jalopnik) and Elizabeth Blackstock (Jalopnik), be your friendly guides to the wild world of Formula One. From the frustrations (FERRARI!) to the glory (RED BULL!) to the downright disappointing (MERCEDES?!), Donut Racing Show is here for you.

      <itunes:summary>Ah, the “family car.” We each remember our treasured childhood vehicle differently, for it contained multitudes: road trips, melted gummy bears, questionable air conditioning... But what does the term “family car” mean to the auto industry? The family segment has had to evolve and change with the times perhaps more than any other type of car. Today on Past Gas: the societal changes that drove innovation behind the family car.

      <title>Past Gas #145: Alex Zanardi is Han Solo</title>
      <description>Alex Zanardi is a champion, a survivor, and a legend. From his father’s garage, to Formula One, to spinning the first celebratory donut, to the Paralympic Games, this fearless Italian has been unstoppable. If there weren't so many people who witnessed his incredible journey in motorsport, you'd think it was scripted. Today, we're taking a deep dive into one of the most mind-blowingly inspirational figures in racing history: Alex Zanardi.

      <title>Past Gas #144: Danica Patrick: Better Than Ricciardo?</title>
      <description>Danica Patrick was one tough cookie, a spitfire, and all those other lightly patronizing names you might call a strong woman in a male-dominated sport. She’s also a self-made mogul, icon, and champion… all achieved before the age of 40. How did she get her start? How many records did she actually break? And how did she become one of the most notorious figures in racing, despite never winning a championship?

      <title>Past Gas #143: Mario Andretti's Purple Cotton Briefs </title>
      <description>There’s probably thirty people on Earth who have never heard the name Mario Andretti. And that’s because Mario Andretti is racing royalty. Today on Past Gas-the story of "Driver of the Century" Mario Andretti. How would Andretti’s childhood living in a WWII refugee camp spark his racing career? What impact did Andretti have on the future of race cars? What led to the Andretti family’s racing dynasty? And is the Andretti Curse REAL?!

        <![CDATA[<p>Randy Lanier was one of the most exciting race car drivers of the 80’s-- but he also had a secret life as a drug smuggler.

      <title>Past Gas #141: Suzuki Turned A Motorcycle Racer Into A Spy</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas, the story of the motorcycle racer turned spy Ernst Degner-- as well as that of a Nazi engineer named Walter Kaaden. Why was Degner leaving East Germany at the height of his fame? How was the Japanese company Suzuki embroiled in his defection? And what secrets did Degner have stuffed in a briefcase that he was carrying with him on that Autumn day in communist Germany? Degner and Walter’s destinies were shaped by larger-than-life forces-- but through a series of choices of their own making, they shaped their futures, and in the process, altered the history of motorcycle racing forever.

      <title>Past Gas #140: Ford Almost Dies Again</title>
      <description>TODAY ON PAST GAS: The 2008 crash nearly killed Detroit. How did Ford survive not one but two massive financial calamities within a span of five years? Could Ford transition from its history of larger than life, charismatic leaders, to someone with a steadier hand? There’s arguably an alternate reality where Ford-- and its American competitors-- completely folded just over a decade ago. Is a guy you may have never heard of-- Alan Mulally-- the GOAT of resurrecting dying companies?

      <title>Is The Yugo REALLY The Worst Car Ever Made?</title>
      <description>The list of all-time worst cars wouldn’t be complete without the infamous… Yugo. Yes, it was objectively a bad car, but that’s not the whole story. Today on Past Gas, what’s the real story behind what’s perhaps the most notorious car flop of all time? Is this a story about failure.. Or something else entirely? Could there be something redeemable about a 45-horsepower jalopy built in the backwoods of Serbia? Join James, Nolan, and Joe as they go deep on the Yugo.

      <description>We’re shaking things up today and sharing a preview from Car Show!, a new podcast from our friends at Pushkin Industries.

In this preview, Eddie and fellow car enthusiast Malcolm Gladwell share an ode to sport-sedan purity, before automation and excessive trim ruined everything.

      <title>How Stirling Moss’ Sportsmanship Destroyed His Shot At F1 Glory</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas… how did one man break three world speed records, win almost half of his 529 races, and dominate the Nurburgring 1000 three years in a row? How did this household name give away his only shot at winning an F1 Championship Title? Who was this British driver… the king whom racing never crowned? Today on Past Gas, one of the greatest F1 drivers to NOT be the champ… Stirling Moss.

      <title>The Carrera Panamericana Is One Of The Most Dangerous Races Ever</title>

      <title>Jeff Gordon’s Legacy Was Tested By Tragedy...and the Tabloids</title>
      <description>Jeff Gordon’s career thus far was as close to a fairytale as one can get. Before the age of 30 he had won three championships, barely missing out on a fourth, while becoming the face of NASCAR. With the joy of his early success came also the burden of high expectations. Today on Past Gas: Could Jeff Gordon continue to meet sky high expectations and become the greatest driver of all time?

      <title>Jeff Gordon Made NASCAR Mainstream</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas… Jeff Gordon! How did a kid who grew up 20 miles from San Francisco take over a rugged sport which sprung from the illicit moonshine running business in the south? What made Gordon so good at such a young age? How would Jeff navigate the fever of fame? Did his popularity in the media ultimately overshadow his abilities as a race car driver?

      <title>The Man Behind One of F1's Most Legendary Names</title>
      <description>As a mechanic and engineer, Jack Brabham brought ideas to the forefront of automotive construction that would have a lasting effect on the game. And as a race car driver, he brought a wild and unruly Australian flavor to the track - putting Oz on the racing map for decades to come. How did one Aussie from humble beginnings turn into an innovative racer, engineer, a three time Formula One World Champion AND get a suburb named after him? Today on Past Gas, we discuss racing legend Jack Brabham and how he got good at, well… everything.

      <title>Why 1973 Was The Worst Year for Cars</title>
      <description>1973 was undeniably the worst year in nearly a century of American cars. Why were Americans so scared of running out of gas they were brawling at the pumps? How and why did American manufacturers make undeniably inferior cars for over a decade– and how did they dig themselves out of a mess that was largely of their own creation? Today on Past Gas we’re diving into the dark history of the Malaise Era … buckle up, or don’t, we won’t be going that fast.

      <title>F1 Owes Everything to Adrian Newey’s Car Designs</title>
      <description>Even if you don’t know the name Adrian Newey, you know his accomplishments. Considered to be one of the best engineers, designers and technical directors in history, Adrian Newey cars– and the copycats he inspired– dominated racing for over two decades, winning a stunning number of Grands Prix and Championship titles in the process. Six different drivers have won the Drivers’ Championship behind the wheel of his cars– how did Newey’s designs get them there? And how did his designs revolutionize F1 as a whole? Today on Past Gas, F1's greatest designer, and what makes him great.

      <title>Smokey Nagata Sparked A Tuning Revolution</title>
      <description>Smokey Nagata is most famous-- or infamous-- for driving his gold-painted Toyota Supra 200 miles per hour on a UK public highway. It made him perhaps the most famous outlaw in Japanese automotive history. How did Smokey Nagata become one of the world’s top tuners? What’s so secret about his legendary custom cars? And is the nickname ‘Smokey’ as obvious as it seems? Today on Past Gas: the story of Smokey Nagata, Top Secret Co., and the Doubleton run!

      <title>Tucker 48: Stroke of Genius, or Scam?</title>
      <description>The Tucker 48 may be the most innovative, ahead-of-its-time car you’ve never heard of. How did the Tucker Corporation of the 1940s develop one of the most radical designs cars of all time, then fail to get it in the hands of customers? Just what innovations did Tucker pack into his futuristic 48? And how did it all end in an all-out battle with the American government? Today on Past Gas we’re taking a trip in the wayback machine to have a look at what the world could’ve been– if one underdog had succeeded at building the car of his dreams.

      <title>John Force Took Funny Cars to the Extreme</title>
      <description>John Force is the king of Funny Cars… but what ARE funny cars? Why are they called “funny cars,” when the sport itself is deadly serious? How did John Force become the winningest driver in Funny Cars by an insanely huge margin? These deafeningly loud, near-7000 horsepower cars are part of drag racing history, and we sprint through their story… TODAY on Past Gas!

      <title>The Race To Build A 200mph Production Car </title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas, it’s a sprint AND a marathon– inside the decades-long quest to build a production car that could hit two hundred miles per hour. Was it even possible for a land-based vehicle to reach 200mph? And if it was, could it be mass-produced? What companies joined in on the cut-throat race to shatter the 200mph barrier? Who were the madmen that actually made it happen? And did yet another grudge match with Enzo Ferrari lead to another milestone in automotive history? All that and more on a VERY fast episode of the podcast.

      <title>RC Cars Are Crazy Fast Now</title>
      <description>Remote-control or radio-control racing – RC, as it’s known to fans – isn’t a new phenomenon. Since its invention in 1966, there’s arguably no greater thrill for a young car nut than receiving a kickass remote control car as a gift. You may have loved crashing them together as a kid, but how much do you know about remote control cars? Where’d they come from? How fast can they go? Our subject matter is tiny, but this is a BIG episode of Past Gas.

      <title>This Was F1's Most Successful Family</title>
      <description>The Fittipaldis are arguably the most dominant family dynasty in Formula One history. How did Emerson Fittipaldi open the door for a whole slew of Fittipaldis to join the F1 paddock? How did his older brother, Wilson, fare as an F1 driver? And which one of Emerson’s offspring could be the first to follow in his footsteps to become an F1 champion? All that and more on today’s Past Gas - Emerson Fittipaldi and his Racing Dynasty.

      <description>Hi everybody I’m Nolan from Past Gas by Donut Media, we’re an automotive history show. Its kind of like hanging out in the garage with your friends, listening to them tell a story from automotive history! 
Fast cars and big movies are as American as Abraham Lincoln. From the Delorean to the Batmobile, superstar cars and the badasses who drive them have been woven into the fabric of American culture for over a century. What made Steve McQueen a legend in both film and autos? How did he come to love cars even more than movies, and what were his greatest moments, both on-screen and off? All that and more on today’s episode of Past Gas.

      <title>The Bizarre Battle Over... Seatbelts??</title>
      <description>Driving is dangerous! You may think that safety measures would be a popular and easy win for the automobile industry, but it wasn’t always that way. Why would the auto industry collude to prevent important environmental pollution-control devices? Why were Americans so anti-seatbelt that, as one Michigan legislator called it, they fought for their right to fly through a windshield? Today, on Past Gas, the shockingly hard-won safety measures that the auto industry fought against.

      <title>Jeeps Aren’t What They Used To Be</title>

      <title>How Kimi Raikkonen Became F1's Most Memeable Star</title>
      <description>Today, on Past Gas, the epic and long-as-hell career of the Flying Finn, Kimi Raikkonen. Kimi Raikkonen is one of the most beloved Formula One drivers, a celebrated “Iceman” with an open hatred for doing interviews and one of the most meme-able personalities in the paddock. What makes him tick, and why has he stuck it out in Formula One for so long, considering that he’s on record saying that driving is “more like a hobby for me”? Is Kimi F1’s most underrated legend?

      <title>Lee Iacocca Was Detroit's Most Powerful Man</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas-- was Lee Iacocca Detroit’s Most Powerful Man? He led not one, but TWO of Motor City’s biggest companies. Without him, would we even have the Mustang? Or the Jeep? Or the… Chrysler Minivan? And how serious was his feud with the Fords? Iacocca’s rag to riches story is an inspiration to car fans and a lesson on how to succeed in whatever you want to accomplish in life.

      <title>How Hot Wheels Torched Matchbox</title>
      <description>There are many rivals in cars, but few are firier (and tinier) than the battle between Hot Wheels and Matchbox. At one point, the two companies were in all out war for the coveted toy car market. Who were the players? How did Hot Wheels end up being the best-selling toy EVER? Today on Past Gas, we’re laying down some flimsy plastic track to explain exactly how Hot Wheels zipped past Matchbox.

      <title>How Detroit Muscle Flexed on the World</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas: Where did the idea of the muscle car come from, and what even is a muscle car? How did drivers go from tiny flathead V8s to fire snorting 454s in only a few short decades? And who holds the title for the first true muscle car? We’re hitting the gym, doing some auto-body-building, and getting swole for an all muscle edition of the podcast.

      <title>Bond’s Future is Uncertain, But His Past is Aston Martin</title>
      <description>James Bond is an iconic character because of his charm, spy skills, style and… his cars. Bond has driven his share of Subarus and Toyotas. But the ultimate Bond car, the go-to for any British spy worth his salt is the Aston Martin. What started this partnership? How did the Bond franchise affect the business dealings of Aston Martin? And how did Aston Martin affect the Bond Franchise? And why was Roger Moore the only Bond to never drive an Aston Martin? Today on the podcast, we’re taking our martinis shaken, not stirred as we load up on gadgets and embark on a secret mission to learn everything we can about James Bond and his cars. The show is Gas. Past Gas.

      <title>Dodge vs. Ford Was A Toxic Feud </title>
      <description>Hamilton and Burr. Hatfield and McCoy. Biggie and Tupac. The Dodge Brothers and… Henry Ford? There are many great feuds that define American history, but few know about the legal battle between two automotive giants that forever changed the industry. Why did Henry Ford hate the Dodge brothers so much? How did their rivalry reinforce corporate corporatism as we know it? All that and more on today’s Past Gas.

      <title>How These Electric Vehicles Sparked The Tesla </title>
      <description>What kind of bonkers science took Electric Vehicles from quirky novelty to racetrack hero? How did the internal combustion motor not only kill the electric car, but also make it absolutely amazing? What is the true origin of the electric car, and what does it have to do with a modern electric car that recently broke the world record for drifting? Turn on, tune in, and plug in… it’s an are-we-past-using-gas edition of Past Gas… the history of EVs!

      <title>NASCAR’s Eurotrip - ’Merica At Le Mans</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas,we got the story of some good ol’ American boys taking a wild 1970s Eurotrip. How did the 1970s Oil Embargo lead to a couple of Americans bringing big block muscle cars to Le Mans? How did Ferrari rage quitting Le Mans in 1973 lead to NASCAR racing in France? Just how well did the big block bruisers do against the tiny Le Mans cars? We’re bringing oval power to the eiffel tower…it’s the story of NASCAR at Le Mans!

      <title>How Did A 9,000 Mile Road Trip Forge A Revolutionary?</title>
      <description>You’ve probably been on a road trip that changed your life. But have you been on a road trip that changed the WORLD? How about 9,000 Miles on a Norton bike, through the treacherous terrain of South America? Today on Past Gas: how did an epic road trip create the mononymous revolutionary we know simply as “Che”? Leper colonies, love affairs, and dog diarrhea all tell the story of how a boy turned into a freedom-fighting man… and then a t-shirt. You gotta hear it to believe it, babeeeee!

      <title>This Was NASCAR's Greatest Rivalry</title>
      <description>Rivalries are what make racing riveting. Mopar vs. Ford, North Carolina vs. South Carolina, Puralator vs. STP … and today, Richard Petty versus David Perason. Why did they wind up in head to head battles almost every week? How did their rivalry push NASCAR to the limits and save the sport from suffering the same fate as the auto industry during the 70s? All that and more on today’s Past Gas!

      <title>Mazda's Abandoned Luxury Brand</title>
      <description>Have you ever heard of Amati? In the late ’80s, Mazda took a big swing and tried to create a luxury car brand. They were emboldened by the success of the Miata. But somehow, Amati never happened, and almost 400 million dollars were wasted in the process. Today on Past Gas: how did Amati become a ghost badge haunting Mazda’s dreams? Why does Mazda refuse to discuss the failed brand? How did Mazda go from zoom zoom, to doom and gloom?

      <title>The SuperCar’s Incredible Origin Story</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas, the gritty origin story of supercars. Supercars and hypercars are now a permanent fixture in the automotive landscape, but it wasn’t always that way. First, a bunch of renegade designers and engineers actually had to be crazy enough to invent them. How did Ferrari and Lamborghini’s rivalry lead to some of the greatest car designs ever? And how did Americans start competing with Europeans in the supercar arena? It’s the Batman Begins of our supercar story!

      <title>Why the Mid-Engine Corvette Took 60 Years to Make</title>
      <description>Just a couple years ago, the world finally got its first Mid-Engine Corvette. Today on Past Gas, the epic, decades-long story of how we finally reached that point. It’s a story that starts with hiding out from the Nazis in a French brothel, and only gets wilder from there. What were the incredible experimental cars that Chevy scrapped, how did last minute business blunders hold the project back, and who were the geniuses who finally made it possible? It’s a mid-engine LEGEND on today’s podcast.

      <title>Why The ’80s Was SuperCars Craziest Decade</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas-- How did the race to breaking 200mph in a production car set the tone for a decade?

Pack the trunk with coke, blast some Guns N Roses, throw on the Oakleys… I pity the fool who isn’t ready for an all ’80s, all supercar episode of Past Gas.

      <title>F1's Greatest Rivalries: Hamilton vs Alonso</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas, one of the greatest rivalries in modern Formula One-- Lewis Hamilton versus Fernando Alonso. What were the origins of the rivalry, and how did it lead to one of the most awkward peach-eating incidents of all time? How did Lewis, as a rookie, get under the champion’s skin so easily? How did a pit stop threaten to destroy McLaren’s relationship with Alonso? How did the rivalry set the tone for F1 for years to come? The year is 2007, Steve Jobs just announced the iPhone, Shrek the Third is out in theatres, and McLaren had two drivers who hated each other. All the F1 drama you can handle, on today’s podcast.

      <title>How Eminem Helped Save Detroit</title>
      <description>Detroit has always been the beating heart of American car culture. But how did crisis after crisis nearly destroy not only its industry, but the city itself? You’ve probably seen photos of Detroit’s urban ruins and wondered what happened. Today on Past Gas, we’ll give you the whole story, and how the city’s history is inseparable from the history of American cars built by Ford, Chevy, and GM. How did Motown fall? And can it rise again?

      <title>Group B’s Greatest Rivalry: Audi and Lancia</title>
      <description>Group B. The Golden Age of Rally Racing. It’s safe to say that auto racing will never again be this fast, thrilling, and dangerous. The most iconic battle of Group B was in 1983, when the beefy 4WD Audi Quattro faced off against the stylin’ Italian rear-wheel drive Lancia 037. Who prevailed in what many consider to be the greatest rally battle of all time? You gotta listen to today’s Past Gas to find out.

      <title>1994 Was F1’s Most Consequential Year</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas, we’re zooming in on a single year of Formula One-- one that saw the loss of a legend and the birth of a new superstar. We can often point to one year that shapes us-- whether it be through hardship, hard-won victory, or both. For F1, that year was 1994. It’s a gut-wrenching season that changed the sport forever, and today on the podcast we give you the whole story. What were the challenges? Who overcame them? Whether you’re an F1 fan or new to the sport, this episode is a must-listen.

      <title>The Underdogs Who Outraced The Nazis</title>
      <description>Beating Nazis in a racecar sounds like the plot of a ’90s action movie-- but it’s actually straight out of real life. Today on Past Gas, the story of how a band of determined outsiders, led by Lucy Schell, prevailed over Hitler in Formula racing, infuriating the Fuhrer and handing him a defeat even more humiliating than his art school rejection letters (for real). It’s an underdog car story for the ages, and if you like Bugatti, Mercedes, or just hearing about Hitler losing, this episode’s for you.

      <title>THIS GUY won F1, NASCAR, Indy, AND Le Mans?!</title>
      <description>Only three drivers have won in Formula One, Indy Car, NASCAR, and Sports Cars. Dan Gurney was the first. Gurney was like the Forrest Gump of cars in the ‘60s and ‘70s, everywhere at once, racing incredible Carroll Shelby designed cars-- then designing cars of his own that won countless events. He’s a guy James WISHES he could be-- the “coolest dude in cars”-- once nominated by Car and Driver to be the President of the United States. Today on Past Gas-- the legendary OG, Dan Gurney.

      <title>The Stunt Too Crazy For Evel Knievel</title>
      <description>Stunt driving is full of fearless, borderline crazy people. Today on Past Gas, we’re talking about possibly the craziest stunt man of them all. A guy whose stunt was so reckless, even Evel Knievel took a pass. Ken Carter, aka the Mad Canadian, had a dream to jump a mile over a river, in a rocket-powered Lincoln Continental. What would you risk for glory? How dangerous is too dangerous? That and more as the guys explore one of the wildest stories we’ve ever told.

      <title>Are We Actually About to Get Flying Cars?</title>
      <description>Does anything symbolize the promise of the future like flying cars? From Star Wars to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, from The Jetsons to James Bond, flying cars have captured our imagination, but failed to translate into any sort of reality. Will flying cars ever be safe and practical enough to happen? How would they work? Flying cars always seem right around the corner, but can advancements in battery tech and autopilot modes actually get us there? That’s today… or tomorrow… or maybe never… on Past Gas.

      <title>Why Volkswagen is the Gamestop of Cars</title>
      <description>Before Gamestop revolutionized the world of stonks, there was… Volkswagen. Over a decade before Reddit made GME a meme, one of the craziest short squeezes in history involved VW and Porsche. How did VW briefly become the most valuable company in the world? And how did it all go down in flames. On today’s episode of Past Gas, we’re trading in the short shifter for the short squeeze. It’s time to talk Volkswagen-- the GameStop of cars.

It’s time to talk Volkswagen-- the GameStop of cars.</p><p><em>Follow James on IG and Twitter </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamespumphrey/?hl=en"><em>@jamespumphrey</em></a><em>. </em></p><p><em>Follow Nolan on IG and Twitter</em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nolanjsykes/?hl=en"><em> @nolanjsykes</em></a><em>. </em></p><p><em>﻿Follow Joe on IG and Twitter </em><a href="https://cms.megaphone.fm/organizations/655115ea-de0d-11e8-a08f-bf72f7367b9d/podcasts/89c374c4-b3b7-11e9-aae1-9bbb392f644f/episodes/3c9aeac0-cb7a-11ea-9416-6f78df30e5d4/@joegweber"><em>@joegweber</em></a></p><p><em>Follow Donut </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/donutmedia/?hl=en"><em>@donutmedia</em></a><em>, and subscribe to our </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6JmiMXKoXS6bpP1D3bk8g/featured"><em>Youtube</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> channels! </em> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Land Rovers, Cigarettes, and Thicc Jungle- 20 Years of Camel Trophy</title>
      <description>The world renowned Camel Trophy—one of the most brutal adventure driving events, and the ultimate proving grounds for Land Rover’s off-road capability. Crossing jungles and desert, from the Amazon to Borneo, Sumatra to New Guinea, this event was considered to be the “The Olympics of 4x4.”
Drivers flocked to the competition, applicants chosen over a million applicants worldwide. The event was not quite a rally, not quite a race, not quite a series of technical challenges-- it was the ultimate off-road adventure.
What made the Camel Trophy so iconic? How does it tell the story of Land Rover’s evolution as a company? And could it ever stage a comeback? Join Nolan, James, and Joe, as they traverse the history of the infamous Camel Trophy Event. The adventure—starts now!

      <title>How Niki Lauda Emerged From The Flames An F1 Champion</title>
      <description>If you’ve seen the movie Rush, you know the name Niki Lauda. The coldly competitive Austrian F1 driver was most known for his rivalry with British James Hunt, and his horrific crash at the Nurburgring. But who is the man behind the legend? Is he a Terminator, a Rat, or a misunderstood genius who was the first truly technical driver in F1? Today on Past Gas, how a man of steel gave F1 one of its greatest human stories.

      <title>How Lowriders Were A Protest Against White Supremacy</title>
      <description>On January 1, 1959, the government of California tried to kill the lowrider movement. But their efforts backfired-- instead giving rise to a golden age of cars that bounced and tilted like magic. Lowriders became a protest movement on wheels. How did conflicts between lowriders and the cops play out? How are lowriders connected to the history of Chicano culture in the US? And who are the modders and mechanics who made it all happen? On today’s Past Gas, take a little trip with James, Nolan, and Joe, as they dive into the story of lowriders.

      <description>Remember toy fads like pogs and silly bandz? The ’60s version was Snake and Mongoose, two real life drag racers who got immortalized in diecast form by Mattel. Don “The Snake” Prudhomme and Tom “The Mongoose” McEwen were elite drag racers, but they also became pop culture icons as drag racing reached peak popularity. Who won more races? Why were people going so far as to get Snake and Mongoose tattoos? And how did they help put Hot Wheels on the map? All that and more, on today’s Past Gas!

      <title>Bertha Benz: Was This The First Road Trip Ever?</title>
      <description>Back in the 1870s, Bertha Benz was married to a penniless engineer named Karl Benz. What happened to Karl is now part of German automotive legend-- but Bertha had a crazy part to play in the Benz saga. Today on Past Gas, the story of Bertha Benz’s Big Ride, a 65 mile trek on a Benz Patent Motorwagen through the rugged, treacherous terrain of the Rhine Valley. Along the way, Bertha addressed mechanical issues on the fly, even originating a braking innovation that’s still in use today. It’s the story of the OG road trip-- driven by a fearless woman who put Benz on the map.

Along the way, Bertha addressed mechanical issues on the fly, even originating a braking innovation that’s still in use today. It’s the story of the OG road trip-- driven by a fearless woman who put Benz on the map.</p><p><em>Follow James on IG and Twitter </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamespumphrey/?hl=en"><em>@jamespumphrey</em></a><em> </em></p><p><em>Follow Nolan on IG and Twitter</em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nolanjsykes/?hl=en"><em> @nolanjsykes</em></a><em> </em></p><p><em>﻿Follow Joe on IG and Twitter </em><a href="https://cms.megaphone.fm/organizations/655115ea-de0d-11e8-a08f-bf72f7367b9d/podcasts/89c374c4-b3b7-11e9-aae1-9bbb392f644f/episodes/3c9aeac0-cb7a-11ea-9416-6f78df30e5d4/@joegweber"><em>@joegweber</em></a></p><p><em>Follow Donut </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/donutmedia/?hl=en"><em>@donutmedia</em></a><em>, and subscribe to our </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6JmiMXKoXS6bpP1D3bk8g/featured"><em>Youtube</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> channels! </em> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Hitler’s Racing Program</title>
      <description>Just a year before WWII, a 28 year old German driver named Bernd Rosemeyer crashed while driving over 260 miles per hour on a public road, killing him instantly. Just a few years earlier, Rosemeyer had been a humble mechanic, working at his dad’s garage. But now, he was part of a Hitler-funded racing program-- a violent effort to make Nazis the fastest drivers in the world. Today on Past Gas, the dark origins of Mercedes’ and Audi’s racing programs. How did these teams get started? What was their link to the Nazis? And why were some of the drivers not even Germans?

      <title>The Woman Who Led The Bloody Battle Against GM</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas, we tell the story of Genora Johnson, and a fearless group of women, who helped to organize workers and defeat one of the largest companies in the world-- General Motors. GM once ruled the town of Flint with an iron fist, but employees were fed up with perilous conditions and low pay. The workers took to the streets, but protests quickly turned violent. What were the dangers involved? How did the workers get GM to bend? And how did one strike change the course of automotive history? You gotta listen to James, Nolan, and Joe to find out.

      <title>The World's Most Expensive Car Collection Is Rotting Away</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas-- the Sultan of Brunei, owner of the largest, most expensive car collection of all time. For decades, the Sultan had a shadowy but significant influence on the automotive industry, ordering one-of-a-kind supercars ranging from Ferraris to Aston Martins. Why did the Sultan choose to spend his vast fortune on thousands of cars, worth billions of dollars? Forget barn finds… today James, Nolan, and Joe talk PALACE finds… it’s the Sultan of Brunei and his massive hoard of cars.
Valvoline is proven to maximize engine life by 40% with their Advanced Full Synthetic and new Full Synthetic High Mileage oils.

      <title>Pike's Peak: The Complete History of the World's Highest Hill Climb</title>
      <description>Today on Past Gas, James, Nolan and Joe take on the legendary Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Known as The Race To The Clouds, Pikes Peak is the premiere event in the sport of hillclimbing. How did Pikes Peak popularize, then revolutionize, the hillclimb?

      <title>How Japanese Street Racers Created the Best Car Magazine Ever</title>
      <description>A decade before JDM reached the US and Europe, Option Magazine was profiling the Midnight Club and the underground street racing scene of Tokyo. The mag's hands-on approach had a huge influence on car culture and played a big role in popularizing all the Japanese tuners we know and love today. Its pages were filled with cars like the GT-R R33, Mazda RX-7, and Toyota Supra. By the end of the episode we promise you'll love Option as much as we do.

      <title>The Bizarre Scandal that KILLED the Skyline in America</title>
      <description>Today James, Nolan, and Joe are talking about the bizarre scandal that many claim is the reason you can't get the Skyline in America. Motorex was a car import company that was led by Hiroaki Nanahoshi, who was arrested for fraud and held on one million dollars bail, before disappearing for more than ten years. With exclusive interviews from Sean Morris, who was working with Hiro at Motorex before his arrest, we'll attempt to unravel this bizarre mystery.  
Many thanks to Sean Morris! If you're looking for a completely legal import don't go any further than Top Rank International Vehicle Importers  https://www.importavehicle.com/vehicles

      <description>Today we take a close look at a family whose life has been shaped by the legendary Isle of Man TT motorcycle race. The Dunlop family of Northern Ireland is one of the most decorated dynasties in motorcycle racing. Joey, Robert, Willam and Michael Dunlop have a combined 50 overall wins in the event’s 116 year history.

      <title>The Rotary Before Mazda Pt. 1</title>
      <description>Today’s episode is all about the invention of the Wankel Rotary Engine! German inventor Felix Wankel devised “a new type of engine, half turbine, half reciprocating” when he was just 17 years old, but wouldn’t get to see his creation under the hood of a production car for another 45 years. Luckily a lot happened in Felix’s life along the way, including running multiple machine shops in his mother’s backyard, inventing a three wheeled car called “the Devil Beetle”, and getting some help from colleagues who may or may not have been adorable animated forest creatures. Part 1 of 2.

      <title>Worst Weekend in Formula 1 History - Senna Pt.4</title>
      <description>In our series finale on Ayrton Senna, James, Joe, and Nolan relive that fateful moment on May 1, 1994, when Ayrton Senna crashed while driving in the San Marino Grand Prix. Senna’s’ untimely death at Imola was foreshadowed by multiple devastating crashes, and the death of fellow F1 driver, Roland Ratzenberger, who died on the same track just days before Senna. It was, maybe, the worst weekend in Formula 1 history. To this day, Senna continues to be an icon, and his namesake remains as being synonyms with greatness.

      <itunes:summary>In our series finale on Ayrton Senna, James, Joe, and Nolan relive that fateful moment on May 1, 1994, when Ayrton Senna crashed while driving in the San Marino Grand Prix. Senna’s’ untimely death at Imola was foreshadowed by multiple devastating crashes, and the death of fellow F1 driver, Roland Ratzenberger, who died on the same track just days before Senna. It was, maybe, the worst weekend in Formula 1 history. To this day, Senna continues to be an icon, and his namesake remains as being synonyms with greatness.

      <title>Hell’s Angels - Heroes or Villains? Pt 1: The Rise</title>
      <description>Join Nolan, James, and Joe as they try to separate fact from fiction on the most notorious motorcycle club ever, The Hells Angels. To get an accurate picture of the Angels you need to understand how and why motorcycle clubs were founded in the first place. So in this episode we’re going back, way back, all the way to the invention of the first bicycle. From there we’ll follow companies like Indian and Harley Davidson as their bikes become popular amongst war torn soldiers. We’ll also find out how Pancho Villa may have inadvertently helped Harley land their first military contract, and how the small Milwaukee company went from Los Angeles motordrome to the New York Stock Exchange. It’s a crazy story that you won’t want to miss!

      <title>The Cannonball Run Pt. II - From Protest to Pro-Fun! </title>
      <description>In the conclusion of our Cannonball Run series, we explore how the race devolved from a protest against regulation to…less of one. We also examine some of the wackier competitors of the race: a van disguised to look like an ambulance, a group of racers dressed like priests- this one’s kooky folks! We also discuss later attempts at the sea to seas' record, and how people accomplish it today.

      <title>The Cannonball Run Pt. I - How are these guys not in JAIL?</title>
      <description>In this episode, we dive into the history of the “Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash”, a cross-country race from New York City to Los Angeles. This real life event inspired a film of the same name, but as we’ll see, the real thing was a lot more than Burt Reynolds’ mustache. We explore the history of American cross-country racing, including early records, and why the 1971 running was organized as a protest against the government!

      <title>Bruce McLaren Pt. I - New Zealand’s Racing Prodigy</title>
      <description>We all know the McLaren supercars like the Senna, P1, and 720s. But where did the company that built their beauties get their start? We begin our series on Bruce McLaren, one of Motorsport’s most influential figures, with his early life on the small island nation of New Zealand. Bruce had a rough start, as a kid he was confined to a hospital bed for two years. His time in the hospital taught him great academic discipline, a skill which assisted in the meticulous construction of his race cars later on. Join us as we explore Bruce’s early days of racing: from building a hillclimb car with his dad, to his journey to England to compete in Formula 2 racing!

      <title>John Delorean Part II: "This Stuff's Better than Gold"</title>
      <description>We all know John Delorean stood out in the automotive industry, in part because of his flamboyant lifestyle (but mostly because of his sizable chin). So maybe it wasn’t a good idea for Delorean to get into the Cocaine Trafficking Business. Delorean was nabbed carrying a briefcase worth over 6.5 million dollars worth of cocaine, but did the FBI set him up? Or would the British backed DMC finally find success in Ireland. Join Nolan, Joe, and James as we find out in John Delorean: Part II- “This Stuff’s Better than Gold”.

      <title>VW Emissions Scandal a.k.a. "Dieselgate"</title>
      <description>In this one-parter, Nolan, Joe, and James lay out the story of the Volkswagen emissions scandal so far. There were billions of dollars in fines and hundreds of thousands of cars were bought back from customers. From VW’s realization that their cars couldn’t pass US emissions standards and their decision to cheat, to the downfall of the whole charade and the legal consequences, the story is absolutely crazy. Since this is still an ongoing story, we might revisit it in the future as developments continue to unfold.
