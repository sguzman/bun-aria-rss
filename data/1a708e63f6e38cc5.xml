So many of us are searching for that sweet spot between working in the office, at home and everywhere in between.  Hybrid work brings opportunities to seize, but it also brings challenges to tackle. Our host Melanie Green is learning how we can all thrive in hybrid work - for the long haul. You’ll hear compelling stories and advice from leading experts. Produced by Citrix.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Trust is crucial at a hybrid workplace. But it’s often hard to find between colleagues. According to the Citrix Work Balanced report, 8 in 10 employees say it’s important to have an employer they can trust. However, less than half the workforce says they actually trust their bosses. Meanwhile, a growing number of employers are turning to monitoring software to ensure productivity – often unaware or ignorant of the negative impacts of stealthy supervision tactics. (There are, of course, industries such as banking where monitoring workers’ online activity is necessary due to compliance issues.) This can lead to resentment and loss of morale among employees, and ultimately the decision to call it quits.</p><p>In this episode, we hear some anonymized accounts of workers who were told to come into the office because their employers wouldn’t trust them to be actually working from home or were asked to use employee monitoring software to ensure they were actually fulfilling their tasks. Later on, Curtin University research fellow Caroline Knight talks about outdated concepts such as "presentee-ism" that are hard to break, and why managers and employees need to learn how to trust each other and build empathy. Finally, Bhushan Sethi, global leader of People and Organization at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, tells us how the accounting firm has launched a Trust Leadership Institute to help business leaders figure out a new road map to a more inclusive and empathetic workplace.</p><p>Hybrid work is here to stay.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In early March, Teniesha Wright-Jones and Lamont Jones were among the first doctors in Michigan to treat patients for COVID-19. Then, they tested positive for the virus. Because of their roles as pivotal healthcare providers in the midst of a pandemic, the two were forced to nurse themselves back to health while remotely navigating an overhaul in how they provided healthcare. There were some big questions to answer: How could they make sure patient information was safe and secure while working from home? How could all parts of the hospital connect with each other? Most importantly, how could they get the information they needed -- in real time? The answers for those working remotely in healthcare and in so many industries, can be found in the cloud. In this episode, we'll hear from Al Taylor, co-founder of cloudDNA, a UK company that provides a solution for wide-scale networking digital infrastructure.</p><p>Citrix has created a virtual series on remote work filled with research, tools, and best practices to guide, support, and enable the remote workforce.

Now is the time to have a deeper look at what teams and individuals really need to succeed in their jobs, from technology to digital wellness. In the Season 2 premier of Remote Works, host Melanie Green speaks with Aston Martin Red Bull Racing drivers Max Verstappen and Alex Albon about what the pandemic taught them about adapting to working differently.

      <itunes:summary>Auto racing could be seen as the perfect metaphor for the world in which we find ourselves now.  In this second season of Remote Works, we'll look at how people and companies are doing now that we're settling into a new world of work. Some are heading back to an office that looks different post-COVID; others are working remotely for the long term. Now is the time to have a deeper look at what teams and individuals really need to succeed in their jobs, from technology to digital wellness. In the Season 2 premier of Remote Works, host Melanie Green speaks with Aston Martin Red Bull Racing drivers Max Verstappen and Alex Albon about what the pandemic taught them about adapting to working differently. Christian Horner, Aston Martin Red Bull Racing team principal, shares insight into how he kept his team close when half of them were suddenly forced to work remotely.
