			<description><![CDATA[<p>As coaches, we know that our thoughts create our results, right? But in order to coach our clients effectively on their thoughts, we have to understand the CONTEXT from which these thoughts emerged. Someone whose cultural history involves persecution and multigenerational trauma may not resonate with the coaching that “everything will happen as it’s meant to,” just as someone who has learned explicitly and implicitly that their sexuality is wrong or bad won’t respond to coaching that does not take this history into account. In this episode, you will learn how approaching your clients with radical curiosity and learning to spot how their thoughts have been shaped by their cultural context will enable you to coach clients with lived experiences that differ from your own. In this special episode, guest coaches Rachel Hart and Dr. Sonia Wright join Kara Loewentheil for a conversation about why understanding your clients’ context is so important, and how committing to curiosity and nonjudgment will help you navigate your own blind spots as a coach.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get full show notes and more information here: <a href="https://unfuckyourbrain.com/otwb5" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://unfuckyourbrain.com/otwb5</a></span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Many coaches believe that once they become certified, they will be equipped with the tools to coach anyone on anything. It’s a lovely thought, but maybe not so helpful when you’re in your tenth session with a client who just stares at you blankly as you try to explain, for the 50th time, how their thoughts are creating their results and why that’s a great thing. While there are certainly powerful frameworks out there, the coaching principles we learn aren’t one-size-fits-all. One single tool or framework isn’t going to work for everybody, and that’s ok. In this episode, Kara Loewentheil and Simone Seol will discuss how to bring more openness, nuance, and discernment into your coaching, so you can coach clients of different backgrounds and lived experiences effectively.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get full show notes and more information here: <a href="https://unfuckyourbrain.com/otwb4" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://unfuckyourbrain.com/otwb4</a></span></p>]]></description>
