   <media:description>How can we solve physical equations on massively complex geometry?  Computer graphics grappled with a similar question in the 1990s, leading to the widespread adoption of Monte Carlo methods for photorealistic image generation.  This talk explores how Monte Carlo can also be used to solve a broader class of equations appearing in science and engineering, using the so-called &quot;walk on spheres method&quot; and recent extensions developed at Carnegie Mellon University.

The talk was originally given by Keenan Crane at the Oberwolfach Research Institute for Mathematics on August 22, 2022.  It is based primarily on two papers:

   <media:description>Cut a small hole in a donut.  Can you turn it inside-out?  The answer, as shown in this looping video, is &quot;yes!&quot;  Notice how the blue inside becomes the red outside, and back again.  Unlike the classic question of &quot;turning the sphere inside out,&quot; which considers non-physical motions where the sphere may pass through itself, here the (punctured) torus turns inside-out without any self-contact.  In other words, you could really perform this motion if you had a donut made out of a stretchy rubber sheet.  Mathematically speaking, this motion is an &quot;isotopy&quot;: a continuous transition between states with no self-intersections (whereas the classic sphere eversion is a &quot;regular homotopy&quot;: a continuous transition that can have self intersections, but no pinching or creasing).

The motion of the torus was computed using the algorithms developed in the paper

Chris Yu, Caleb Brakensiek, Henrik Schumacher, Keenan Crane
&quot;Repulsive Curves&quot; (2021)

For more information, see http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/RepulsiveSurfaces/index.html

To compute a sphere eversion, one typically starts with a &quot;mid-surface,&quot; i.e., a symmetric surface that exhibits no preferred orientation, applies a tiny perturbation (to break symmetry) and minimizes an energy that encourages smoothness to flow to the round sphere.  To get the full &quot;movie&quot;, this motion is then reversed in time, the colors are flipped, and the two movies are concatenated together.  The punctured torus eversion was computed in the opposite way: starting with a torus, we make a small hole and then minimize an energy that encourages every point on the surface to repel every other point.  To keep the surface from simply growing to infinity, we also constrain the surface area and penalize large increases in boundary length and curvature.  This &quot;repulsive energy&quot; pushes the surface into the symmetric configuration seen at the halfway point between the red and blue torus.  As with the sphere eversion, two movies are then concatenated to get the full motion.</media:description>

   <media:description>Suppose you have a pair of handcuffs locked to a post.  Can you remove one of the cuffs without unlocking them, breaking them, or letting them pass through themselves?  With real handcuffs, definitely not!  But for handcuffs made out of stretchy rubber, it turns out to be possible—as shown in this short looping video.

This motion provides a surprising example of what is known in mathematics as an &quot;ambient isotopy&quot; of two surfaces: a continuous motion where the surface is not ripped, cut, pinched, or allowed to pass through itself.  A more traditional example, perhaps, is the &quot;unknot problem&quot;: given a loop of string, can it be untangled into a circle without cutting?  Even this simple question turns out to be very difficult to answer in general.  And questions about isotopy get even more interesting—and harder to predict!—when you start thinking about surfaces rather than curves.

The motion in this video was computed in a particularly remarkable way: it was not keyframed or manipulated by a human animator, but computed automatically by a program that does not do any high-level reasoning.   Instead, it minimizes a simple geometric energy that knows only about the shape of the surface at the current moment in time.  Just like gravity makes a ball fall to the ground, this so-called tangent-point energy makes the surface &quot;fall&quot; into the configuration that gets furthest away from the pole, while preserving its initial surface area—and avoiding any self-intersections.

The algorithm used to compute the motion is described in the paper

   <media:description>For millennia human beings have been drawn to the question: what's the nicest possible shape I can make?  &quot;Nicest&quot; could mean the most symmetric—for instance, the ancient Greeks discovered there were five so-called Platonic solids where every face and every vertex looks the same (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron).  Or, &quot;nicest&quot; could mean smoothest.  For instance, the smoothest shape with no holes or handles is a round sphere; the smoothest shape with a single hole is (by some definitions) a perfectly round donut, also known as a torus of revolution.

What's the nicest way to draw a shape with many holes?  As shown in this video, the smoothest possible shapes often want to have a high degree of symmetry—just like the Platonic solids.  In each case we start with an initial guess of several donuts glued together along a straight line.  If we make this surface smoother and smoother and smoother, we end up with nice smooth shapes that look like the tetrahedron, the cube, and the icosahedron.

More precisely, these surfaces are (conjectured!) minimizers of something called the tangent-point energy.  This energy tries to keep all pairs of points on the surface far away from each other—just like two electrons pushing away from one another.  At the same time, the area of the surface must remain the same, so that it doesn't just blow up to infinity.

These motions were computed using the algorithm described in

   <media:description>In visual computing, point locations are often optimized using a &quot;repulsive&quot; energy, to obtain a nice uniform distribution for tasks ranging from image stippling to mesh generation to fluid simulation.  But how do you perform this same kind of repulsive optimization on curves and surfaces?  This talk takes a deep dive into the mathematical and computational challenges of repulsive shape optimization, with applications in computer graphics, mathematical visualization, and 3D geometry processing.

&quot;Discrete Conformal Equivalence of Polyhedral Surfaces&quot;
(ACM Transactions on Graphics 2021)
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/CEPS/index.html

A standard way to show a bunch of results in a geometry processing paper is to pack rendered 2D images into a single image using Qingnan Zhou's &quot;Mosaic Generator&quot;: https://github.com/qnzhou/Mosaic

We put a twist on this idea by arranging our models in 3D space so that they nicely pack into a 2D image when projected onto the camera plane.  The video shows what happens when you move the camera from the &quot;perfect location&quot;!</media:description>

   <media:description>This video is the second in a series of two lectures given by Keenan Crane at the Harvard FRG Workshop on Geometric Methods for Analyzing Discrete Shapes: https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/frg-2021/

Day I: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w99UcsgkUgE

Abstract: The intrinsic viewpoint was a hallmark of 19th century geometry, enabling one to reason about shapes without needing to consider an embedding in space---and leading to major developments in the 20th century such as Einstein's theory of general relativity.  Yet 21st century digital geometry processing still largely adopts an extrinsic mindset, where the geometry of a polyhedral surface is expressed via vertex positions in n-dimensional space.  This talk explores how the intrinsic view of polyhedral surfaces helps relax some standard assumptions in geometric computing, leading to algorithms that are more flexible and numerically more robust.  In particular we will examine fundamental data structures for intrinsic triangulations, extensions of important triangulation algorithms to curved surfaces, as well as methods for finite element problems, finding geodesics, and computing discrete conformal maps.</media:description>
