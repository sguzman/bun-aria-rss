      <itunes:summary>Seth takes a closer look at the Trump White House as they peddle conspiracy theories, attack immigrants and defend an aide accused of domestic violence.

John Mulaney describes why the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony is like a wedding - if every speech was given by the bride's ex-boyfriend - and what it's like to see Frank Sinatra in concert.

John then speaks to Late Night producer Kevin Miller backstage at Studio 8G for a few more questions backstage.

Next, Seth speaks to Congressman Seth Moulton about the popular Iraqi TV show he hosted during his time in the Marine Corps and why more veterans like him should challenge establishment politics by taking on incumbents.

Rep. Moulton then speaks to Late Night producer Henry Melcher backstage at Studio 8G.

      <title>Republicans Can't Defend Their Health Care Bill | Billie Jean King</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Seth takes a closer look at Republicans, who are once again making a mad dash to rush through an Obamacare repeal bill without being able to defend or explain what it does.
Then, tennis legend Billie Jean King tells Seth about the time she met then-President Obama, who admitted watching her Battle of the Sexes tennis match on TV was life changing for him as a father of two girls.
Late Night producer Henry Melcher then asks King about her experience as the inspiration for an Elton John song and more.

      <title>Senate GOP Tries to Rush Trumpcare: A Closer Look | Really!?! with Seth &amp; Amy | Kumail Nanjiani</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Seth takes a closer look at the health care bill draft Senate Republicans finally unveiled after weeks of secret, closed-door meetings.
Then, Seth and Amy Poehler revive a signature segment from their time as Weekend Update co-anchors, Really!?! with Seth & Amy. This time around, they address the conservative outrage surrounding a New York production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar that comments on modern-day American politics.
Then, Seth interviews actor and comedian Kumail Nanjiani, who shares some of the harsh, and occasionally racist, personal comments people said about his movie The Big Sick, which is the real-life love story of him and his wife.
Afterwards, Kumail talks about his stand-up roots to Late Night producer Henry Melcher as a podcast bonus.

      <title>Bonus Episode: Looking Back At The Insanity Of May 2017</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA["Late Night with Seth Meyers" is on hiatus this week, but after we wrapped last week, segment producer Henry Melcher and A Closer Look writer Sal Gentile sat down and looked back at the news cycle that lasted throughout May 2017.
From the Yates testimony to the firing of James Comey to the FBI's recent focus on Jared Kushner, the pace of news last month was breakneck and often bled into the "Late Night" production schedule. Henry and Sal discuss how their jobs have been affected, and how the nonstop barrage is affecting citizens' understanding of their political leaders.

Then, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) chats with Seth about the importance of bipartisan efforts and her votes on Trump's cabinet nominees, as well as her shift in stance on gun rights and the Women's March. Late Night producer Henry then goes backstage with the senator to ask her about her long political relationship with Hillary Clinton. (10:59 - 26:37).
Finally, earlier this week Seth did a special bonus segment with Jordan Peele on Facebook Live. We've included the audio of that conversation here. Seth and Jordan talk about their early comedy careers in Amsterdam in a loose, free-flowing conversation never seen on TV. (26:49 - 40:24).

      <title>A Closer Look: Trump Lashes Out Over Travel Ban / Interviews: Anderson Cooper &amp; Tracee Ellis Ross</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[On today's episode of the Late Night Podcast, Seth takes a closer look at the Trump Administration's attempts to make up fake tragedies and openly blame the court system for future terror attacks.
Then, Anderson Cooper talks to Seth about the random (and often X-rated) things he's learned while on a press tour with his famous mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, for their memoir The Rainbow Comes and Goes. He also discusses covering the White House administration under Trump's press scrutiny and whether POTUS owns a bathrobe.
Finally, Black-ish star Tracee Ellis Ross reveals why her first Golden Globe win at age 44 connects her to famous mom Diana and her first-meeting fail with Moonlight's Trevante Rhodes. She goes on to explain why it's important that her series Black-ish let viewers draw their own conclusions instead of telling people what to think or believe.

Then, Seth interviews award-winning journalist Katie Couric about press freedom under Donald Trump, as well as her new documentary, "Gender Revolution." We also go backstage with Katie to hear some more about her documentary.
Finally, Seth talks to author Matt Taibbi about his new book "Insane Clown President: Dispatches from the 2016 Circus."
