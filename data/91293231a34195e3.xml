      <itunes:summary>The Marxification of Education Workshop, Session 3 

The word of the year in education and regarding our children has been &quot;groomer,&quot; which is widely banned across social media now as a result (along with James Lindsay from Twitter for calling this problem out). In the Marxification of education, which is its remaking into a system of Marxist conscientization, schools can be said to have been transformed into groomer schools. Specifically, while the terms &quot;thought reform&quot; and &quot;brainwashing&quot; have been used in the past to describe this process, the term &quot;grooming&quot; is even more applicable given the nature of the process of conscientization, including its specific subject matter. It's a tremendous problem that demands understanding and a solution. Here, New Discourses Founder James Lindsay summarizes what he means by the term &quot;Groomer Schools&quot; in this third of four presentations on the Marxification of Education delivered in late July 2022 in Arlington, Virginia, on location in the now-famous Loudoun County, ground zero for the fight for America's schools. 

As a result of the research that produced this lecture series, Lindsay has written a detailed and accessible book on the issue titled The Marxification of Education, which is available for preorder now: https://amzn.to/3RYZ0tY

      <itunes:summary>New Discourses Bullets, Ep. 25 

With the possible exception of our would-be overlords, we all know Nazis were bad. Fewer of us, especially in the younger generations, understand that Communists are also bad. Do you understand these two movements and how they're actually both bad because they're actually both part of the same current of thought? That current of thought is progressivism, especially of the collectivist-socialist kind, which is more broadly an actionable manifestation of the Romantic counter-Enlightenment movement. While different in important ways, what these two evil movements share in common is profound. Join host James Lindsay in this longer episode of New Discourses Bullets to see them both, as well as our present circumstances, more clearly.

      <itunes:summary>The Marxification of Education Workshop, Session 2 

How on Earth did education get so messed up and stolen from our society and our kids? While the critical turn in education enabled this &quot;transformation&quot; of our education system, the crucial piece that allowed it to happen is the work of a Brazilian Marxist by the name of Paulo Freire. Paulo Freire completely transformed education, not least by Marxifying it. That is, in addition to creating the conditions to swap out actual education for political education, Freire structured his understanding of education and knowledge itself as a Marxist Theory of knowing and being educated. Treating these as a special kind of bourgeois private property, Freire paved the way to abolish education entirely and to reimagine it as a system of brainwashing learners into critical Marxist consciousness. Here, New Discourses Founder James Lindsay summarizes this transformation of education itself in this second of four presentations on the Marxification of Education delivered in late July 2022 in Arlington, Virginia, on location in the now-famous Loudoun County, ground zero for the fight for America's schools. 

As a result of the research that produced this lecture series, and this lecture in particular, Lindsay has written a detailed and accessible book expanding on these themes considerably, titled The Marxification of Education, which is available for preorder now: https://amzn.to/3RYZ0tY

Trauma and harm. Trauma and harm. Harm and trauma. It seems virtually everything Woke these days is justified on the back of some obviously nonsense appeal to &quot;trauma&quot; or &quot;harm.&quot; Schools are arranged as being &quot;safe and welcoming&quot; and &quot;places where everyone feels like they belong&quot; in response to the pervasive &quot;trauma&quot; and &quot;harm&quot; of everything else in society. What's going on? In Woke Marxism, like everything else, trauma and harm are understood systemically. They're the result of oppression, which is the result of systemic power, which is the result of the structural stratification of society, which is how Marxists read everything in the world. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay breaks down how &quot;systemic trauma and harm&quot; are nothing more than the same old Marxist religious impulse (to undo the Marxist Fall of Man) and latest excuse for seizing power over everything.

Education has been stolen from us and from our children. Yes, stolen. It was deliberately transformed from within into something that is barely education at all anymore. Instead, it's a systematic program of thought reform (brainwashing) into neo-Marxist belief and activism. How has this been accomplished? The formal name for the transformation is &quot;the critical turn in education,&quot; which &quot;turned&quot; education from traditional models of pedagogy to &quot;Critical Pedagogy,&quot; the application and teaching of Critical Theory to and through the education system. Its purpose: to overcome what Marxists refer to as &quot;the problem of reproduction,&quot; by which stable societies reproduce themselves from one generation to the next, especially through institutions involving children like religion, family, media, and especially education. Here, New Discourses Founder James Lindsay summarizes this &quot;turn&quot; in this first of four presentations on the Marxification of Education delivered in late July 2022 in Arlington, Virginia, on location in the now-famous Loudoun County, ground zero for the fight for America's schools.

We have devoted a lot of time on the New Discourses Podcast to breaking down the work of the Brazilian Marxist &quot;educator&quot; Paulo Freire, who proved to be a pivotal figure in the history of Marxism in several ways at once. This work needs to continue, so it will continue. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, host James Lindsay offers a summary of what it means to be &quot;Freirean&quot; in education, following from his detailed explanation on the Social Justice Encyclopedia, Translations from the Wokish (https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-freirean/). Join him to understand what it means to be Freirean in even greater clarity and detail.

You have probably heard the quip: &quot;data is the new oil.&quot; What does that mean, and what does it imply? In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay walks you through the concept, making it clear that data, like oil and gold before it, are not just extremely valuable commodities but can also serve as the basis for the next iteration of our currency. This has profound implications for life in the coming digital era if we don't get ahead of it now by passing robust data privacy, ownership, and protection legislation. This is truly an issue of global importance!

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 96 

We all know academia is in trouble. In fact, we're not even sure it can be saved. To put it simply, the university is dying. To be sure, it's a strange death, however, because the university is in some sense going back to its roots, returning to being theological seminaries, though in a completely new religion. That religion is the transformative religion of Dialectical Leftism, and its materialist watchword in the 21st century is &quot;Sustainability.&quot; In this New Discourses Podcast series, host James Lindsay takes the listener through a 2022 UNESCO book, Knowledge-driven Actions: Transforming Higher Education for Global Sustainability (https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380519/), that calls upon all &quot;higher education institutions&quot; to transform themselves so that they align, promote, and help complete the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals as a part of the 2030 Agenda. 

In this episode of the series, host James Lindsay takes the listener through the first chapter, the introduction, to this manipulative UNESCO document. Sustainability is made out clearly to be a cult-religious concept, a new theological object to bind and orient the university so that the Neo-Communist agenda can be accomplished through it. Sustainability will come to guide how institutions think, operate, research, and teach, and they will serve as beacons for this new faith to the communities around them. Sustainability is to become our &quot;New Sensibility,&quot; just like Herbert Marcuse called for in the second chapter of his 1969 Essay on Liberation (https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/marcuse/works/1969/essay-liberation.htm/). Sustainability as the tyranny of the 21st century (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/10/sustainability-tyranny-21st-century/) is to become the mode and model for all institutions of higher education, including colleges, universities, seminaries, and more. Join James to hear about how the universities are to be transformed into the cathedrals of this new backwards cult religion.

      <itunes:summary>New Discourses Bullets, Ep. 22 

We've all heard it and done everything we can to avoid rolling our eyes now. &quot;It's my lived experience!&quot; as though that's evidence or, actually, even better than evidence. &quot;Lived experience&quot; is a particular result of Leftist dialectical thought, however, that allows them to convince people that whatever they say is right and whatever anyone else says is dumb or bad. It is, in fact, the dialectical synthesis of evidence and the Leftist phenomenological interpretation of the circumstances in which that evidence presents. It's even better than evidence, then, because while evidence is objective, &quot;lived experience&quot; is both objective and subjective at the same time, with the subjectivity coming from a place of higher consciousness. Join host James Lindsay for this episode of New Discourses Bullets in which he breaks it down.

In this first episode of the series, Lindsay goes through the preliminary materials, including a foreword that explicitly grounds the entire purpose of the document in the work of the Critical Marxist Herbert Marcuse. &quot;Transformation is the red thread running through all the Sustainable Development Goals,&quot; we're told in the first sentence of the foreword. The goal in this executive summary is clear. The university must be transformed. It must be made into a think tank that services the UN 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals meant to achieve it. All institutions of higher education, colleges, universities, seminaries, and beyond, must be bound and oriented in this one particular Neo-Communist direction. They must abandon their missions and take up the core value of sustainability, on the UN's agenda-driven terms. They must install &quot;sustainability officers&quot; and refuse to engage in any activity that supports &quot;non-sustainable&quot; practices. Join James and be shocked at what the United Nations thinks it can coerce the world's colleges into doing.

Leftist thought for at least the past 250 years has taken a particular form that is not the usual form of thinking and understanding we know and love. It's something completely different. The Left, perhaps since Rousseau and definitely since Hegel, has been dialectical in its thinking. It is the Dialectical Left. What is the dialectic, though? What is dialectical thinking? In short, it's the fusion of opposites in a way that understands them from a higher-level perspective, which is necessarily synthetic. In this slightly longer episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay explains the dialectic and dialectical thought in some detail with a considerable number of examples to help you understand this synthetic approach to thought and why it's always going to be a catastrophe in the making.

Paulo Freire is a Brazilian Marxist who is responsible for &quot;Marxifying&quot; education (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/05/paulo-freires-marxification-of-education/), thereby ruining it. In effect, what he did was created a Marxist Theory of being educated (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/05/paulo-freires-schools-new-discourses-bullets-ep-7/), and what this did, in turn, was create a Marxist Theory of knowledge and knowing. Who gets to be considered a knower? On what grounds? To whose benefit? Who decides? All of these questions are to be answered on (Critical) Marxist grounds. One result of this transition, in addition to his approach to education (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/08/paulo-freire-and-the-critical-theft-of-education/), is that he opened the door to a true Marxism of stupidity. You see, as a result of Freire's arguments, &quot;excluded knowledges&quot; have to be included, which includes the stupid. Speaking of how anti-intellectual and stupid this allowed Marxism to be, it allows for any idiot with a &quot;Critical&quot; disposition to create a Marxist Theory of anything by asking and answering the sorts of questions listed above about the knowledge base of anything they want. Thus, we end up with Marxist analyses of every academic subject, every facet of society, every hobby, every everything, in an interminable cascade of irritating stupidity we refer to as &quot;being Woke.&quot; In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, host James Lindsay explains the phenomenon through a number of examples that make it absolutely clear how cheap and stupid &quot;Marxist&quot; analysis has become as a result of going &quot;Woke.&quot;

There are certain advantages to understanding not just how the Dialectical Left (including Marxists and Wokeness) think but how their thought evolves over time. Theirs is a wholly Leftist religion that operates through a completely dialectical faith. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay spends a few minutes unpacking the dialectic and how it works. He then uses this information to trace the development of Leftist thought over the last 260 years and offers a cogent explanation for how it will develop over the next thirty, progressing through Woke Marxism into Sustainable Capitalism and pushing onward into &quot;global citizenship&quot; and a basis for a global administrative state.

Redefine the words; redefine the society. That's the basic idea of &quot;critique&quot; and the way so much of Marxist activism proceeds. Recently, James Lindsay explained this phenomenon in an essay (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/09/three-terms-communists-redefined-to-subvert-society/) on New Discourses with relation to three key terms that allow a subversion of society: &quot;inclusion,&quot; &quot;democracy,&quot; and, most concerningly, &quot;citizenship.&quot; In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, host James Lindsay reads through and elaborates on his own essay on this topic.

      <itunes:summary>New Discourses Bullets, Ep. 19 

Apparently a lot of young people believe not only in something nonsensical but also specifically in socialism. I recently heard an example of a young woman talking about how all the necessities of life both &quot;should be free&quot; and &quot;should be paid for by the government.&quot; Obviously, if they're paid for, they're not free, but she means that they're free for her and paid for by everyone, thus partly her, through the intermediary of the State. This is a terrible idea. To better understand why, it's best to understand a basic fact of economic decision-making, which are the differences between first-, second-, and third-person purchasing decisions and why government purchasing, which is always third-person, is always least likely to do well by the cost/quality tradeoff.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 92 

We have to talk about Social-Emotional Learning (SEL). It's not the first time it's been addressed here on the New Discourses Podcast, but the full picture hasn't been painted for you yet. Social-Emotional Learning is evil and must be stopped. It isn't a nice little program to help at-risk kids deal with the difficulties of learning. It's the central pillar of a nefarious attempt to remake and control society. Host James Lindsay walks you through a number of sources promoting and describing Social-Emotional Learning in unprecedented depth, breadth, and clarity in this long but crucial episode of the podcast. Join him to understand why Social-Emotional Learning and the mechanisms that enable it must be removed from our schools as soon as possible and the people who have implemented it need to be investigated and held accountable.

What is a woman? That's the question of the year, it seems, and we're all aghast. The thing is, almost nobody understands what that particularly nasty bit of confusion is about. Luckily, the most high-profile case of the problem, which occurred in the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Kentanji Brown Jackson, gave us the answer. She said she didn't know what a woman is (while being a woman) because she's not a biologist. In other words, to know what a woman is, you have to ask a qualified expert. It doesn't matter what the definition is because the whole thing is a power grab making use of Queer Theory (better called Queer Marxism) to steal power from deliberately constructed confusion. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay breaks it down for you like no one else can. Join him and hear!

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 91 

The churches are under attack, not just from without but also from within. Marxist subversion has been brought deeply into them, and they are already falling. The model for how this is being accomplished mirrors the model used to steal education, so it's little surprise that the Brazilian Marxist educator Paulo Freire is at the bottom of it. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, host James Lindsay picks up out of the Critical Education Series (https://newdiscourses.com/tag/critical-education-theory/) in which he has been reading most of Freire's landmark 1985 book, The Politics of Education: Culture, Power, and Liberation (https://amzn.to/3IJ4ZOT). Here, he presents the last two thirds of the tenth chapter of that book, which is dedicated not to education at all but to seeing churches as educational platforms that can be utilized in the same way as schools to raise Marxist consciousness. The model is simple: capture the colleges of education and seminaries and you get the teachers and the pastors, and once you have them you get the students and the laity. Join James to understand the goal of transforming the Christian churches in theory, practice, and agenda in this gripping podcast that exposes the roots and implementation of a devastating Marxist rot in mainline Christianity and thus the chief heresy of the twenty-first century.

Woke Marxists talk endlessly about the need to &quot;destigmatize&quot; this, &quot;normalize&quot; that, &quot;affirm&quot; this other thing, and &quot;celebrate&quot; whatever they say is best. They want you to think that these things are all the same, though, and any one who doesn't take the slider all the way from &quot;destigmatize&quot; to &quot;celebrate&quot; on any of their causes célèbre is somehow a conservative (or a bigot or a &quot;Nazi&quot;). In fact, these gradations are necessary to a healthy society, and their boundaries must be understood and maintained. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay breaks down the relevant categories and gives concrete examples of things that belong and do not belong in each. His goal is to add clarity to all discussions made muddy, murky, and ultimately dangerous by Woke Marxist activism that benefits from blurring the lines and making those slopes slippery.

Critical Education Theory Series, Part 20 

This episode of the New Discourses Podcast continues a long miniseries exploring Paulo Freire’s landmark 1985 book The Politics of Education: Culture, Power, and Liberation (https://amzn.to/3IJ4ZOT), and it is embedded in the broader Critical Education Theory series (https://newdiscourses.com/tag/critical-education-theory/). In the previous part, James Lindsay presented the ideas in the ninth chapter of that book, where Freire outlines that the purpose of education is to humanize Man and the world, exactly as indicated by Karl Marx. The previous parts of this series, covering the earlier chapters of the book can be found here:
Part 1: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/
Part 2: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freire-educating-to-proclaim-the-world/
Part 3: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/social-work-education/

Part 7: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/08/paulo-freire-and-the-critical-theft-of-education/

In this episode, the last in the formal educational series covering this book, James takes up the first part of the very weird tenth chapter of The Politics of Education, wherein Freire discusses Liberation Theology and the Role of the Church as a parallel educational institution. In this first part of this shocking chapter, before turning to the role he envisions for churches, Freire explains the religious conversion educators must go through in order to be &quot;true&quot; educators. He describes it as a process of spiritual death and rebirth, literally an Easter educators and religious leaders must go through to be resurrected on the side of the oppressed. This is the religious heart of the so-called &quot;pedagogy of the oppressed&quot; at the center of Freire's entire project and legacy. Join James to understand how Freire enabled the theft of education so that it could be transformed into religious education for the Theology of Marxism (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/01/theology-marxism/).

Thanks to Drag Queen Story Hour, groomer schools, and all other things sex, gender, and sexuality pushed by today's out-of-control Woke Marxist Left, Queer Theory has been pushed front and center in the public consciousness, but what is it? Simply put, Queer Theory is Queer Marxism, which is a Marxist Theory about a form of sociocultural &quot;property&quot; called &quot;normalcy,&quot; &quot;normality,&quot; or &quot;normativity,&quot; that it believes to have been unjustly created and in need of destruction and total abolition. As such, it's incredibly dangerous and destructive, particularly on the formative and impressionable psychologies of children, whom it targets in particular, often directly through our schools and children's entertainment programming. On this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay breaks down what Queer Theory is, partly in its own foundational words, and illustrates succinctly why it is a form of Queer Marxism that must be stopped. Join him to learn about this important and timely topic!

In the previous part (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/07/paulo-freire-and-learning-to-remake-man/), James Lindsay presented the ideas in the eighth chapter of that book, in which Freire describes &quot;The Process of Political Literacy&quot; and outlines a sweeping program for education as a means to remake Man himself. The previous parts of this series, covering the earlier chapters of the book can be found here:
Part 1: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/
Part 2: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freire-educating-to-proclaim-the-world/
Part 3: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/social-work-education/
Part 4: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/05/paulo-freire-birth-of-groomer-schools/

Part 6: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/07/paulo-freire-and-learning-to-remake-man/

In this episode, James takes up the ninth chapter of The Politics of Education, wherein Freire describes what he calls “Humanistic Education,” as that term is meant by Karl Marx Building on the themes of the previous two chapters (education for conscientization [https://newdiscourses.com/2022/07/paulo-freires-perpetual-cultural-revolution/] and education as a process of political literacy [https://newdiscourses.com/2022/07/paulo-freire-and-learning-to-remake-man/]), this chapter clarifies how Paulo Freire enabled the theft of education from all potential learners for the purposes of Marxism. It's an incredible crime against humanity. Join him to understand how Freire enabled the theft of education from our society and our children.

      <itunes:summary>New Discourses Bullets, Ep. 15 

Most people do not understand what a gulag is. They think of the Nazi concentration camps and therefore miss the point. Gulags, utilized directly and by that term in the Soviet Union under Lenin and then Stalin and without the term in Maoist Communist China, are re-education camps, not merely labor camps or concentration camps. That is, they have an ideological goal, and that goal is to brainwash people into becoming Communists. They're also mid-20th century technology, so they're not likely to be utilized extensively in their classical prison-camp form in 21st century totalitarian regimes, as we can already see in CCP-controlled China. The tyranny and brainwashing of today will be through digital gulags, which amount to using digital devices and technology to control and contour behavior, including through social-credit programs, while re-educating people into the Neo-Communist ideology behind these totalitarian agendas, primarily ESG-driven &quot;sustainability.&quot; In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay explains not only what digital gulags might look like but how they're already being built, primarily using our children as guinea pigs under the &quot;educational&quot; brand name of systemic Transformative Social-Emotional Learning (SEL). Join him to learn about this crucially dangerous problem so we can take steps to stop it before it goes too far.

Critical Education Theory Series, Part 18 

Critical Pedagogy in our public schools unambiguously violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The reason is simple. As Critical Pedagogues themselves say, it has ambitions that can only be framed in religious terms, describes a fundamental concept of man and the world, and gives rise to duties of conscience. According to well-established First Amendment law (https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol74/iss3/4/) in the United States, that violates the Establishment Clause. The argument is simple. The conception of man and the world it forwards is not the self-evident base of liberal society, which is by definition secular in this way; it is otherwise. It is the Hegelian-Marxist conception of a world that is transformed into its intended utopian state (literally, &quot;the Kingdom of God on Earth&quot;) by the morally obligated and willful activity of man undertaken with a specific belief, intention, and set of practices. It is a world that demands to be transformed into its ideal state by specific means in accordance with specific beliefs about its organization and operation with &quot;conscientized&quot; man as its intentional transformer. Join host James Lindsay for this episode of the New Discourses Podcast where he makes the argument, neat as neat.

Queer Theory has no bottom. No matter how bad you think it is, it's worse. No matter how bad you think it is now, it will get worse later. In that spirit, we at the New Discourses Podcast present to you yet another &quot;academic&quot; paper rooted in Queer Theory: &quot;Cripping Incest Discourse(s)&quot; (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-021-09856-3). You probably didn't think it was an act of latent genocide to be against incestuous sexual relationships, but according to &quot;Crip Theory,&quot; which is the fusion of Queer Theory and Critical Disability Studies, you'd be wrong. You see, incest produces disabled and deformed offspring at a higher than otherwise rate, so you being against incest means you're supporting the idea that there should be fewer disabled people in the world, which is &quot;latent eugenics.&quot; Join host James Lindsay as he takes you through this stunning piece of academic work. You won't believe your ears.

Critical Education Theory Series, Part 17 

Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) is a key battleground topic in education today. Parents across the country are rightly very upset that what sounds like and could be a very useful program for kids who struggle in certain ways at school has far less wholesome purposes. On the one hand, they're noticing that SEL tends to be misapplied in classrooms and through other subjects, not in controlled therapeutic settings with kids who have been identified to need it. On the other hand, they've noticed far more nefarious uses like data mining of children and a diversion of educational resources into overtly grooming and Marxist programs they don't support or want for their kids. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, host James Lindsay goes through a paper on Social-Emotional Learning in the context of the pandemic to reveal that there's an intentional bait-and-switch being sold to school districts (unless they realize what they're doing, which is unconscionable). What sounds good in SEL is being sold to promote &quot;Transformative SEL&quot; (CASEL model) or, in this paper, &quot;Social-Emotional Learning for Social-Emotional Justice (SEL-SEJ),&quot; which is just a different description of essentially the same thing. What's obvious here is how flimsy SEL programs of this type are and also how overwhelmingly Marxist in the Paulo Freirean mold Lindsay is exposing in tremendous depth here on the New Discourses Podcast. Join him to learn about how SEL is definitely not what it might seem to be.

In the previous part, James Lindsay presented the ideas in the seventh chapter of that book, where Freire makes clear that education is really meant to be about conscientization, which is to say becoming Marxist. The previous parts of this series, covering the earlier chapters of the book can be found here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/), here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freire-educating-to-proclaim-the-world/), here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/social-work-education/), here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/05/paulo-freire-birth-of-groomer-schools/), and here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/07/paulo-freires-perpetual-cultural-revolution/).

In this episode, James takes up the eighth chapter of The Politics of Education, wherein Freire describes what he calls &quot;The Process of Political Literacy.&quot; That is, in this chapter, Freire explains explicitly that political literacy, which is called cultural competence or racial literacy today, should replace the usual, actual literacy in education. Join him to understand how Freire didn’t just Marxify education but made the entire Marxist project of transforming society and man the centerpiece of his educational project.

      <itunes:summary>One does not merely arrive at a Marxist consciousness. In fact, conscientization is a process of awakening a Marxist consciousness, and it is a deliberate practice of cult grooming. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay walks you through the eight stages of Marxist conscientization, as he has understood them from Cultural and Critical Marxists in the 20th century. Join him to learn about the Marxist grievance cult initiation in a clear step-by-step way.

Klaus Schwab is the Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, which openly seeks to remake the world and its economies into a &quot;stakeholder&quot; model of his own creation. In his 2022 book, 'The Great Narrative for a Better Future' (https://amzn.to/3QvkcrU), Schwab explains that the existing &quot;shareholder&quot;-based social contract has expired, and it's time for a new one. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay walks you through a few paragraphs of The Great Narrative in which Schwab details what a new social contract would entail and where it might come from. Join him to see what Schwab has in mind.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 82 

Before the last year or so, two terms you wouldn't have expected to encounter together are &quot;drag queen&quot; and &quot;early childhood education,&quot; but we're now about three years into a full-fledged Communist revolution in the Western world, which has made it not only commonplace but shoved all in our faces. Here we are in the midst of June, &quot;Pride Month,&quot; 2022, and the Leftist collision of drag queens and young children has been center-stage all month long, including in schools. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the idea of using drag queens, or specifically a program called Drag Queen Story Hour, as an intentional educational methodology in schools isn't just some fringe activist project but also appears in the scholarly education literature. In this unbelievable episode of the New Discourses Podcast, host James Lindsay reads through an academic paper, &quot;Drag pedagogy: The playful practice of queer imagination in early childhood&quot; (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03626784.2020.1864621), in the journal Curriculum Inquiry. In light of this paper, it is virtually undeniable: what we're dealing with in schools is Marxism, specifically Queer Marxism here, and it has turned our schools into Groomer Schools.

Two of the most infamous figures of the 20th century are two of its most notorious Marxist dictators: Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong. Each had his own methods. Speaking broadly, Lenin's Bolshevik approach could be considered top-down, imposed by government and its seized industries, and Mao's &quot;Marxism-Leninism with Chinese Characteristics&quot; might be considered bottom-up, a youth rebellion, and inside-out, a cultural revolution ushered in by his radicalized youth. The most infamous Neo-Communist figure of the early 21st century will be Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, who has figured out how to combine these approaches into a top-down, bottom-up, inside-out push. His primary tools: ESG and SEL. Join James Lindsay in this episode of New Discourses Bullets, where he succinctly explains how Schwab's &quot;stakeholder capitalism&quot; Is a Leninist-Maoist project to mold a new economy and society in his image using a two-pronged vanguard model and a cultural revolution.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 81 
Thinking Sex Series, Part 3 of 3

In the previous two episodes of the New Discourses Podcast, host James Lindsay reads through the first two thirds of Gayle Rubin's shocking 1984 essay, &quot;Thinking Sex&quot; (https://sites.middlebury.edu/sexandsociety/files/2015/01/Rubin-Thinking-Sex.pdf), widely regarded as the first essay in Queer Theory. In it, as Rubin's subtitle indicates, &quot;Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality,&quot; she takes feminism (especially sex-negative radical feminism) to task for being insufficiently radical as a politics of sexuality. In fact, she accuses it (not entirely wrongly) of being resoundingly conservative with regard to sex and sexuality. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James walks you through this most tedious portion of the essay where the seeds of subverting feminism itself are planted. Within just a couple of decades from this point, the Queer Marxist movement will have used Rubin's call for a &quot;radical theory of the politics of sexuality&quot; to completely undermine the women's movement and basically kill it and the category of &quot;woman&quot; itself. Join him to understand how it started.

      <itunes:summary>New Discourses Bullets, Ep. 11 

One of the most common words we run into today thanks to the incredible spread of Woke Marxism is &quot;critical.&quot; This is because Woke Marxism comes out of the Critical Theory tradition, which is the tool of a mid-20th century Marxist project called &quot;Critical Marxism.&quot; We run into this term especially often in education, where the Woke Marxist objective is to use the pun on &quot;critical&quot; that exists between &quot;critical thinking&quot; and &quot;Critical Theory&quot; to advance their agenda under a positive-sounding cover. Luckily, they explain themselves plainly too. In this quick New Discourses Bullets summary, James Lindsay goes through an explicit admission by education activist Alison Bailey on the differences between the critical thinking and the Critical Theory (and Critical Pedagogy) approaches. Join him and stop getting fooled!

Thinking Sex Series, Part 2 of 3 

In the previous episode of the New Discourses Podcast, host James Lindsay presented the first third of the first Queer Theory paper to have been written, Gayle Rubin's shocking 1984 essay &quot;Thinking Sex&quot; (https://sites.middlebury.edu/sexandsociety/files/2015/01/Rubin-Thinking-Sex.pdf). In this episode, he continues with a second part of Rubin's essay in which it becomes clear that Queer Theory is all about breaking down all boundaries and categories between acceptable and unacceptable sexual behavior using explicitly Marxist-style analysis (Queer Theory is Queer Marxism). Before getting to this section of the essay, however, James also presents a short article from 2016 explaining the fruit Queer Theory is bearing, which makes its Marxist underpinnings completely apparent. Join James to understand more about the origins of Queer Theory.

      <itunes:summary>In the Marxist literature, you run into the words &quot;reality,&quot; &quot;realities,&quot; and &quot;actual&quot; all the time. This is no mistake. Marxists believe they, and they alone, have hacked the system and come to the only true or scientific understanding of reality. Everyone else sees reality through an ideological distortion, and they can use their &quot;critical&quot; methods to see through it. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, James Lindsay cuts through their mystification and makes it clear that when Marxists talk about &quot;reality,&quot; what they mean is their own weird and dangerous misinterpretation of it and nothing else. Misinformation and information switch places! Join him for the short discussion!

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 79 
Thinking Sex Series, Part 1 of 3 

People have very rapidly realized, whether in Groomer Schools, marketing, or so many other corners of society that we've been suckered into supporting Queer Theory under the banner of a gay and lesbian civil rights movement. We've also figured out very quickly that Queer Theory is a branch of Identity Marxism: Queer Marxism, which takes &quot;normalcy&quot; as its special form of bourgeois property to abolish through (Queer) class struggle. Where, though, did Queer Theory come from? It is relatively widely accepted that the first real Queer Theory paper is Gayle Rubin's 1984 essay &quot;Thinking Sex&quot; (https://sites.middlebury.edu/sexandsociety/files/2015/01/Rubin-Thinking-Sex.pdf), which calls for a new radical politics of sexuality. To help people understand what Queer Theory is and always has been about, James Lindsay proudly hosts a three-part New Discourses Podcast series reading through &quot;Thinking Sex&quot; in full and offering his commentary on it. In this first part, we learn that Queer Theory from its very beginnings is profoundly interested in both child pornography and pedophilia. It's almost shocking to hear. Join James to understand Queer Theory from its very origins.

      <itunes:summary>Probably the most influential Marxist thinker of the 20th century was the Critical Marxist Herbert Marcuse. His ideas were so influential that I commonly find myself saying &quot;we live in Herbert Marcuse's world&quot; today. Virtually everything crazy you see going on, perhaps except in schools, thanks to Woke Marxism and its corporate partners can be traced back neatly to Herbert Marcuse's neo-Marxist Theory, whether &quot;Repressive Tolerance (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/01/how-not-to-resolve-the-paradox-of-tolerance/),&quot; the turn to Identity Marxism (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/12/a-brief-history-of-identity-marxism/), or even the push for &quot;sustainability&quot; (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/10/sustainability-tyranny-21st-century/) at the highest levels of global governance (for example, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and the World Economic Forum's Great Reset).

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 78 
Critical Education Theory Series, Part 14 

We spend a lot of time talking about the Woke Marxification of North America's public schools, but what about private schools? As many who send their kids there can tell you, they're just as Woke, if not Woker. Critical Education Theorists (Critical Pedagogs) have not ignored private schools, just like they haven't ignored elite private universities that these schools primarily service, but how do they really think about them? In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay reads through a recent academic paper (http://www.criticaleducationnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/RCP_Feb2022_SusannahE.Livingston.pdf) regarding bringing Freirean and Leninist Critical Pedagogy into NAIS-certified private schools, and what is written by Susannah Livingston, recent graduate of GCAS (https://gcas.ie/)(Global Centre for Advanced Studies and teacher at an expensive private school in New York City, an explicitly neo-Marxist certification mill) is shocking. Join him to learn what elite parents are paying $40,000, sometimes $50,000 a year to subject their children to.

      <itunes:summary>Here's a quick public service announcement for policymakers about a simple manipulation everyone keeps falling for: the concept of &quot;historically marginalized&quot; groups. Whether using the phrasing &quot;historically marginalized&quot; or &quot;traditionally marginalized&quot; groups, this little manipulation enables a grab of power and resources in a truly tricky way, and it's &quot;feel good&quot; phrasing that appears in policy everywhere today. What's the trick? Join James Lindsay for a few minutes in this episode of New Discourses Bullets to find out. Spoiler alert, if you're in a hurry: It's that no matter what happens after a policy bearing these terms is enacted, the group referenced as &quot;historically marginalized&quot; will always remain historically marginalized because history can't be changed. Any benefits assigned to those groups will be a permanent reorganization of distribution of power and resources as a result.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 77 
Critical Education Theory Series, Part 13 

A common term of art in the current educational milieu is racial literacy. In fact, here is the giant and influential educational company Pollyanna, Inc., talking about how central racial literacy is (https://pollyannainc.org/k-8-curriculum/) to their K-8 education programs. What is racial literacy, though? As you will not be surprised to learn, it is the racial repackaging of Marxist education Theorist Paulo Freire's critical literacy model using Race Marxism (Critical Race Theory) in place of Critical Marxism (Critical Theory, or neo-Marxism). In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay explores racial literacy in the words of two of its own scholars, making clear how shoddy their so-called &quot;research&quot; really is, at bottom, and that, in fact, &quot;racial literacy&quot; means the priority of the Race Marxification of education, which merely takes Freire's Marxist education project (Critical Pedagogy) one step further. Join him to gain the confidence you need to understand this concept and push back against it when you see it in your kids' schools.

      <itunes:summary>Anywhere in North America, chances are our kids go to Paulo Freire's schools. Who is Paulo Freire? Paulo Freire is a Brazilian Marxist and Liberation Theologian who remade literacy education according to his ideological programs (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/) and thereby ruined it. His ideas were imported to North America in the 1980s and have been steadily colonizing education ever since. Now, his work has been so influential on the &quot;Critical Pedagogy&quot; (or, &quot;Critical Education Theory&quot;) movement that virtually all teachers are trained in his ideas and implement them in classrooms across the nation. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay breaks down what this unfortunate turn in education means for schools and our kids.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 76 
Critical Education Theory Series, Part 12 

This episode of the New Discourses Podcast continues into a second part a long miniseries exploring Paulo Freire's landmark 1985 book The Politics of Education: Culture, Power, and Liberation, and it is embedded in the broader Critical Education Theory series here. In the previous part, James Lindsay presented the ideas in the first half of the sixth chapter, wherein we see how Freire Marxified education itself. The previous parts of this series, covering the earlier chapters of the book can be found here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/), here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freire-educating-to-proclaim-the-world/), here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/social-work-education/), and here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/05/paulo-freires-marxification-of-education/). 

In this episode, James takes up the more complex second half of chapter six, revealing how Freire's &quot;dialogical model&quot; of education is, in fact, the birthplace of what he has elsewhere referred to as &quot;Groomer Schools.&quot; Join him to understand how Freire didn't just Marxify education but also retooled pedagogy to amount to Marxist political grooming, which is far worse than mere indoctrination.

      <itunes:summary>How do you control the Bull on Wall Street? Simple: you put a ring through its nose. The name of that ring is ESG: Environmental, Social, and Governance scoring for financing and investment. Allegedly, ESG is supposed to provide a measure of a company's long-term sustainability and profitability, but it is, instead, the tool of a small number of so-called &quot;stakeholders&quot; who are actually technocrats. The tool enables big investment firms like Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, Fidelity, and others to effectively run a monopoly-trust, which is to say a cartel, without being in direct violation of existing anti-trust legislation. If you wonder why everything, especially every big corporation, is going Woke, ESG is your answer. Join James Lindsay in this quick episode of New Discourses Bullets to break it down.

      <itunes:summary>Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) is one of the hottest scams in academia, but what is it? It is a psychological grooming mechanism used to open up children through &quot;social&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot; means to Woke Marxist ideology and praxis. It is clinical psychology practiced without a license in uncontrolled, non-therapeutic spaces on groups of children with no mental disease. It is a data-mining scheme used to probe our nations' children so they can be better propagandized in the future.

      <description>Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) is one of the hottest scams in academia, but what is it? It is a psychological grooming mechanism used to open up children through &quot;social&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot; means to Woke Marxist ideology and praxis. It is clinical psychology practiced without a license in uncontrolled, non-therapeutic spaces on groups of children with no mental disease. It is a data-mining scheme used to probe our nations' children so they can be better propagandized in the future. Join James Lindsay in this quick episode of New Discourses Bullets to break it all down.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 75 
Critical Education Theory Series, Part 11 

This episode of the New Discourses Podcast continues into a second part a long miniseries exploring Paulo Freire's landmark 1985 book The Politics of Education: Culture, Power, and Liberation (https://amzn.to/3IJ4ZOT), and it is embedded in the broader Critical Education Theory series here (https://newdiscourses.com/tag/critical-education-theory/). In the previous part, James Lindsay presented the ideas of the fifth chapter, wherein the seeds of Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) are laid as Freire describes how education and social work are closely related. The previous parts of this series, covering the earlier chapters of the book can be found here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/), here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freire-educating-to-proclaim-the-world/), and here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/social-work-education/).

In this episode, James dives into the first half of the sixth chapter, which goes deeply into Freire's model for education. In fact, what we see in this episode makes sense of the ones before it while setting the stage for all the ones that follow. Paulo Freire Marxified education itself. That is, Freire redefined literacy, education, and even knowledge according to the usual bourgeois/proletarian dichotomy and thus was able to redefine literacy to mean gaining critical consciousness. Join James to hear about the Marxification of education itself, bearing in mind yet again that almost all of our kids now go to Paulo Freire's schools.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 74 
Critical Education Theory Series, Part 10 

Here on the New Discourses Podcast, we are deep into our sprawling series (https://newdiscourses.com/tag/critical-education-theory/) on Critical Education Theory (Critical Pedagogy) and the Identity Marxist corruption of our schools, and at the same time, we're still being gaslighted about whether or not Critical Race Theory is even present in American schools. In this episode of the podcast, James Lindsay reads through part of an academic paper from 2006 about incorporating Critical Race Theory and Whiteness Studies into literacy education in second-grade classrooms. That's seven-year-olds. The point is clear: almost all of our kids go to Paulo Freire's Marxist schools, and Critical Race Theory is definitely a part of that program in today's Race Marxist regime.

      <itunes:summary>At present, schools throughout North America are reproducing the youth radicalization program utilized by Communist dictator Mao Zedong. They're doing this by combining Critical Race Theory, Gender Theory (gender ideology), Queer Theory, and the other Critical Theories of Identity (Identity Marxism) to funnel kids into politically active, radical and revolutionary personal identities. They're doing it because it works: Marxism is the what, and Maoism is the how. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, James Lindsay condenses the argument in his popular Groomer Schools 3 podcast: The Creation of an American Red Guard (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/12/groomer-schools-3-the-creation-of-an-american-red-guard/) to explain Mao's strategy to radicalize and mobilize the youth against their existing culture. He then explains how the terms of Critical Race Theory, Queer Theory, etc., are used to reproduce this in the intersectional (Identity Marxist) context here in the West for the same purposes.

This episode of the New Discourses Podcast continues into a third part a long miniseries exploring Paulo Freire's landmark 1985 book The Politics of Education: Culture, Power, and Liberation (https://amzn.to/3IJ4ZOT), and it is embedded in the broader Critical Education Theory series here (https://newdiscourses.com/tag/critical-education-theory/). In the previous parts, James Lindsay presented the ideas of the first four chapters, revealing both how religious Freire is and how Marxist. Part 1, covering the first two chapters of the book can be found here: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/, and Part 2, covering the following two chapters can be found here: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freire-educating-to-proclaim-the-world/.

In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay reads the entirety of chapter 5 of The Politics of Education, which seems out of place at first because it addresses &quot;the role of the social worker in the process of change.&quot; Not only is this chapter also profoundly religious, it reveals two points very clearly that are crucial to understand if one is to understand Critical Pedagogy (thus what's happening in schools). First, Freire is reproducing basic Marxist Theory with knowledge (as understood by formal education within the existing system) as the special form of bourgeois property. Second, Freire is erasing the distinction between education, which he says must be sociopolitical to be authentic, and social work, paving the way for the Social-Emotional Learning (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/03/critical-education-transformative-social-emotional-learning-sel/) programs of today, especially Transformative SEL. Join James to dig even deeper into what it means that our children all go to Paulo Freire's schools.

      <itunes:summary>School choice is an important component not only of liberty and improving educational outcomes but also of defeating the Woke Marxist influence in our schools and upon our children. It isn't so easy as making the money follow the child or the backpack however. School choice legislation has to be smart, and it has some challenges in need of clever solutions before we blunder ahead into a trap the Woke Marxists are setting for us. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, James Lindsay spends a few minutes breaking down the challenges and pitfalls of bad school choice policy by explaining how it will fail to solve the essential problem and might even walk our communities and our children into a Woke trap even worse than what we currently see in the public schools.

Critical Education Theory Series, Part 8 

This episode of the New Discourses Podcast continues into a second part a long miniseries exploring Paulo Freire's landmark 1985 book The Politics of Education: Culture, Power, and Liberation (https://amzn.to/3IJ4ZOT), and it is embedded in the broader Critical Education Theory series here (https://newdiscourses.com/tag/critical-education-theory/). In the previous part, James Lindsay presented the ideas of the first two chapters, revealing both how religious Freire is and how Marxist. Part 1, covering the first two chapters of the book can be found here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/). 

In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James tackles the next two chapters of this book, chapters three and four, wherein it becomes abundantly clear that &quot;Culturally Relevant Teaching&quot; (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/02/critical-education-what-is-culturally-relevant-pedagogy/) is an Identity Marxist repackaging of Freirean education. His discussion highlights how messianic Freire is and pointing out that, in some sense, Freire's Critical Pedagogy stands in analogous relationship to the Gospel of John for the Marxist Theology (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/01/theology-marxism/). Freire's idea is that literacy means political literacy as understood in the Marxist way: formal education is bourgeois and Critical Education is a revolutionary praxis that can transform the oppressive state of the world. Freire's point, though, is positively religious, in the Johnnine sense in that his goal is to teach the word so the conscious can learn to speak the world. Join James Lindsay to unpack even more of what it means that all of our children now go to Paulo Freire's Marxist Sunday Schools.

      <description>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 72 
Critical Education Theory Series, Part 8 

This episode of the New Discourses Podcast continues into a second part a long miniseries exploring Paulo Freire's landmark 1985 book The Politics of Education: Culture, Power, and Liberation (https://amzn.to/3IJ4ZOT), and it is embedded in the broader Critical Education Theory series here (https://newdiscourses.com/tag/critical-education-theory/). In the previous part, James Lindsay presented the ideas of the first two chapters, revealing both how religious Freire is and how Marxist. Part 1, covering the first two chapters of the book can be found here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/). 

In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James tackles the next two chapters of this book, chapters three and four, wherein it becomes abundantly clear that &quot;Culturally Relevant Teaching&quot; (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/02/critical-education-what-is-culturally-relevant-pedagogy/) is an Identity Marxist repackaging of Freirean education. His discussion highlights how messianic Freire is and pointing out that, in some sense, Freire's Critical Pedagogy stands in analogous relationship to the Gospel of John for the Marxist Theology (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/01/theology-marxism/). Freire's idea is that literacy means political literacy as understood in the Marxist way: formal education is bourgeois and Critical Education is a revolutionary praxis that can transform the oppressive state of the world. Freire's point, though, is positively religious, in the Johnnine sense in that his goal is to teach the word so the conscious can learn to speak the world. Join James Lindsay to unpack even more of what it means that all of our children now go to Paulo Freire's Marxist Sunday Schools.

      <itunes:summary>We hear about equity all the time but are rarely told that it's shorthand for Social Equity, or even &quot;Critical Social Equity.&quot; We also hear all the time about Social Justice, which is sometimes referred to as Critical Social Justice. What are these concepts, though? In Woke Marxism, they are the rebranding of Socialism (Social Equity) and Communism (Social Justice), meant to be achieved through Critical Theory. That's it. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, James Lindsay explains Karl Marx's conception of the evolution of Socialism into Communism and then shows how the terms &quot;equity&quot; and &quot;Social Justice&quot; as widely used today reproduce this precise Theory in a new domain (identity politics) under new branding.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 71 
Critical Education Theory Series, Part 7 

Just as we have learned here on the New Discourses Podcast that we live in Herbert Marcuse's world (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/01/how-not-to-resolve-the-paradox-of-tolerance/) today (and that's why it's so messed up), we also need to understand that our children all go to Paulo Freire's schools. Therefore, we have to spend some time getting to know Paulo Freire and his approach to education, now called Critical Pedagogy or Critical Education Theory (https://newdiscourses.com/tag/critical-education-theory/), and we need to know it deeply. To serve that goal, the New Discourses Podcast has undertaken a long series on Critical Education Theory, filled with several miniseries. Here, it begins a miniseries exploring Paulo Freire's book The Politics of Education: Culture, Power, and Liberation (https://amzn.to/3IJ4ZOT), published in 1985, in considerable depth, revealing exactly what Freirean education is about. Though the introduction to this book, by Henry Giroux, already counts for two episodes of the New Discourses Podcast in this broader series, in this episode, James Lindsay begins his deep-dive directly into Freire's work. This book, The Politics of Education, is nothing short of revelatory, not least because it is the book that succeeded in getting Freire to be taken seriously throughout colleges of education throughout North America.

In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James tackles the first two chapters of this book, giving a broad overview of Freire's general approach and beliefs about the act of study and two visions for education: one &quot;ingenuous&quot; and the other Critical. In the second of these, we see how Freire redefines &quot;literacy&quot; so that it becomes the site of a new Marxian Theory. Freire's Marxist (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/01/theology-marxism/) and Hegelian (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/05/hegel-wokeness-and-the-dialectical-faith-of-leftism/) roots are clearly exposed in just these first two chapters, as are his generally religious disposition with regard to Marxism. Join James to understand how Freire, through this book and his other work, transformed our education system into Marxist Sunday School, five days a week, bearing in mind that nearly all of our kids go to Paulo Freire's schools.

      <itunes:summary>The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion industry under Woke Marxism is easy to understand. Equity is a rebranding of Socialism: an administered economy that makes outcomes equal. Diversity and Inclusion are tools used to install political officers and to censor and remove dissidents, respectively. In other words, the Woke Marxist DEI industry is a racket designed to install commissars for its ideology. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, James Lindsay breaks this vital concept down in quick, digestible terms.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 70 

We often hear that Woke Marxism is a new ideology in the world. I've even said so. Well, it isn't. It's just an old one repackaged in various ways without any essential changes made to it at all. Critical Race Theory is Race Marxism in the same way as what we usually call Marxism is Class Marxism. Radical Feminism is Sex Marxism. Gender ideology and Queer Theory are Sex, Gender, and Sexuality Marxism, or just Gender Marxism or Sexual Marxism to be more concise. Fat studies is Fat Marxism. Disability studies is Ability Marxism. Critical Education Theory (Critical Pedagogy) is Knowledge Marxism in terms of what it means to be formally educated or literate within the existing system. Postmodern postructuralism is Language Marxism. Postcolonial Theory is National Origin Marxism. And on it goes, with all of these cobbled together by intersectionality, which is Identity Marxism. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay breaks down the essential kernel of Marxist thought and makes perfectly clear how all of the claims in this paragraph are true. Join him to understand what's going on in our world today in these simple, straightforward, yet sobering terms.

      <itunes:summary>Resisting Critical Race Theory Workshop, Session 5 of 5 

What is Critical Race Theory? What does it believe? Where does it come from? How does it work? And what can we do about it? These are core questions to understanding our times. In this series of lectures, originally delivered in Tampa, Florida, in July of 2021, James Lindsay, the founder of New Discourses, gives thorough, deep answers to these questions. 

In this fifth and final lecture in the series, Lindsay offers a stirring alternative to Critical Race Theory. The approach he advocates has two prongs, one practical and the other cultural. Practically, Critical Race Theory must be fought. Being Race Marxists, Critical Race Theorists will not stop on their own, even if we ask very nicely (or firmly). Their better nature cannot be appealed to because their entire program insists that Critical Race Theory is humanity's better nature (in fact, the only way it can avoid being racist). Thus, practical solutions that challenge and limit Critical Race Theory's implementation are needed with the overarching goal of removing the influence of Critical Race Theorists from power they only ever abuse. Secondly, Lindsay dives into the need for a cultural renewal in the classically liberal principles that founded nations like the United States. He makes calls for decentralization of power and, even more importantly, a new Common Sensibility to replace the fractured intersectional sensibility imposed upon us by Critical Race Theory. Join him in this and the other lectures in the series to understand Critical Race Theory like you never have before and, in this lecture, to gain some clear ideas on how to take action to defeat its pernicious influence in our societies! 

For those interested in learning even more, Lindsay's newest book, Race Marxism: The Truth About Critical Race Theory and Praxis (https://amzn.to/3s25IFJ), was developed out of the notes for this series of lectures. His notes for this lecture served as the basis for the sixth and final chapter of the book. Get the book and follow along with the lectures!

      <itunes:summary>Resisting Critical Race Theory Workshop, Session 4 of 5 

What is Critical Race Theory? What does it believe? Where does it come from? How does it work? And what can we do about it? These are core questions to understanding our times. In this series of lectures, originally delivered in Tampa, Florida, in July of 2021, James Lindsay, the founder of New Discourses, gives thorough, deep answers to these questions. 

In this fourth lecture in the series, Lindsay steps away from Theory and into praxis, that is, the practical application of Critical Race Theory. That is, in this lecture, Lindsay breaks down what Critical Race Theory does: makes more Critical Race Theorists (and nothing else). He also elaborates on how Critical Race Theory does it, which is through the complicated idea called &quot;praxis&quot; and through a significant number of linguistic, social, and psychological distortions and extortions. For those in attendance and many since, this lecture has been considered the most eye-opening and clarifying of the series. Critical Race Theory is as Critical Race Theory does, and all Critical Race Theory does is take every pain to transform everything in society into a Critical Race Theorist programming machine. If you are facing Critical Race Theory in your life, this is a must-watch lecture on the operating principles of Critical Race Theory. Join him in this and the other lectures in the series to understand Critical Race Theory like you never have before!

For those interested in learning even more, Lindsay's newest book, Race Marxism: The Truth About Critical Race Theory and Praxis (https://amzn.to/3s25IFJ), was developed out of the notes for this series of lectures. His notes for this lecture served as the basis for the fifth chapter of the book. Get the book and follow along with the lectures!

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 69 
Critical Education Theory Series, Part 6 

Possibly the most important topic happening in education, at least if you care about the well-being, health, and safety of children and the future of this country, is &quot;Social-Emotional Learning (SEL).&quot; Social-Emotional Learning is the psychologizing of schooling, and, as one might expect, it comes in a variety of forms. The most contemporary and relevant form is the most Marxist form because the Marxist educators have completely hijacked any legitimacy the program ever had and turned it into a Maoist nightmare (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/12/groomer-schools-3-the-creation-of-an-american-red-guard/) to ruin your kids so they can achieve their revolution. In this long, detailed episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay helps you understand the most Marxist version of SEL, Transformative SEL, by reading a full academic paper describing it and the (complete lack of) evidence for its implementation. The paper (https://bit.ly/TransSEL) appeared in Educational Psychologist in 2019, bearing the title &quot; Transformative Social and Emotional Learning (SEL): Toward SEL in Service of Educational Equity and Excellence,&quot; and is by Robert J. Jagers, Deborah Rivas-Drake, and Brittney Williams. If you want to save our schools, you have to understand what Transformative SEL is (and the CASEL model it has colonized), and you can do that by joining James for this informative episode!

      <itunes:summary>Resisting Critical Race Theory Workshop, Session 3 of 5

What is Critical Race Theory? What does it believe? Where does it come from? How does it work? And what can we do about it? These are core questions to understanding our times. In this series of lectures, originally delivered in Tampa, Florida, in July of 2021, James Lindsay, the founder of New Discourses, gives thorough, deep answers to these questions. 

In this third lecture in this eye-opening series on Critical Race Theory, Lindsay goes even deeper, into what he refers to as the &quot;deep ideological roots&quot; of Critical Race Theory. These roots are, predominantly, in the Communist Theory of Karl Marx. Marx's mid-19th century ideas were based on other ideas, however, particularly those of the German idealist G.W.F. Hegel and the French romantic Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In this lecture, Lindsay makes abundantly clear the relevance of these 18th and 19th century social theorists and philosophers to the Critical Race Theory plaguing the world today. He also makes important connections through the intellectual godfather of Critical Race Theory, a black scholar from the turn of the 20th century named W.E.B. Du Bois. After this lecture, you will have a deep understanding of how Critical Race Theory is both Race Marxism and just a racial manifestation of the broader &quot;dialectical faith of Leftism&quot; that finds its origins primarily in Hegel and Rousseau. Join him in this and the other lectures in the series to understand Critical Race Theory like you never have before!

For those interested in learning even more, Lindsay's newest book, Race Marxism: The Truth About Critical Race Theory and Praxis (https://amzn.to/3s25IFJ), was developed out of the notes for this series of lectures. His notes for this lecture served as the basis for the very detailed third chapter of the book. Get the book and follow along with the lectures!

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 68 

James Lindsay recently released a new book titled Race Marxism: The Truth About Critical Race Theory and Praxis (http://racemarxism.com) that shot up to #14 on the Amazon.com bestsellers list in its opening week. As many will know, that book seeks to expose Critical Race Theory and follows a series of lectures Lindsay gave in Tampa, Florida, in July of 2021 (https://newdiscourses.com/tag/resisting-critical-race-theory-workshop/). Since the book is so broad and has so much to expose, there's even more to say about the specific claim in the title, that Critical Race Theory is Race Marxism. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, Lindsay goes into tremendous detail linking Marx's Theory of Communism directly to Critical Race Theory, showing in clear detail how Critical Race Theory reproduces those ideas in a new form that replaces economic class with race. For those seeking to understand Critical Race Theory, this episode of the New Discourses Podcast is therefore indispensable. Join James to fully understand how Critical Race Theory is, in fact, Race Marxism in the deepest possible way.

      <itunes:summary>Resisting Critical Race Theory Workshop, Session 2 of 5

What is Critical Race Theory? What does it believe? Where does it come from? How does it work? And what can we do about it? These are core questions to understanding our times. In this series of lectures, originally delivered in Tampa, Florida, in July of 2021, James Lindsay, the founder of New Discourses, gives thorough, deep answers to these questions. 

In the second of these insightful lectures, Lindsay takes us into the &quot;proximate ideological roots&quot; of Critical Race Theory. These twentieth-century ideological antecedents to CRT include the Critical Legal Studies movement in law, the New Left and its radical activism (as it went first into the streets and then into the classroom), neo-Marxism (also known as Critical Marxism or Critical Theory), Cultural Marxism, and postmodern Theory. Critical Race Theory, you'll learn in this lecture, did not arise in a vacuum, out of nowhere. It arose from Marxists who needed to answer certain questions about why their Theory had failed in so many disastrous ways and how they might get to their glorious Revolution by other means. Critical Race Theory turns out to be one of those means, and in this lecture, Lindsay makes it clear where these lines of thought came from and how they separated and then recombined to give us the Identity Marxist and Woke Marxist Theories we see today, especially including Critical Race Theory. In this lecture, it will become absolutely clear why Lindsay characterizes Critical Race Theory simply as &quot;a neo-Marxist conflict theory of race, i.e., Race Marxism.&quot; You will also come away understanding the twentieth century history of Marxist thought better than ever. Join him in this and the other lectures in the series to understand Critical Race Theory like you never have before!

For those interested in learning even more, Lindsay's newest book, Race Marxism: The Truth About Critical Race Theory and Praxis (https://amzn.to/3s25IFJ), was developed out of the notes for this series of lectures. His notes for this lecture served as the basis for the very detailed third chapter of the book. Get the book and follow along with the lectures!

In the second of these insightful lectures, Lindsay takes us into the &quot;proximate ideological roots&quot; of Critical Race Theory. These twentieth-century ideological antecedents to CRT include the Critical Legal Studies movement in law, the New Left and its radical activism (as it went first into the streets and then into the classroom), neo-Marxism (also known as Critical Marxism or Critical Theory), Cultural Marxism, and postmodern Theory. Critical Race Theory, you'll learn in this lecture, did not arise in a vacuum, out of nowhere. It arose from Marxists who needed to answer certain questions about why their Theory had failed in so many disastrous ways and how they might get to their glorious Revolution by other means. Critical Race Theory turns out to be one of those means, and in this lecture, Lindsay makes it clear where these lines of thought came from and how they separated and then recombined to give us the Identity Marxist and Woke Marxist Theories we see today, especially including Critical Race Theory. In this lecture, it will become absolutely clear why Lindsay characterizes Critical Race Theory simply as &quot;a neo-Marxist conflict theory of race, i.e., Race Marxism.&quot; You will also come away understanding the twentieth century history of Marxist thought better than ever. Join him in this and the other lectures in the series to understand Critical Race Theory like you never have before!

For those interested in learning even more, Lindsay's newest book, Race Marxism: The Truth About Critical Race Theory and Praxis (https://amzn.to/3s25IFJ), was developed out of the notes for this series of lectures. His notes for this lecture served as the basis for the very detailed third chapter of the book. Get the book and follow along with the lectures!

What is Critical Race Theory? What does it believe? Where does it come from? How does it work? And what can we do about it? These are core questions to understanding our times. In this series of lectures, originally delivered in Tampa, Florida, in July of 2021, James Lindsay, the founder of New Discourses, gives thorough, deep answers to these questions. 

In the first of these lectures, Lindsay dives into a pressing question: what is Critical Race Theory? In particular, he seeks to offer answers and insights about what defines Critical Race Theory, both in terms of what it represents as a Theory and in terms of what its core beliefs are as a religious system. His answer is simple: Critical Race Theory is Race Marxism. In this illuminating lecture, Lindsay takes us through excerpts from introductory and advanced Critical Race Theory texts to make clear not only that CRT is, in fact, Race Marxism, but what that means in practice for everyone. He stresses particularly that Critical Race Theory is a belief system founded on the article of faith that racism that benefits white people is the fundamental organizing principle of society. He then details thirteen core beliefs, or tenets, of the Critical Race Theory faith and explains how they form a comprehensive, systematic system of belief around that core article of faith. Join him for this and the subsequent lectures in the series to understand Critical Race Theory like you never have before.

For those interested in learning even more, Lindsay's newest book, Race Marxism: The Truth About Critical Race Theory and Praxis (http://racemarxism.com), was developed out of the notes for this series of lectures. His notes for this lecture served as the basis for the first two chapters of the book. Get the book and follow along with the lectures!

The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 67

It's time the unvarnished truth about Critical Race Theory is told in full. That truth is simple: Critical Race Theory is Race Marxism, that is, Marxian Theory reinvented with race as &quot;the central construct for understanding inequality&quot; in place of economic class. That conclusion is unavoidable after reading this new, groundbreaking book from James Lindsay: Race Marxism: The Truth About Critical Race Theory and Praxis, published by New Discourses. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, the author introduces this book to the world, including reading an excerpt from the introduction. You won't want to miss the book or this podcast introducing and explaining it. Join James for the podcast and order Race Marxism today!

Critical Education Theory Series, Part 5 

Fancy buzzwords proliferate around the fight in education, especially now that Critical Race Theory has been exposed so thoroughly [as Race Marxism (https://racemarxism.com)]. Terms like Ethnic Studies, Social-Emotional Learning, and all manner of &quot;culturally&quot; something teaching seem like they have cropped up out of the ground in just the last few months, but they're actually old. Culturally relevant teaching (CRT) is one of these, pioneered first in 1995 by Marxist and Critical-Race education activist Gloria Ladson-Billings. In that year, Ladson-Billings wrote both &quot;Toward a Critical Race Theory of Education&quot; and &quot;Toward a Theory of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy.&quot; In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay reads through this latter paper, &quot;Toward a Theory of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy&quot; (https://edspace.american.edu/culturallysustainingclassrooms/wp-content/uploads/sites/1030/2017/09/Ladson-Billings-1995.pdf), to expose what this menace to education is (hint: it's not very clear, but it's obviously Marxism). Join him to learn about culturally relevant, responsive, and sustaining teaching, cultural competence, and the broader Marxist project of multiculturalism.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 65 
Critical Education Theory Series, Part 4 

Perhaps no Marxist has had more influence on the Western world than the Brazilian crackpot educator Paulo Freire, who is most famous for his book The Pedagogy of the Oppressed (https://amzn.to/3IRRe0N), which is the third most-cited work in the social sciences and humanities in the history of the world and a mainstay in all education programs today. Understanding Freire and his influence is therefore paramount to understanding how our education system has been poisoned by Marxist Theory over the last forty years. To put it simply, Freire must be understood as a significant prophet in the Marxist religion, and his faith has been integrated thoroughly into all North American education, to the detriment of all. Join James Lindsay in this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, where he continues through the darker, deeper aspect of Freirean Critical Pedagogy, as he reads through the second half of Henry Giroux's foreword to Freire's 1985 The Politics of Education (https://amzn.to/3s4bQft), which is an explicitly religious book. This is the fourth episode in Lindsay's sprawling Critical Education Theory (Critical Pedagogy) series on the New Discourses Podcast.

In April of 2019, the famously conservative Southern Baptist Convention adopted an infamous resolution, Resolution 9, bringing into the Convention both Critical Race Theory and Intersectionality &quot;as an analytical tool subordinate to Scripture.&quot; This is, at best, a fundamental misunderstanding of Woke Marxism (thus CRT/I), which are explicitly designed to identify anything they are put in subordination to, subvert that thing, and then occupy a position of dominance over it (which they deny they are doing). In this must-listen episode of my subscribers-only podcast, James Lindsay OnlySubs, I go into this facet of Theory and raise important questions about why anyone would think this was a good idea. Join me to hear all about the threat from within to a conservative religious icon.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 64 

Most people think of Marxism as an economic theory or, perhaps, a social theory. This isn't sufficient. Marxism, strange as it may sound, is a theology, the basis for a religion. This isn't to say that Marxism or Communism is like a religion. It is to say that it literally is a religion. The basis of the Marxian theology is work, or, as they tend to have it, the work. You must do the work. The work is the basis of the Marxian theology in the same way that submission is the basis of Islam and atonement by grace through the sacrifice of Jesus as Christ is the basis of Christianity. In this groundbreaking episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay dives into the Marxian literature, including the writings of Karl Marx himself, to show that Marxism should be thought of as a theology by clarifying how this theology works. Understanding the theological nature of Marxism will, in turn, shed considerable light on the theological nature of Wokeness. Join James for this intense, in-depth discussion.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 63 
Critical Education Theory Series, Part 3 

How did Wokeness come about? Here on the New Discourses Podcast, we've dedicated hours and hours to uncovering the roles of neo-Marxism (or, Critical Marxism; or, Critical Theory), postmodern Theory, Marxism, Hegelianism, and other dimensions of Leftist thought. The role played by Critical Pedagogy, and in particular the Marxian Theory of Paulo Freire, has not been fully discussed, however. The role played by this line of Marxian thought cannot be ignored, however, because, as James Lindsay puts it in the forthcoming book Race Marxism (https://amzn.to/3qo23Bw), Critical Pedagogy is the plow, planter, and fertilizer that enabled Wokeness to grow in the first place. This is evident when we understand Freire's line of thought on the purpose and approach to education, but what's less well understood is the aspect of faith and hope (&quot;Critical Hope&quot;) Freire brought back into Marxian Theory. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, join James as he dives into the introduction to Paulo Freire's 1985 book, The Politics of Education (https://amzn.to/3ntSjnr), in order to better understand Freire and his influence. This podcast is the third in the developing Critical Education Theory series on the New Discourses Podcast and the first of many focusing on the figure and thought of Paulo Freire.

On January 1 of this year, the New York Times told us that &quot;Every Day is January 6 Now.&quot; That's obviously absurd, hyperreal, pseudo-real, but it's also an echo from the past. While many have rightly made the comparison between that farce and the Reichstag Fire perpetrated by the National Socialists in order to grab power, I was immediately put in mind of a paragraph from Herbert Marcuse's 1965 essay &quot;Repressive Tolerance&quot; (https://www.marcuse.org/herbert/publications/1960s/1965-repressive-tolerance-fulltext.html) when I saw that headline. &quot;The whole post-fascist period is one of clear and present danger. Consequently, true pacification requires the withdrawal of tolerance before the deed, at the stage of communication in word, print, and picture. Such extreme suspension of the right of free speech and free assembly is indeed justified only if the whole of society is in extreme danger. I maintain that our society is in such an emergency situation, and that it has become the normal state of affairs,&quot; Marcuse wrote. Every day is January 6 now, and our entire society is in such an emergency situation, one of clear and present danger. In this episode of my subscribers-only podcast, James Lindsay OnlySubs, which I'm taking out from behind the paywall and making available to everyone, I walk you through the crucial paragraphs of Marcuse's essay in light of this ridiculous and ridiculously dangerous pronouncement. Join me to learn even more about how we find ourselves living in Marcuse's nightmarish neo-Marxist philosophy.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 62 

Intersectionality is usually credited to Kim Crenshaw, who coined the term as well as &quot;Critical Race Theory&quot; in 1989. It has an older history, however. Listeners to the New Discourses Podcast will have heard earlier episodes in which James Lindsay articulates how intersectionality arose from the Critical Marxist Theory of Herbert Marcuse in the late 1960s, but there's another link in the middle of the twenty-five year span between 1964, when Marcuse wrote One-Dimensional Man (https://amzn.to/3pXrjhK), and 1989. That link can be found in the Black Feminist organization known as the Combahee River Collective, which published a manifesto-like statement in 1977 that lays out intersectionality 12 years before Crenshaw ever wrote about it. In the Combahee River Collective Statement of 1977 (https://www.workers.org/wp-content/uploads/CombaheeRiverCollectiveStatement1977.pdf), then, we can find the first articulation of what intersectionality is really about and see unambiguously its deep Marxist roots, cementing the claim that it is, in fact, Identity Marxism. Join James on this episode of the New Discourses Podcast to hear the statement in his signature style.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 61 
Critical Education Theory Series, Part 2 

Something is rotten in the state of Western education. The name for that rot is &quot;Critical Pedagogy,&quot; which could also be called &quot;Critical Education Theory,&quot; the infusion of Critical Theory into all aspects of education. How did this happen? Rather, how was it allowed to happen? Activists have been tirelessly working for over 50 years to make their way into the American, Canadian, and other Western school systems, and, as you will learn in this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, the second in a growing series on the Critical Turn in Education, they have been successful in that mission for at least the last 30 years. In this episode, second in this series, James Lindsay reads through the book that documents this horrific turn, The Critical Turn in Education (https://amzn.to/3qDpJRi), by Marxian education professor Isaac Gottesman, and makes clear exactly how our educational systems were deliberately and strategically turned Marxist over the last half century. Join him to understand exactly what's going on in our schools and why.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 60 

More and more people are waking up every day to the fact that our schools have become an undeniable catastrophe, and they're starting to realize alongside that fact that it isn't an accident. It is purposed. It is intentional. It is a strategy, and it uses our children as pawns for achieving a nightmarish agenda, no matter how much damage it does to them to achieve it. In this Groomer Schools series on the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay has already walked you through (in Part 1: https://newdiscourses.com/2021/11/groomer-schools-1-long-cultural-marxist-history-sex-education/) the long Communist Party strategy to use sex education in schools to destabilize society and sever ties between generations and just how specifically grotesque this grooming sexual agenda is (in Part 2: https://newdiscourses.com/2021/11/groomer-schools-2-queer-futurity-and-the-sexual-abuse-of-your-children/). Here, in the third part of the series, Lindsay puts these two pieces together, explains their purpose, and illustrates how Critical Race Theory works alongside Queer Theory (grooming) for a blatantly Maoist purpose: to create an American Red Guard meant to overthrow our society and start all over from a new Year Zero. Join him to understand the evil Maoist tactics being employed in our schools to turn our children into Revolutionaries for the purpose of undermining America and the West.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 59 

The movement taking on Critical Race Theory is now in full swing across the Western world, and not a moment too soon. Over the course of the last year and a half, people have learned enough about this Neo-Communist menace to be ready, willing, and able to stand up and fight it in schools, institutions, companies, and communities all across our societies. What's necessary now is a simplification. Critical Race Theory flourishes in part by making people believe it is complicated and sophisticated when, in fact, it is neither. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay boils down Critical Race Theory to five simple points that are easily understood and easily communicated. Join him to arm yourself to show up to the fight and to equip officials to take up the fight beside you.

Critical Education Theory Series, Part 1 

Over the last fifty years, a monumental change in the North American education systems has been taking place. The name for that change is &quot;the Critical Turn in Education,&quot; which is, in brief, how Critical Theory has crept into education and education theory (pedagogy) and slowly perverted it from within. The madness in today's schools, then, is not some unhappy accident of the last year or even decade but the product of a dedicated march into the schooling institutions by Marxist, neo-Marxist, and Identity Marxist Theorists who have all but completely colonized it. This needs attention. Over the coming weeks and months, James Lindsay will be taking his listeners here on the New Discourses Podcast through the Critical Turn in Education so that they can know how and why these terrible changes have been implemented. In this first episode in this wide-ranging series, Lindsay dives into the new commitments Critical Pedagogy demands of teachers and students in the new Regime. Join James as he reads through a summary by Critical Education Theorist Michael Apple to learn exactly what these are.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay. Episode 57 

What is the University? It's the center of intellectual life in civilizations in the broad era we might call Modernity. And what is the purpose of the University in its essence? If we turn to the 19th century Catholic thinker John Henry Newman and his iconic The Idea of the University, we see that it is to teach all knowledge. The Universities were originally seminaries, though, and theology sat at their heart. Newman, in this iconic and valuable work, makes a convincing case that without theology, which Universities could merely assume would be present in their beginning, other sciences less suited to the task would take up theologizing and would do so poorly. Newman is right, and this is exactly what has happened in the secular Western University over the last few centuries. In that gap, the social sciences have filled in the role of theologians, and the Critical Theory perversion of the social sciences has therefore resulted in a pervasive rot throughout Western Civilization that we are realizing only just in time. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay, perhaps an unlikely host for this subject, takes on Newman's argument and, in fact, agrees that a mature theology must sit at the center of any vital and healthy society, including whatever institution resides at the heart of its intellectual life. What that looks like not just in a post-Enlightenment world (Modernity) but also in one that is entering its Second Enlightenment (Postmodernity) (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/10/welcome-to-the-second-enlightenment/) is a challenging question that he believes is the most immediate task for taking humanity through its present and emerging challenges. Join him for an unexpected and groundbreaking discussion of the centrality of theology to a thriving civilization.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 56 

The ideology that is most conveniently identified as &quot;Wokeness&quot; is much more accurately described by the phrase Identity Marxism. That is, Wokeness is a Marxian approach to identity politics for similar aims to those Marxism has always touted. In this regard, Critical Race Theory is Race Marxism; Critical Gender Theory is Gender Marxism; Queer Theory is Gender, Sex, and Sexuality Marxism; Fat Studies is Fat Marxism; Postcolonial Theory is Postcolonial Marxism; and Disability Studies is Disability Marxism. All together, working intersectionally, they are one new species of Marxism: Identity Marxism. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay walks the listener through a history of the various strains of Marxist thought to make the case that Wokeness is best thought of this way. Indeed, it must be understood this way. In so doing, he elucidates what Marxism really represents as a broad, overarching philosophy (or, religion) and indicates that the various species of Marxism, including vulgar, Cultural, neo-, and now Identity Marxism, are all essentially the same project in different guises. Join him for a penetrating discussion that frames Wokeness as it really is.

In the previous episode of the New Discourses Podcast (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/11/groomer-schools-1-long-cultural-marxist-history-sex-education/), James Lindsay revealed the long history of the problem of Groomer Schools, and horrible as it is, it barely communicates just how bad things really are. In this follow-up episode, Lindsay reads through an academic paper at the intersection of early childhood education and Queer Theory, two subjects that should never be mixed. The 2019 paper is called &quot;Queer futurity and childhood innocence: Beyond the injury of development&quot; by Hannah Dyer of Carleton University, Canada. In this episode of the podcast, James reads through this paper in full, offering his usual level of commentary and revealing just how insidious and dangerous the agenda in the public schools is (Critical Race Theory is, honestly, among the least of our problems, if you can believe it). Join him and prepare to be appalled at what the Critical Marxists who have taken over our education system have in mind for our children.

Through brand names like &quot;comprehensive sex education&quot; and one of its parent programs, &quot;Social-Emotional Learning (SEL),&quot; our government schools have been turned into Groomer Schools, and parents are beginning to notice. What many will not understand, however, is that this isn't just a fluke of our weird and increasingly degenerate times. It is, in fact, a long-purposed Marxist project reaching back into the early 20th century. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, join James Lindsay as he explains the long history of the sexual grooming that has come into our schools through Critical Gender Theory and Queer Theory as they have crept into educational programs. If you want an explanation for how sexually explicit materials, gender ideology, pornography, and strippers have made their way into our government schools, including for young children, this is a must-hear.

Order Counter Wokecraft: https://amzn.to/3r1y0Ak 

New Discourses is excited to present the first publication in its book imprint, Counter Wokecraft: A Field Manual for Combatting the Woke in the University and Beyond, by Charles Pincourt with James Lindsay. This short, accessible guide presents the idea that Wokeness isn't just a philosophy but also a practice that is used to infiltrate and take over institutional settings, particularly universities. In that regard, it has a method attached to its madness, which Pincourt aptly names &quot;Wokecraft,&quot; in parallel to spycraft. This guide presents a brief overview of the Woke ideology (&quot;Wokeness&quot;), outlines many of the most prominent institutional techniques of Wokecraft, and then offers the reader many strategies for identifying and fighting back against Wokecraft wherever it may be encountered. A first of its kind, this book takes on Wokeness at the level of its institutional strategy and equips readers to do something about it. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, contributor to the book James Lindsay walks through the table of contents in extraordinary detail to give listeners an overview of this exciting and useful new title. Join him and pick up your copy of Counter Wokecraft today!

Surely you've noticed that the Woke movement doesn't build anything or accomplish anything productive. There's a reason for that. The only thing they bring to the table is protest, which is to say destruction. Disrupt, dismantle, deconstruct, subvert, and then &quot;reimagine&quot;; that's their whole program. This has been summarized here on the New Discourses Podcast under the slogan &quot;Communism doesn't know how&quot; (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/04/communism-doesnt-know-how/), but in this episode, James Lindsay walks you through their literature again, showing you that protest is the only method they intend to bring to the table. That protest is rooted in a profound paranoia that pervades all of Critical Theory, and thus the entire Woke movement can be summarized as being one of little more than protest and paranoia. Join James for another in-depth discussion of the Woke literature and what it tells us about the movement we're all dealing with.

You may have noticed that times are turbulent and that something very nefarious seems to be afoot. You're not wrong, of course. That's exactly what's happening, and it presents a dangerous time for humanity. The question is why it's happening because the answer to that question informs us significantly on our prospects going forward. On the one hand, and this is correct, a global push for a kind of communo-fascism is underway: a power grab of the grandest proportions in human history. This is consistent with Communist visions stretching back over a century and must be recognized and resisted. On the other hand, it's happening now instead of at some other time. Is that merely because the technological tools to make this attempt finally exist, with digital technology and social media enabling new forms of propaganda and social credit systems for unprecedented social control? Partly, yes, but merely, no. The internet, like its nearest conceptual predecessor, the printing press, has changed everything. Understanding the nature of that change sheds useful light on the world we now inhabit along with how we should address this new threat and what we have to look forward to if (or when) we succeed.

In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, host James Lindsay walks us through a view that breaks out of our limited historical parallax and considers the question of what's going on around us in a broader frame. What he sees is the dawn of the Second Enlightenment, which will change the world in unbelievable ways for the better if it can set the world ablaze and spread its light. Drawing on lessons from the previous Enlightenment, which unfolded from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries, Lindsay makes a case that for all it did accomplish, it didn't do the one thing that most educated liberals believe it did. The First Enlightenment did not create a Marketplace of Ideas. It created an aristocracy of ideas, which was a huge step in the right direction away from the magisteria of the Darker Age that preceded it. Now, with the advent of the internet and the ability for the average person to hold &quot;information property&quot; by the fruits of his own research, the Marketplace of Ideas is finally emerging. It's also threatening the power of the &quot;information aristocrats&quot; in the Expert Caste, including its worst offenders, the technocrats. These are doing everything in their power to re-establish a technocratic information aristocracy in the form of a new administered information economy: an information socialism totally under oligarchical technocratic control.

Sustainability is going to be the buzzword of the century. Everywhere we turn, we hear about sustainable practices in business and industry, sustainable foods and agriculture, sustainable energy, and so on. Businesses and governments sign on to &quot;Sustainable Development Goals,&quot; and so civil responsibility is framed in terms of this seemingly simple idea: sustainability. What does sustainability entail, though? What informs it? In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay walks through Herbert Marcuse's New Leftism of the 1960s and 1970s and explains how sustainability has become Marcuse's &quot;New Sensibility.&quot; In other words, sustainability is the new way of thinking about the world so that we can have liberation, which is to say Communism. Join James in this groundbreaking episode of the New Discourses Podcast to explore this idea at its ominous roots.

      <description>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 50 

Sustainability is going to be the buzzword of the century. Everywhere we turn, we hear about sustainable practices in business and industry, sustainable foods and agriculture, sustainable energy, and so on. Businesses and governments sign on to &quot;Sustainable Development Goals,&quot; and so civil responsibility is framed in terms of this seemingly simple idea: sustainability. What does sustainability entail, though? What informs it? In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay walks through Herbert Marcuse's New Leftism of the 1960s and 1970s and explains how sustainability has become Marcuse's &quot;New Sensibility.&quot; In other words, sustainability is the new way of thinking about the world so that we can have liberation, which is to say Communism. Join James in this groundbreaking episode of the New Discourses Podcast to explore this idea at its ominous roots.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 49 

Critical Theory evolved out of a pathological hatred. This hatred isn't just what you expect. Yes, the Critical Theorists hated capitalism, like all Marxists, but they hated something new about capitalism compared against their predecessors. They hated that capitalism works. Critical Theory, the tool of neo-Marxism, therefore grew out of the pathological hatred of the fact that &quot;advanced capitalism,&quot; as they call it, which is protected against monopoly abuses, allows the working class to &quot;build a better life.&quot; Having a good life, you see, stabilizes them. It takes away their revolutionary will. It makes them love their society and want to maintain it. It, in their view, turns them conservative, and this is intolerable. Prosperous, functioning societies became the target of their bid for cultural revolution in the 1960s. To execute this revolution, though, they needed a new base for revolutionary energy, a new proletariat to awaken to Marxian revolutionary anger. Herbert Marcuse, architect of the New Left, found that new proletariat in identity politics, laying the ground in which the Woke Identity Marxism of today would eventually take root. Join James Lindsay in this episode of the New Discourses Podcast to hear it straight from the sources and to understand more about how we got to where we are today.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 48 
Liberation Series, Part 4 of 4 

We live in Herbert Marcuse's world. In a previous series on the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay made that clearer than ever by reading through all of Marcuse's 1965 essay &quot;Repressive Tolerance&quot; (https://www.marcuse.org/herbert/publications/1960s/1965-repressive-tolerance-fulltext.html), which served as a basis for the strong double standard enjoyed by radical Leftism today (check out the first part in that series here: https://newdiscourses.com/2021/01/how-not-to-resolve-the-paradox-of-tolerance/). In this episode, Lindsay wraps up his four-part series reading through another of Marcuse's frightening essays, &quot;An Essay on Liberation.&quot; This fourth and final part of &quot;An Essay on Liberation&quot; (https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/marcuse/works/1969/essay-liberation.htm) focuses on the role of &quot;solidarity&quot; as the glue meant to hold together his new coalition for liberation, outlined in the first three parts of the essay. Understanding the works of Herbert Marcuse has never been more important.

In this episode, join James as he reads through the final (shortest) part of this essay and connects it to the features of today's clownish world, from Antifa and other radical activism to divisive identity politics to stakeholder capitalism and sustainability metrics. Learn what Marcuse envisioned for his New Left to bring into the world and how it has finally, after fifty years, begun to come to pass. Also, don't miss the other parts in this four-part series on this important and chilling essay: Part 1 (A Biological Foundation for Socialism: https://newdiscourses.com/2021/06/biological-foundation-socialism/), Part 2 (A New Sensibility: https://newdiscourses.com/2021/07/herbert-marcuses-new-sensibility/), and Part 3 (Subverting Forces in Transition: https://newdiscourses.com/2021/08/marcuses-subverting-forces-in-transition/).

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 47 

Systemic racism is said by Critical Race Theorists &quot;ordinary, not aberrational—'normal science,' the usual way society does business, the common, everyday experience of most people of color in this country.&quot; As such, virtually everything is systemically racist, from schools to the SAT to businesses to every policy they can think of to teachers to hobbies like walking, hiking, and being outside to books to birds, fish, and even rocks. Everything is systemically racist. Except one thing, we have now learned: vaccine passports. Despite the fact that vaccine passports, if implemented, will meet the Critical Race Theory definition of racist policy (which Ibram Kendi says is abominable and should be unconstitutional), this fact is not being trumpeted by Critical Race Theorists anywhere. In fact, those who have spoken publicly on the issue, like Nikole Hannah-Jones, have applauded the vax passes. Not only that, but Twitter is locking people out of their accounts and suspending people for sharing satirical memes pointing this fact out. Join James Lindsay in this episode of the New Discourses Podcast for a short discussion of this phenomenon and what it means. (Nota bene: It has come to our attention since the recording of this episode that the eviction moratorium is also strongly systemically racist by the Critical Race Theory definition and yet supported by the Leftist Regime, so there are at least two things that are not, in fact, systemically racist. Three if you count the destruction of black and Latino neighborhoods and black- and Latino-owned small businesses in the wake of the so-called &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; riots of 2020. Official word is that there is no pattern whatsoever to the strange exemptions from the list of what is systemically racist.)

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 46 
Liberation Series, Part 3 of 4 

The more one reads of Herbert Marcuse, the father of the New Left, the less there is to recommend his ideas and more there is to recommend learning about them. This is because thanks to the New Left that he spawned, we live in Herbert Marcuse's twisted world, which may now be in the early stages of collapse. This episode of the New Discourses Podcast features James Lindsay taking us through the third part in Marcuse's infamous 1969 essay, &quot;An Essay on Liberation&quot; (https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/marcuse/works/1969/essay-liberation.htm). In this part of the essay, Marcuse makes an argument for forging an alliance movement between the bourgeois Leftists students and intelligentsia in the universities and the minority and &quot;ghetto&quot; populations that were, at the time in their militancy movements, showing the necessary energy for revolution. Hear him make the case for the ends justifying the means for Leftist revolutionary movements among other shockers (spoiler: he indicates that his New Left movement should be driven by a refusal to grow up and get a job, for example, because attacking functioning, prosperous, free societies is a moral duty, including by refusing to participate). He even explicitly compares his own movement to what we now call &quot;Clownworld.&quot;

This episode of the New Discourses podcast is part three in a four-part series that reads through &quot;An Essay on Liberation.&quot;

Part 2: https://newdiscourses.com/2021/07/herbert-marcuses-new-sensibility/

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 45

Critical Theories are almost embarrassingly simple. There's almost nothing to them. A Critical Theory of anything can easily be made by one of two routes. One: Take an existing Critical Theory of something, substitute the domain-specific jargon of some other thing, and then publish. You're a genius revolutionizing (pun intended) your field! Two: Just understand the basic anatomy of a Critical Theory and do the same thing. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay walks you through the idea of a &quot;Critical Car Theory&quot; that challenges &quot;carnormativity&quot; to show you exactly how. It's simple. Choose something imperfect in the world that you'd like to complain about. Identify a politically actionable outcome you hope to achieve, probably a Leftist one. Blame everyone for incidences of the problem by thinking &quot;systemically&quot; and assign them moral complicity and responsibility for the problem you started with. Demand systemic change. Then close off all disagreement or questioning as an attempt to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot; of &quot;the system,&quot; which only an evil person who wants those problems to continue would do. That's it. That's the anatomy of a Critical Theory. Join James in this episode to hear how ridiculously simple and absurd it is so you can protect yourself from Critical Theories in other lines of thought.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 44
Liberation Series, Part 2 of 4

Herbert Marcuse is one of the most influential Leftist thinkers of the 1950s and 1960s, and for that reason he is often regarded as the father of the &quot;New Left,&quot; which is reaching something of a crescendo in the Woke Movement of today. His goal was straightforward: liberation. In 1969, he wrote an influential essay (or short book) called &quot;An Essay on Liberation&quot; in which he explains what liberation looks like and how we should achieve it. So that you can better understand the moment we find ourselves in, James Lindsay has been reading &quot;An Essay on Liberation&quot; (https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/marcuse/works/1969/essay-liberation.htm) for the New Discourses Podcast in full, with his explanation and commentary. This is the second part of that series, reading through part two of Marcuse's infamous essay, &quot;A New Sensibility.&quot;

In the first part of the essay, Marcuse lays out a case that we need to change mankind at the &quot;biological&quot; (meaning, it seems, mostly psychological and instinctual) level to make way for a liberated socialism. In this part of the essay, Marcuse explains that man will need to develop a &quot;new sensibility&quot; and even a &quot;new rationality&quot; (Critical Consciousness) in order to break the cycle of repression that he believes characterizes free, liberal societies (i.e., those that aren't Communism). His argument is that what people consider &quot;sensible&quot; constrains and represses their imagination, so a new (liberated, read: communistic) &quot;sensibility&quot; is needed and must replace the old sensibility. Then we will understand how sensibility and reason constrain and repress us and prevent previous (Communist and French) revolutions from succeeding at producing true liberation. It's a truly shocking piece of work, and it is obvious upon understanding it that its general thrust defines the ethos of radical Leftism today in the Critical Social Justice movements that have derived from it.

Part 1 of this series, &quot;A Biological Foundation for Socialism?&quot;, can be found here: https://newdiscourses.com/2021/06/biological-foundation-socialism/

Another series on Marcuse's work, featuring his essay &quot;Repressive Tolerance,&quot; begins here: https://newdiscourses.com/2021/01/how-not-to-resolve-the-paradox-of-tolerance/

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 43

What's happening in our schools? It's obvious to everyone that Critical Race Theory (and the other Theories of Critical Social Justice) have been incorporated into them at virtually every level and in most subjects all across the nation, but the line is that &quot;Critical Race Theory isn't being taught in our schools.&quot; To unpack this lie, we have to understand that Critical Theories require praxis, so while the formal and narrow theory of Critical Race Theory may not be being taught in specific, Critical Race Praxis (CRaP) is throughout our schools. It was brought in by Critical Pedagogy, which is the application of Critical Theory to education, which also requires the implementation of Theory, which is known as &quot;praxis.&quot; Once you understand this, it's far easier to understand one of the big reasons that (classical) liberals are so ineffective at fighting back against Critical Theories and other forms of Critical Philosophy: it's because they think the argument is about ideas rather than implementation. Praxis is the religious duty of Critical Theorists, and they can keep liberals busy arguing about whether or not the Theory should be taught or banned or not taught or not banned or its details or whatever other thing that doesn't matter while they still go forward applying Theory via praxis in whatever setting. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay breaks down the distinction and intrinsic relationship between Critical Theory and Critical Praxis and thus why almost the entire discussion of what to do about this problem coming from liberal quarters misses the point and remains ineffective. Join him here to learn where the target is and how to fight this pernicious ideology more effectively.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 42

Many of you will already be very familiar with the fact that the Woke manipulate language, often by meaning more than one thing by a term. One meaning will be quite milquetoast; the other quite radical. Much of Woke activism works by equivocating between these two meanings in a strategic way: boring everyday meanings to gain access and win arguments; specialized meanings to do their activism once they have the power. Among the words that the Woke have strategically manipulated in an important way is democracy. Of course, in nations like the United States and the other contemporary parliamentary democracies, we use democracy to enable republics, to which the Woke are generally strongly opposed. This isn't the only reason for their incessant push for &quot;democracy,&quot; though, which is only comprehensible when you understand the relationship between equity (or communism) and democracy. To the Woke, if anyone or any group has any more power, money, or privilege than anyone else (as they see it), there is no equality, thus democracy is skewed. That is, for them, democracy presupposes equity (or communism). In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay walks you through more pieces of the Woke, neo-Marxist, and Marxist literature to make the case that when the Woke are calling for &quot;democracy,&quot; they mean something that demands a very radical agenda along with it.

Critical Race Theory tries to bill itself as the continuation of the Civil Rights Movement, which was a true achievement of the American Experiment, but is it? Of course it's not (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/02/no-critical-race-theory-does-not-continue-the-civil-rights-movement/). To understand more about this, in this episode of my subscribers-only podcast, James Lindsay OnlySubs, I go through the first paragraph of Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic's Critical Race Theory: An Introduction (https://amzn.to/3zVLOOW) line by line and make it completely clear that Critical Race Theory rejects everything about America while mostly misrepresenting itself. Join me as I take a deep-dive into just what Critical Race Theory sees itself as rejecting.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 41

The Critical Theorist and neo-Marxist Herbert Marcuse was one of the most influential radical Leftist thinkers of the 20th century, and this fact is evident throughout his writing. The depth of his radicalism can be seen quite clearly in several of his essays, including his 1965 &quot;Repressive Tolerance&quot; (https://www.marcuse.org/herbert/publications/1960s/1965-repressive-tolerance-fulltext.html), which has been featured on the New Discourses Podcast before in a four-part series (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/01/how-not-to-resolve-the-paradox-of-tolerance/). It may stand out even more prominently in &quot;An Essay on Liberation&quot; (https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/marcuse/works/1969/essay-liberation.htm), written in 1969. In this longer essay, Marcuse lays out what he believes liberation requires, especially at the level of what he refers to as preconditions for that utopian possibility. In this four-part series, James Lindsay presents &quot;An Essay on Liberation&quot; with his commentary. In this first part of the series, he reads through the introduction to the essay and its first of four parts, &quot;A Biological Foundation for Socialism?&quot;, in which Marcuse makes the case that to achieve a liberated utopia, man will have to be changed at the level of his fundamental needs, his instincts, and his biology, and that this can be accomplished by making him live in a society that &quot;introjects&quot; a new critical morality into him. It's a truly alarming piece of work, and the resonances of it can definitely be felt today. Join James as he begins to explore this essay by Marcuse on the New Discourses Podcast.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 40

It is not normally appropriate to liken one's ideological opponents to something like a virus, but what should we do when the people who hold that ideology liken themselves to viruses like HIV, Ebola, and SARS? This circumstance may seem strange and unlikely, but it is exactly what we encounter with Critical Social Justice. In 2016, two feminist scholars, Breanne Fahs and Michael Karger, both of Arizona State University, published a bizarre academic paper doing exactly that. They called this paper &quot;Women's Studies as a Virus: Institutional Feminism, Affect, and the Projection of Danger&quot; (https://www.hipatiapress.com/hpjournals/index.php/generos/article/view/1683), and in it, they (almost unbelievably) characterize viruses like those named above and also cancer as an ideal metaphor for what their ideology hopes to accomplish and how it should do it. This has to be seen (or heard) to be believed, so in this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay reads through the entire paper, offering his commentary as he goes. Join him to hear this unbelievable characterization of Critical Social Justice (that is, Woke) ideology in its own words.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 39

One of the more peculiar features of the Theory of Critical Social Justice for many people is why it is acceptable under Theory to be trangender but absolutely forbidden to be transracial. The short answer to this question, which is sometimes given (usually after someone steps on the landmine of thinking they can pull off a transracial argument or identity), is that Critical Race Theory and Queer Theory approach the issue of identity differently. This is correct on a superficial level but facile to the way that the overarching Critical Social Justice ideology thinks about power and its interaction with identity. Understood more deeply, both Theories are doing the same thing in different ways. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay goes through all of this heavy Theoretical detail to explain why it is, from within Theory, that you can be transgender but not transracial. He then shifts to explain how and why these Theories likely developed the way that they did by investigating the proximate incentive structures that motivated their developments.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 38

At the heart of the &quot;Woke&quot; (Critical Social Justice) movement is the abuse of language, which is perpetrated in order to abuse power. Therefore, at the heart of the New Discourses project is a Critical Social Justice Encyclopedia, Translations from the Wokish (https://newdiscourses.com/translations-from-the-wokish/), that documents these abuses and helps to decode them so that everyday people won't be taken in by them. One of the projects taken up by James Lindsay and the New Discourses team with that Encyclopedia is to document the theoretical underpinnings of the Critical Social Justice ideology so that people can understand not just the words but also why they are given the particular distorted meanings they have.

In line with that, and because it is the heart of the &quot;Woke&quot; (Critical Social Justice) movement is the concept of Neo-Marxism, which is the school of thought brought to the world by (communist) people like György Lukács, Antonio Gramsci (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/01/antonio-gramsci-cultural-marxism-wokeness-leninism/), Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/01/how-not-to-resolve-the-paradox-of-tolerance/), and Angela Davis. It's almost impossible to understand the Woke ideology without understanding this precursor. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, join James Lindsay as he reads through and adds nuance and detail to the relevant &quot;neo-Marxism&quot; entry (https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-neo-marxism/) in his Critical Social Justice Encyclopedia so that you can better understand where Wokeness comes from and how it thinks and operates.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 37

Is Critical Race Theory Marxist, as many insist, or is it not? What is the relationship between Marxism, neo-Marxism (Critical Theory), and Wokeness? All three criticize one another, and yet all three have a great deal obviously in common. Is there some common underlying thread between these clearly similar yet obviously different worldviews? The answer is yes, and by tracing back to one of the most influential speculative idealist philosophers of the early 19th century, namely George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, we can gain a great deal of insight into how these decidedly leftist movements—the Marxist Old Left, the neo-Marxist New Left, and the intersectional Woke Left—share at least one deeper philosophical architecture in common. From Hegel, the Left since his time has, wittingly and not, adopted several of the pillars of Hegelian philosophy, these including his statism, historicism, and, much more importantly, his dialectical approach and metaphysical worldview. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay takes a long, deep dive into the ways that Hegel's philosophy is at the root of the entire &quot;Dialectical Left&quot; since, naming the dialectic the &quot;operating system&quot; of all activist Leftism since the early 1800s.

In this episode, Lindsay takes considerable time explaining Hegel's view of dialectical thought and then reveals in many examples, reaching up to the present day, how consistently the dialectic appears as the functional underpinning of Leftism ever since, at the latest, the 1830s. He makes the case that Leftism since Hegel thinks dialectically, moves dialectically, and applies dialectical thought not just to its targets but to everything, including itself and even its own dialectic. He then switches gears and explains how the dialectic is central to Hegel's underlying Hermetic (or alchemical) worldview and explains his mystical metaphysics so that this long arc of Leftist activism can be understood as evolving denominations within a single religious faith. With this theoretical groundwork laid, he then tackles how Hegel's historicism and statism arise as key features of his philosophy, with both of these characterizing activist Leftism up to the present day. Join him for his longest and most in-depth discussion yet, taking on how Hegel is a key progenitor of communism, liberationism, and ultimately Wokeness, how this philosophy must be understood so that it can be countered, and why it should be thought of in the same way that Hegel thought of it: as a religion in its own right, with its own notion of deity, metaphysical commitments, soteriology, and eschatology.

From Hegel, the Left since his time has, wittingly and not, adopted several of the pillars of Hegelian philosophy, these including his statism, historicism, and, much more importantly, his dialectical approach and metaphysical worldview. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay takes a long, deep dive into the ways that Hegel's philosophy is at the root of the entire &quot;Dialectical Left&quot; since, naming the dialectic the &quot;operating system&quot; of all activist Leftism since the early 1800s.

In this episode, Lindsay takes considerable time explaining Hegel's view of dialectical thought and then reveals in many examples, reaching up to the present day, how consistently the dialectic appears as the functional underpinning of Leftism ever since, at the latest, the 1830s. He makes the case that Leftism since Hegel thinks dialectically, moves dialectically, and applies dialectical thought not just to its targets but to everything, including itself and even its own dialectic. He then switches gears and explains how the dialectic is central to Hegel's underlying Hermetic (or alchemical) worldview and explains his mystical metaphysics so that this long arc of Leftist activism can be understood as evolving denominations within a single religious faith. With this theoretical groundwork laid, he then tackles how Hegel's historicism and statism arise as key features of his philosophy, with both of these characterizing activist Leftism up to the present day. Join him for his longest and most in-depth discussion yet, taking on how Hegel is a key progenitor of communism, liberationism, and ultimately Wokeness, how this philosophy must be understood so that it can be countered, and why it should be thought of in the same way that Hegel thought of it: as a religion in its own right, with its own notion of deity, metaphysical commitments, soteriology, and eschatology.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 36

Elite overproduction is a concept that was forwarded by the anthropologist Peter Turchin to attempt to explain some part of why we face growing social instability in today's society. This is an insightful concept that deserves serious consideration in our present circumstances. It is characterized by a society engaging in practices, like sending too many people to college or for advanced degrees, that create conditions for potential elites to end up underemployed and underaccomplished in the existing socioeconomic power structure of society, and it breeds resentment in this class of people. Indeed, it generates a bourgeoisie, which in turn generates social instability due to the overproliferation of their values and, eventually, ressentiment. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay walks through the idea of elite overproduction to focus in on the operant problem that it leads to, bourgeois overproduction, and posits that this problem is the seat of the Woke menace and many of the large-scale ills that have arisen in similar form over the past few centuries in prosperous societies. He also discusses the ways in which the Marxian characterization of the bourgeoisie was imprecise in a way that led to identifying something akin to this problem while misdiagnosing its true foundations (or his own role in it). Join him for a detailed discussion of this phenomenon.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 35

Not gonna lie, the title of this episode of the New Discourses Podcast is a bit of a bait-and-switch, so I hope it doesn't put you off. The thing is, there is a principled reason to be hesitant on the Covid-19 vaccine, and, far from positioning people as &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; for holding that position, it is perfectly reasonable and needs articulation. Put simply, it's this: people should have to be convinced, not coerced or forced, into accepting a vaccine into their bodies, especially under the conditions presented by Covid-19 and its vaccine. That is, the argument for getting vaccinated needs to be made, not merely assumed, and neither coercion nor force makes that argument. On the contrary, in fact, they diminish the ability to make the argument and thus increase vaccine hesitancy. Join James Lindsay in this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, in which he tries to articulate that principled argument for vaccine hesitancy and thus also the path away from it, should our institutional authorities want to achieve it.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 34

Society depends upon the people in it being able to rely upon expectations about how it and the other people in it will function. This requires a sense of what is and isn't reasonable. Some of this is, as the Woke contend, socially constructed, perhaps even partially arbitrary and up for debate. Much of it isn't. Wokeness doesn't agree, however. By having adopted a strict adherence to Critical Theory and the social constructivism of postmodernism, Wokeness rejects the entire idea that there is any such thing as a reasonable person or standard. In place of a sense of what is and isn't reasonable, the Woke ideology sees only one thing, its sole obsession: power. This is a catastrophe for society and the laws upon which a functioning society depends. Join James Lindsay in this episode of the New Discourses podcast to learn about the long history of unreason in Wokeness and even its all-out rejection of the notion that anyone or any position at all can be reasonable in any meaningful sense.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 33

Following in the footsteps of The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, he University of Texas, Austin, has initiated a campus-wide plan to force diversity, equity, and inclusivity into the administrative operation of the university, particularly in hiring, promotions, recognition, and awards. This is a bold step by the university administration in making the university functionally religious and, more importantly, unmaking the university as an educational institution. Of course, this isn't to pick on UT Austin. Most universities are doing the same thing to themselves now, much to our detriment as a society. So are most companies, schools, churches, and everything else. The ideas are shallow and functionally identical, so even if UT Austin isn't interesting to you, these kinds of plans are likely to be infecting something closer to your life.

In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay takes this jargon-heavy plan (http://bit.ly/UTAustinDEI) and reads through it, breaking it down so that people outside of the inner circle of UT Austin's diversicracy can make sense of what these plans entail. The short answer is an ideological reworking of the institution to make it into something it never should have been: a seminary to a new totalizing ideology that is taking over our society and poisoning our minds. Join Dr. Lindsay as he reads through this document and breaks down exactly why the requirements it entails amount to creating de facto discrimination, quotas in employment and advancement, and wholesale corruption that is to be enabled by a raft of expensive new equity commissars who add nothing of value to the institution.

If UT Austin is something close to your life, this might be especially alarming and informative to you, as it is setting itself on the same path that destroyed The Evergreen State College in 2017. If not, you'll still find much value in the discussion of this document because something approaching a facsimile is likely to be in place or in the works wherever you learn, work, or worship. James's goal in this episode of the podcast is to inform you about what these documents really entail wherever they arise.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 32

Wokeness exists in a crisis of authenticity. This is no surprise since both of its main philosophical predecessors, neo-Marxist Critical Theory and postmodernism, are both their own forms of reaction to a perceived crisis of authenticity in the world. For the postmodernists, the real is remote, inaccessible, and simulated. Meaning is infinitely deferred. Authenticity, which is to say being who you are when you're not attempting to be anyone, is passe and embarrassing, even as we crave it so much that the world itself needs to be done away with and replaced with raw experience. In Critical Theory, nothing is authentic because a consumerist society has already commodified, marketed, and sold it to us as a good life that doesn't exist and controls us. Wokeness inherits all of this cynical legacy and generates inauthentic identities doing inauthentic scholarship to achieve inauthentic political goals. In this sense, authenticity is a form of kryptonite against Wokeness because Wokeness can't abide or manipulate the authentic. Its deconstruction has no power over the truly and comfortably real.

But what is authenticity and how can you be more authentic? In this episode of the New Discourses podcast, join James Lindsay for a detailed discussion of the crisis of authenticity at the heart of the Woke project and its predecessors as well as a discussion of what it means to approach authenticity for yourself.

Authenticity, which is to say being who you are when you're not attempting to be anyone, is passe and embarrassing, even as we crave it so much that the world itself needs to be done away with and replaced with raw experience. In Critical Theory, nothing is authentic because a consumerist society has already commodified, marketed, and sold it to us as a good life that doesn't exist and controls us. Wokeness inherits all of this cynical legacy and generates inauthentic identities doing inauthentic scholarship to achieve inauthentic political goals. In this sense, authenticity is a form of kryptonite against Wokeness because Wokeness can't abide or manipulate the authentic. Its deconstruction has no power over the truly and comfortably real.

But what is authenticity and how can you be more authentic? In this episode of the New Discourses podcast, join James Lindsay for a detailed discussion of the crisis of authenticity at the heart of the Woke project and its predecessors as well as a discussion of what it means to approach authenticity for yourself.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 31

At the heart of communist and communistic thought is faith in a kind of historical trajectory toward utopia that's driven by social alchemy. There are many reasons why this fails in practice, but the simplest thing to say is that communism fails because communism doesn't know how communism will succeed. The fundamental belief driving communists is that once enough people become true believers that the communist utopia lies on the other side of certain social changes, a perfect society will manifest. How? Because they will. The details aren't meant to be known or told; they're meant to be figured out. This is in exact alignment with the historicism in Marx's dialectical materialism: once we get capitalism out of the way, we'll enter a worker-managed system (socialism) that can start figuring out how to make the state redundant to its purposes, at which point a stateless improvement of the same will emerge and the communist utopia (and end of History) will emerge. On this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay gives an example of how a contemporary police abolitionist activist has made almost exactly this same argument perfectly explicitly and walks you through how you can spot it for what it is. Join Lindsay for one of his more important discussions.

What is the end-game of the Woke ideology? It's a hard question to answer, mostly because it's hard to tell where it will stop, but a proximate answer to that question is easy and needs to be understood. The immediate goal of the Woke agenda is to turn everything into a Woke organ. That's it. This is more alarming than it may sound, however. You may be Catholic or Protestant, a scientist or a doctor, a rockclimber or a musician, but if the Woke agenda proceeds far enough, you will in time find yourself being a Woke person professing Wokeness in Catholic or Protestant language, or through science and medicine, or in rockclimbing and music. That is, the Woke agenda is to flatten all the variety out of life and make every aspect of life do one thing and one thing only: serve Theory. This means that Wokeness is a totalizing ideology and will lead to totalitarian outcomes unless we reject it and put a stop to its relentless takeover of our society and every aspect of our lives. Join James Lindsay on this latest episode of the New Discourses Podcast to dive more deeply into this alarming truth about Wokeness.

If we are fortunate enough to leave Wokeness and Critical Theory behind us, we need a map. We need to know what a post-Woke world would look like and, more importantly, which values will get us there. In a recent essay (https://newdiscourses.com/2021/03/values-post-woke-world/), James Lindsay presented four values he thinks are core to the establishment of a post-Woke world, which can repel Wokeness anywhere they are adopted. These are truth, beauty, liberty (thus responsibility), and merit. Join James in this episode of the New Discourses podcast, wherein he discusses why these are the right values as well as why we should hold the narrow way against other competitors in the space that will not produce results as good, including both the Very Smart &quot;respectability&quot; (blue pill) approach and the relatively hopeless &quot;post-liberal&quot; or &quot;neoreactionary&quot; approach (black pill, mostly).

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 28

The agriculturalist Trofim Lysenko should be a household name throughout the world in roughly the same way that Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, and Mao Zedong are or should be. That is, Lysenko shouldn't be known for his successes, which are none of his legacy, but for his catastrophic failure. He was the agriculturalist of the Soviet Union, first under Stalin, and his ideological biology (Lysenkoism) led directly to the deaths of tens of millions, first in the Soviet Union and then in Maoist China. Lysenkoism implied famine and mass death, and disputing Lysenkoism, despite its catastrophe, meant a trip to the gulag or a bullet in your head.

We should be aware of Lysenko because it is crucially important to understand how the ideological perversion of science, especially the biological sciences, can lead to catastrophes. In fact, if we were more aware of Trofim Lysenko and his legacy of death, we might be more cognizant of the threat we're currently stumbling our way into under the banners of &quot;antiracist medicine&quot; and &quot;health equity.&quot; These are the dawn of Medical Lysenkoism, which is a tragedy in the making, potentially on a grand scale, and this is already well underway.

The threat of Medical Lysenkoism is rapidly growing around us already, and we have to take it seriously and demand it be put to a halt. In this case, Critical Race Theory and its perverse doctrines of &quot;antiracism&quot; and &quot;equity&quot; are being leveraged to transform healthcare away from a science- and patient-oriented endeavor to an activist opportunity to &quot;level the playing field.&quot; Further, under the banner of &quot;health equity&quot; and Covid-19, our society's concerning lurch toward medical dictatorship (governed by this new &quot;equitable&quot; Medical Lysenkoism) is becoming the standard throughout our medical schools, hospitals, and research universities. This is a preventable catastrophe in the making.

In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, join James Lindsay as he reads through a recent essay (https://bostonreview.net/science-nature-race/bram-wispelwey-michelle-morse-antiracist-agenda-medicine) published in Boston Review outlining an advance in the &quot;health equity&quot; agenda wherein even racially preferential care is described as already being implemented and reparations are demanded at a major Boston-area teaching hospital affiliated with Harvard University.

There is a fair amount of criticism of my recent book Cynical Theories (https://amzn.to/3sEJF5X) (written with Helen Pluckrose) out there now, mostly from philosophers who aren't up to the task. It is both fair and correct to say that the book isn't perfect. Given their inability to criticize the book adequately, however, I decided to take matters into my own hands and am discussing the issue at length in this episode of the New Discourses Podcast. Join me to hear what I think of these philosophers' criticisms (not much!) and what a proper criticism of the work would look like (and why the book &quot;falls short&quot; in this way).

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 26

As most New Discourses fans will know, back in October 2018, James Lindsay, Peter Boghossian, and Helen Pluckrose burst onto the scene with a scandalous expose of Critical Social Justice scholarship within academia. This effort to show the world what was going on in the humanities and (to lesser extent) social sciences research literature was billed the &quot;Grievance Studies Affair&quot; (https://newdiscourses.com/2020/01/academic-grievance-studies-and-the-corruption-of-scholarship/), and the trio told their story in detail when the Wall Street Journal ended up breaking the story. The expose involved (https://leiterreports.typepad.com/files/project-summary-and-fact-sheet.pdf) their having written 20 academic papers in about 10 months and seeing 7 of those accepted, 4 published, and 1 (about dog sex) having received recognition for excellence in scholarship. A further 7 papers were still under consideration or revision, and it has been assessed that at least 4 of these would probably also have been accepted (and eventually published).

Among these papers, one very controversial example rewrote a chapter of Adolf Hitler's infamous book Mein Kampf (My Struggle) and was accepted for publication by the feminist social work journal Affilia (title: &quot;Our Struggle Is My Struggle: Solidarity Feminism as an Intersectional Reply to Neoliberal and Choice Feminism,&quot; available in full here, https://drive.google.com/file/d/18DoO44m2G5tvJcQaMdau6d8CSrdKDRBf/view). This paper has predictably garnered a great deal of attention and has been the center of much controversy, including recently in an article by the progressive Israeli magazine Haaretz, where Swedish &quot;Hitler expert&quot; Mikael Nilsson recently brought (https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-hitler-hoax-academic-wokeness-culture-war-1.9629759) the issue back up (dated March 21, 2021) two and a half years later. His objective was to discredit the entire Grievance Studies Affair by showing the infamous &quot;Feminist Mein Kampf&quot; paper to have been a fraud (and darling of &quot;right-wing&quot; nonsense). He even makes the argument that the paper rewrites the least bad part of Mein Kampf, which is easily revealed to be horrifically misguided and believable only by removing the relevant context of the chapter.

On this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay, who helped to write the paper and perpetrate the Grievance Studies Affair, talks about the project and the creation of this particular paper at unprecedented length and in unprecedented detail, revealing Nilssen not to know what he's talking about. If you have ever wondered about the backstory of the creation of the &quot;Feminist Mein Kampf&quot; paper really was, including why its authors did it, you won't want to miss this long-form discussion and rare response to yet another underinformed critic of Lindsay, Boghossian, and Pluckrose's work.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 25

In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay continues his abridged reading of  Kimberlé Crenshaw's famous (or infamous) paper, &quot;Mapping the Margins,&quot; which appeared in the Stanford Law Review in 1991. While not the birthplace of intersectionality, this paper is the first full-throated appeal for its application, not just in the world but also in the movements from which it was born: radical feminism and black liberationism. 

In part 1 of this series, James read the introduction to the paper, wherein he claims the Woke One Ring was forged to form one model of systemic oppression to rule them all: intersectionality, by which all the radical and civil rights movements were ensnared and brought under the dominion of postmodern neo-Marxist thought. Here, in part 2, James reads through the conclusion of &quot;Mapping the Margins&quot; and illustrates exactly how Crenshaw's ideas will achieve the complete subordination and redirection of all leftist, left-wing, and civil-rights thought.

This episode of the New Discourses podcast is the second part of a two-part series reading an abridged version of Crenshaw's &quot;Mapping the Margins.&quot; You can find Part 1 here: https://newdiscourses.com/2021/03/forging-woke-one-ring-kimberle-crenshaws-mapping-margins/

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 24

&quot;Mapping the Margins,&quot; by Kimberlé Crenshaw, is an academic law paper that changed the world (abridged pdf here). It was published in the Stanford Law Review in 1991 and makes the case for putting intersectionality into all cultural analysis. It is also more or less unambiguously the birthplace of Wokeness, as in this paper, Crenshaw indicates explicitly that, to her, intersectionality is &quot;a provisional concept linking contemporary politics with postmodern theory,&quot; that is, as Jordan Peterson has it, postmodern neo-Marxism. Crenshaw is no minor figure, by the way. She is the creator of intersectionality as well as the co-creator (with her mentor Derrick Bell) and namer of Critical Race Theory. This paper is, in all likelihood, by far her most influential.

In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay reads through the introduction to &quot;Mapping the Margins&quot; and offers his commentary on the paper and its role as the birthplace (though not gestation) of the Woke movement and, as he and Helen Pluckrose named it in Cynical Theories, applied postmodernism. It is in this paper that intersectionality became the Woke One Ring, which would bring all of the other aspects of identity politics and Critical Theory under the dominion of one mode of analysis from which they cannot deviate. Join him as he reads through the text of the paper and explains what Crenshaw means, where she is coming from, and where she intends for this idea to go.

This episode of the New Discourses podcast is the first part of a two-part series reading an abridged version of Crenshaw's &quot;Mapping the Margins.&quot;

Aufheben is a German word that, in Critical Theory, means to &quot;abolish&quot; or to &quot;negate&quot; in the way that Critical Theorists do. It's a somewhat complicated term in that it means both to abolish and to keep or to keep safe, and the Critical Theory use taps into the so-called dialectical process to attempt to use aufheben to tear apart and, as the Marxists translated it, &quot;sublate&quot; whatever cultural artifact they are targeting onto a &quot;higher&quot; level of understanding, namely the one that empowers Critical Theorists and induces misery in everyone else. This process was widely pushed by the Critical Theorists of the Frankfurt School under a doctrine of Aufheben der Kultur, abolishment of culture, and it continues in the Woke movement today.

One of the latest big targets of Aufheben der Kultur is Dr. Seuss and his wide body of popular children's literature. Why? Because of its success. Seuss becomes a cultural anchor point for hundreds of millions of children and adults, and by tainting Seuss, his legacy, and your own memories of him with accusations of racism and &quot;harm,&quot; they can abolish that shared cultural anchor and make more room to advance their own agenda, in which every text is &quot;decolonized&quot; and geared to indoctrinate you and your children into Critical Theory, especially Critical Race Theory. Join James Lindsay in this episode of the New Discourses Podcast to dig into the Critical Dr Seuss academic literature to see where this Aufheben der Dr Seuss comes from and how it works.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 22

Critical Race Theorists like to claim that they have inherited and continue the noble legacy and justice work of the Civil Rights Movement, but this is an abject lie. In this episode of James Lindsay OnlySubs, my subscribers-only podcast, I take about half an hour to make the case definitively that, while they are content to portray this illusion, it is a grotesque distortion of reality, using their own words. By exploring the book Critical Race Theory: An Introduction (https://amzn.to/3rzYANN), by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic (Delgado is something of a founder of Critical Race Theory) and the paper &quot;Mapping the Margins&quot; (https://sites.oxy.edu/ron/csp19/readings/mappingmargins-crenshawwilliams.pdf) by Kimberlé Crenshaw, who is regarded as one of the true founders of CRT and the founder of intersectionality, the case against the Woke claim on the Civil Rights Movement is easily and definitively made.

      <description>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 22

Critical Race Theorists like to claim that they have inherited and continue the noble legacy and justice work of the Civil Rights Movement, but this is an abject lie. In this episode of James Lindsay OnlySubs, my subscribers-only podcast, I take about half an hour to make the case definitively that, while they are content to portray this illusion, it is a grotesque distortion of reality, using their own words. By exploring the book Critical Race Theory: An Introduction (https://amzn.to/3rzYANN), by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic (Delgado is something of a founder of Critical Race Theory) and the paper &quot;Mapping the Margins&quot; (https://sites.oxy.edu/ron/csp19/readings/mappingmargins-crenshawwilliams.pdf) by Kimberlé Crenshaw, who is regarded as one of the true founders of CRT and the founder of intersectionality, the case against the Woke claim on the Civil Rights Movement is easily and definitively made. Join me to hear the details and the argument!  -James

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 21

In 1945, even as the Nazis fell from power, Karl Popper told us how to find the line where free, liberal societies are in imminent danger in his book The Open Society and Its Enemies, most simply summarizing a crucial part of the argument in a short footnote about &quot;The Paradox of Tolerance.&quot; There, Popper lays out a short summary of when a free society should and must not tolerate intolerant movements if it is to survive. It is not only when they espouse and preach intolerance but when they also cease to be amenable to reason and rational debate, forbid their followers from listening to reason and rational debate, cannot be held in check by public opinion, and encourage their followers to respond to arguments with &quot;fists or pistols,&quot; i.e., violence of some form or another. I contend that the Woke, uniquely, have crossed this line in this episode of the New Discourses Podcast. They are absolutely intolerant, will not debate or listen to alternative perspectives, and, unlike all other hate movements that fail those two criteria, have grown to be completely unchecked and uncheckable by public opinion. This places them outside of the range to which tolerance should be extended in free, open societies, and it identifies them uniquely as a threat to their continuance. Join me to hear my argument for how Karl Popper warned us in 1945 so that we might see this situation when it arose.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 20
Repressive Tolerance Series, Part 4 of 4

In this fourth and final part of his four-part lecture series about &quot;Repressive Tolerance,&quot; James Lindsay takes the reader from the darkest point of the essay, which was the exciting climax of Part 3, through the end of Marcuse's argument. In this part, Marcuse dedicates the rest of the original 1965 essay to explaining why it is him and people like him (that is, Critical Theorists) who get to decide what constitutes good violence and bad violence, truth and falsity, liberating tolerance from the kind that must not be tolerated and must be suppressed. In our own time, it is the Woke and the high-powered elites in government, media, education, and law who have taken up this mantle of being able to decide, in the spirit of Herbert Marcuse, what must be tolerated, no matter how bad it is, and what must be suppressed, no matter how legitimate it is. The parallels to our own time are undeniable, and, as Lindsay has claimed throughout, the unavoidable conclusion is that we live in the asymmetric and totalitarian logic of &quot;Repressive Tolerance&quot; today.

The second half of this episode leaves the essay itself and dives into a postscript to the original essay that Marcuse added three years later, in 1968, after the logic of his essay had already caused innumerable riots and episodes of civil unrest at the end of that tumultuous and transformational decade. In exploring this postscript, we see Marcuse sticking to his guns, but we also see just how blatantly obvious it is that his repressive tolerance has become the monster it sought to slay, which sheds considerable light upon what some people are now calling &quot;the Great Realignment&quot; in our societies, cultures, and politics.

Repressive Tolerance Series, Part 3 of 4

In this third part of James Lindsay's lecture series on Herbert Marcuse's &quot;Repressive Tolerance,&quot; we see how the essay takes a particularly dark turn. Having set up the framing of the essay in the first part and explaining the condition of the &quot;administered society&quot; in the second, Marcuse now turns to answering the question of what a Repressive Tolerance should look like, including what it must suppress and what it must tolerate, including the sorts of violence and extralegal behaviors it must tolerate. The statement, which we arrive at near the end of this part, is simple, in Marcuse's own words: &quot;Liberating tolerance, then, would mean intolerance against movements from the Right and toleration of movements from the Left.&quot; In this part of the lecture series, Lindsay walks the listener through the darker part of Marcuse's argument to show how he arrives at this blatantly biased and ridiculous conclusion that has set the stage for the totalitarianism we see today in Wokeness and from Big Tech.

Repressive Tolerance Series, Part 2 of 4  

In this second part of his annotated reading of Marcuse's &quot;Repressive  Tolerance,&quot; James Lindsay reads and explains the portion of the essay  where Marcuse defines the &quot;administered society&quot; that he claims we live  in. The listener will find striking parallels to today's world, which  certainly qualifies as the type of &quot;administered society&quot; far more  accurately than the world that Marcuse inhabited in the 1960s when he  wrote the essay, but paradoxically, or ironically, because it adopts the  logic of this very essay as justification for its administration! This  part of the series, then, raises particularly interesting questions  about whether or not Marcuse would support the fruits of his own work  and thus sheds interesting light on the problem we currently find  ourselves in. It sets the stage for answering at the end of the series  how we might go about solving this problem while avoiding the mistake  Marcuse plainly made.

Repressive Tolerance Series, Part 1 of 4

We live in a crazy world today that seems to have gone off the rails.  That's because it is being driven by a broken logic, and, for all the  flaws on the right, that broken logic is centered in the  no-longer-tolerant left. The logic of the left today is overwhelmingly  rooted in a single essay published in 1965 by the neo-Marxist  philosopher Herbert Marcuse. That essay is &quot;Repressive Tolerance.&quot; The  thesis statement of this essay can be boiled down to &quot;movements from the  left must be extended tolerance, even when they are violent, while  movements from the right must not be tolerated, including suppressing  them by violence.&quot; This asymmetric ethic has been the heart and soul of  left politics in the West since the 1960s, and we're living in the fruit  of that catastrophe now.

To help people understand this vitally important and intrinsically  totalitarian essay and its relevance to our present moment, James Lindsay walks the listener through Marcuse's &quot;Repressive Tolerance&quot; in a  four-part lecture series. In this series, he reads the essay in full  and attempts to make clear how it is the logic underlying the present  moment. The goal is to explain the essay as Marcuse would have  understood it, in his own context, and to show how his own logic has  become dominant and the monster that he believed he was fighting.

In the first part, Lindsay begins by framing the Frankfurt School of  Critical Theory to give background on Marcuse. He also explains that  Marcuse seems to be attempting to give a solution to Karl Popper's  famous &quot;Paradox of Tolerance,&quot; which was provided as an aside in his  1945 book The Open Society and Its Enemies, which analyzed how fascism  can arise and overtake liberal societies. Marcuse's answer to this  conundrum is that a &quot;discriminating tolerance,&quot; a &quot;liberating  tolerance,&quot; must be practiced that offers favoritism to the left and  actively suppresses the right, as he defines them (from a perspective of  Critical Theory). Join Lindsay as he contextualizes and then brings the  first portion of this essay to life, and stay tuned for Parts 2, 3, and  4 to come!

      <description>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 17
Repressive Tolerance Series, Part 1 of 4

We live in a crazy world today that seems to have gone off the rails.  That's because it is being driven by a broken logic, and, for all the  flaws on the right, that broken logic is centered in the  no-longer-tolerant left. The logic of the left today is overwhelmingly  rooted in a single essay published in 1965 by the neo-Marxist  philosopher Herbert Marcuse. That essay is &quot;Repressive Tolerance.&quot; The  thesis statement of this essay can be boiled down to &quot;movements from the  left must be extended tolerance, even when they are violent, while  movements from the right must not be tolerated, including suppressing  them by violence.&quot; This asymmetric ethic has been the heart and soul of  left politics in the West since the 1960s, and we're living in the fruit  of that catastrophe now.

To help people understand this vitally important and intrinsically  totalitarian essay and its relevance to our present moment, James Lindsay walks the listener through Marcuse's &quot;Repressive Tolerance&quot; in a  four-part lecture series. In this series, he reads the essay in full  and attempts to make clear how it is the logic underlying the present  moment. The goal is to explain the essay as Marcuse would have  understood it, in his own context, and to show how his own logic has  become dominant and the monster that he believed he was fighting.

In the first part, Lindsay begins by framing the Frankfurt School of  Critical Theory to give background on Marcuse. He also explains that  Marcuse seems to be attempting to give a solution to Karl Popper's  famous &quot;Paradox of Tolerance,&quot; which was provided as an aside in his  1945 book The Open Society and Its Enemies, which analyzed how fascism  can arise and overtake liberal societies. Marcuse's answer to this  conundrum is that a &quot;discriminating tolerance,&quot; a &quot;liberating  tolerance,&quot; must be practiced that offers favoritism to the left and  actively suppresses the right, as he defines them (from a perspective of  Critical Theory). Join Lindsay as he contextualizes and then brings the  first portion of this essay to life, and stay tuned for Parts 2, 3, and  4 to come!

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 16

If you want to understand the present moment, especially how similar Wokeness seems to Mao's Cultural Revolution, you have to understand the  Italian communist Antonio Gramsci. Gramsci wrote a series of essays and  books while imprisoned by the Italian fascists in the 1920s and 1930s  that are referred to as his Prison Notebooks. These are the birthplace  of Cultural Marxism, which James Lindsay argues has evolved into &quot;Identity Marxism&quot; since. Once you understand Gramsci, you can easily  understand what is going on with our society at present and understand  more clearly than ever why it must be resisted. 

Though he didn't coin the term, the idea fellow communist Rudi Dutschke would name &quot;the long march through the institutions&quot; in 1967 is  ultimately Gramsci's roadmap to getting communism to take hold in the West. Gramsci identifies that the &quot;cultural hegemony&quot; of Western  cultures prevented communism from having any chance of taking root, so  he recommended a strategy that seeks to tear apart and capture major  cultural institutions, including religion, family, education, media, and  law. Mao understood this clearly and used it to devastating effect. The  same thing is happening throughout the West today. Join James Lindsay  as he explains the thought and relevance of Antonio Gramsci in today's  Woke movement, which he aptly brands &quot;Leninism 4.0.&quot;

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 15

We are witnessing the birth of a new national mythology in America, and it is not good news. Imperfect as it was, the old one was better, warts and all, and it needs to be fought for. This new mythology turns the story of America on its head, positioning it not as having been born in the pursuit of freedom and liberty in 1776 but in slavery and evil in 1619. It has mainstreamed itself since the 1960s but especially over the last five years as it used Trump's presidency as a foil to legitimize its pseudo-real description of America for millions, and now it has gained the beginnings of cultural hegemony (which it is already abusing). This magic narrative has been and remains the key to their power.

This new mythology is using its own narrative about Trump's presidency and, especially, the events that took place at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, as a pivotal moment in its story arc, where it finally gained the upper hand on more than 400 years of evil and could usher in a new world order based on equity, guaranteed by the &quot;perfected&quot; state apparatus and its corporate partners (especially in tech). The thing is, while the real American story genuinely is the story of freedom, this new alternative, of &quot;liberation,&quot; is based not in truth but in alchemy, and like all such regimes, it will therefore end in catastrophe. Lead, as it sees our history, cannot be changed into gold, as it views our future through its manic utopian lenses, and drinking potions of cinnabar will not make people live forever but will slowly poison them into madness.

Join James Lindsay as he tries to make sense of the events we have been watching unfold over the last few days and years, relying in an unexpected way, if you'll believe it, on the postmodern philosophers who in some ways saw this danger first.

      <itunes:summary>The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay - Episode 14

In a recent long-form essay on New Discourses (https://newdiscourses.com/2020/12/psychopathy-origins-totalitarianism/), James Lindsay explained the origins of totalitarianism in a single word: psychopathy. There, he explained that totalitarianism arises from people who cannot cope with reality as it is, and yet who are content to manipulate others, constructing a &quot;pseudo-reality&quot; in service to a vision of the world that serves their needs. That pseudo-reality holds as its North Star a Utopian vision that aligns with artificial resolutions to their inability to cope with reality as it is, and it thereby attracts others who have similar issues. By constructing a false logic (a paralogic) and a false morality (a paramorality) to define and enforce the pseudo-reality, they can gather supporters in a cult-like fashion. In the end, those ensnared lose the ability to distinguish reality and pseudo-reality almost entirely and become functionally psychopathic, and if they gain enough social, cultural, economic, and political power, they can hold hostage entire societies that are, in effect, on the march to totalitarianism and, eventually, total catastrophic collapse.

The essay is an important read, but it is also a difficult one. In this episode of the New Discourses podcast, James seeks to explain the essay in easier language and to flesh out its ideas one by one. He sees this process of unpacking the essay as his next major work, and in this podcast, he begins the process of linking the concept of &quot;ideological pseudo-reality&quot; to more familiar examples, not least Wokeness. Critical Race Theory, for example, is a pseudo-reality that positions racism as the ordinary state of affairs in society, not an immoral aberration from them. Queer Theory is a pseudo-reality in which being normal with regard to sex, gender, and sexuality is a problem while being in some way deviant (which is not the same as being gay or even trans) is elevated as normal. Communism is a pseudo-reality that deems socially engineered command economies as effective and efficient ways to maximize human flourishing. Covid-19 is a pseudo-reality built to enact control around a genuine and serious virus called SARS-CoV-2. These topics and more are presented in this episode of the New Discourses podcast to help people understand and, hopefully, able to see reality for itself again.

      <itunes:summary>Human beings think in stories. We understand ourselves and the world, societies, social groups, and contexts we live in that way. One type of story is a national story, and in this episode of the New Discourses podcast, James Lindsay makes the case that Americans have, by and large, forgotten the totality of their own story. This has happened by placing too much focus and too much emphasis on one valuable and important part of the American story, which is equality. All men are, in fact, created equal, at least so far as liberal ethics should understand men, but this part of the American story exists in some tension with the other parts, especially the liberty part of the story, which is threatened by an overemphasis on equality in the same way that equality is threatened by an overemphasis on liberty. The truth is, even on a perfectly equal playing field, liberty will produce unequal outcomes because people will behave in unequal ways, and this form of inequality of outcome is just, even if inequality of opportunity isn't.

In this podcast, Lindsay argues that Americans have mistaken the equality part of their story for the whole story, and in that the equality part of their story has been largely but not perfectly fulfilled, Americans now find themselves retelling the story in ever more tendentious ways, including Critical Social Justice. That is, Americans, in seeking to understand themselves against their own story, which they have misunderstood, are telling a kind of genre fiction on the equality story, trying to resurrect its themes in new ways to give themselves meaning and personal and social context. The Critical Social Justice, or Woke, story is comprehensible as a certain type of genre fiction on the equality portion of the American story, one that inverts the very values it claims to espouse in the pursuit not of further equality but of equity, which is a type of enforced equality of outcomes, regardless of behavior, talent, and merit.

In the end Lindsay urges Americans to remember the totality of their story: liberty and equality in balance with one another, government with the consent of the governed, and a place, at least one place in the world, where these values can be kept alive. The American story has not been fulfilled, although it is not necessarily clear what its next chapters are. This podcast hopes to start finding the next parts of the American story. In that, Lindsay urges that Americans today are called to be keepers of the flame of liberty in a society that values and has, in largest part, achieved equality. They are also encouraged to offer their balanced model of federalism and anti-federalism, individual and national sovereign liberty, in this case, to the world as globalism increases with technology. Should the world refuse, Americans should not turn their backs on their story but should, instead, keep the flame of Americanism burning bright for any who should want it.

In the end Lindsay urges Americans to remember the totality of their story: liberty and equality in balance with one another, government with the consent of the governed, and a place, at least one place in the world, where these values can be kept alive. The American story has not been fulfilled, although it is not necessarily clear what its next chapters are. This podcast hopes to start finding the next parts of the American story. In that, Lindsay urges that Americans today are called to be keepers of the flame of liberty in a society that values and has, in largest part, achieved equality. They are also encouraged to offer their balanced model of federalism and anti-federalism, individual and national sovereign liberty, in this case, to the world as globalism increases with technology. Should the world refuse, Americans should not turn their backs on their story but should, instead, keep the flame of Americanism burning bright for any who should want it.

      <itunes:summary>We live in an era of unprecedented pressure for ideologically based organizational trainings: anti-racist, racial sensitivity, unconscious bias, cultural awareness, and, perhaps most commonly, some combination of &quot;diversity, equity, and inclusion.&quot; We're also rapidly waking up to the fact that in this era, the basic terminology describing and informing these training programs cannot be trusted to mean what it seems to on its face. What's needed, then, is clarity around these terms and these ideas. In this episode of the New Discourses podcast, James Lindsay walks the listener through the concepts of &quot;diversity,&quot; &quot;equity,&quot; and &quot;inclusion&quot; so that listeners can understand what these terms mean in the context of the Critical Social Justice ideology and thus be better informed to deal with their infiltration into our organizations.

      <itunes:summary>We have to talk about 2+2. Unfortunately. Most unfortunately. This is because what looks like a simple and profoundly stupid Twitter fight must be understood in the full context in which it is playing out. This context is, in fact, the most important and least reported part of the origin story of the Great 2+2 War of 2020, and few realize that this ridiculous discourse didn't come out of a vacuum. It arose in reaction to something James Lindsay posted on Twitter, as has been reported, but more specifically it is the product of a Washington State Ethnic Studies program director, Shraddha Shirude, jumping into that fray with a request to make 2+2=5 &quot;into a true statement&quot; in order to defend her Ethnic Studies education program in that state (and beyond). This &quot;ethnomathematics&quot; program has deep ties into the academic literature within the critical study of mathematics education and is now currently being implemented in Washington and may spread to California and New York soon, and from there, beyond. It is also part of a deliberate attempt to destabilize our ability to identify and name objective truths so that the activists pushing these agendas cannot be criticized and so they can advance their agendas unimpeded. Join James Lindsay on the New Discourses podcast for a deep, sometimes emotional dive into the real story of the 2+2 discourse.

      <title>The Evolution Of Postmodern Thought | Helen Pluckrose</title>

      <itunes:summary>Helen Pluckrose develops the definition of &quot;Social Justice&quot; as it is used in the academic literature in this tradition, explains its connections to identity politics and the political correctness movement, and then shows the relevance of the original postmodernists to this Theory in some detail. She does this to elegantly describe the progression of these ideas from Theory to activism to the streets by describing how these ideas originated, evolved, and were built upon by successive generations of Theorists leading up to those who have become famous names even outside of the scholarly world today: for examples, Peggy McIntosh, Barbara Applebaum, and Robin DiAngelo. She wraps up by explaining how this newest generation of Theorists simplified the highly abstract ideas of their predecessors and made it far clearer and easier to understand so that it could, as we now see all around us, eventually go mainstream.

      <itunes:summary>In my line of work taking on Critical Social Justice and other forms of increasingly dominant societal insanity, I get asked a lot of questions. If there's one question I'm asked more often than any other, it's how don't I go crazy looking at this stuff every day? To be fair, I've flown pretty close to that sun, but I didn't fall in, and so I've reflected quite a bit on it. I thought it might help people to spell out some of the answer. -James Lindsay

      <title>Stealing the Motte: Critical Social Justice and the Principle of Charity</title>

      <itunes:summary>There is a rhetorical strategy called the “motte and bailey” that is getting increasingly famous lately. This is because it is one of the central tools of the Critical Social Justice movement. In that strategy, named after a kind of castle, a highly defensible “motte” position, like “we just want to treat people more fairly,” is maintained while also pushing a more radical “bailey” position, like “we need to radically remake our school systems so that no one can fail.” Activists advance the bailey and, when pressed on it, retreat to the motte until scrutiny and pressure go away, at which point they return to the bailey.

In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, your host James Lindsay explores the principle of charity in debate and dialogue in the context of the motte-and-bailey rhetorical strategy. His goal is to explain how the game of critical theories is not the same game the rest of us play in broadly liberal societies. In fact, the critical game seeks to disrupt and dismantle the liberal game and replace it with its own. Exploiting the principle of charity is one of the most common ways it can achieve this.

In this long-form, flowing discussion of the phenomenon, Lindsay breaks down several recent examples of Critical Social Justice activists playing a completely different game than our own. He then illustrates how the principle of charity is exploited by Critical Social Justice advocates, who get us to build their castle for them and then use it to advance their radical, disruptive agendas. He explains that what’s needed in answer to this insidious critical game is to use the principle of charity to steal their motte and then trenchant, informed criticism to bomb their bailey every time.

      <itunes:summary>On this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, your host James Lindsay explores the concept of political regimes through American history. From Washington, to Lincoln, to Roosevelt, right up through W and Obama, the “US of A” has seen a broad spectrum of political ideals displayed under the common framework known as “Modernity.” But where are we now? Considering the rise of Trump, the media's explicit bias, and the prevalence of critical social justice theory throughout culture, Lindsay suggests that America may have moved into a new Postmodern Regime: a regime that is making us wonder how we can tell what's true anymore.

      <itunes:summary>Critical Social Justice operates like a virus. I’ve said it about them; they say it about themselves; we’re all in agreement. It infects liberal institutions and liberal-minded people (philosophically speaking, whether on the left, right, or center), perverts “critical” as in “critical thinking” into “critical” as in “critical theory,” which means something completely different. It then turns those institutions and individuals into woke cells that produce more Critical Social Justice and spread it to others, hollowing out the institutions and organizations it infects as it goes.

Is that true, though? Won’t most of us “regress to the mean,” as it’s sometimes phrased, as we move forward and get this crisis in our rearview mirror? I think we will, more or less, and I think we need to remember that.

      <itunes:summary>New Discourses convened in October of 2019 in the National Liberal Club of London for a day-long conference titled Speaking Truth to Social Justice. There, Portland State University philosophy professor Peter Boghossian gave a rousing talk about the need to “speak truth in the face of danger,” parrhesia, as the Ancient Greeks called it, as this applies to Critical Social Justice.

      <description>New Discourses convened in October of 2019 in the National Liberal Club of London for a day-long conference titled Speaking Truth to Social Justice. There, Portland State University philosophy professor Peter Boghossian gave a rousing talk about the need to “speak truth in the face of danger,” parrhesia, as the Ancient Greeks called it, as this applies to Critical Social Justice.

      <itunes:summary>Dr. James Lindsay in his talk, “The Truth About Critical Methods,” makes very clear that Critical Social Justice is not the same thing as social justice. He argues that the branding of social justice, which is how Critical Social Justice promotes itself, misleads people about the nature of that movement.

      <itunes:summary>In February, I discovered an article on Twitter about “decolonizing graphic design,” published in the summer of last year. These sorts of articles are incredibly useful for showing exactly what’s going on in the Critical Social Justice mindset once you know how to read them, and this one doesn’t disappoint. After quickly threading about the article on Twitter to show it and explain it to my followers, I grabbed my microphone for an impromptu discussion of what I read.

      <title>Satire in the Digital Age | Andrew Doyle</title>

      <itunes:summary>In October of 2019, a small group of genuinely liberal-minded people gathered together for a day of speeches, panels, and community in the Gladstone Library in the National Liberal Club of London. The conference had a title that succinctly described its purpose: Speaking Truth to Social Justice. Over the course of the day, even as the Extinction Rebellion protest raged outside just a block away, we gave seven talks and held two panel discussions, all with the intention of recovering and restating genuine liberalism in this unique era of history, where it faces unique threats.

Last to speak in the evening was our good friend Andrew Doyle, a comedian and satirist most famous for his excellent work with the satirical faux-Woke Twitter account Titania McGrath. In his brilliant and hilarious talk, Doyle provides a worthy and robust defense of both free speech and free thought. He does so by explaining the long history of satire and satirical hoaxes and their applications against unjust power. These, he reminds us, are necessary anywhere power over-asserts itself, especially in censorship, not just to deflate scolds we tend to associate with the right but also those who have arisen recently on the left, before ending with a twist: revealing that he, too, (maybe…, and that’s beside his point) has contributed to this sometimes-necessary tradition.
