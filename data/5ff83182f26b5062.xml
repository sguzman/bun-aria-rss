      <description><![CDATA[<p>Musician <a href="https://mariancall.com">Marian Call</a> appeared on New Disruptors back in October 2013. Her home was in Alaska, but she spent a lot of time away from it touring. With six more years under her belt, she’s trying to stick closer to her community in Juneau. One of the reasons? Her husband Pat Race, an illustrator, gallery owner, videographer, filmmaker, and part-time adult camp operator.</p>
<p>We talk about their independent careers and where both find themselves—besides in Alaska—and how they converge and diverge with their work. Also, we learn just how hopping a town Juneau is for creative people!</p>
<p>Marian on the universe of entertainment now available and what we contend for as artists: “I can’t place too many demands on people’s attention knowing they have all the options in the world.”</p>

<p><a href="https://cwandt.com/">CW&amp;T is Che-Wei Wang and Taylor Levy</a>. They combine art, technology, design, and manufacture into everyday objects that have nothing everyday about them, as well as unique expressions of industrial design that can’t be compared with anything else. In this episode, we talk about one of their latest endeavors, <a href="https://cwandt.com/products/time-since-launch?variant=19682206089275">Time Since Launch</a>, a single-use launch clock that counts indefinitely into the future.</p>
<p>I first <a href="https://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/2/27/episode-12">spoke to Che-Wei and Taylor in 2013</a> about the Pen Type-A, their first highly funded project and one that had a lot of complexity. They <a href="https://newdisrupt.org/blog/11/14/actually-quite-likely-recorded-live-in-dumbo">appeared with me on stage at the Nearly Impossible conference</a> with other makers later that year to talk more broadly about creating. (You can now purchase both <a href="https://cwandt.com/products/pen-type-a">Pen Type-A</a> and <a href="https://cwandt.com/products/pen-type-b">Pen Type-B</a>.)</p>
<p>Six years later, the couple has completed dozens of projects of different scales and natures, moved from New York to Massachusetts and back again, and 3D printed two humans.</p>

Benn tells us about his grandfather's literal study (in his house) and his study (his work). (Eugene Bollay <a href="https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/archives%3A8208">recorded an oral history</a> back in 1987.)</p>
<p>Benn was always struck that his grandfather was seen and respected as a person of science. This helped lead him on his path as a programmer, entrepreneur, and researcher, currently pursuing directions in AI at the Paul Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode is recorded live at <a href="https://glowforge.com/about-us">Glowforge</a>, makers of a 2D laser cutter—but it’s not a sponsored episode and we don’t talk about the hardware much at all. Instead, it’s conversation about what people are trying to make and how to get started as a creator.</p>
<p>I talk with Glowforge founder (and my friend) Dan Shapiro, and the company’s two content designers, Shell Meggersee and Nick Taylor, who spend a lot of their time talking to new and experienced makers as they work with their laser equipment. They offer some great insight and a lot of encouragement.</p>
<p>A few lovely quotes that struck me on listening to the recording afterwards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nick: “I wonder if we’re teaching them how to fail gracefully, rather than how to be successful?”</li>
<li>Shell: “There’s some subtle psychology in the fact that, ‘Oh, the machine messed up! Oops! It wasn’t me!’”</li>
<li>Dan: “Tools that help you become an amateur are so wonderful…it gets you to that point where you have some small degree of self-sufficiency and creativity.”</li>
</ul>
<p>(Glowforge <em>did</em> sponsor an episode earlier in the current season; this episode was entirely my idea and no money changed hands. However, if you’re thinking about buying a Glowforge, <a href="https://glowforge.us/r/6KYGS">you can use this referral link</a> and get $100 to $500 off purchase price depending on the model. I receive the same amount as a referral fee, which helps support the podcast.)</p>

<p><em>Shell Meggersee</em> has worked in film, TV and video games, bringing everything from giant 3D monsters to well-known cartoon characters to life. At night, you might find her designing anything from vinyl toys to couture bedding fabric to intricate wedding invitations.</p>
<p><em>Nick Taylor</em> has spent the last 12 years completing hundreds of projects including custom headphones, bespoke bicycles, desktop furniture, and lighting. Before joining Glowforge, Nick spent 5 years at Apple and ran his own company making artisanal leather goods.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>My love of letterpress printing is no secret, and in this episode, I speak to two designers who devote parts of their working lives to modern letterpress. This episode was taped live at Ada’s Technical Books and Café in Seattle on January 23.</p>
<p>Printing didn’t change much from about 1450 to 1950. It became faster, motorized, and blew up to industrial scale, but it was only when the “relief” (or letterpress) method of printing—putting ink on a surface and then pressing paper onto it—was replaced with offset lithography, which relies on flat printing plates and thin films of ink, that everything changed for good. Letterpress printing has remained as a craft, though, and it has thrived in the last 20 years as it’s been rediscovered and taught fresh to new generations.</p>
<p>Two Seattle practitioners have deep ties to this great resurgence of letterpress. We talk about how they got sucked into an old-school printing method and how the medium affects their design and vice-versa.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sarah Kulfan is a visual designer, illustrator, and letterpress printer. She is the proprietrix of <a href="https://gallopintopress.com">Gallo Pinto Press</a> and <a href="http://beansnrice.com">Beans n’ Rice</a> where she respectively prints limited edition prints and runs her freelance graphic design business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demian Johnston is the Designer and Pressman at Annie’s Art &amp; Press, a letterpress shop in Ballard. At SVC, he teaches both introductory and advanced classes in the letterpress program. His design and illustration work has appeared in <em>The Stranger</em>, <em>Seattle Weekly</em>, <em>City Arts</em>, and <em>Beer Advocate</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<p>Thanks to the patrons in the crowdfunding campaign who brought the New Disruptors back, and these Disruptor-level backers in particular: Elliott Payne, my friends at Lumi, Kirk McElhearn, Kuang-Yu Liu, and Marc Schwieterman. (Marc, and another Disruptor backer, Kim Ahlberg, attended the taping!) You can <a rel="payment" href="https://newdisrupt.org/support/">become a patron of the show</a> on a one-time or recurring basis, and get rewards like an exclusive enamel pin and being thanked in this fashion!</p>
<h2>Show notes:</h2>
<p>We talk about a lot of concepts and old tech in this show, so the notes are a little more extensive to help you understand some of the things we mentioned just in passing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SVC is the <a href="https://www.svcseattle.com">School of Visual Concepts</a> in Seattle, where Jenny Wilkson runs the letterpress program. It’s a for-profit analog and digital design school, teaching letterpress, UI/UX, graphic design, copywriting and more. It’s where I had my 2017 design residency, too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demian has a <a href="http://www.excelsiorpress.org/Chandler_and_Price/index.html">10x15 Chandler and Price</a> (C&amp;P), which is a workhorse press, <a href="https://circuitousroot.com/artifice/letters/press/presses/cp-gordon/index.html">manufactured from 1884 to 1964</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.sternandfaye.com">Stern &amp; Faye</a>: Jules Remedios Faye and Chris Stern ran this press together for decades. Jules continues to print and bind, and handbound my book, <em><a href="https://glog.glennf.com/general-shop/letterpress-fine-point">Not To Put Too Fine a Point on It</a></em> (copies still available). The <a href="http://www.metaltype.org/ccstf/">C.C. Stern Type Foundry</a>, a working museum in Portland, Oregon, is named for Chris and features a lot of Jules and Chris’s casting equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“dissed type”: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgQa_BvaS-w">Type distribution</a> is an incredibly tedious part of hand setting type. Each character you pull out of a type case has to be “distributed” back into its original compartment in the case when you’re done with a printing job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.kurzke.co.uk/ruling-pens-and-technical-pens-part-i-ruling-pens/">Ruling pens</a>: These pens were used for making lines, or “rules,” and hold ink in a reservoir between two jaws. The gap of the jaws can be adjusted to create lines of different thickness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plates: Printing plates are solid sheets of metal or plastic made from source material and intended to be printed as a full sheet, sometimes including dozens of pages. Starting in the 1800s, printers would cast metal plates (called “stereotypes”); in more recent decades, printers rely on a rubbery plastic called photopolymer that’s light sensitive. Digital files can be output to high-contrast film and exposed to the plastic plastic, and make a letterpress-printable plate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.davidsongalleries.com/artists/contemporary/carl-v-montford/">Carl Montford</a>: a local renowned wood block engraver, who has taught thousands of people how to carve linoleum blocks and hundreds how to carve in wood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://letterpresscommons.com/linoleum/">Linoleum blocks</a>: These are really just pieces of linoleum glued to a wood base. A designer carves the linoleum to leave high areas to receive ink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type high: The exact height needed for type and other material on the “bed” of a press to be inked by rollers and press exactly at the right distance into paper. It’s 0.918 inches in America and England.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Touche plate: This may have been a regionalism, but a “touche” (French, pronounced <em>toosh</em>) is a touch-up plate used to fix an error in offset printing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.boardingallrows.com/linoleum-reduction-prints/">Reduction cut</a>: On a block, you engrave a starting image that prints in the lightest color, carve away details, print the next-lightest color, and so forth. The block is creatively destroyed in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://letterpresscommons.com/impression/">“kiss” impression</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://vandercookpress.info">Vandercook cylinder presses</a> are the hot thing in letterpress today, originally designed largely as a “proof press”: to pull a copy of a section of text for proofreading, layout, and evenness, before it went on a <em>real</em> press.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHhiJ3wGuCM">Printing the Oxford English Dictionary</a> (YouTube)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/127605643">“Farewell, Etaoin Shrdlu”</a>: The last day of hot-metal Linotype typesetting at the <em>New York Times</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quote I was trying to recall was from <em><a href="https://isbn.nu/0881791547">A Short History of the Printed Word</a></em>, written by Warren Chappell and, in a second edition, updated and extended by Robert Bringhurst. Bringhurst wrote the following devastating sentence about the entire era following relief printing:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the practitioners of photocomposition and offset printing were, like Gutenberg, engaged in a simultaneously innovative and imitative act. But they were not imitating writing; they were imitating printing—and were doing so in a world where reading had become, for most, a passive, cerebral act, unconnected with any physical sense of the making of letters, and unconnected with any sense of the intellectual urgency of publishing.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>“Grand Inventions” is a new micro-series within The New Disruptors in which I talk to people whose grandparents or great-x-parents invented something that’s still current or in use today. Two things sparked this micro-series idea for me. First, my grandfather’s stories of making a suggestion during WWII at <a href="http://www.mbiconcepts.com/ibm-and-world-war-ii.html">an IBM wartime manufacturing plant</a> that led to improved impeller productions; second, how invention and entrepreneurialism spans generations.</p>

<p>Joining me for the first episode is <a href="https://chrishiggins.com/w/">Chris Higgins</a>, a documentary filmmaker and writer, whose great-grandfather invented a variety of geared devices that counted things like fuel and people and more, and ultimately became CEO of Veeder-Root. Chris’s great-grandfather was H.L. Spaunberg, and Chris provided a list of some of his patents:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2040027A/en?oq=2040027">Counter</a> (via Frank E. Northrup) (1931)</li>
<li><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2077667A/en?oq=2077667">Odometer</a> (1934)</li>
<li><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2143584A/en?oq=2143584">Counting Device</a> (1936)</li>
<li><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2103650A/en?oq=2103650">Counter for Machines</a> (1937)</li>
<li><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2285844A/en?oq=2285844">Counter</a> (1939)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you have a grandparent or beyond who invented something still in use in some form? <a href="https://newdisrupt.orgmailto:nd@newdisrupt.org">Contact me</a> and we’ll set up an interview.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this inaugural episode #100, the return of the podcast to regular production, I’m pleased as punch to have C. Spike Trotman as my guest. Spike founded <a href="https://ironcircus.com/">Iron Circus Comics</a> in 2007, and it’s risen through her hard work and excellent curatorship to become the Chicago area’s leading comics publisher.</p>
<p>A cartoonist and writer herself with a long-running series, Spike has raised <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/ironspike/created">over a million dollars through Kickstarter</a> across more than a dozen projects, and created a sustainable and repeatable funding method. (You can read her book on Kickstarting comics for advice!) For her success, she was named one of Kickstarter’s Thought Leaders.</p>

      <itunes:subtitle>The new New Disruptors inaugural episode, featuring C. Spike Trotman, a major independent comics publisher and cartoonist who uses crowdfunding and distribution to make an impact.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>In this inaugural episode #100, the return of the podcast to regular production, I’m pleased as punch to have C. Spike Trotman as my guest. Spike founded Iron Circus Comics in 2007, and it’s risen through her hard work and excellent curatorship to become the Chicago area’s leading comics publisher.

A cartoonist and writer herself with a long-running series, Spike has raised over a million dollars through Kickstarter across more than a dozen projects, and created a sustainable and repeatable funding method. (You can read her book on Kickstarting comics for advice!) For her success, she was named one of Kickstarter’s Thought Leaders.

Support the podcast: The crowdfunding campaign brought back The New Disruptors, but I could produce more episodes and keep the show running after July 2019 with your help! You can contribute monthly via Patreon or become a yearly subscriber directly on this site—and get nifty bonuses and rewards. Support the podcast at https://newdisrupt.org/support

Jen Bekman founded 20x200 in 2007 to provide art at accessible prices. She spoke about her in work in 2012 at XOXO. Then she had a terrible, no good, very bad year. For a lot of reasons, she can't discuss the particulars of what happened, but she had to reboot 20x200: its site, its technology, its art, and its trust with existing customers.

If you have beautiful digital art, you need a place to display it. That's the idea behind Electronic Objects, a massively funded Kickstarter project from a month ago. But Zoë Salditch's interest is less in the technology than the uses to which people will put it. In the midst of producing their EO1 model, they have artists in residence working on concpetual ideas and are considering one future for their hardware as a platform for art — maybe 20x200 and EO have a lot in common?

With most people, saying "I can buy and sell you" is a boast about one's own ostensible net worth. With Mike Merrill, it's the literal truth. Mike is a publicly traded company, and shareholders can vote on the course his life takes, including how he pursues romantic interests.

      <itunes:summary>Nicole Dieker wears a lot of hats, as well as a brown coat. She's a freelance copywriter and ghostwriter, pens fiction, and writes essays. She's also a musician who bootstrapped herself out of a convention to which she returns every year, a rock climber, a Firefly fan, a whiskey drinker, and much more. Nicole wears her earnings on her sleeve, too: she discloses in regular posts precisely how much she's made in her freelance career.

      <itunes:summary>Jamie Wilkinson is the co-founder and CEO of VHX, a service that delivers movies online to the customers of filmmakers. They exist in sharp contrast to many video sites — operated by the likes of Amazon, Apple, and others — in that they only deliver films free of digital rights management, take a sliver of the purchase price, and truly facilitate filmmakers reaching their audiences.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Matt Haughey founded <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">MetaFilter</a>, a well-moderated forum for discussions about interesting things that expanded to also answer questions. At just a few months over 15 years old, it's a veterans of many Internet lifecycles. In the last couple of years, however, MetaFilter began to face an existential challenge, which we'll talk about in this episode, along with its history, nature, and future. </p>

<h2>Show notes</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atex_%28software%29">Atex</a> was the first digital composition system, used widely in the newspaper and magazine world into the 1990s, when PageMaker, QuarkXPress, and other software superceded it. Matt worked at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyra_Labs">Pyra Labs</a> on <a href="https://www.blogger.com/about">Blogger</a> for a short stint in its early days with <a href="http://evhead.com/">Ev Williams</a>, <a href="http://megnut.com/">Meg Hourihan</a>.</p>

<p>We mention <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/tim/">Tim O'Reilly</a>, a publisher and thinker who invested in Blogger and a number of other interesting early-stage ventures. He founded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Network_Navigator">Global Network Navigator (GNN)</a> in 1993, which was sold to AOL in 1995. He is part of <a href="http://oatv.com/are.html">O'Reilly Alphatech Ventures</a>.</p>

<p>David Carr, the <em>New York Times</em>' media critic, used the terrible, terrible term <em>platisher</em> to refer to Medium, which is a combination of a platform and a publisher <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/business/media/a-platform-and-blogging-tool-medium-charms-writers.html?_r=0">in a recent article</a>. </p>

<p>An OC-12 line is up to 622 Mbps of throughput. MAE-West was once the major interconnection point for ISPs on the west coast. The MAE stands for Metropolitan Area Exchange. In 1995, I wrote "<a href="http://tidbits.com/article/1501">The Experiment Is Over</a>," about the how the National Science Foundation was shutting down its contracts for NSFNet, because commercial organizations could now directly operate the Internet backbone.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">Virtual Private Server</a> (VPS) is a virtualized instance of an operating system running on a host alongside potentially many others, each of which is allotted guaranteed amounts of CPU usage, storage, and the like. VPSes are just like running a virtual machine on one's own computer, but designed for efficiency and reliability.</p>

<p>Glenn uses <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a>, which recently switched all its drives to SSDs and doubled many system parameters. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> is slightly cheaper (it used to be much more so). <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?sc_channel=PS&amp;sc_campaign=AWS_Free_Tier_2013_C&amp;sc_country=US&amp;sc_publisher=Google&amp;sc_medium=b_core_compute_ec2_e-ec2&amp;sc_content=40951034682&amp;sc_detail=Amazon%20ec2&amp;sc_category=compute_networking&amp;sc_segment=EC2&amp;sc_matchtype=e">Amazon EC2</a> is another alternative for rapid scaling.</p>

<p>After years of pictures of cats in scanners, MetaFilter set up <a href="http://cat-scan.com/">cat-scan.com</a> to house those and its memories. </p>

<p>BREAKING! Cat-scan is dead and its file lost forever!</p>

<p>BREAKING! File were found and it's fixed. As you were.</p>

<p>The community at Ask MetaFilter produces some remarkable answers. A poster <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/255675/Decoding-cancer-addled-ramblings">asked for help</a> deciphering coded messages her grandmother on index cards before she died in 1996. Within 15 minutes, there was an answer. <a href="http://waxy.org/">Andy Baio</a> <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/261595/Impossible-question-Can-you-identify-this-portion-of-an-album-cover">asked about an image</a> he used a decade ago for the soon-to-be-revived Upcoming, and Boing Boing's <a href="http://beschizza.flavors.me/">Rob Beschizza</a> had an answer four minutes later.</p>

<p>Einstein <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/02/24/telegraph-cat/">probably didn't tell a story</a> about "no cat," but it's an interesting history of where the apocryphal quote came from; and <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=62956">my original Google Answers query</a>, for which I was willing to pay $15 if someone had an accurate reply.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jessamyn.com/">Jessamyn West</a> is part of the lifeblood of the interesting part of the Internet. Matt blames his <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/">PVRblog</a> for the rise of content farms.</p>

<p>On Medium, <a href="https://medium.com/technology-musings/on-the-future-of-metafilter-941d15ec96f0">Matt explained</a> MetaFilter's Google search and AdSense predicament. But the good news is that even after we recorded this episode, <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/23272/MeFi-Fundraising-Update">donations continued to pour in</a>. They've now received about $40,000 in one-time donations and a commitment of $10,000 per month in recurring ones. That monthly figure is about one-third of the site's Google ad revenue, and thus a good cushion against future drops.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ariel Meadow Stallings is the proprietor of several "offbeat" sites about weddings, home and life, and families under the rubric <a href="http://offbeatempire.com/">Offbeat Empire</a>. She started the wedding site in 2007 to promote a book on creative alternatives for brides, which built an audience hungry for much more of the same. She obliged and has been building her empire full-time since 2009.</p>

<h2>Show notes</h2>

<p>Teresa Valdez Klein and Noah Iliinsky met through Ignite Seattle and <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2014/video-watch-geeky-seattle-couple-get-married-five-minutes-ignite/">got married during an event</a> in May. My wife, Lynn, and I were married in a chapel at Fort Worden and had our reception in <a href="https://flic.kr/p/6MhT2q">a former dirigible hangar</a> (now a theater).</p>

<p>Ariel's book is <em><a href="http://isbn.nu/1580053157">Offbeat Bride: Creative Alternatives for Independent Brides</a></em>. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/13174365">My <em>Economist</em> article</a> about people who leave the 3,000th review on a popular book or item. Facebook's director of product <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mhudack/posts/10152148792566194">ranted</a> about the trivialization of news.</p>

<p>Marisa McClellan runs the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mhudack/posts/10152148792566194">Food in Jars</a> blog, and found her following of nearly 150,000 "likers" on Facebook resulted in 80 people seeing a recent post. Huh. She and I <a href="http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/8/29/episode-38-yes-we-can-with-marisa-mcclellan">spoke last summer</a> for the podcast. <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/">The Oatmeal</a> is a popular webcomic; its creator is based in Seattle.</p>

<p>Offbeat Bride covered <a href="http://offbeatbride.com/2014/05/brooklyn-winter-wedding">a wedding at reBar</a> in Brooklyn, which shut down shortly afterwards. The article went up after its owner had been charged with tax evasion, and the site <a href="http://offbeatbride.com/2014/05/brooklyn-winter-wedding/comment-page-1#comment-391976">dealt with criticism</a> rather superbly in the comments.</p>

<p>We ran an article in <em>The Magazine</em> about <a href="http://the-magazine.com/15/feed-me-see-more">BuzzFeed's use of images</a> that they often don't license, and discovered that their methods likely fall within fair use.</p>

<p>Co-working has become hot again. In Seattle, <a href="http://officenomads.com/">Office Nomads</a> is the veteran shop and is expanding. Ariel and I met at <a href="https://www.wework.com/location/south-lake-union/">We Work</a>, a new high-end space for startups that's quite affordable given the amenities. I'm looking into co-working at <a href="http://seattletechnicalbooks.com/">Ada's Technical Books and Café</a>, the owner of which I interviewed in a podcast not long ago.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Katie Lane is an attorney who writes a blog called <a href="http://www.workmadeforhire.net/blog/">Work Made for Hire</a>. She advises creative freelancers and artists on how to protect their rights and get paid fairly for their work. She recently took the plunge herself, going full-time as a self-employed person. We'll talk about what led her into this specialized career and the kinds of things that people who want to or are pursuing work on their own should consider. We take a brief, deep dive into copyright, too.</p>

<p>The US Copyright Office <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf">has a circular</a> that defines work-for-hire rules (PDF). Katie notes that regardless of what contract you sign, <a href="http://dearauthor.com/features/reclaiming-your-copyright-after-thirty-five-years/">you can reclaim rights</a> after 35 years. It's a very specific process. This has been an <a href="http://variety.com/2013/biz/news/judge-rules-dc-comics-holds-rights-to-superboy-1938-superman-ads-1200387287/">ongoing issue</a> with the rights related to early creators of well-known comics characters, like Superman.</p>

<p>The phonogram right is a set of audio rights separate from copyright. I <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/06/sound-recordings">explain it at length</a> at the <em>Economist</em>. For extensive and interesting details about the duration of copyright in America, depending on what kind of thing is under discussion, when it was created or registered, and other factors, <a href="http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm">consult this chart</a> by copyright guru Peter Hirtle at Cornell University's site.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://medium.com/the-magazine/b6481c44c3ff">wrote a pile of words</a> on the tax and licensing issues (in America) around crowdfunding. You can apply for and receive an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS through <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-%28EIN%29-Online">a simple online process</a> -- no, I'm not kidding! It's great!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/forexposure_txt">@for_exposure</a> Twitter account is a riot, posting messages about people asking for work from others for free.</p>

<p>Katie recommends taking a look at these sites:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.zencash.com/">Zencash</a>: Helpful best practices (and a service) for getting paid and on time.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.docracy.com/">Docracy</a>: An open-source contract site, where you can examine others' contracts and upload your own.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.shakelaw.com/">Shake</a>: It's a way to create, sign, and send legally binding agreements via an iPad or iPhone.</p></li>

<h2>Show notes</h2>

<p>Maggie mentioned two early groups that helped independent artists and labels handle digital distribution: the for-profit <a href="http://www.merlinnetwork.org/">Merlin</a> and the trade group <a href="http://a2im.org/">A2im</a>. Maggie worked with bands at <a href="http://www.killrockstars.com/">Kill Rock Stars</a> for 17 years before becoming the co-head of CASH.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/">Jonathan Coulton</a> is on CASH's board, and I spoke to him about his career in "<a href="http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/3/27/episode-16">Baby Got Back Catalog</a>," March 2013. Back in 2000, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2000/06/14/love_7/">Courtney Love explained</a> how the sausage of music-industry accounting in big labels is designed to rip off artists.</p>

<p>I visited the Library of Congress Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation in 2012, and wrote "<a href="http://the-magazine.org/4/the-sound-of-silence">The Sound of Silence</a>" for <em>The Magazine</em> about the issues of preservation and rights. Pandora has a good explanation of <a href="http://www.dmx.com/pandora/licensing/">how music rights have to be licensed</a> in America.</p>

<p>Jesse <a href="http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellowship/fellows/current-fellows/">received a fellowship</a> from the Shuttleworth Foundation, which has freed them a bit from the endlessly cycle of fundraising to move forward and grow the staff. <a href="http://dansinker.com/">Dan Sinker</a> is in charge of the Knight-Mozilla OpenNews project for the Mozilla Foundation, and the founder of <em>Punk Planet</em>, an underground culture magazine.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.dylanmeconis.com/">Dylan Meconis</a> is a prolific cartoonist who lives in Portland, Oregon. She constantly labors away at a mix between her solo work and projects in collaboration with others, including writing the script for Scott Kurtz's popular <a href="http://pvponline.com/">PvP webcomic</a>. She is part of <a href="http://periscopestudio.com/">Periscope Studio</a>, which we've talked about in previous podcasts. We talk about building a career and learning from mistakes while keeping all the plates spinning.</p>

<h2>Show notes</h2>

<p>Dylan's books include <a href="http://www.dylanmeconis.com/outfoxed/"><em>Outfoxed</em></a>, <a href="http://www.bitemecomic.com/"><em>Bite Me!</em></a> (a vampire farce); <a href="http://www.lutherlevy.com"><em>Family Man</em></a>, a graphic novel being told pages at a time, and then collected into volumes; and <a href="https://dylanmeconis.myshopify.com/collections/books/products/danse-macabre-2-0"><em>Danse Macabre 2.0</em></a>. My friend Alison Hallett recommended Dylan's work and the <a href="http://www.boneville.com/">Bone series</a> by Jeff Smith. Dylan mentioned the artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Bilibin">Ivan Bilibin</a> as an inspiration for <em>Outfoxed</em>.</p>

<p>Portland has a ton of creative people of all sorts, and cartoonists and comic-book artists rank high among them. Both <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/">Dark Horse Comics</a> and <a href="http://www.onipress.com/">Oni Press</a> are based there. Erika Moen, a Periscope Studio participant, was <a href="http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/7/31/episode-34-do-toy-with-my-affections-with-erika-moen">on this show</a> in August 2013. Bill Amend (<a href="http://www.foxtrot.com/"><em>Foxtrot</em></a>) became internet famous. </p>

<p>Dylan's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dmeconis/the-dylan-meconis-library-2012">Kickstarter campaign</a> was successful, but she hit a bunch of snags we discuss. Her wife, Katie Lane, is a lawyer <a href="http://www.workmadeforhire.net/blog/">who advises freelancers at Work Made for Hire</a> on making good decisions about their work and rights! Katie performs legal work for cartoonist Matt Bors, <a href="http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/6/26/matt-bors-the-pen-is-mightier-episode-29">a previous guest</a> on this podcast.</p>

<p>I and Dylan listed off an oodle of conferences, which include <a href="http://www.gallifreyone.com/">Gallifrey One</a>, <a href="http://rosecitycomiccon.com/">Rose City Comic Con</a>, <a href="http://www.emeraldcitycomicon.com/">Emerald City Comicon</a>, <a href="http://prime.paxsite.com/">PAX</a>, the <a href="http://2014.xoxofest.com/">XOXO conference</a>, <a href="http://www.maxfuncon.com/">MaxFunCon</a>, and <a href="https://jococruisecrazy.com/">JoCo Cruise Crazy</a>.</p>

<p>Erika Moen is using Patreon to <a href="http://www.patreon.com/erikamoen">fund each cartoon</a> she creates.</p>

      <title>See You in the Funny Webpages with Dave Kellett and Fred Schroeder</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Kellett and Fred Schroeder created the movie <em><a href="http://www.strippedfilm.com/">Stripped</a></em> about the past, present, and future of comic strips and their creators. <a href="https://twitter.com/davekellett">Dave</a> is the creator and cartoonist of two webcomics titles, <em><a href="http://www.sheldoncomics.com/">Sheldon</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.drivecomic.com/">Drive</a></em>, and the co-author of <em>How To Make Webcomics</em>. He is one of a small but growing group of webcomics artists who are self-sufficient. <a href="http://fredschroeder.com/reel.html">Fred</a> is a veteran cinemographer, nominated for Best Cinematography at Sundance for his work on <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0893331/">Four Sheets to the Wind</a></em>. He has been shooting commercials for much of his career.</p>

<p>Together, they matched Fred's filmmaking skills with Dave's personal knowledge of the field and his contacts to create the first feature-length documentary on the topic, funded in part through two Kickstarter campaigns. They don't pull punches about the difficulties of being a comic-strip artist, but they show all the joy and love that goes into the work along with many potential bright lights already illuminating parts of the field and shining on the horizon.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Joshua Lifton is one of the founders of <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/">Crowd Supply</a>, a company that crowdfunds around products. They take a very different approach to preparation, funding, and follow-up than Kickstarter. Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/1billion">just announced</a> that it had crossed $1bn in pledges in its five-year lifetime. Of that, it's disbursed nearly $850m. It's on track to facilitate perhaps half a billion in 2014 alone.</p>

</p>The name Kickstarter may be used interchangeably with the term crowdfunding, and it is the 800 lb. gorilla in the space. (Watch out for the shipping charges on that gorilla, especially internationally.) But in its wake, hundreds of millions of dollars are being raised from all sorts of other sites which fill in important aspects of ecosystem, and Crowd Supply is one of them.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/angelamwebber">Angela</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AubreyCello">Aubrey</a> Webber are the musical group <a href="http://www.thedoubleclicks.com/">The Doubleclicks</a>, bringing geeky music to nerdy folk. The sisters never intended to form a band, but when Aubrey joined her sister Angela in Portland a few years ago, her cello coupled with Angela's singing caused enough of a stir for them to join forces and write songs about Dungeons &amp; Dungeons, the Curiosity rover, and not dissing the geek girl. We talk about all this and their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/angelar/the-doubleclicks-new-album-dimetrodon-weekly-songs">absurdly successful Kickstarter campaign</a> that just closed.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/">Andrew Huang</a>, known as "bunnie" (lowercase) to his friends, first came to the public eye when, while a graduate computer-science student at MIT, he cracked the proprietary wrapper around Microsoft's Xbox operating system in 2002, which allowed it then to run any software of his choosing. Microsoft didn't like this and MIT told him it wouldn't provide any support if a legal defense were needed. Fortunately, Microsoft quickly realized how embarrassing the situation could be, never pursued legal action, and bunnie published a book on the topic. He went on to design the Chumby, a squeezable interactive personal app device, and now works on a variety of projects for the public good, including an <a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3265">open laptop design</a> and <a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=2218">an open design for a radiation detector</a> in the wake of the nuclear plant disasters in Japan.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Chris Hawker invented the PowerSquid, a multi-pronged power adapter that exploded the notion of the old power strip. It's designed for the modern age of power bricks and oversized adapters. With his Trident Design, Chris and his team have created 70 products over 20 years that it licenses to other companies to manufacture. We've talked a lot to first-time industrial designers and producers who've taken advantage of funding and production techniques. Chris offers some insight for the long haul.</itunes:summary>

      <link>http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/6/26/matt-bors-the-pen-is-mightier-episode-29</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mattbors.com/">Matt Bors</a> is an independent political cartoonist. He's never had a staff job, and he's never drawn a banker holding bags of money where the banker is labeled "BANKER" and the bags of money have giant dollar signs on them. You've certainly seen Matt's work before, but you may not have known that he created it. You'll recognize his style when you visit his site. Matt joins me from Portland, Oregon, to talk about his whole career, with a special focus on the last year and a half.</p>

      <title>So Successful That He Fired Himself with Marco Arment (Part 1)</title>
      <link>http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/4/24/marco-arment-in-episode-20-so-successful-he-fired-himself</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment's</a> career has come in two main acts: as the first employee of <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, he helped create a service that changed the fundamental nature of blogging by introducing both ease of creation and social networking. While there, he toyed with a service, to let him read Web pages offline without formatting, that became <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>. In late 2010, he left Tumblr to focus on that service full time. Now Marco is a successful podcaster and the editorial director of <i><a href="https://the-magazine.org/">The Magazine</a></i> — the best publication ever created — at which I'm the editor and he's my boss! (I still have a job after we recorded the podcast.)</p>

<p>Our conversation will be aired in two parts, each about an hour long. In this first part, we talk about how as a Tumblr developer Marco found out he didn't want to manage people, how Instapaper developed, and issues of managing resources and scaling. In the second, we move further into podcasting, <i>The Magazine</i>, blogging, advertising, and other areas.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Duncan Davidson and Greg Koenig joined forces a few years back to start <a href="http://luma-labs.com/">Luma Labs</a>, a firm that makes across-the-chest camera straps. The two collaborated first on Luma Loop, a free-sliding camera strap, and then created Cinch, one that holds a camera tighter but still allows for movement. The Loop was kaboshed by a potential patent lawsuit; the second model has been a good seller, but with volume comes decisions about ramping up production. In this episode, we discuss all that, how they developed the original Cinch and Cinch 2 (about to be released), and quite a bit about rapid prototyping.</p>

      <title>Go Home at 5 O’Clock with Jason Fried</title>
      <link>http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/2/13/episode-10</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Jason Fried co-founded 37signals, a Web design company that found one of its internal tools for managing projects could be something effectively used by others. Millions of users later, 37signals offers Basecamp (overhauled substantially a year ago), Campfire, and Highrise among other services. The founders not only transformed their business, but routinely help others transform theirs. Fried collaborated on a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307463745?ie=UTF8&tag=searchbyisbn&linkCode=am2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307463745"><i>Rework</i></a> that distills years of what he learned from running a successful company and helping others with theirs.</p>
<p>You can look at and sign up for <a href="http://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> as a trial subscription, but this episode isn't a product plug; Basecamp fits the disruption mindset. Microsoft Project is perfectly fine software for companies that have employees in one place and need the top-down approach. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">Software as a service</a> (SaaS) typically involves an application you access via the Web for which data is stored centrally, and updates to the software happen centrally as well. Salesforce, an early SaaS alternative to enterprise-licensed and -managed software, was founded in 1999, and had risen as a force that defined the industry by the time Basecamp came out. <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307463745?ie=UTF8&tag=searchbyisbn&linkCode=am2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307463745">Rework</a></i> may be purchased from Amazon.com and <a href="http://isbn.nu/0307463745">many other fine bookstores</a>.</p>
<p>Glenn brought up three concepts relating to 37signals' work: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>, Eric S. Raymond's explanation of the difference between software code controlled by a handful of priests and that in the marketplace that's open to all; <i><a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a></i>, a provocative set of theses that turned into a revolution and a book by declaring, among other things, that markets are conversations; and Stephen Jay Gould's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nhIl7e61WOUC&lpg=PA122&ots=ZCqv80DVAD&dq=hecatomb%20stephen%20jay%20gould&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q=hecatomb%20stephen%20jay%20gould&f=false">use of the term <i>hecatomb</i></a> to explain evolution's remorseless pruning of failed mutations.</p>

      <title>Iterative Imperative with Ellie and Mike Kemery</title>
      <link>http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/2/6/episode-9</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Maker spaces are popping up all over where people can go and work with tools of all sorts, from woodworking to advanced 3D printers, to make things for themselves or prototype designs to manufacture. Seattle has been bereft of a large-scale facility with everything under one roof — until now. Ellie and Mike Kemery have just opened <a href="https://twitter.com/elliekemery">Makerhaus</a>, a 10,000-square-foot building chock full of everything makers need. But their secret sauce, they hope, is community and education among their members. We talk about what a maker space can mean to bring all the hardware, software, and people together in one place to make magic happen.</p>
<p>This episode is the first in the series in which I talk to facilitators: firms set up to help artists and producers connect with an audience. I'll be talking more over the coming weeks to a mix of creators and these new kinds of intermediaries that help rather than hinder achieving one's goals and finding an audience.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Tonya and Adam Engst have been disrupting publishing for 23 years, starting shortly after graduating Cornell University when they founded TidBITS, a Macintosh journal that is now the longest continuously produced Internet publication.

More than a decade ago, the group decided to shift its business from mostly working for others to mostly working for themselves. Field Notes (with Aaron Draplin), The Deck advertising network, and Layer Tennis are some of the commercial and entertaining results. Field Notes is entirely a physical product ordered online; The Deck, a digital one that can't exist without a network of independent voices.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Andrea Seabrook spent more than a decade at National Public Radio, and covered Congress for a good part of that time. She left NPR to start something of her own: DecodeDC, a podcast and syndicated radio program (on this very network) that cuts through the blandification of politics, and speaks the unvarnished truth that gets lost in the interest of presenting supposedly balanced viewpoints. Andrea is fair, but she doesn't shrink from cutting through layer after layer of spin, something that's typically not possible in conventional broadcast media. We talk about the future of public radio and the joy of making your own decisions about what your audience wants to hear.</p>

He's the founder of BoingBoing, a directory of wonderful things that's encouraged "happy mutants" for over 15 years (and was a zine created with his wife, Carla Sinclair, before that), and the editor of Make Magazine, one of the inspirations of and driving forces behind the maker movement.

      <link>http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2012/12/19/episode-3</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Tony Konecny, better known as Tonx, has been sourcing and roasting beans for a numbers of years, and recently founded Tonx Coffee, a subscription service that delivers whole beans from small batch roasting every two weeks. It's not a bean of the month club. It's a way to bypass the overchoice that one can face in specialty coffee shops, and get the assurance that the beans are fresh and good every time. In this episode, listen to Tonx and his ecommerce guru Nik Bauman talk about the joys of coffee and the joys of starting a business in which you can talk directly to your customers without anyone else getting in the way. There's a brief interlude in which the host and a friend have a little Tonx tasting, too.</p>
<p>(Note: Although Tonx Coffee has sponsored other Mule Radio shows, this show is editorially independent and Tonx Coffee didn't sponsor this episode.)</p>

It's not a bean of the month club. It's a way to bypass the overchoice that one can face in specialty coffee shops, and get the assurance that the beans are fresh and good every time. In this episode, listen to Tonx and his ecommerce guru Nik Bauman talk about the joys of coffee and the joys of starting a business in which you can talk directly to your customers without anyone else getting in the way. There's a brief interlude in which the host and a friend have a little Tonx tasting, too.
(Note: Although Tonx Coffee has sponsored other Mule Radio shows, this show is editorially independent and Tonx Coffee didn't sponsor this episode.)</itunes:summary>

      <title>Come Fly with Me, Let’s Fly, Let’s Fly Away with Chris Anderson</title>
      <link>http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2012/12/12/episode-2</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Chris Anderson was the editor in chief of Wired Magazine for over a decade, during which time he wrote an "accidental" trilogy of three books: The Long Tail, Free, and Makers. His latest book details how a mild obsession with do-it-yourself drones (pilotless planes) sucked him into the maker community, and to co-found a business now producing millions in sales. We talk about the maker movement, the revolution of atoms that's underway, and his drones. (He left Wired just after we recorded this podcast to work full-time as chief of his business, 3D Robotics.) </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Filmmakers Lisanne Pajot and James Swirsky discovered the rich stories behind independently produced videogames, and turned some preliminary interviews into first one Kickstarter campaign, and then another. The resulting film, "Indie Game: The Movie," won an award at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2012. But then, rather than accept deals for conventional film distribution, the two organized their own tour, renting theatres and meeting Kickstarter backers around North America. They ultimately controlled their own digital distribution as well. We discuss their journey of the last two years, which remains underway as they ready special features.</p>
