			<title><![CDATA[E49: Anti-Racist Action in Minneapolis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Rerelease of our episode 49 about Anti-Racist Action in Minneapolis, because we are currently trying to co-publish a book, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wrkclasshistory/we-go-where-they-go-the-story-of-anti-racist-action" target="_blank"><em>We Go Where They Go: The Story of Anti-Racist Action</em></a>, which is the definitive history of the group across the US. To fund its publication, we are currently running a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wrkclasshistory/we-go-where-they-go-the-story-of-anti-racist-action" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign so please do check it out here</a>, and support it by pre-ordering your copy at a great discount with lots of other great rewards.</p>

<p>Anti-Racist Action (ARA) started in Minneapolis and is a predecessor to the crews often now called antifa. ARA started in 1987 with a multiracial group of teenage skinheads who fought the rising white power movement. It grew into a network of groups in at least 120 towns and cities across the US and Canada. ARA’s first principle was: “We go where they go. Never let the Nazis have the streets.” They eventually applied that not only to white power organising, but to homophobic and anti-abortion organizing, and to police violence, which they saw as all connected. Producer and host Anna Stitt tells the story of the group in Minneapolis through vivid first-person accounts, archival audio, and music from the era. It starts under the railroad tracks in Uptown, Minneapolis and traces a movement that continues to shape the US to this day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Howard Zinn, author of <em>A People’s History of the United States </em>and other texts, was one of the most influential historians in the US in the 20th-century, inspiring a generation to study history from below, including us. Born in New York in August 1922, we are releasing these episodes for the centenary of his birth, as part of a series of <a href="https://www.howardzinn.org/zinn-at-100/" target="_blank">Howard Zinn 100 events</a>. In these episodes, Zinn tells the story of his life, his activism, his ideas and his work in his own words, in what was one of his last, if not the last, interview before his sudden death in 2010. This little-known interview was conducted by Sasha Lilley, and excerpts from it are used with permission of Lilley and PM Press.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[WCL E4: Michael Rosen's socialist fairy tales, part 2]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Part 2 of our double-episode in which we talk to acclaimed author, poet and Professor of Children’s Literature, Michael Rosen, about his anthology, Workers’ Tales: Socialist Fairy Tales, Fables, and Allegories from Great Britain, which gathers together short stories from the labour and socialist press between 1880 and 1920.

In this episode, Michael shows how popular children’s stories (like Wind in the Willows and Alice in Wonderland) are shot through with the political content of their adult authors. He also reads a story from his anthology by William Morris and explains how all culture, including children’s writing, contains within it elements of social contest.

You can buy a copy of Michael's anthology here: https://bookshop.org/books/workers-tales-socialist-fairy-tales-fables-and-allegories-from-great-britain/9780691175348

			<description><![CDATA[As a far-right mob storms the Capitol in Washington DC, learn more about the history of opposition to white supremacy in the US. This podcast episode tells the story of Anti-Racist Action, a militant anti-fascist organisation in Minneapolis, Minnesota founded in the 1980s.

Anti-Racist Action (ARA) started in Minneapolis and is a predecessor to the crews often now called antifa. ARA started in 1987 with a multiracial group of teenage skinheads who fought the rising white power movement. It grew into a network of groups in at least 120 towns and cities across the US and Canada. ARA’s first principle was: “We go where they go. Never let the Nazis have the streets.” They eventually applied that not only to white power organising, but to homophobic and anti-abortion organizing, and to police violence, which they saw as all connected.
Producer and host Anna Stitt tells the story of the group in Minneapolis through vivid first-person accounts, archival audio, and music from the era. It starts under the railroad tracks in Uptown, Minneapolis and traces a movement that continues to shape the US to this day.

			<title><![CDATA[E30: The Hong Kong riots 1967, part 1]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[As protests have swept Hong Kong in the last few weeks, we begin an occasional series on the British Empire with a double episode on a previous wave of demonstrations, riots, strikes and bombings in the city, then a British colony. We speak with three people who were there about what happened, and learn new revelations about one of Hong Kong’s most notorious unsolved murders – of radio commentator Lam Bun.
We interview to Zhou Yi (Chau Yick/周奕), Leung Po Lung (梁寶龍) and Chui Yat Keung (徐日強) who were in Hong Kong at the time, as well as Lala, an activist and historian who interpreted for us and spoke about her research.

			<title><![CDATA[E27: Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners, part 1]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[First in a three-part podcast miniseries this Pride month about Lesbians & Gays Support the Miners, a small group of LGBTQ people in London who began to raise money for striking workers in the Welsh valleys during the great miners’ strike of 1984-5. Unknown to them at the time, they would end up transforming both communities, and Britain as a whole.
LGSM have recently achieved a level of fame due to the excellent 2014 film by Steven Beresford, Pride. In these episodes, participants in the group, and in the Welsh mining communities, tell their story.

			<title><![CDATA[E25: The Stonewall riots and Pride at 50, part 1]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Summer 2019 marks 50 years since the iconic rebellion against the police raid of the Stonewall Inn in New York City. The LGBTQ patrons and locals, many of them people of colour, and most of them working class, fought back against the police in 6 days of rioting. Then they organised, revolutionising the LGBTQ rights movement, and sparking Pride.
In honour of Pride month, WCH are releasing a series of episodes about LGBTQ history. We begin with a double episode telling the story of the Stonewall rebellion, in the words of participants.
After the rebellion, participants in it, along with others, set up the Gay Liberation Front, and then organised a protest on its first anniversary, 28 June 1970, which became Pride.
This is part 1. Part 2 is out for early listening by our patreon supporters. You can listen and support us here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/e22-stonewall-at-26826103
We also have a bonus episode about this exclusively for our patreon supporters, here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/e22-1-stonewall-26826531

			<title><![CDATA[E21: WCH Crime - The Columbia Eagle mutiny, pt 1]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[First episode of the WCH Crime podcast, about the Columbia Eagle mutiny in 1970, perhaps the most spectacular act of resistance to the Vietnam war, when two sailors hijacked their ship transporting thousands of tonnes of napalm for US forces, and sailed it to Cambodia.
You can listen to all 4 parts of this series, plus 2 bonus episodes, by supporting us on patreon: https://patreon.com/workingclasshistory
Full footnotes for this episode, including photos and more information are here on our website: https://workingclasshistory.com/2019/04/09/wch-crime-columbia-eagle-mutiny/
WCH Crime will feature cases where people have faced criminal charges for their beliefs or political activities, and will look at cases where people have been framed or even killed by the state. It will be in the same feed as the regular Working Class History podcast.
All four parts, and two additional bonus episodes, are available for all of our patrons contributing $5 a month or more. For everyone else, subsequent parts will be released each week.
Pictured above are the two mutineers: Alvin Glatkowski, left, and Clyde McKay, right, superimposed on the ship.
We speak to Al about his experiences, in addition to Vietnam war-era sailor and historian Roberto Loiederman.
We have been working on this miniseries for almost a year, and have put in so many hours we lost count some time ago. We are taking time out from our day jobs through 2019 to devote more time to WCH and podcast, but this will only be sustainable in the longer term if we get more support from our listeners on patreon. So if you appreciate what we do, and if you can afford it, please consider supporting us. If you can't afford it, no problem, please just give us a review on your podcast app, and share episodes on social media.
MORE INFORMATION
We will be adding more information about the mutiny, as well as photographs and videos to this our website shortly at https://workingclasshistory.com 
For a detailed history of the events, we recommend the book The Eagle Mutiny, by Roberto Loiederman and Richard Linnett.
To find out more about different aspects of the Vietnam war check out the other WCH podcast episodes in our Vietnam war series: E14: The Vietnam war with Noam Chomsky and a member of the Vietnamese Women's Union is about the geopolitics of the conflict and human cost, especially on women, E10-11: The GI anti-war movement, E8: The strike wave is about the wave of strikes which took place in the US during the war
MERCH
We've produced a range of merchandise commemorating the anti-war movement by service people during the Vietnam war using some of their original artwork to help fund our work. Check it out here: shop.workingclasshistory.com/collections/vietnam-gi-resistance
CORRECTIONS
Part 1: We erroneously say that Al was born in Norfolk, Virginia. Al was born in the military base at Ford Gorgon in Georgia. He later moved to Norfolk for his high school years.
