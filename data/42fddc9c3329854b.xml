      <title>On with Kara Swisher: Maggie Haberman Makes Sense of Donald Trump</title>
      <description>Hey Pivot listeners! The Pivot team is off for the Monday holiday, so instead of your regularly-scheduled episode, you're getting an exciting surprise: an episode of our sister podcast, On with Kara Swisher!

You're welcome, and we'll be back on Friday with more Pivot!

Donald Trump has said journalist Maggie Haberman is like his “psychiatrist” — a remark she dismisses as a meaningless and failed attempt at flattery. Yet Haberman does have a deep understanding of what makes the former president tick, cultivated through years of covering City Hall in New York City and then Donald J. Trump for The New York Times. Her recent book, “Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America,” tells Trump’s origin story and chronicles his unexpected takeover of the Republican party and his consolidation of power in Washington. “He’s not a political genius,” Haberman tells Kara, “he is a genius about human emotions and a certain darkness in what animates people.” So will Trump run again in 2024? Haberman says that “he’s backed himself into a corner where he has to,” but she’s not sure whether she'll be covering him.
Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about the newsmakers: Elon Musk’s about-face on the Twitter deal and Peter Thiel’s financing foray into key Senate races and ... a conservative dating app.

      <title>The Legacy of Steve Jobs, at Code 2022</title>
      <description>Tim Cook, Sir Jony Ive, and Laurene Powell Jobs unpack the life and work of Steve Jobs, the legendary Apple co-founder who changed consumer technology forever. Jobs was a regular guest at Code conferences, appearing at the first All Things D in 2003. Over the years on the Code stage, he predicted the end of the PC era, bantered with his arch-rival Bill Gates, and famously denied— and later teased— plans for the iPhone. Now, he’s remembered by three luminaries who knew him best: Cook, his protege and successor; Ives, who translated his ideas into iconic designs; and Powell Jobs, founder of Emerson Collective and Jobs’ wife of 20 years, until his death in 2011.
Recorded September 7, 2022 in Los Angeles.

      <description>Scott Galloway is back! He joins Kara at Code 2022, where they spent the week interviewing the biggest names in tech (and some presidential hopefuls) about everything from regulation to TikTok to the legacy of Steve Jobs. It was busy week: Senator Amy Klobuchar and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy make their cases for and against antitrust bills. Former Disney CEO Bob Iger may have just opened himself to a subpoena from Elon Musk. And Tim Cook had a beautifully simple solution to the phone wars.

      <title>Guest Episode: Decoder with Nilay Patel: Why the future of work is the future of travel, with Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky</title>
      <description>Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky prides himself on thinking very differently than other CEOs, and his answers to the Decoder questions about how he structures and manages his company were almost always the opposite of what I’m used to hearing on the show. Airbnb is pretty much a single team, focused on a single product, and it all rolls up to Brian. That’s very different from most other big companies, which have lots of divisions and overlapping lines of authority.
And Airbnb’s relationship to cities is changing as tourism changes. Airbnb used to be the poster child for a tech company that showed up without permission and fought with regulators, but as the company has grown and the pandemic has changed things, it’s entered what is hopefully a more mature phase — it just came to a deal with New York City after ten years of argument. I asked Brian about that and about what it’s like to run a public company now — the transition from scrappy startup to public company engaged with regulators is a big one.
Of course, I also had to ask about cryptocurrency and the metaverse — does Brian think we’re all going to be visiting virtual NFT museums on vacations in the future? You have to listen and find out.
Okay, Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, here we go.

      <title>Facebook’s “cultural crisis,” Mark Cuban on the NBA’s rebound, and Kara gets replaced by AI</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott chat about the delay of the tech antitrust hearing, the "unprecedented culture crisis" at Facebook, and the think-tank financed by Big Tech that is schmoozing foreign regulators. Friend of Pivot Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, joins to talk about the return of professional basketball and why the NBA's "bubble" at Disney World is safer than the attempted comebacks of football and baseball; Cuban also discusses his Twitter battle with Ted Cruz, why he's optimistic about a COVID-19 vaccine, and why a new wave of legalized sports gambling is on the horizon. Also: What should Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg have behind them when they testify, what should we take away from AOC's battle with Ted Yoho, and can an AI algorithm write better than Kara Swisher?
Hey, listeners: We want your reactions to and questions about Wednesday's tech antitrust hearing. Send them in to pivot@voxmedia.com by Wednesday night, or tweet them @PivotSchooled.

      <title>Uber offers to gobble up GrubHub, Elon Musk is “Re-open America guy”, and a prediction on mergers in digital media</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about Uber's offer to buy GrubHub, which would give the company a majority of food delivery market share. They talk about whether this merger would be good for Uber (yes) and whether it would be bad for the commonwealth (also, yes). Meanwhile, Elon Musk is reopening the Tesla factory in California, and his mother is texting Kara about how harsh she's being on her son. In Listener Mail we get a question about companies taking back their upfront ad deals with the major television networks and how that will shake things up in the industry. Scott's prediction is that we are about to see mergers in smaller digital media companies.

      <description>Kara and Scott talk about Jack Dorsey's $1 billion donation to fight COVID-19, as well as other tech billionaire's contributions to fight the virus. They think that those contributions can't fill the void of a well funded government through tax dollars. They give an update on Zoom's privacy issues as the company takes on Alex Stamos, Facebook's former security chief. In Listener Mail, Kara and Scott get a question about the massive video game industry as Amazon starts producing its own video games. In predictions, Scott thinks the World Health Organization will be in the Trump administration's cross hairs in the weeks to come.

      <title>Stimulus package stalled, how Airbnb, Tesla and Uber fare during COVID-19, and Corey Johnson (NYC Speaker) on small businesses and New York on “PAUSE"</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about the stimulus package in limbo and the Defense Production Act. They break down how tech companies like Lyft, Airbnb and Tesla are pivoting in the COVID-19 crisis. They think Airbnb probably won’t go public this year. In Friend of Pivot, we talk to New York City Speaker Corey Johnson about how New York City is the US epicenter for COVID-19 cases. He discusses the possibility of rent freezes, the new “PAUSE” order and how small businesses are faring in the upheaval. In wins and fails, Kara thinks Rand Paul being the first Senator to test positive for COVID-19 — and exposing other congresspeople to the disease is a major fail.

      <title>Addressing the US economy (a note from Andrew Yang), data privacy in a public health emergency, and a listener question on the "great WFH-experiment”</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about stimulus packages and possible emergency checks to deal with the US economic crisis. We hear a bite from Andrew Yang about why implementing universal basic income in this situation is the next phase of capitalism. As Israel joins Iran and China in using data location to stop the spread of COVID-19, Kara and Scott talk about whether this is a move the United States should attempt. In listener mail, we get a question about whether this "work-from-home-moment" will become permanent...and what will happen to office buildings if it does.

      <title>Tech in the time of COVID-19, Congressional antitrust hearing and Google Search, PLUS a listener asks: could Amazon Care roll out COVID-19 tests?</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about COVID-19, what tech could do to help, and what we need to see from leadership. We hear from Ron Klain, who was the "Ebola czar" under the Obama administration about why we need COVID-19 tests and what the hold up is in getting them. In other news, Kara and Scott discuss this week's Congressional hearing on antitrust and why Yelp thinks Google's search results are biased towards their own products. In Listener Mail we get a question about whether Amazon should roll out COVID-19 tests as part of their Amazon Care launch (spoiler alert: this idea gets a big WOOF yes from the Big Dawg). Plus Scott gives professors switching to online class forums tips on how to be a dynamic lecturer via web.

      <title>Twitter’s new board, Silicon Valley vs. Washington’s approach to COVID-19, and Aminatou Sow joins to discuss women in leadership</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about the deal reached at Twitter, the fate of Jack Dorsey and his tenure as CEO. They discuss how big tech companies have been stepping up to take care of gig-workers as COVID-19 spreads; Silicon Valley's approach has been drastically different from the government's, thus far. Facebook takes some action on misleading Trump campaign ads connected to the 2020 Census ... but Kara and Scott think one ad is not enough. In Friend of Pivot we hear from podcast host and author Aminatou Sow on what we're missing about International Women's Day and how to create gender parity.

They discuss Facebook's redesign of Libra -- their cryptocurrency and how other coins are faring in the face of COVID-19. In Listener Mail we hear from G/O Media reporter Dhruv Mehrotra about his recent investigation into how Better Help proliferates user data (find the journalists on Twitter @dmehro and @molly_o). In predictions, Kara and Scott disagree about how Dorsey's future with Twitter will play out.

      <title>Bob Iger exits — what’s going on at Disney? The stock market takes a coronavirus hit. PLUS Is “coffee” a disruptable industry?</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott speculate about what is happening at Disney following Bob Iger's abrupt exit. They talk about the stock market's tumble in reaction to coronavirus. Scott breaks down which companies should be on the offense and which ones should be on the defense... and why he thinks Peleton may be one of the companies that see a spike during the coronavirus scare. In wins and fails, Kara thinks Harvey Weinstein's rape conviction is a win (but should have happened far sooner). "Rundles" are back in wins as Panera begins offering monthly coffee memberships. In predictions, Scott thinks Pence will fail at his job to control the coronavirus pandemic in the US and that Nikki Haley joins the Trump ticket.

Scott breaks down which companies should be on the offense and which ones should be on the defense... and why he thinks Peleton may be one of the companies that see a spike during the coronavirus scare. In wins and fails, Kara thinks Harvey Weinstein's rape conviction is a win (but should have happened far sooner). "Rundles" are back in wins as Panera begins offering monthly coffee memberships. In predictions, Scott thinks Pence will fail at his job to control the coronavirus pandemic in the US and that Nikki Haley joins the Trump ticket.

      <title>The EU takes on AI, the US vs. Huawei continues, Airbnb is in the red, and a Friend of Pivot on your children’s data privacy</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about the big players in Silicon Valley headed to the EU where they are debating new regulations on artificial intelligence. In more foreign affairs and tech, they talk about the US bringing charges against Huawei for federal racketeering. Airbnb was once a rare profitable "unicorn", but now, ahead of their expected IPO, they're in the red; Kara and Scott talk about how and where they are allocating their money. In Friends of Pivot, Kara and Scott have a conversation with Stanford professor and co-founder/CEO of Common Sense, Jim Steyer, about how to protect our children's data privacy and what the government's responsibility is in this issue (SPOILER: we should repeal Section 230).

      <title>Amazon pays taxes (and fights for JEDI), SoftBank gains on Sprint and what ClassPass tells us about the fitness economy</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about what it means for Amazon to be paying (minimal) taxes, as Jeff Bezos is "going Hollywood", and the company battles with the government over JEDI. They also revisit Google's quiet dismissal of top executives -- the company's longtime head of HR left this week. This week, the FTC ordered the big tech companies -- Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple -- to hand over information about all the mergers and acquisitions that were too small to report over the past decade. In listener mail, we hear about Class Pass -- the decade's first "unicorn" -- and the fitness industry in general. Scott predicts that eventually India will ban Facebook.

      <description>Kara and Scott talk about The Oscar's and how the award is being rebranded. They discuss Uber's most recent earnings call and whether or not they'll actually be profitable next year. Kara thinks that while the January jobs report showed employment is up, it is a poor marker of success because of wage stagnation. In Friends of Pivot, New York Times columnist and Squawk Box host Andrew Ross Sorkin calls in for a conversation about Instagram, e-commerce and news models of monetizing content.

Scott's fail is Casper's IPO. In predictions, Scott thinks that in 2-5 years Tesla will come out with its own cryptocurrency.

      <title>IBM leadership shuffle, Amazon earnings, plus "Friend of Pivot” Jon Lovett pops in from Iowa to talk Trump’s inevitable ad operation</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about IBM's new CEO as the company struggles to keep up with cloud computing. They also discuss Zuckerberg's "new approach to social media", and breakdown Amazon's major earnings. In "Friends of Pivot" Jon Lovett, host of the Crooked Media podcast "Lovett or Leave It" says we should be prepared for the Trump campaign's major ad push. In wins and fails, Kara remembers Leila Janah an entrepreneur who focused on creating jobs in the world's poorest communities; she passed away this week at the age of 37. Scott's win is the halftime show at the Superbowl (although his kids would say his dancing is a FAIL). We end the show by questioning Jeff Bezos' dating choices after his girlfriend's brother sues him for defamation.

      <title>US budget deficit will hit $1-trillion; AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB earnings breakdown; and Britain sides with China on Huawei</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about the Congressional Budget Office projecting that the U.S. budget deficit will pass the $1 trillion threshold in 2020. They also get into tech earnings, who did well last quarter, and what we can expect going forward. In listener mail, Kara and Scott talk about Huawei Britain defying Trump's plea to ban their plans for 5G expansion. Kara's win is Michael Bloomberg's ad campaign. Her fail is Facebook's oversight board running late (and not asking her to be a member). Scott's win was media outlets who highlighted Holocaust Remembrance Day. His fail was Chipotle violating child labor laws. And Scott predicts that Uber will spinoff "Uber Eats".

Also, YouTube is now having their moderators sign a release acknowledging they could get PTSD from doing the work... Kara has thoughts. In listener mail, we get a question about players in the co-working space and how they are strategizing after the fall of weWork. It's definitely a FAIL that Kara did not get invited to Jeff Bezos' mansion party. In wins, Scott remembers Clayton Christensen.

They talk about how Amazon has the power of its own nation and the implications of that.

      <title>Trillion dollar companies and tax season; how the “Black List” shapes Hollywood’s big business… and is podcasting coming for radio dollars?</title>
      <description>Kara talk about Google becoming the world's fourth trillion-dollar company ... and who is actually paying taxes on all of it? They discuss world leaders congregating at Davos. Donald Trump will be speaking as the Senate impeachment trial starts. In Friend of Pivot, Executive Producer and founder of "The Black List", Franklin Leonard says that with the influx of big tech companies producing films there is greater opportunity for a "full embrace of the country's diversity", even though the Oscars did not reflect those stories. In wins and fails, Kara disagrees with Scott on holding Sheryl Sandberg accountable for Mark Zuckerberg's failures at Facebook.

      <description>Kara and Scott talk about Facebook's decision not to change their political ad policies. They also discuss Facebook banning "deep fakes" and Teen Vogue's confusion over a Facebook sponsored content article. Kara has a rant for Facebook VP, Andrew Bosworth, about his Lord of the Rings reference and op-ed. In Listener Mail we hear from an Australian asking about big tech's response to natural disasters such as the on-going fires in his country. Overall CES is a fail, but inviting Ivanka Trump to speak was next level fail. In predictions, Scott has some thoughts on the future of cyber attacks and hacks.

      <title>Twitter and the Saudis, Facebook’s 'Switcharoo', and the 2020 digital ads race</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about former Twitter employees who were spying on user data for Saudi Arabia. They also talk about a big leak of internal Facebook emails that further shows Facebook's conniving use of data. A year out from the 2020 election, a new progressive PAC is trying to beat Donald Trump in the digital ad space. Kara and Scott agree it's a drop in the bucket. Scott bids a farewell to his presidential hopeful and "dreamy man crush" Beto. Kara's win is Airbnb's transparent handling of a few recent incidents. Meanwhile, in fails, SAT-takers names and data are being sold to elite universities ... so those schools can have a higher rejection rate.

      <title>Going after venture capital culture and the unicorn industrial complex</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about feuds with VC's, billionaires paying fewer taxes than the working class and tech companies folding to Chinese state media pressure. They take a listener mail question about Sidewalk Labs and the right way to make smart cities. They're concerned with the Turkish president's use of Twitter to announce an invasion of Syria. A win is Andrew Yang's $10-million boost in Q3. And Kara comes with her own prediction this week, that Michael Bloomberg is going to jump into the presidential race. (Also a big warm welcome to the Pivot team's newest favorite member, Kara's baby, Clara Jo!!)

      <title>Uber is 'disruptive and drunk',  weWork is 'just drunk', and Pivot turns 1!</title>
      <description>Happy 1st anniversary to Pivot! Kara and Scott talk about weWork's halted IPO (we'll take partial credit). They talk about Amazon manipulating its algorithm to present more of its own products in search. Facebook is making its own "Supreme Court", is it just a band-aid? Should Kara Swisher be one of the Justices? (Yes). Fail: Trudeau -- and the (STILL) Governor of Virginia -- wearing black face.

They talk about Amazon manipulating its algorithm to present more of its own products in search. Facebook is making its own "Supreme Court", is it just a band-aid? Should Kara Swisher be one of the Justices? (Yes). Fail: Trudeau -- and the (STILL) Governor of Virginia -- wearing black face.

      <title>LIVE! From the Lesbians Who Tech Summit</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk at the annual Lesbians Who Tech Summit in New York City. Scott is dubbed a #LezBro. They discuss 48 state AG's putting forth an antitrust probe into Google. They love it. Kara comes with her new augmented reality glasses -- she thinks they're the future, Scott disagrees. WeWork's biggest investor encouraged them not to go forward with their IPO -- it's either because Pivot has gone so hard after them or because their S-1 is utter nonsense. Kara's win is Chrissy Teigen taking on Trump on Twitter. Scott's win is California's new law protecting gig workers. And they answer audience questions about how tech can be a better place for the LGBTQ community.

      <description>Kara and Scott bring on NYTimes reporter, Mike Isaac, to talk about his new book "Super Pumped: the Battle for Uber". They pick his brain about all the Silicon Valley drama around the ride-share company. Scott's win is Walmart for taking action in the gun-control debate. Mike comes prepared with his own fail and calls out Twitter for the hacking of Jack Dorsey's account. Scott is predicting that weWork doesn't ever actually go public.

      <title>Peloton “sells happiness” and bedbugs take over Twitter</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk Peloton's S-1 ... is it the WeWork of exercise or an innovation in happiness? They also talk about Facebook's newest attempt to undercut Snapchat. Kara's fail is journalists who can't take a joke. And for the first time ... Pivot is taking listener mail! This week, Scott gets pushback from a listener in Minnesota on his Tesla views. PLUS: we get the inside scoop on how Scott comes up with his predictions (spoiler: it's more than shaking a Magic-8 ball).

Facebook actually gets a win this week for bringing on their first African American woman as a board member (but will she hold Zuckerberg to account?).

      <title>"It's not a meritocracy, it's a mirror-tocracy"</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about the avalanche of recent Facebook news -- including Zuckerberg's new professed want for regulations. They also talk about YouTube and how the company actively seems to be overlooking all the toxic things that end up on the platform. We reached out to Managing Editor of AfroTech, John Ketchum, to talk about the late-Nipsey Hussle's contributions to tech and entrepreneurship as a way to uplift his community. It's part of a broader trend of affluent black celebrities putting their money into tech entrepreneurship. Speaking of rap/entrepreneurship (eye-roll implied), Elon Musk dropped a rap about Harambe on SoundCloud. Meanwhile, Patagonia is refusing to sell tech-bros vests and we are here for it. And finally, Scott revisits predictions about Lyft and Amazon.

Will anyone follow? Scott and Kara also talk about what Apple TV even is, the EU hitting Google with more antitrust fines and AOC continuing to win the heart of the internet.

      <title>Facebook says it’s all about privacy now. OK, sure.</title>

      <description>Kara and Scott talk about Apple and Facebook's latest gaffes and how Apple might be the only force left regulating Facebook. There's a-latte to say about Howard Schultz's presidential ambitions. Nancy Pelosi was a big winner this week (and Scott for predicting the shutdown would end on last week's episode!) We also hear from a historian who told the Davos crowd that a top-marginal tax has historically worked in the United States.

      <title>MAGA teens, Fyre Fest and Twitter wars</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about how Twitter duped us all again. Scott is fresh off a conference where both he and Sheryl Sandberg talked about the future of Facebook (spoiler alert: they have very different takes on how the company should move forward). Kara gets caught up in the Covington Catholic video drama. Now she's going head-to-head with Tucker Carlson (hey Tucker, want to come on our podcast?). Meanwhile, in another Twitter feud this week, Cardi B is a big winner after saying she'd "dog walk" Tomi Lahren. Also, Fyre Fest is still the biggest fail of all time (but the new documentaries about it are both a win!). And, Kara's prediction is that she'll never own another car again.

      <title>"Woke" is the 2019 business strategy</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott are back together again! This week they catch up on Jeff Bezos' divorce and his not so hot texting skills (hey alive girls!). We're pretty sure Gillette listens to Pivot because they took Scott up on one of his predictions; they used a social justice trend in their latest marketing campaign. Meanwhile, during this weeks senate confirmation hearing, Attorney General nominee William Barr got a surprising amount of questions -- from both sides of the aisle -- about enforcing antitrust laws and big tech. And, let's face it, @AOC, aka Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is winning the Internet.

      <title>Microsoft is more valuable than Apple again. Why?</title>
      <description>Kara and Scott talk about Microsoft surpassing Apple. They also come to an agreement that “Republicans buy football teams and Democrats buy media properties”. In case you missed some recent headlines, Kara and Scott talk under-reported stories. China is unveiling a social credit surveillance system and it’s literally a ‘Black Mirror’ episode. Scott’s “win of the week” is NASA beating big tech to a Mars landing. Kara’s win is Google employees making bold statements about their company on her recent podcast.
