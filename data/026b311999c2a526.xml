      <title>Introducing 'Reclaimed: The Story of Mamie Till-Mobley'</title>

      <title>Whoopi Goldberg &amp; Joy Behar</title>
      <description>Taped in July 2021 when they were working from home before returning to hosting the show in the studio, the two “View” greats Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar sat down to take a look back at their time on the show. For 23 seasons, Joy has been making us laugh since the show premiered in 1997. She is the longest-running host in "View" history and brings a mix of her comedy and strong political opinions to the table every day. Whoopi joined the show in 2007 as moderator and has been at the helm of the table ever since. They talk about why they joined the show and look back at their time with other co-hosts and some of the most buzz-worthy moments when they became the Hot Topic.

      <title>Raven-Symoné, Candace Cameron Bure &amp; Sara Haines</title>
      <description>Raven and Candace became famous as successful child stars and they both joined the show as co-hosts in 2015, sharing the table with Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Paula Faris, Michelle Collins, and Sara Haines. They both made the decision to leave the show after one season. This week, Sara Haines talks with them about all the ups and downs Raven and Candace experienced together – from their toughest moments, to the pressure they felt to speak up for certain communities, and how the 2016 election changed everything for them.
