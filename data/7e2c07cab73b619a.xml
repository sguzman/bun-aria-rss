An open place to admit no one really knows what they&apos;re doing. On today&apos;s episode, Christina broke her ankle! And so the main mommy is reporting from her home studio because moms never have a day off. On a lighter note, we find out which one of the booth boys would be the best and worst to room with, Victoria&apos;s Secret&apos;s new &quot;successful model&quot; campaign, and the ever important wiping debate. We dish out some pretty helpful advice to a couple of listeners about dudes with commitment issues and making a career changes so be sure to hear what Christina and the team have to say! Christina P. wants to hear from you since she is seriously lacking in cool mom friends. If you want to share a &quot;Pazsitzky Effect&quot; or &quot;Mom Hack&quot; please call into our voicemail (213)375-5184 and let Christina know! We want to talk to as many moms across America as we can.</itunes:subtitle>

Not only the most REAL show for moms, but the most interactive. An open place to admit no one really knows what they're doing.</p> <p>Christina just had her 44th birthday and she got RIPPED. Christina goes into a bit what it was like doing standup back then. Christina teaches Nadav about basic bedding and hygiene practices and they go back and forth on figuring out what a husband wants vs what a wife wants. Hint: one is universally much easier to figure out than the other. Then we get into some absolutely genius mom hacks, some terrible mom fails, AND we ask "Where My Dads At?!" We hear from the dad listeners about what their spouse does to annoy them the most.</p> <p>Christina P. wants to hear from you since she is seriously lacking in cool mom friends.

A young lady has started therapy but isn't sure she likes her new shrink. How do you know it's time to bounce? A young man has gotten his life and now can't understand why others can't get theirs!

      <title>Ep 154: Big News! Drama of the Past, The Art of Not Trying so Hard and Korean Soaps!</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week I share some big news and get super deep after suffering a cold in bed (inferior immune system = weakness) and watch so many great TV shows. The wisdom of Korean Soap Operas and "This is Us". Why is it that the more we want something, the more it eludes us? Also, how to get over your own story and start living in the present! I answer some emails  - a wife is sick and tired of making her husband's sandwiches and wonders if she's being his mom. A young man wonders if he should give up on his dream. A guy writes in with a fetish he's really ashamed of. Should he be? All this and more! Let's get our lives and get super deep, bros. </p> <p> </p>

      <title>EP 147:Getting the F*ck out of Your Comfort Zone</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode I talk about how the only way to get anywhere is to do stuff you don't feel comfortable doing. How do we do that?? Also, why does every self help guru talk about "doing what you love"? That phrase seems so empty, but I think I can make sense of it. I answer emails - one person wonders if they should quit their horrible job. Another emailer asks if I've ever felt isolated from friends. Also, should a 19 year-old girl with so much going on start a podcast? What if her friends laugh at her? All this and more. Let's get super deep on it all, bros! </p>

      <title>Ep 141:  Getting Free From Societal Boxes &amp; Taking up Space</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>A sweet millennial writes in asking how someone gets out the boxes society puts you in. This episode is all about that. Why do we sometimes live small and how do we get into taking up some goddamn space? How do we recognize society's rules then get ourselves out of the Matrix? A woman who wants to pursue her Master's degree in Social Works wonders if her school choice is a reflection of her wanting to please others or herself? We get into external validation. A young woman has a 22-year old friend who has been hitting the booze hard lately. Should she say something? It's all here, bros. Let's get deep and GET YOUR LIFE!</p>

      <title>EP 135: HAPPINESS (GACK!)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>A topic I seldom discuss - happiness! I came back from my vacation and had so many epiphanies about the nature of joy and why we may be afraid to feel it. Also, some deep ass emails from listeners - a girl is in a class with her rapist. What should she do? A woman wonders how she will ever trust men again. A 24 year old used to be an 8 and is now a 5 and is bummed about it. Does that make her shallow? Mommy P goes off the deep end philosophically, tangentially on this one! You won't wanna miss. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A listener wrote in asking why nobody talks about the in between times - the place in the marathon where one just runs. So this episode is all about the in between. A newly pregnant woman writes in about having non-thrilled emotions about being pregnant. Is she not meant to be a mother? Should a young lady travel alone? A man wants to make a career change but was told when he was young that he wasn't good at school. How should he get his life? And a mom confesses she is guilty of "shutting it down" wear. How does she incorporate some fashion into her busy life? All this and more - let's get DEEEEEEEP!</p>

      <title>Ep 128: Getting the Control Thing Under Control</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode I get deeper into codependency and control - all the fun stuff like what if you don't have to react to things right away? How obsessing never helps and boundaries in general are good things. Reading a book about it called "Codependency No More". Also, my latest analysis of Molly Sims' Youtube page - FYI she's way better at Momming than I am.  Who the fuck is updating their "story" on Instagram constantly?! More lessons from social media. I answer an emailer who wants to hang with her ex - should she? Another lady is depressed despite keeping a structured daily routine - should she take anti-depressants? My first emailer from Manila writes in about how to get her life in the Philippines. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week I explore codependency. I've always thought it was a thing only Alcoholics dealt with, but it's so much more! 15 Signs you may be a codependent (a list I found on the internet). Samantha writes in asking for advice - her internship is killing her and her relationship. What should she do? A depressed college student doesn't know how to ask for help. We get our lives on this episode in a very deep way, bros! </p>

      <title>Ep 125: Deserving the Ankle Socks (and all the other Good Stuff)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I bought a pair of ankle socks after a lifetime of suffering sockless in Vans. It lead to an epiphany of how much we let ourselves have the "good stuff" - socks, friendship, leisure time, love, money, success, health - all of it. What separates those who believe they deserve the good stuff from the rest of us? The Great British Baking show again reveals powerful Buddhist lessons. An emailer writes in saying he's lost 90 pounds, but why does he still feel crappy inside? A newly single man writes in for dating advice. A 22 year-old boo boo millennial is filled with anxiety about what her next step should be! How can we all GET OUR LIVES!?!?! I will show you! xoxo </p>

Something tells me staying up all night obsessing over it is an indicator...We saw a lady with enormous hangers at dinner. Should she wear a bra????? Am I a sexist pig for demanding it? I answer emails - how do you know you've found the right therapist? How does one deal with anxiety? Should I send my kid to Catholic School even though I'm not Catholic? All this and more, GET YOUR LIFE!</p>

I answer emails - how do you know you&apos;ve found the right therapist? How does one deal with anxiety? Should I send my kid to Catholic School even though I&apos;m not Catholic? All this and more, GET YOUR LIFE!</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>EP 123: FEELINGS (GACK!), THERAPY AND MOVING ON FROM MORMONISM</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week I reflect on Paul Gilmartin's podcast, Mental Illness Happy Hour Episode 330. He has a therapist on and they discuss co-dependency and the importance of feelings. How do parents mess you up by not letting you have feelings? You're about to find out! Also how do you learn to have feelings after you've spent years accommodating others? Could this be the importance of therapy? How we see reality thru our own perception goggles and living in the past vs now.  I answer emails from a woman who wonders if she has to teach her kid to swim even though he's terrified of water. A woman is in a sexless relationship. Jena calls in and we discuss her Mormon upbringing and how she escaped! </p>

      <title>Ep 122: Anxiety and the Millennial&apos;s Guide to Social Interaction</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week during a romantic getaway with the husband, I had a pretty mind-blowing epiphany. I discuss why the idea of  closure is total 1980's bullshit psychology. Why the show Better Call Saul is really about embracing your inner piece of shit. Each week I get countless emails from Millennials who struggle with inter-personal communication. It's no wonder why - your parents have raised you to be terrified of everything.  You've been over-parented into feeling hopeless about making friends. This episode I'll teach you how to talk to strangers. Also, I discuss my own emetephobia (fear of vomiting). This episode has so much deepness, I could barf! J/K NEVER!!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>How is Rick Ross tied to Marxism? You're about to find out! Also self care.

      <title>Ep 119: The Horrors of  Approval Seeking and Perfectionism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I watched 13 Reasons Why and loved it almost as much as my beloved BH90210.  High school sucks donkey dicks and in this episode I uncover why. The compelling reasons to attend college (to become interesting and drink Zima). My favorite new British Baking Show contestant and the deepness of her victory. It's not just about avoiding a soggy bottom! Why you can't necessarily DO everything. I mean you can, just not perfectly. How do we make peace with doing things imperfectly. Also, what are our limits and who defines them? A 34 year-old single woman writes in feeling the panic of her biological clock ticking away. She's newly single and wants to find her forever jeans! The horrors of modern-day dating. A Mormon girl writes in and asks how she can get over her competitiveness. She hates games! It may have something to do with approval seeking...and the good opinion of others...The book I recommend is by Wayne Dyer, Your Erroneous Zones.</p>

      <title>Ep 118: Overcoming (Ignoring) Societal Norms</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I accidentally downloaded a Christian audio book but still managed to glean some wisdom about perfectionism before the endless bible quotes sent me running. Why is everyone else seemingly doing "it" right but me? I have a theory. All the great psychological truths are in Sesame Street.  I grew up in an era where girls were told they could be secretaries or hairdressers - how does one transcend societal norms?! An emailer asks if it's possible that he's already gotten his life at just 24 years old?  An overweight bro asks how to lose weight. I divulge my foolproof post-baby French methods. Such a big episode, let's get it alllllll, bros! </p>

      <title>Ep 117: Balance, Fear &amp; Addiction to the Awful</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode I discuss the myth of "shy actors" and why that's just code for being anti-social. Also, after a viewing of the film "Reality Bites" it occurs to me how insanely different life was in a pre-panopticon existence (fancy word). An emailer writes in asking how she can overcome her anxiety and irrational fears about quitting her job. Will she ever find another job ever again?!? A man writes in asking how to deal with his demanding mother. "Mummy, may I live my life?" And a woman addicted to a stressful job wants to know how to let go. It's allllll here and it's all so deep. Let's get our lives in this episode! </p>

      <title>Ep 112: When the Sh*t Hits the Fan</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This past week I had a flat tire during rush hour on the 405. What did I do???  It may have involved foraging for stale water bottles and Door Dash. Also, why do people always think other people have it so much worse than them? Being entitled to your story is important. How many Existential Crises are normal within a year and what should you do when shit gets REAL? You'll find out. I answer an email from a good guy who can't seem to get the girl. Why are people disingenuous with others - like the ridiculous Garth Brooks videos oozing praise on the lighting guys? I read responses from people who have worked as psychics! Are they real?  You'll have to get your entire life and find out. </p>

      <title>Ep 111: Starting Over - The Temporary Nature of Identity</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode I discuss the phenomena of over-parenting, narrating every aspect of your child's experience and other people's shitty kids. Also, what is so bad about "starting over"? A friend is on the verge of a major life change but is reluctant because he'd be "starting over". What does that mean and why are we so hell bent on staying the same? Our sense of identity is important, but it can also be holding us back. A woman emails about her annoyance with writer Elizabeth Gilbert's recent news of becoming a lesbian. Why would someone suddenly turn gay at 40? Also what wisdom can be gleaned from the film "Mona Lisa Smile". You're about to find out and get your life. </p>

      <title>EP 105: CAN YOU LOVE &amp; HATE YOUR MOMMY AT THE SAME TIME?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The 24 hour work cycle has become the worshipped paradigm for Americans. Crush it! Never Stop! But is it really the way to go? Also, I discuss ambivalence and how it can change your life! Did you know you can simultaneously love and hate something at the same time?! My shrink taught me all about that. The Mommy Myth and how it has made American Mothers feel like shit. Also some listener emails - one gal wants to get her life, but is afraid of being by herself. Why does she get freaked out when she's not doing something? A man has BBD syndrome (Bigger, Better Deal) with women. What's going on here and how can he get his love life? </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>My husband won the weight loss challenge. Well, technically both Tom AND Bert won. What motivates someone to make a change? I think shame and self loathing are wonderful motivators! I had an epiphany about social media - I finally GET IT! Cameron Dallas is adorable and a millionaire and now I KNOW WHY! I answer emails - one man is a 30 year-old sociopath virgin who needs to get his life. Shitbag parents who call once a year to borrow money. What should you do?  Let's get all deep and change it all this year, BROS.  </p>

      <title>Ep 103: I Hate in You What I See in Myself</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode I get deep on a talk given by Alan Watts. He references Carl Jung and his "Element of Irreducible Rascality" - meaning Jung was a fully integrated deep ass bro who accepted all parts of his emotional world. He had a rascally twinkle in his eye because he accepted what was guilty, shameful and anxious in himself. Being someone who has all these feelings, I'd like to know how it's possible to feel all these things and not get all wound up over it. Also, why are people rude to wait staff? Jung may have some insight into that as well. Let's get deeeeeeep on it, bros. </p> <p>  </p>

      <title>EP 102: Creating What We Defend Against (And Other Stuff I Unconsciously Do)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This holiday season, I'm most thankful for my therapist. I have a breakthrough regarding my neurotic need to stop being like my parents. I explore the idea of "creating what we defend against" from the Course in Miracles. Also, what does it mean to live small and how do we not do that in 2017? I saw Star Wars and love the Orphan Mythology - how powerful the theme is and how it can be applied to our lives. Also, more on drinking the Motherhood Kool-Aid. I drank more of that shit and found myself deep down a rabbit hole of maternal insecurity. There's so much to get deep on, you may wanna just put on a black turtleneck and beret to listen. Light a cigarette, hide from your boss, LET'S GET DEEP for the last time in 2016!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>As my in-laws are here, I sneak into the studio and record this episode. I'm reading about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - just the first half of the book - but I feel like I know where it's heading. No more negative thoughts! Also, let's talk about aging. Why is it perceived as the worst thing imaginable in our culture? Also, is marriage for everyone? And what do you do with a partner/loved one who is addicted to drugs? Do you let them come over for the holidays and make everyone uncomfortable as F*ck? Let's get deep on it and celebrate, yo!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Every time I put an ornament on my tree, I hear my mother's voice "You're doing it wrong! You can't mix gold with silver!" I have a radical thought about liking myself...An emailer asks if she should quit her dream of being a social worker because of a failed first gig. I discuss failure and why it's such a loaded word. Speaking of words, do we have to be ultra sensitive about what words we choose? Did the PC movement of the 90's work? This European-American has some thoughts on that...let's get our lives and get DEEEEEEEP on it. </p>

      <title>Ep 92: &quot;But What IS Normal?&quot;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>My whole life, I've wanted to violently beat anyone who chalks up shitty behavior to the phrase "but what IS normal?" Despite the psychological community's insistence that there is no norm, I think there is. If you've grown up in a dysfunctional home, you know for a fact there IS a "normal" and it probably involves not getting hammered and throwing plates of food at each other. In this episode I discuss the traits of adult children of Alcoholics - but I have a feeling you don't need a drunk Mommy or Daddy to relate to a lot of this stuff. Let's get deeeeeeep as fuck on it, bros. </p> <p> </p>

      <title>Ep 71: Patti Smith, Mapplethorpe &amp; Inventing the Self</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Remember when people looked like people? I got into Patti Smith
on my hiatus from That's Deep Bro and went on a freedom odyssey
that lead me to the big, black dongs of Robert Mapplethorpe. What
can we learn from big dongs, crooked teeth and the 70's? That maybe
you can invent who are you are and stop worrying so much about
conforming. Freedom! </p>

      <title>Ep 23: Leisure Time - Where Did it Go?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode I discuss what it means to take a break and just be a person. I took 4 days off and realized that leisure time is something Americans hate. Why is that? Jean Baudrillard has some answers, as does Max Weber. Also, I read Dan Harris' book "10% Happier" about his journey into finding meditation. A great book for anyone deeply skeptical about the self-help guru world. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Stranded in a snow storm in a hotel room in DC, I cover Phenomenology, Husserl and Merleau-Ponty. Phenomenology is the study of subjective perception and Merleau-Ponty grounds perception in the body and in the "flesh of the world". How French is that? I also look at what it means to "stay present". It's the buzz phrase of the time, but how in the hell does anybody really do that? Also, what does this have to do with Pippi Longstocking? All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy...listen to my lunatic snowed-in ramblings. </p>

      <title>Ep 13: Forgiveness with Paul Gilmartin</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Nietzsche thought forgetfulness was essential to human existence, without it "there could be no happiness, cheerfulness, hope, pride, immediacy..." Forgetfulness is similar to forgiveness in that it requires we let go of negative emotions that harm us. But how does one forgive the unforgivable? Nazis? Child molesters? Do they deserve forgiveness? My guest Paul Gilmartin of the Mental Illness Happy Hour discusses how he forgave his abusive mother. Brutally honest and touching, you will love this episode.</p>

      <title>Ep 10: How Well Can We Know Another Person?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode I talk to the love of my life, comedian and husband Tom Segura. We usually talk about farts while podcasting, so this is a little bit weird. We discuss the idea of the Other and whether or not you can really know another person. I mean, I think I know Tom, but he really enjoys shows about murder...We explore Martin Buber's idea of I-Thou vs I-It relationships. What does it mean to really love someone? Does it mean you love them even when you don't feel like it? Sometimes...You'll just have to listen to find out. </p>

      <title>Ep 9: FAME with Nick Youssef</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I don't know anyone who openly admits to loving the Kardashians. If everyone hates them, who in the hell is watching all their shows? In this episode we discuss fame and celebrity. Who deserves to be celebrated? Why do we hate certain celebrities? Is it possible that famous people serve a function in society other than just annoying the hell out of us? Why can't I stop watching (and being on) reality shows? My buddy Nick Youssef and I get into all of it. </p>

      <title>Ep 7: Duncan Trussell</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode didn't need a topic, it just needed Duncan Trussell. Professional mind-blower and joke teller, Duncan and I discuss everything. Is God a loving, benevolent force or an evil deceiver? Does evil even exist? Are there boundaries between people or are we essentially the same being? Do we have a soul? What about a self and a Self? Who the hell is Neem Karoli Baba and is how is he related to Adam Corrolla? Strap yourself into your spaceship, because we are about to blast off into the outer limits of space and time! </p>

      <title>Ep 6: What is Consciousness &amp; Does LSD Help us Better Understand it?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>What is consciousness and can we access parts of our minds that we normally can't with the use of psychedelics? This episode we discuss the 1960's Harvard Psychologists Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) and their use of LSD to explore the mind. What is thought in the first place? Can we even know how we know? If I drop too much acid will I go insane and be convinced I'm an orange? My guest has done LSD about 50 times and can provide us some insight into the psychedelic world. She prefers to remain nameless and thus gainfully employed.</p>

      <title>Ep 4: The Absurd &amp; Existentialism with Matt Fulchiron</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>By far one of my favorite topics in philosophy, the absurd. You know that whole "What's the point? What the f$%k am I doing all this for?" feeling. I'm sure Camus wouldn't define it that way, but that's absurdity. Matt Fulchiron and I get deep on feelings of the absurd, with some sprinkling of Existentialism. Where does one find meaning in a seemingly meaningless world? Ahhhh the French get deep like no other.</p>

      <itunes:summary>By far one of my favorite topics in philosophy, the absurd. You know that whole &quot;What&apos;s the point? What the f$%k am I doing all this for?&quot; feeling. I&apos;m sure Camus wouldn&apos;t define it that way, but that&apos;s absurdity. Matt Fulchiron and I get deep on feelings of the absurd, with some sprinkling of Existentialism. Where does one find meaning in a seemingly meaningless world? Ahhhh the French get deep like no other.

Ryan was in the midst of some major life events at the time of this recording - his first marriage and expecting his first child. Staring down the barrel of some major life changes, Ryan and I figure out the best way to deal with it all. It may involve smoking a lot of weed and drinking copious amounts of wine.

      <title>Ep 2: Pornography with a Mystery Guest</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, my mystery guest and I discuss the topic of pornography. My guest, who prefers to remain anonymous, edited porn for 5 years and now that he’s out of the biz has some great stories to tell. From the smells to the squirts, he shares it all. We discuss the philosophical aspects of porn, namely degradation vs. liberation, the rise and acceptance of raunch culture and why we secretly hate porn stars. Now that porn is more accessible than ever, is it necessarily a good thing and why do I feel profound shame after watching it? Maybe that’s just my problem…enjoy this episode. </p>

      <title>That&apos;s Deep Bro Episode 1 Jenny Pentland and Why We Aren&apos;t Happy For Very Long</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This isn't your mother's podcast. The first episode of That's Deep, Bro covers some ideas found in Buddhism like non-attachment, suffering and what it means to be happy. With my guest Jenny Pentland, we explore the idea of why as humans we are never really happy from external things and how we can achieve a sense of well being in a world that is always changing. And Jenny knows a little sumpin' sumpin' about change. The daughter of legendary comedian Roseanne Barr, Jenny has lived thru many changes and bizarro experiences that would break anyone's spirit. Thankfully, Jenny has a fantastic perspective on life and graciously shares it with us. Have you ever found out your parents were getting a divorce from reading the tabloids? Ever had Tom Arnold as a stepdad or spent 5 years in various mental institutions? Jenny has and surprisingly has hilarious stories about all of it. You'll laugh, you'll cry (we did a few times, no really) and at the end you'll say "woah, that's deep, bro."</p>
