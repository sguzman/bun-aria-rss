   <media:description>After years of trying to get his rap career off the ground, Joseph Foreman (aka Afroman) struck gold with a cautionary tale about the consequences of excessive weed smoking. “Because I Got High” began gaining traction throughout the South but once it made its way onto Napster and the Howard Stern show, it became an unlikely mainstream hit. Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes starred in the iconic music video and featured the track in their film “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back”, and the song eventually became a #1 hit in 11 countries. VICE meets Afroman to retell the story of his perennial stoner anthem, and speak to Kevin Smith about his experience being a part taking the song sky high.

   <media:description>The Camorra is one of the oldest criminal institutions in the world, but how it functions in Naples is changing. New child criminal gangs, and the rise of stunting on social media, as opposed to the long-standing rule of omertà, means that the Camorra seemingly will never be the same. 

VICE heads to the infamous Le Vele Di Scampia, and Parco Verde, to meet a child gang that operates there, and a social worker trying to prevent these children from ending up in the clan, prison, or dead. For the first time on camera, we will hear directly from Camorra members, speaking about how they recruit and use children.

   <media:description>Louie Lingard aka NotLewy hates &quot;inspiration porn&quot; and has garnered millions of followers on TikTok for making crude jokes that make fun of his physical disability. Despite his success, comedy isn't his passion. He wants to be a rapper but when he creates content about his music (and not about his disability) his views plummet. He feels stuck between what the TikTok algorithm wants and what he wants.

   <media:description>During the weekdays, Georgio T. works as a massage therapist in Fairfield, CT. He owns a home, has friends, and enjoys a fairly simple life. But on Friday and Saturday nights, Georgio drives into NYC where he wraps himself in a carpet and allows people to step on him at various paid gigs and kink parties. 

What started as a kink (he realized he liked the feeling of weight on top of him as a child when his cats would walk on top of him), has turned into a full-blown, secondary source of income. Now, he’s committed to providing an unmatched, optimal experience for participants to ensure that he “gets rehired for more gigs”. 

NYC gigs range from birthday parties, S&amp;M parties, costume parties, Burning Man parties, etc. Georgio has even thrown his own and plans on organizing a series of events at the Rockaways + Fort Tilden this summer (donations encouraged but not mandatory).

   <media:description>ABDL stands for ‘Adult Baby Diaper Lovers,’ a niche corner of the fetish sphere filled with squirmy littles, extra large onesies, and lots and lots of diapers. In this world, nostalgia and childhood reign supreme, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all lifestyle. Some might find the adult baby aspect therapeutic, while others just find soiling diapers kind of hot.

   <media:description>Russian soldiers are banned from using their smartphones. But a lack of discipline and a desire for attention means they use them anyway. Their posts online provide a wealth of data about their side of the war. 

Journalist, ​​Mark Krutov, uses this information to track the locations and movements of Russian troops, as well as their low morale and sinking mood.

In our series Super Users, VICE World News explores the latest technology being used to fight crime, trafficking, climate change and social injustice.

   <media:description>Against the backdrop of a brutal war, thousands of young Ukrainian hippies gathered in the mountains for a giant party: the annual Shypit Festival. Nudity, psychedelics, and dancing around the fire chanting “**** Putin” ensued.

For many, this was their last chance to party before being conscripted to the front lines.

   <media:description>The most publicized wrestling rivalry of all time, Andy Kaufman vs Jerry “The King” Lawler, left many wondering where the line between reality and fantasy blurred. Wrestling Historian &amp; Personality Jim Cornette takes us through it all, from Kaufman demanding that women get “back in the kitchen”, Kaufman's public demise at the hands of Foxy, Lawler’s illegal piledriver move that sends Kaufman to the hospital, and coffee thrown across the desk of David Letterman. This abridged tour of the biggest public farce of all time will leave you with a new understanding of the *real* meaning of wrestling.

From Executive Producers Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Dany Garcia, and the creators of the groundbreaking DARK SIDE OF THE RING comes the exhilarating new series TALES FROM THE TERRITORIES that reunites iconic, larger-than-life wrestling legends as they relive their most outrageous, jaw-dropping, unbelievable-but-100%-true stories from inside and outside of the squared circle. Tune in Tuesdays at 10P on VICE TV.

   <media:description>VICE meets Natasha Bedingfield to reflect on her uplifting 2000’s hit “Unwritten” and its viral moment during the peak of the 2020 pandemic. The track was vital to her cross-over success in the US, topping the radio charts for its pure pop sound and incredible vocal performance. Fast forward almost 20 years, VICE speaks to those closest to Natasha to understand the emotions of such a heartwarming track and travel to Ft Lauderdale, Florida to meet the TikTok dancers who created the viral dance craze.
