			<description><![CDATA[<p>What do you wanna do in your life?</p>
<p>This was the question that led me to the path I've taken and my journey towards that life I want to live. This podcast is a time capsule that documents what I've done and gone through but more importantly, who have helped me in every aspect and stage of this journey. All the struggles and challenges I've encountered in the last 12 years were all worth it and honestly might have discouraged me if not for my village. Thank you to each and every guest for going back through time with me and sharing all the nuggets of wisdom you all so generously gave to me and to my community. Thank you to my team for making this podcast happen. Thank you to my community for listening and sharing the love. I wish this motivates you and gives you that push that you need to go for your passion and dreams. You got this!</p>

Monifa Mortis
Monifa is a perfectionist in the best way. She lives in the details. She is the kind of artist that can teach as well as she creates. I am an immensely better artist because she taught me how to think for myself and ask myself why I&apos;m doing what I&apos;m doing. You&apos;ll hear us talk about the importance of confidence in artistry and how to develop it.
Show Topics:
How to manifest your dream
How to be a confident artist
How to stand strongly in knowing your worth
Speaking up for your client
How to be collaborative

<p><strong>The True Story of A Beautypreneur</strong></p>
<p><strong>A capsule collection of Delina Medhin's career journey and the village it took to build her beauty enterprise.</strong><br>

Delina believes that every person needs their own village to achieve success. No one person can do it all by themselves. The motivation and the push to reach for your dreams and live it comes from within and from people you meet. Sometimes, even the not-so-good feedback drives you more to prove them wrong and in effect, they have also helped you reach your goals.<br>
<br>
In 'It Takes A Village,' we start with Delina's aha moment from when she decides to quit her job and start living her life as a creative freelance artist. We get to meet family members, friends, mentors, and colleagues. We'll hear about relationships and stories that are as real and honest as they can get. Listen to all the episodes and we're sure you'll begin to reflect on your own dreams, passion, career, and of course, your own village.<br>
<br>
This is Delina's village and you're about to be a part of it.</p>
<p>Welcome to It Takes A Village, The True Story of A Beautypreneur.</p>
