    <description>For nearly 100 years, one family traded influence and held power in the South Carolina lowcountry until a fatal boat crash involving an allegedly intoxicated heir-apparent shed sunlight on a true crime saga like no other.  Award-winning journalist Mandy Matney has been investigating the Murdaugh family since that fateful night in 2019.
The now-infamous Murdaugh family is at the center of a litany of criminal investigations into fraud, obstruction of justice, the 2021 double homicides of Paul Murdaugh and his mother Maggie, the 2015 murder of young Stephen Smith, the suicide-for-hire plot of family patriarch Alex Murdaugh (who has since been charged with Paul &amp; Maggie’s murders) and a vast insurance scheme that preyed on the region's most vulnerable citizens.
Matney's podcast, ranked #1 globally in 2021, provides unmatched insight into the horrific deaths, botched investigations and newly-uncovered crimes that are all interconnected.  Every corner of the justice system seems to be connected to this vile web of deceit, murder and corruption. 
Now featuring Co-host Liz Farrell, you’ll follow along in real time from South Carolina as their exclusive sources guide listeners on a journey to expose the truth wherever it leads.

      <title>Who Killed Maggie and Paul? Part Five (S01E66)</title>
      <description>With fewer than 90 days left before Alex Murdaugh’s double-murder trial, we take a look at all the evidence we suspected, but now know to exist in the case.
Also, Mandy and Liz take another look at a fiery two-hour pre-trial hearing last month where Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin did their best to throw doubt on the state’s case, but Creighton held his own and Judge Newman kept the peace.

      <title>Land of No Consequences: ‘Judge Mullen Is Wanting To Make Stuff Up’  (S01E65)</title>
      <description>Last week we revealed that 14th Circuit Judge Carmen Mullen — who has been a key figure in the Murdaugh world — tried to create a crime and orchestrate the arrest of a man with psychiatric vulnerabilities in her neighborhood five years ago. This week, we have the recordings showing what she did — and her behavior is far worse than it sounded on paper. Once again, Mandy and Liz take on the judicial system and call on the state Supreme Court to stop looking the other way on judicial misconduct. 
I don’t know how many more disturbing stories the justices on the Supreme Court of South Carolina need to hear about Judge Carmen Mullen or how many more times her integrity needs to be publicly questioned before they pull their heads out of the sand and take action.

Stay tuned for a bonus episode of Cup of Justice this week as we peer deeper into this mess and the circus of a hearing last Thursday.

      <title>Cup Of Justice Bonus 5: Motions, Motives &amp; Mullen</title>
      <description>Mandy Matney took a moment to chat with Liz Farrell and Eric Bland to review a few legal maneuvers from the Murdaugh camp.
Plus the team discusses a bombshell police report that alleges Carmen Mullen (spelled “Judge Mullins” in the report) injected herself into a neighborhood dispute and attempted to use her judicial position to incarcerate one of the parties without legal authority.
Thanks to quick thinking by BCSO deputies, the injustice stopped there. Listen to COJ #5 for the whole story and SUNscribe to our email list to get the full police report as you follow along with a FULL Cup of Justice.
You won’t want to miss this!!

      <title>Cup Of Justice Bonus 4: A Surprise Recording and The Sacrificial Loser</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Before the wedding this weekend, Mandy Matney, Liz Farrell and Eric Bland took a moment to discuss the big surprise that Russell Laffitte dropped on Palmetto State Bank last week — that he has recordings proving the bank’s board was aware of what he was doing. Does this mean Russell secretly suspected he was being set up as the fall guy? How many more recordings does he have? Could Russell Laffitte bring down his family’s bank in an effort to avoid prison time?

      <title> The Curious Case of Arthur Badger (S01E64)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>In this episode Mandy and Liz dive deeper into the Arthur Badger case and share how Russell Laffitte, Alex Murdaugh and potentially others allegedly aimed to reap benefits from the Badger family’s unimaginable tragedy.
Despite how egregious it is and despite how much it has exposed the underworld of Alex Murdaugh, these circumstances deserve a more critical examination than they’ve received thus far. Names you’ll recognize like Corey Fleming, Carmen Mullen and others continue to pop up and we get some great insight from the indefatigable Eric Bland.
Plus - we look at new developments in the Beach’s civil case against the Murdaughs and Parker’s.

      <title>Cup of Justice Bonus 3:  Motives and Motivations - What's Up Next For Alex Murdaugh?</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>As we reported in MMP this week, the Judge Hall reversed his earlier order that basically split the "boat crash" case in two and allowed the Murdaughs to indefinitely postpone that trial so Alex could prepare for his speedy murder trial. The Attorney General’s Office told us the murder case still hasn’t been scheduled. 
While we wait for those crucial announcements, Mandy Matney, Liz Farrell and Eric Bland want to share some conversations about what might be happening behind the scenes.

We all want to drink from the same Cup of Justice — and it starts with learning about our legal system. What questions do y’all have for us? Email info@murdaughmurderspodcast.com and we'll do our best to answer your questions in these bonus episodes.

      <title>Who Are They Protecting? Part One (S01E63)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Recent revelations and legal filings have us wondering if investigators are maintaining the momentum needed to hold all of Alex Murdaugh’s alleged conspirators accountable. Or are they taking a page from the Good Ole Boys handbook and hoping that one man’s punishment will get the public to shut up and move on?
Mandy and Liz share their take on journalistic ethics as it pertains to victims, dive deep into recent motion filings, and take a look at the entangling alliances within the federal and state justice systems.

      <title>'Rich People Problems': The Victimization of Russell Laffitte (S01E62)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Russell Laffitte and his wife, Susie, gave an epically tone-deaf performance in an effort to get one of his two ankle monitors removed earlier this month.
Mandy and Liz take a hard look at a recently released transcript of what went down in federal court on Sept. 6. What should have been a run-of-the-mill hearing, was anything but as Russell and Susie tried to convince a judge that he too is a victim of Alex Murdaugh. 
We also hear a powerful response from Alania Plyler and stay tuned for more detailed legal analysis from Eric Bland this Friday on our new Cup of Justice Bonus Episode.

      <title> Who Killed Stephen Smith? Part Six (S01E61)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>In this episode, we caught up with Stephen’s mother, the wonderful and resilient Sandy Smith, and Mike Hemlepp, Jr., the Columbia attorney who stepped up to help after Sandy’s previous attorney let her down.
We asked Sandy and Mike where things with the case stood and how they felt about everything. While the case gained some momentum last year after SLED took it over from the South Carolina Highway Patrol, it’s now 15 months later and we were hoping by now to know more. 
Mandy and Liz take a new look at Stephen’s case. And now, we’re angry and demanding answers. 

IF YOU KNOW who killed Stephen Smith, or who covered up this crime, please call:
Crime Stoppers of the Lowcountry: (843) 554-1111
Mike Hemlepp’s Office: (803) 373-1706
Or Email info@murdaughmurderspodcast.com

      <title>‘If You Come For The King, You Best Not Miss’: Chaos In The Murder Case (S01E58)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>This last week was another roller coaster of insanity in the Murdaugh Murders Saga. Murdaugh’s defense team has amped up their strategy to fool the public and create chaos in the double homicide case and - per usual - mainstream media is happily helping them with that.
Mandy, Liz  &amp; David poured through a pile of documents filed in the last week – and dove deep into Harpootlian’s press conference. 
We also cover the latest — including new indictments filed against Russell Laffitte, Alex Murdaugh, and two new defendants that plunge this saga deeper into mystery.

      <title>Broken Trust &amp; The Unseen Villains (S01E57)</title>
      <description>Just when you think the Murdaugh saga can’t get any worse, along comes Greg Parker....
An owner of a chain of local convenience store is estimated to have spent millions to minimize his liability in the Mallory Beach wrongful death case and has aimed his ire toward the people with the least amount of power.
In this episode Mandy &amp; Liz  take a look at two shocking admissions Parker made to Valerie Bauerlein in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend; and we correct the record on journalism.
Plus comments from Sandy Smith's attorney Mike Hemlepp.

      <title>'The Magic Men' - What Happened To The Plyler Sisters? (S01E56)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>The Plyler sisters were just little girls when Alex Murdaugh and Russell Laffitte entered their world. 
Now, more than 15 years later, they are discovering all the ways these two men (allegedly) secretly enriched themselves off their settlement money. We talk with Alania Plyler about what it was like having Russell Laffitte as her conservator and the betrayal she now feels knowing what he was doing the entire time.
Plus legal analysis on what duties a conservator is supposed to perform from Eric Bland.

      <title>Our Entire System On Trial  (S01E54)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>We believe the entire system is on trial here. And it’s time the Attorney General’s office starts understanding that citizens of South Carolina demand transparency and zealous attention to restore public faith.  

In this episode we take a deep dive into the perplexing prosecution strategies and deliberate defense strategies swirling around the various criminal charges pointed at Alex Murdaugh. 

Mandy and Liz revisit odd statements made by the Murdaugh camp early in the double homicide investigation and how their original purpose might be making more sense. 

Plus spirited analysis from Eric Bland and more on Russell Laffitte’s upcoming bond hearing for new federal charges including bank fraud and wire fraud.

All the while, we are left wondering why Creighton Waters appears to have lost his initial confidence and we search for reasons behind Attorney General Alan Wilson’s absence from the fray.

      <title>Alex Murdaugh To Be Charged With Killing Wife Maggie And Son Paul (S01E52)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Agents from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) are scheduled to present evidence against Alex Murdaugh in the double homicide of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh this Thursday July 14, 2022. 
THAT IS A BIG DEAL.
In this episode, you’ll hear from the journalists who have been covering this story since 2019 — Mandy Matney and Liz Farrell explain what this news means, how we were able to report it, and what’s coming next. Could this be a capital murder case? When we will know more details about what happened on June 7, 2021. 

You’ll also hear from Eric Bland, an expert in South Carolina lawyer misconduct, who explains why there could be a potential conflict of interest for the defense attorneys in this case. While the news this week is huge, this saga is far from over. We still need answers for all of the victims in this case.

      <title>"Overkill" : Incoming Call From Alex Murdaugh - Part Four (S01E51)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Mandy, Liz, and the team dive deeper into the jailhouse phone calls with shocking revelations.
After listening – and relistening – to hours upon hours of of tapes, we have a better understanding of how Alex’s family sees this tangled web playing out in the media. 
You'll hear what Alex says, and doesn't say about Maggie and Paul in heart wrenching, but very telling conversations with Buster, John Marvin and Liz Murdaugh.
Plus an update on Eddie Smith’s arrest, and the money laundering, drug and other charges he faces with alleged co-conspirator Alex Murdaugh.

      <title>Incoming Call From Alex Murdaugh - Part Three (S01E50)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>In this special 50th episode of the Murdaugh Murders Podcast, Mandy, Liz, and the team do another deep dive into the jailhouse phone calls obtained recently by the MMP team.
After reviewing the tapes, we learned a lot more about Buster’s University of South Carolina Law School readmittance and the alleged $60,000 payment to Butch Bowers last fall. 
In this episode, we play several calls where this transaction is discussed and Mandy and Liz explain how this isn’t the first time the Good Ole Boys have been accused of interfering with USC Law School admissions. 

Also, you’ll hear clips from the Gloria’s Gift Foundation press conference and Eric Bland tells us why he’s weary of the Supreme Court’s recent decision on Alex Murdaugh’s law license.

      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>After officials released Alex Murdaugh’s jailhouse phone call recordings, we now have a much clearer understanding of the former attorney and volunteer solicitor’s relationships, plots, and life behind bars. 
The Murdaugh Murders Podcast has been working tirelessly listening to more than 100 phone calls between Alex and his family members. 
This episode will be one of at least two covering these public records. 
During this episode, you’ll hear Alex speak with his family about moving around assets before the receivership was in place. 
You’ll hear calls between Alex and his sister-and-law Liz Murdaugh — who is apparently one of his biggest supporters. 
You’ll hear more about Alex’s life behind bars and his family apparently supporting him no matter what was revealed about him. 
Stay tuned for more.

      <title>Means, Motive &amp; Opportunity - Who Killed Maggie &amp; Paul? Part Four (S01E48)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Tuesday marked the one-year anniversary of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh's murders. Unfortunately, there still have not been any arrests in the crime that has evolved into the most notorious murder investigation in recent South Carolina history. 
However, this week we broke some important news in the double homicide. 
Audio and video evidence obtained by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division shows that Alex Murdaugh was at Moselle in the moments just before the murders. 
In this episode, Mandy and Liz take you through everything we know about the double homicide — the means, the motive, and opportunity. 
We’ve learned in this case how important sunlight is — and you’ll hear attorneys Eric Bland and Ronnie Richter and FITSNews founding editor Will Folks talk about that. 
Also in this episode, we share good news in the jailhouse phone call case.

      <title>Overdrawn and Under The Radar - What Happened To The Money? Part Four (S01E47)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>A motion filed last week by John T. Lay and Peter M. McCoy Jr. — the two attorneys who were appointed as co-receivers in November 2021 to tally Murdaugh’s assets — revealed even more shocking and unheard of banking practices at Palmetto State Bank.

It’s yet another layer of this story that shows us how powerful institutions treated Alex Murdaugh differently and therefore, potentially played a role in his alleged crimes. 

In this episode, Mandy, Liz, and fan favorite attorney Eric Bland explain the new information uncovered by the receivers and what we know about what happened to the money. 

Also this week, the State newspaper published an interesting piece about Chris Wilson — the third attorney on the infamous Omaha flight. Will Wilson be a witness IF murder charges arise?

      <title>Alex Murdaugh’s Ground Zero: The Case That Changed Everything (S01E46)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>So today we want to take you back to the story that was the beginning of the end for the Murdaugh family’s 100-year dynasty and the fall of the Good 'Ole Boys in South Carolina— the boat crash that Killed Mallory Beach. 
This case is ground zero for everything we talk about in this podcast. Without this case, the Murdaughs’ grip on the Lowcountry might never have loosened.

The Beach case — which started as a fairly straightforward wrongful death claim — has become incredibly complex. Because of its intricacies it can become lost in the headlines to a degree.

The good news? A heroine has emerged in this complicated and tragic case. And she won her first round up against the Good 'Ole Boys. Mandy, Liz and David comb through every detail and development in the boat crash case — which has been full of shocking twists and turns. 

And a special thank you to our sponsors: Microdose.com, Priceline, Embark Vet, VOURI, Babbel, Article, and others. Use promo code "MANDY" for a special offer!

      <title>What Happened To Gloria Satterfield? Part Six (S01E45)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>We received new information from the attorneys and insurance companies who investigated Gloria Satterfield’s death. Not only do these new details raise more questions about what happened at Moselle the day of her alleged “trip and fall,” the new information highlights one of the major problems in this state: lawyers helping lawyers.
Also, on Friday the 13th, Charleston's Post and Courier published an opinion piece by the current and past presidents of the South Carolina Bar Association on behalf of the state’s 13,000 actively practicing lawyers saying that “recent news stories and commentaries have presented an inaccurate picture of our attorneys, judges and lawyer-legislators.”
However, this week, we’ve found documents that show that this heist could have never taken place if every South Carolina lawyer and judge involved were doing their jobs. 

The culture in South Carolina is ripe for corruption and the corruption happens because of attorneys who pretend the problem doesn’t exist and attorneys who are too afraid to stand up to those around them.

Also, on Friday the 13th, Charleston's Post and Courier published an opinion piece by the current and past presidents of the South Carolina Bar Association on behalf of the state’s 13,000 actively practicing lawyers saying that “recent news stories and commentaries have presented an inaccurate picture of our attorneys, judges and lawyer-legislators.”
However, this week, we’ve found documents that show that this heist could have never taken place if every South Carolina lawyer and judge involved were doing their jobs. 

The culture in South Carolina is ripe for corruption and the corruption happens because of attorneys who pretend the problem doesn’t exist and attorneys who are too afraid to stand up to those around them.

      <title>‘The Devil’s In The Details’: Russell Laffitte Indicted On 21 Charges + Bowen Turner Arrested (S01E44)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>The Good 'Ole Boys had a very bad week in South Carolina. 
Last Wednesday, the S.C. Attorney General’s Office announced three superseding indictments against Alex Murdaugh, his best friend Cory Fleming, and his banker buddy Russell Laffitte. 
Attorney Justin Bamberg, who represents the Pinckney family, joins us for episode 44 of the Murdaugh Murders Podcast. 
And trust us — “The devil is in the details.”

And, on Monday (5/9/2022), we found out Bowen Turner was arrested again and this time, he was denied bond

      <title>How Many People Will Go Down For This? Part Two (S01E43)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>As police are still investigating the five deaths that have been tied to the Murdaugh family, we’re trying to answer a big question in this case — what happened to the money?

Following the money has led us down some strange, unexpected paths in this story — especially in the last week when it was discovered that Alex paid $110,000 for a funeral home. This funeral home is linked to one of Murdaugh's alleged victims and also linked to a funeral director that once sawed a man’s leg’s off because he was too tall to fit in the casket.

We also share where the money went in the Hakeem Pinckney case… and which “associates” named in Alex's indictment benefitted from Pinckney's settlement. In this week’s episode, Mandy , Liz, and special guest Attorney Justin Bamberg take you through the paper trail of evidence and explain what it all means. 

And we have an exclusive bonus segment in this week’s episode: As Deadline first reported, a drama series based off the Murdaugh Murders Podcast in development at UCP, a division of Universal Studio Group. In this episode, you’ll hear from Erin Lee Carr and Michael D. Fuller — the creators and writers for the show in development— explain their vision and approach to the Murdaugh saga.

      <title>Who Killed Maggie and Paul Murdaugh? Part Three (S01E42)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Multiple sources have told FITSNews that high-velocity impact spatter was present on the shirt Alex Murdaugh was wearing the night of the murders and that this evidence has been independently analyzed and confirmed by multiple forensic experts — including by at least one out-of-state laboratory. 

In this special breaking episode of the Murdaugh Murders Podcast, Mandy , Liz, and Will dive into all of the details in the June 7, 2021 double homicide of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh — a murder investigation like no other. 

You’ll also hear from Linda Rourke, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, speak about high velocity impact spatter for you to get a better understanding of the the science. 

We also tell you about a big update in the Bowen Turner case.

      <title>Hutt-winked and Harpootlianed: The Good Ole Boys Strike Back (S01E41)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>This episode is about so much more than jailhouse phone calls right now. This is about the future of the justice system in our state.
Will we continue to stand by and let Good Ole Boys like Dick Harpootlian and Brad Hutto run our courts? Or is it finally time for a change?
In this episode, Liz, Mandy and David take you through every bit of Dick and Jim’s lawsuit — including all of their mistakes. You’ll hear from South Carolina FOIA expert attorney Jay Bender.

And we’re not done with the Bowen Turner case, either. Over the weekend, State Senator Brad Hutto called Mandy a “pseudo journalist.” And he sent a listener a shocking letter, which you’ll hear in this episode. 
We will be posting a call-to-action on our Facebook and Instagram pages soon, so stay tuned!

      <title>Bowen Turner &amp; The Two Systems Of Justice (S01E40)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>19-year-old Bowen Turner is accused of raping three women between 2018-2019. One of those victims, Dallas Stoller, died in November of 2021.
In this special episode of the Murdaugh Murders Podcast, you’ll hear from Dallas’ sister and father, who were in the courtroom last week when Turner got a shocking sweetheart deal of just five years probation. 
He won’t have to register as a sex offender. Solicitor David Miller of the Second Circuit Solicitor’s Office agreed to the deal. Judge Markley Dennis approved the sentence. 
Like Paul Murdaugh, Bowen Turner had the privilege of being represented by a state senator. State Senator Brad Hutto negotiated this shocking deal for his client to go free - even after he violated his bond conditions more than 60 times.
In this episode, you will hear from Mandy  &amp; Liz tell you exactly what went wrong in this case and how this case exemplifies a much bigger problem in our judicial system. 

You’ll also hear from survivor Chloe Bess, who was slut-shamed in court by Senator Brad Hutto after she was assaulted by Bowen Turner. 

How can you help?

      <title>Doubling Down On Duffie Stone - Conduct and Conflicts In The 14th Circuit (S01E39)</title>

      <title>"Dear Cory": Letters, Lies And The Law (S01E37)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>There is A LOT to unpack about Cory Fleming. So much, that it doesn’t all fit into one episode. But this week, we received a shocking document showing Fleming’s apparent defense — and it includes a letter and text messages between Alex and Cory as Alex sat in both a Florida rehab facility and a SC jail respectively.
In episode 37, Mandy, Liz and Eric Bland unpack both Cory Fleming’s bond hearing and his shocking defense in a plea to the Georgia Bar.
It seems like Cory isn’t going down without a fight, even after a hard fall from grace.

      <title>‘A Golden Day For Justice’: Cory Fleming Indicted On 18 Charges (S01E36)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes-1</link>
      <description>Suspended attorney Cory Fleming was indicted on 18 charges related to the Gloria Satterfield case. While we wait for his bond hearing, Mandy Matney, Liz Farrell and attorney Eric Bland unpack the latest indictments and what it means for the justice system. 
While Fleming was finally indicted, so many others who allegedly participated in this scheme have escaped accountability so far. 
Fleming’s arrest is a big deal — we will tell you why. 

And a special thank you to our sponsors: Cerebral, Hunt-A-Killer, Priceline, Embark Vet, VOURI, Hello Fresh, Babbel, Article, and others.

      <title>The Old Guard Is Changing: A Bombshell Deposition (S01E35)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>A recently released deposition has revealed troubling accusations about a powerful judge who is at the helm of criminal and civil procedures in the Lowcountry.  
If her involvement in the Gloria Satterfield case was as intentional as the depositions say, then the South Carolina justice system – where judges are pretty much untouchable – has a huge problem on its hands. 
In this episode, Mandy Matney and Liz Farrell pick apart Chad Westendorf's deposition led by Eric Bland.

And a special thank you to our sponsors: Cerebral, Hunt-A-Killer, Bannon Law Group, Nature's Highway CBD, Embark Vet, VOURI, Hello Fresh and others.

      <title>Above The Law? (S01E34)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>On Monday, Alex Murdaugh’s attorneys Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin filed a federal lawsuit in an attempt to block Richland County from releasing more jailhouse calls through the Freedom of Information Act.
In today’s episode, we tell you exactly why this case isn’t a typical true crime story and why Alex isn’t your typical (alleged) criminal. In this case, we’re dealing with a former public official and a whole lot of alleged public corruption.  
As we peel back the layers of history in the Murdaugh family, We see that Alex and Paul Murdaugh’s misdeeds didn’t happen in a vacuum. 
For decades, it appears like people have been looking the other way as the Murdaugh family’s unchecked power spun out of control.

      <title>Incoming Call From Alex Murdaugh: The Jailhouse Tapes (S01E33)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Get a rare inside look into the Murdaugh family dynamic and Alex Murdaugh’s manipulations from behind bars.
In this episode, Mandy Matney and Liz Farrell share recordings of Alex Murdaugh’s jailhouse phone calls to his son Buster, brothers John Marvin and Randy, sister Lynn and sister-in-law Liz.
These gripping calls reveal a supportive family that seems to be held captive by an utter narcissist who is really good at getting people to do what he wants.
Listen in as John Marvin informs Alex about the fallout from Alex’s alleged crimes. Hear Buster’s take on getting recognized while gambling in Las Vegas and his warning to Alex, “I’m not saying you are, but I really hope you’re not doing anything you shouldn’t be doing in there.” 
And witness Alex’s desperate attempts to get his sister-in-law to put money on another inmate’s account.

      <title>Jellyfish and Moselle - What Happened To The Money? Part Three (S01E32)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>The FITSNews.com team learned more about Alex Murdaugh’s ties to an alleged drug smuggler and it led us to... jellyfish?
In this episode, Mandy Matney and Liz Farrell walk you through complicated property transactions that could suggest there is more to them than meets the eye.
Considering the players involved, the millions of dollars missing, and the pieces of land they chose — everything should be inspected with a fine tooth comb. 
Check out some of these properties on this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StHXgB0oSoQ
Also in this episode, Liz and Mandy explain exclusive details from the Moselle sale.
And! Bonus! You will hear from Eric Bland in this episode, too.

      <title>Drug Smuggling And Operation Jackpot - What Happened To The Money? Part Two (S01E31)</title>
      <link>http://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Some of the biggest questions in this case revolve around the money — what happened to it? Why was Alex Murdaugh (allegedly) stealing it in the first place? 
Does it have anything to do with the murders?
To understand Alex Murdaugh’s ties to drug trafficking and find answers to the money questions— we need to look at a man who was a good friend of the family. A man named Barrett T. Boulware. 
In this episode, you’ll hear about the Murdaugh family’s ties to alleged drug smugglers and look at how this plays into the big picture. 
Check out a video explanation of the Murdaugh / Boulware properties we discuss in this episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StHXgB0oSoQ
Research in this podcast was provided by Will Folks And Jenn Wood.

      <title>Who Was Maggie Murdaugh And What About Buster? (S01E30)</title>
      <description>You asked, we answered. 
Our followers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram submitted hundreds of questions about the case in the last week. 
A lot of you asked questions about the Murdaugh’s family history – who Maggie was... Who buster is... What was in Paul’s criminal past? What was in Alex’s criminal past?
How did these people with so much wealth, power and privilege become the family in the center of a snowballing crime ring?
In this episode, Mandy Matney and Liz Farrell dive into these very important questions. You’ll hear from Kim Brant, a Hampton local, who tells us about another side to Maggie that hasn’t been reported before. We tell you everything we know about Buster Murdaugh, the older Murdaugh son often lost in this saga. 
And in later episodes, we will answer more of your questions. Stay tuned and thank you for listening.

      <title>How Many People Will Go Down For This? (S01E29)</title>
      <link>http://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>After Friday’s indictments, Alex Murdaugh now stands accused of stealing at least $8.4 million and faces 74 charges.
If the latest indictments told us anything, it’s that Alex did not do this alone - but how many people will go down for this?
And how bad will this get?
In this episode, Mandy Matney and Liz Farrell walk you through every detail of Alex's newest indictments that appear to hint others are involved and may face indictments of their own soon.
Attorney Justin Bamberg, who is representing at least 8 clients in this case, joins us in this episode. Justin explains how deep loyalty is in a place like Hampton, South Carolina — and how betrayed the people there feel as they reckon with the truth behind two of their most lofty businesses.

** In the last episode, it was said that Russell Laffitte was the former president of Palmetto State Bank. He is the former CEO.

This episode was written by Liz Farrell.

And a special thank you to our sponsors: Cerebral, Betera, Aura Frames, Hunt-A-Killer, Bannon Law Group, Nature's Highway CBD, and others.

      <title>What Happened To Hakeem Pinckney? Part One (S01E28)</title>
      <link>https://murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Hakeem Pinckney was an inspiration. He spent his whole life overcoming the odds. 
His hearing started deteriorating at a young age, but he never complained. In fact, he won a national championship in football when he was a senior at the SC School for the Deaf and Blind. 
But when he was 19, he was in a horrific crash with three other family members that forever changed his life. For Hakeem, the injuries would leave him a quadriplegic dependent on a ventilator. In 2010, Alex Murdaugh, Corey Fleming and Palmetto State Bank's CEO Russell Lafitte began representing passengers of the vehicle accident, including Hakeem who was paralyzed but aware.
But he persevered. His mother Pamela told us that he was improving before he died suddenly in 2011. 
10 years later, Pamela learns that Murdaugh allegedly stole insurance money from the Pinckney family after the accident, and again from Hakeem's wrongful death settlement against his care facility after his ventilator was mysteriously "unplugged".
In this episode, you'll hear the powerful voice of Hakeem's mother Pamela, from his former teacher, and from Justin Bamberg, who now represents at least 8 of the alleged victims of Alex Murdaugh. Justin's sights are set on justice, while Pamela just wants to know what happened to her son - something she never received from the first set of settlements.

      <title>Who Killed Maggie &amp; Paul? Part Two (S01E26)</title>
      <link>https://murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Almost seven months after Paul Murdaugh and Maggie Murdaugh were murdered in Colleton County, South Carolina, multiple sources close to the investigation said physical evidence directly ties Alex Murdaugh to the double homicide.
We've been told that this evidence is substantial, serious and directly links Alex to this gruesome crime. 
And that is a BIG deal. 
In this episode, Mandy Matney and Liz Farrell reveal new information in the case as we put everything we know into context. 
Do all roads lead to Alex?
Also on this episode, we hear from South Carolina attorney and lawmaker Justin Bamberg again — who has stepped into the arena as a voice for victims. 

And a special thank you to our sponsors: Cerebral, Betera, Aura Frames, Hunt-A-Killer, Bannon Law Group, Nature's Highway CBD, and others.

      <title>Taking On "The Firm" - Part One (S01E25)</title>
      <link>https://murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes-1</link>
      <description>“The law firm dropped the ball here…”
Previously on the Murdaugh Murders Podcast, we told you about how Alex Murdaugh is accused of stealing more than ​​$6.2 million in alleged schemes related to his fake FORGE accounts at Bank of America dating back to 2016.
He’s accused of stealing millions of dollars from clients while he was a partner at the law firm started by his great grandfather - PMPED. 
But so far, PMPED has escaped accountability. 
While PMPED partners have been claiming to “make Alex’s victims whole,” it appears like something else was happening behind the scenes. 
On this episode, we speak with South Carolina attorney and lawmaker Justin Bamberg — who has stepped in the arena as a voice for victims. 
Bamberg says a lawsuit, and possibly a class action, is likely coming against PMPED. He asks any of Murdaugh’s former clients believing they were taken advantage of to call his law firm at 803-956-5088 or email him at pmpedmypockets@bamberglegal.com.

As you know, we are a mission-driven podcast - we expose the truth wherever it leads. 

While accomplishing this mission we always take care to respect victims and we are sensitive to the traumatic nature of this story.  We are also very sensitive to our fans - many of which have requested MMP merchandise. We believe we have found a great way to accomplish both of these goals:

      <title>Alex Murdaugh Charged With 21 New Felonies (S01E22) </title>
      <link>https://murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>The disgraced South Carolina attorney, Alex Murdaugh, was hit with 21 new felonies from the state Grand Jury. His bond hearing — which was surrounded by skeptism — was postponed and that is a very big deal.
In this episode, we discuss each one of the seven new indictments involving Alex’s alleged scheme and his new bond hearing which was mysteriously postponed.
Sources have told us they expect to see hundreds of charges against Alex when all is said and done. 
Some sources have told us that this case is going to be the biggest case of fraud the state — and maybe even the country — has ever seen.

      <title>Attorneys At War - Part One (S01E21)</title>
      <link>https://murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Alex Murdaugh‘s “bulldog” defense attorneys, Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, have apparently launched a war on Satterfield family attorney Eric Bland.
While this might seem like a giant distraction to some, it’s important to take a deeper look at these recent moves by Dick and Jim to figure out what exactly is going on here. 
Are they really trying to silence Eric Bland?
Or is this just about egos?
Lucky for us, Eric is not intimidated by the recent actions of the defense, and you’ll hear from him a lot this episode. 
You’ll also hear from attorney Lauren Fox, a South Carolina Bar member, for legal analysis on these recent jaw-dropping actions. Also in this episode, Liz Farrell and Mandy Matney cover the recent judge "switcharoo" in this case and what that could mean.

You’ll also hear from attorney Lauren Fox, a South Carolina Bar member, for legal analysis on these recent jaw-dropping actions. Also in this episode, Liz Farrell and Mandy Matney cover the recent judge "switcharoo" in this case and what that could mean.

On this tragic call, you can hear Maggie Murdaugh &amp; Paul Murdaugh describe Gloria's condition as the 911 operator battles to glean information from each.
Mandy Matney &amp; Liz Farrell take you through everything they know about Gloria's injuries and the mysterious documents surrounding her death. You'll also hear from Eric Bland, who now represents the Satterfield family, with his take on this disturbing call.

      <title>Alex Murdaugh Charged With 27 New Felonies And Why That Is A Big Deal (S01E19)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>On Friday, November 19th, we learned that prosecutors issued 27 additional felony charges against Alex Murdaugh bringing the total possible jail time to over a hundreds years and our sources believe that could be just the beginning.
In this special edition we'll review the 27 new counts and expand on the implications as we introduce our new partner in true crime, Liz Farrell. Liz was there when Mandy first discovered inconsistencies in the only document recorded in the Satterfield settlement which blew the lid off a saga like no other.
In this episode you'll hear a moment between Mandy and Eric Bland in which he explains all the dominos that had to fall in order for Murdaugh's litany of crimes to come to light.

      <title>How Many Crimes Will Alex Murdaugh Be Charged With? Part One (S01E18)</title>
      <link>https://murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>There are currently seven criminal investigations related to Alex Murdaugh and we'll review the salient points in each to capture a bird's eye view of this heinous saga. The Murdaugh name appears repeatedly in police interviews during the investigation of Stephen Smith's murder, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. In this episode, we'll review the funds Alex is alleged to have stolen from the Satterfield estate by false pretense, an obstruction of justice allegation stemming from the criminal investigation of Mallory Beach's death, his identification as a person of interest in the brutal murders of his wife and son, the alleged "suicide for hire" plot and resulting criminal charges, and the new reports of alleged ties to drug gangs, smugglers and perhaps beyond.
For more details on these seven investigations, we encourage you to listen to the following episodes:

Who Killed Stephen Smith? Episodes 2, 4, 9, 17

What Happened To Gloria Satterfield? Episodes 10, 12, 13, 14

Who Killed Mallory Beach? Episodes 3, 5, 7

Who Killed Maggie &amp; Paul? Episode 6

Who Shot Alex Murdaugh / Was Alex Murdaugh Actually Shot? Episodes 8, 11, 15

What Happened To The Money? Episode 16

      <title>Who Killed Stephen Smith? Part Four (S01E17)</title>
      <link>https://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>While a lot of the recent Murdaugh Murders news has focused on Alex Murdaugh, his insurance fraud schemes, and "assisted suicide" plot, we want to make this episode 17 about Stephen Smith. Because his life mattered too. 

In this episode, we’ll revisit the December 7, 2015 anonymous tip to South Carolina Highway Patrol, examine the December 9, 2015 alternative theory presented by Hampton law enforcement, and the eventual interview six months later which concluded the SCHP investigation into Stephen's brutal death.

      <title>What Happened To The Money? Part One (S01E16)</title>
      <link>https://murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>On Tuesday, November 2, 2021 Judge Daniel Hall ordered an injunction and appointed receivers to manage and recover funds that could pay alleged victims currently suing disgraced attorney Alex Murdaugh.
Hall made his decision four days after attorney Mark Tinsley presented his arguments to appoint two outside parties — attorney John T. Lay Jr. and former U.S. attorney Peter M. McCoy Jr. — to have control over Alex and Buster Murdaugh’s assets, which is known as “receivership” in the court.
We also hear from the attorney representing Gloria Satterfield's estate, Eric Bland whose investigation into the handling of Gloria's insurance settlement uncovered a heap of evidence which SLED and the SC Attorney General's office used to charge Alex with fraud and other indictments.

      <title>Was Alex Murdaugh Actually Shot? Part One (S01E11)</title>
      <link>https://murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes-1</link>
      <description>Alex Murdaugh was allegedly shot in a botched "Assisted Suicide Plot" on Saturday, September 4th, 2021.

According to arrest warrants, Alex Murdaugh concocted a scheme to commit suicide with the help of Curtis "Eddie" Smith so his son Buster Murdaugh would receive a $10,000,000 insurance payout. Smith's attorney Jarrett Bouchette rejects this assertion. We also hear claims from Murdaugh's defense attorney and prosecutor's pleas for enhanced monitoring while out on bond for multiple felonies.

Mandy addresses Dick Hartpoolian's comment made during Murdaugh's bond hearing.

In this episode we explore the new developments brought about by attorney Eric Bland and his righteous pursuit for justice.

      <itunes:subtitle>While a lot of the recent news has focused on Alex Murdaugh, we want to focus episode 10 on Gloria Satterfield's Death.   Because her life mattered too. </itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Gloria Satterfield died suspiciously in 2018 following an alleged “trip-and-fall” incident while working at one of the Murdaugh family homes. In this episode we explore the new developments brought about by attorney Eric Bland and his righteous pursuit for justice. Gloria was much more than a housekeeper for the infamous Murdaugh family - she was a mother, a friend and a member of the Hampton community.

      <title>Who Killed Stephen Smith? Part Three - (S01E9)</title>
      <link>https://murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>While a lot of the recent Murdaugh Murders news has focused on Alex Murdaugh, we want to make this episode 9 about Stephen Smith. 
Because his life mattered too. 

The Murdaugh name was brought up more than 40 times during the course of the investigation of Stephen Smith’s death in 2015. 
In this episode, we’ll hear SCHP patrol investigator Todd Proctor interviewing several Hampton Kids about Stephen ’s death. 

And a special thank you to:

      <title>Who Shot Alex Murdaugh? Part One - (S01E8)</title>
      <link>https://murdaughmurderspodcast.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Nearly three months after his wife and son were murdered, Alex Murdaugh called 911 to report that he himself had been shot Saturday, September 4th, 2021. His attorney told the press that he Alex was pulled over to repair his vehicle along Salkehatchie Road in Hampton County en route to Charleston when a motorist opened fire toward Murdaugh's 2021 Mercedes SUV. However, the lead investigating agency, SLED, has not confirmed those details. This special episode explores all the available details on the incident.

      <title>Who Killed Mallory Beach? Part Two - (S01E5)</title>
      <link>http://www.murdaughmurderspodcast.com/</link>
      <description>In a previous episode, we explored depositions and audio evidence from the 2019 boat crash in which the recently murdered Paul Murdaugh was eventually charged with Boating Under the Influence and causing the death of 19 year old Mallory Beach.  
While there are a number of victims connected to this saga, we want to remind everyone that Mallory Beach was a bright young lady who lit up every room she walked into. On this 5th episode of the Murdough Murders Podcast, we look at newly released evidence from SCDNR and other agencies we expose what went wrong in that investigation to ensure law enforcement agencies are doing everything they can to achieve justice for all the victims connected to this saga.
