Did closing schools during the COVID-19 pandemic serve students and society at-large? As part of a World Bank Advisory Panel, University of Chicago economist Rachel Glennerster is taking a closer look at the long-term economic cost of learning losses. Addressing these costs, estimated at greater than $10 trillion, will be crucial to future education policy and pandemic response.</description>

In this episode, we talk about the remote work revolution. It is now more than two years old, and it’s a worldwide phenomenon, at least in wealthier countries. Economist Steve Davis has been studying the staying power of work from home around the globe, and finds that not only is it here to stay, but it’s prompting larger societal questions about everything from worker power to the viability of urban city centers.</description>

      <title>Can Economics Save the World? A Panel Discussion with 2019 Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/beckerfriedmaninstitute/can-economics-save-the-world</link>
      <description>The United States is facing a range of challenging policy issues, from trade to inequality to climate change. The good news is that academic economists are doing cutting-edge work to help solve the challenges of the day, at the University of Chicago and institutions around the world. Over the past 20 years, there has been increasing momentum toward evidence-informed policymaking. While this seems promising, barriers still exist to bridging the divide between academia and government.

On November 19, the Becker Friedman Institute for Economics (BFI) welcomed MIT Professor of Economics Abhijit Banerjee, recipient of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics and co-author of the forthcoming book, Good Economics for Hard Times. Banerjee joined a panel of experts, including UChicago’s Katherine Baicker, Michael Greenstone and Steve Levitt, along with the Obama Foundation’s Adewale “Wally” Adeyemo, to share their experiences and perspectives on the potential for economics to improve policy outcomes, the obstacles that exist to evidence-informed policymaking, and opportunities for improvement.

Follow along with Banerjee's opening remarks and view his presentation: https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/CanEconomicsSavetheWorld_Presentation.pdf

      <title>Crony Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics, Featuring Chang-Tai Hsieh</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/beckerfriedmaninstitute/cocktails-and-conversation-with-chang-tai-hsieh</link>
      <description>The Becker Friedman Institute for Economics (BFI), the Chicago Economics Society (CES), and the Booth Alumni Club of Washington, DC, welcomed Chang-Tai Hsieh, Phyllis and Irwin Winkelried Professor Of Economics, Chicago Booth School of Business, for cocktails and a conversation on Crony Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics. David Rank, former Deputy Chief of Mission and Charge’ d’Affaires at the U.S. Embassy in China, moderated a discussion following Professor Hsieh’s remarks.

Professor Hsieh discussed how China’s fast-paced growth over the past three decades is one of the most remarkable events in world economic history. This growth was fueled by the introduction of pro-market policies, especially in agriculture and trade. However, China’s national institutions continue to restrict property rights and hinder private business development, among other obstructive policies. To counter those forces, China has developed a system of crony capitalism at the local level that has allowed businesses to thrive. Political leaders benefit when local businesses succeed, so those leaders use their power to enhance certain businesses’ success. Local political leaders then compete with other cities for businesses, creating a competitive market that helps drive economic growth.</description>

      <title>Friedman Forum: How Do Individuals Repay Their Debt, Featuring Neale Mahoney</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/beckerfriedmaninstitute/friedman-forum-how-do-individuals-repay-their-debt-featuring-neale-mahoney</link>
      <description>When faced with debt across multiple credit cards, do people pay down their balances in a way that makes financial sense? On February 1, BFI hosted Chicago Booth Professor Neale Mahoney for a Friedman Forum luncheon lecture on his recent working paper, “How Do Individuals Repay Their Debt? The Balance-Matching Heuristic.”

In the paper, Professor Mahoney and his colleagues examine how credit card holders in the United Kingdom divide their payments between credit card balances. Instead of paying down the card with the highest interest rate first, the authors find people make payments based on the size of the balances on each credit card. These findings reveal the large gap between the optimal way to repay debt, and reality of how people repay their credit card debt.</description>

      <title>A Conversation with Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/beckerfriedmaninstitute/a-conversation-with-cass-sunstein-and-richard-thaler</link>
      <description>Traditional economics assumes rational actors. In daily decision-making, however, we all make decisions influenced by our biases and beliefs, whether which car to buy or who to vote for at the polls. As a result, outcomes often deviate from the standards of rationality assumed by economics.

Combining discoveries in human psychology with a practical understanding of economics – including incentives and market behavior – Booth Professor Richard Thaler, recipient of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Economics, and Harvard Law School Professor Cass Sunstein, recipient of the 2018 Holberg Prize and former Administrator of the White House Office of Information &amp; Regulatory Affairs, have revolutionized our understanding of how human behaviors can impact markets. Their work highlights opportunities to drive decision-making in a direction that improves outcomes for businesses, government, and society as a whole.

The Becker Friedman Institute for Economics welcomed Thaler and Sunstein, authors of the best-selling book "Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness," for a discussion about the power of behavioral economics to affect decision-making. BFI Director Michael Greenstone, the Milton Friedman Professor of Economics, the Harris School and the College, moderated the discussion.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Traditional economics assumes rational actors. In daily decision-making, however, we all make decisions influenced by our biases and beliefs, whether which car to buy or who to vote for at the polls. As a result, outcomes often deviate from the standards of rationality assumed by economics.

Combining discoveries in human psychology with a practical understanding of economics – including incentives and market behavior – Booth Professor Richard Thaler, recipient of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Economics, and Harvard Law School Professor Cass Sunstein, recipient of the 2018 Holberg Prize and former Administrator of the White House Office of Information &amp; Regulatory Affairs, have revolutionized our understanding of how human behaviors can impact markets. Their work highlights opportunities to drive decision-making in a direction that improves outcomes for businesses, government, and society as a whole.

      <title>Economics Amplified: Rick Evans on How Computer Science is Transforming Economics</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/beckerfriedmaninstitute/economics-amplified-rick-evans-on-how-computer-science-is-transforming-economics</link>
      <description>Richard Evans is a Senior Fellow in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago, and Fellow here at the institute. Evans sees immense potential in the methods, practices, and even workflows that computer engineers have implemented in their own discipline, and is working to bring those skills into Chicago economics through his role both here at the institute and via the Masters in Computational Social Science, a graduate program he’s a part of. 

Evans spoke to us about how we can expect to see computation shape different aspects of economic study, as well as the ways that computer scientists and software engineers can teach economists how to work smarter.

She visited the institute this spring and spoke about her recent work to evaluate policies that eliminate questions about previous criminal convictions from job applications Advocates of these “Ban the Box” policies have argued that these laws could increase employment for minorities, but some economic theories imply that they could have negative consequences for minorities without records.

      <link>https://soundcloud.com/beckerfriedmaninstitute/economics-amplified-measuring-long-term-outcomes-of-social-insurance-programs</link>
      <description>In this episode, we speak with Manasi Deshpande, who currently works at the Institute as a postdoctoral research fellow leading up to joining the UChicago Economics Department as an assistant professor in the fall of 2016. 

Deshpande’s research interests include the effects of social insurance and public assistance programs on consumption, health, and well being, and the interaction between these programs and labor markets. 

By taking advantage of newly available data from the Social Security Administration, she's able to gather quantitative insights into the impact that social insurance programs have on long-term outcomes of their recipients, important when weighing their overall benefits and costs.</description>

      <description>In this episode, we speak with David Weisbach and Jennifer Nou of the University of Chicago Law School, as well as Alan Sanstad of the Computation Institute and The University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. 

The trio of researchers organized a conference in April 2015 centered on a persistent issues for federal institutions: when making regulations and rules, how should policymakers account for what they don’t know: the uncertainties that could affect the long term costs and benefits of their actions? 

Weisbach, Nou and Sanstad sat down with us to talk about why getting policymakers and economic theorists together might hold the key to helping federal agencies best assess these uncertainties and understand how to address them in the policy process.</description>
