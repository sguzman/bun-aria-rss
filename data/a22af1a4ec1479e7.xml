      <description><![CDATA[<p>Now it’s Sasheer’s turn to be sleepy! This week on Best Friends, it’s Besting Each Other with Nava Kavelin & Penn Badgley! Nava shares her dreamy London day with Penn Badgley and his family, why you SHOULD use emojis when texting, and how Penn is good at keeping secrets (or just forgets the secret), and the perks of being a good neighbor. Penn shares how struck he was by Nava’s intelligence, purposeful friendships, and being on “do not disturb” maybe too much? Together they discuss Penn not setting Nava up, their company’s work to create fun education content for young people, their new podcast Podcrushed, and more. </p><p> </p><p>Here is a photo of Chris Evans’ wig: <a href="https://twitter.com/cevansbuzzcut/status/1555586643716968450?t=uc_81EcY3X0Q_H6_xI1SyA&s=19">https://twitter.com/cevansbuzzcut/status/1555586643716968450?t=uc_81EcY3X0Q_H6_xI1SyA&s=19</a></p><p> </p><p>Email or call Nicole & Sasheer with your friendship questions at:</p><p><a href="mailto:nicoleandsasheer@gmail.com">nicoleandsasheer@gmail.com</a></p><p>424-645-7003</p>

With Trixie they choose their celeb alter ego’s (Howie Mandel, Issa Rae, and Lizzo), and with Katya they discuss how painful the writing process is. Brought back together, they laugh over their different styles, being called “derpy,” interrupting to apologize for interrupting, and the masochism of waist-training. </p><p><br /></p><p>Email or call Nicole & Sasheer with your friendship questions at:</p><p><a href="mailto:nicoleandsasheer@gmail.com" target="_blank">nicoleandsasheer@gmail.com</a></p><p>(424) 645-7003‬</p><p><br /></p><p>This episode is sponsored by Lightbox Jewelry (<a href="http://www.lightboxjewelry.com/bestfriends" target="_blank">www.lightboxjewelry.com/bestfriends</a> code: BESTFRIENDS), MeUndies (<a href="http://www.meundies.com/bestfriends" target="_blank">www.meundies.com/bestfriends</a>), and High & Mighty.</p>
