Through it all, many incarcerated found ways to add beauty and joy into their long days and nights. They cultivated the dusty land around them, practiced their crafts, and created a sense of community and belonging. Though they never should have had to, incarcerated Japanese Americans showed strength and resilience from behind fences made of barbed wire.

The most underrated attribute in great leaders is humility which means that effective and trustworthy leaders are those who seek to understand first and be understood second. The working world has evolved since the start of the Covid pandemic and its leadership needs to reflect new practices built on the principles of “trust and inspire”. But what does good leadership in our communities and in our country look like? How can we apply the same principles about working leadership to leadership within our interpersonal relationships, and as we seek to lead change in our communities?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[On today’s episode of the Sharon Says So Podcast, we are thrilled to sit down with documentary filmmakers Ken Burns and Sarah Botstein. Their new docuseries, The <em>U.S. and the Holocaus</em>t, airs on PBS on Friday, September 18th, 2022 and highlights the nuances of America’s response to the Holucaust. Ken and Sarah talk about their work, and about how it can often be the little known, everyday people–citizens and desk-sitting bureaucrats–who can make a lasting impact on history. Heroism does not mean absolute perfection, and many historical leaders struggled with making decisions, sometimes wrongly or too late. But as Americans, we are often at our best when we commit to considering and acting on behalf of our fellow human neighbors.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Jodi was new to show business when she was cast as the voice of Ariel, and it wasn’t considered a “career maker” job; animated films in the 1980s weren’t wildly popular blockbusters like they are now.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon is joined by economic policy expert and author Heather McGhee. McGhee began her career as an economist but when she took a trip across the country and back, she began to ask herself, “Why can’t we have nice things?” We’re not talking about robot maids, but rather, the social stability of programs like affordable healthcare and well-funded public schools. While puzzling out the answer to this question, McGhee realized that racism was a major driver of stagnant economics for ALL Americans, not just for Brown and Black Americans. Listen in to find out why, and how we must rethink our zero sum mindset–my progress <em>over</em> yours–to gain the most amount of prosperity.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>On the last episode in our series, Momentum, Sharon ties up a few loose ends. The 1950s was a decade full of change, but the Civil Rights Movement didn’t end when the calendar flipped to 1960. Most of the people we’ve followed throughout this series continued their crusade for–or against–civil freedoms well into the next several decades.</p><br><p>We hear about Barbara Johns and the next steps in integrated schooling, about Earl Warren and the gains his Supreme Court made in the 60s.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>On the last episode in our series, Momentum, Sharon ties up a few loose ends. The 1950s was a decade full of change, but the Civil Rights Movement didn’t end when the calendar flipped to 1960. Most of the people we’ve followed throughout this series continued their crusade for–or against–civil freedoms well into the next several decades.</p><br><p>We hear about Barbara Johns and the next steps in integrated schooling, about Earl Warren and the gains his Supreme Court made in the 60s. We also learn about the reason behind his rift with J. Edgar Hoover, and how the FBI evolved over the years. Finally, Sharon returns to a Civil Rights power player, and we visit her in a new city, and with a new approach to activism.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

What began with a young boy who desired to connect with family and learn where his mother came from in Mississippi, ended in horror for the Chicago 14-year-old boy. Though no one will ever know exactly what happened in the grocery store co-owned by Carolyn Bryant leading up to the murder, history will show that what began with a lie from Bryant, resulted in the death of Emmett Till at the hands of Roy Bryant and JW Milam. Three days later, when his body was finally found, it was mutilated and nearly unrecognizable.&nbsp;</p><br><p>After viewing and personally identifying his body, his mother, Mamie, did something completely unexpected: She chose to have an open casket at his funeral. Photographs of his body circulated around the country, appearing in magazines and newspapers. “Time” later selected one of the photographs, showing Mamie over the mutilated body of her dead son, as one of the 100 most influential images of all time. They said, “For almost a century, African Americans were lynched with regularity and impunity. Now, thanks to a mother's determination to expose the barbarousness of this crime, the public could no longer pretend to ignore what they couldn't see.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The trial was held near where Emmett Till’s body was found. The courtroom was filled to capacity, and the town was overrun with reporters after the story captured national attention. The trial was electrifying. With all of the media attention, what did the all-male, all-white jury find in the verdict after 67 minutes of deliberation, and why?

						<description><![CDATA[<p>Today in our special series, Momentum: Civil Rights in the 1950s, Sharon begins with a woman who is surely familiar to anyone who has received a crash course on the Civil Rights movement in America: Rosa Parks. While Rosa Parks earned her position in history, this story does not begin with a tired woman who simply needed to rest her feet on a bus in Birmingham, Alabama. Before Rosa Parks, there was Lucille Times. And before there was Lucille Times, there was Claudette Colvin. Before Rosa Parks, there was Aurelia Browder, and Susie McDonald, and Mary Louise Smith. The Civil Rights Movement would be nowhere without the extraordinary and prolonged courage and efforts of women. In the words of Rosa Parks, “We must live our lives as a model for others.”</p><br><p>Following the Supreme Court ruling of Brown vs. the Board of Education, some leaders of the Civil Rights Movement believed this was their moment. A boycott of Montgomery, Alabama buses had been discussed for months, but leaders were afraid that the wrong person would stall their efforts if they became the face of the movement. This was one of several reasons why Rosa Parks was chosen for this role. But how did a bus boycott shape Civil Rights? And what does the arrest of another household name – Martin Luther King Jr. – have to do with this? Next time, Sharon will speak more on how M.L.K.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of Momentum, Sharon talks about America’s push to eradicate communists during the Red Scare and Korean War. Many people working toward the goal of civil rights and liberties shared links to the Communist Party, like William Patterson and Paul Robeson. In 1951, Patterson submitted a 237-page petition to the United Nations, called We Charge Genocide. After Patterson and Robeson presented their petition, the U.S. retaliated by seizing their passports, smearing their public image, and labeling the Civil Rights Commission as a communist-front organization.</p><br><p>Because of the country’s persecution of subversives and communists, the NAACP leaders were interested in assisting J Edgar Hoover in rooting out any “bad players” in the organization in order to protect it. In fact, Thurgood Marshall, who knew he was being spied on by Hoover, often acted as an FBI informant. He knew both the costs and benefits of cooperating. Do you think this was an effective strategy to distance the NAACP from the communist party? What about the organization’s push to rebrand themselves as an American organization? What exactly did Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King Jr. disagree about?

Do you think this was an effective strategy to distance the NAACP from the communist party? What about the organization’s push to rebrand themselves as an American organization? What exactly did Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King Jr. disagree about? Sharon reveals the source of their strife next time!</p><br><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

While Justice Warren was ultimately successful in leading the court to making a unanimous decision, the President who appointed him – President Dwight D.

						<description><![CDATA[On today’s episode of our special series, Momentum: Civil Rights in the 1950s, Sharon speaks with pulitzer-prize winning author, Gilbert King. It's Important for people to know that the popular narrative of the 1950s – depicted as a time full of sock hops, poodle skirts, and Rock &amp; Roll – was not the lived experience of many Black Americans. In numerous ways, their experience was often worse than what people commonly think of, particularly in the South, including forms of debt slavery. This leads us to The Groveland Four: A harrowing story of 4 young black men who were targeted, and wrongly accused of the rape of a 17-year old white farm wife in rural Florida. “Mr. Civil Rights” himself, Thurgood Marshall, learned of the capital punishment case and was eventually able to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, though not in time to save them all. How did he appeal this case to the U.S. Supreme Court? And what happens when the town sheriff takes the law into his own hands?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the first episode of our new special series, Momentum: Civil Rights in the 1950s. Today, Sharon introduces us to a few key people who became the driving force behind early Civil Rights activism. We meet a young man named Thuroughgood–a bit of a troublemaker who put his curiosity and sense of justice to work and sought incremental change through the legal system. Joining him in the fight against the longstanding legality of “separate but equal” was the McLaurin family. Together, they sued the University of Oklahoma, which gave George McLaurin admission to the graduate program alongside white students… but the journey to true equal learning had only just begun. Sharon also introduces us to another important person–arguably America’s most powerful man in the mid-20th century–who was both a help and hindrance to the Civil Rights Movement.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Patrick talks about how he researches his larger-than-life stories, and gives us a few teasers, like what it was like to interview a woman who is in the Witness Protection Program after testifying against her own brother, and how deeply he dove into the world of wine fraud and revenge. Patrick is fascinated by the choices people make, and what it takes to get inside their minds where they justify their actions, and perhaps even consider themselves the hero of their own stories.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon talks to Minnesota State Legislator Jen Schultz. Jen is currently running for Congress, and is also an educator who has taught economics at the University of Minnesota Duluth for about twenty years. Rep Schultz talks about the ins and outs of working in state government: how budgets are set as well as how bills are written, introduced, prioritized, and voted on. She touches topics like model legislation, which is when a state reviews bills that have passed in other states and looks at ways to adapt it to their state, how state legislators work together across the aisle, and what they do when the session has wrapped for the season (there’s a lot of door knocking involved). Shifting gears, Sharon and Rep. Schultz talk about her current run for Congress, how she plans to bring her state expertise to the federal level, and the value women bring to political office.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Jenna loved the refining process with her book, which saw it evolve from a business and marketing subject into a book that gets more personal, tackling topics like body image, loneliness, community, and personal intuition. Sharon and Jenna also touch on their shared sense of community living in the same Northern Minnesota city, and how to both tackle life’s challenges one small step at a time and say no when you need to.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon spends time speaking with Dr. Aaron Ahuvia, who is an expert on a specific kind of love: our love of things–things like places, objects, brands, and activities. The things we love tend to be part of our own identity: perhaps a part of our childhood, or something we spend a lot of time with. Aaron advocates for using our particular loves–poker, PEZ dispensers, sneakers, water sports–in leading us to others who share our common interests, and can be a catalyst in forging interpersonal relationships. But what makes us really love something? There’s a difference between finding value in an object or activity and <em>really</em> loving it. Ahuvia says one of three things needs to happen for us to feel a connection with a thing: the thing itself is anthropomorphic, or it connects us to another person, or it’s a part of our own identity. This fascinating discussion will have you wondering just why you love the things you love!<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

While gerrymandering predates our country, Professor Seabrook argues that it’s a bigger problem today than it has been in the past because we have more sophisticated access to data and technology. This access has flipped the script, and politicians are choosing their voters instead of voters choosing their politicians. Join the conversation as Sharon and Professor Seabrook talk about how we got here--the myths, the history, and what we can do to slow this threat to democracy.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Together, Sharon and Tabitha talk about Tabitha’s many projects, from her daily TikTok videos, her new restaurant, Kale My Name, her children’s show on YouTube, Tab Time, and even some of her recent collaborations.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon has a conversation with Judge Victoria Pratt, who’s new book, <em>The Power of Dignity</em>, looks at the ways in which respect in the justice system needs to go both ways. She shares her belief that we have a moral and professional obligation to look our for our neighbors; the whole community benefits when everyone is living their lives to their best and fullest potential. In the courtroom, when people are treated with dignity and respect, it increases their trust in the justice system and bolsters the authority of the people who uphold it. To increase public trust in our justice system, we must allow people to have a voice in the process, give them time to speak, ensure that the court process is neutral, and, above all, look people in the eye. Respect is contagious: everyone in court is impacted by how they are treated by those in positions of authority.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Our stories stink. When we fill our free time with passive consumption, we’re left with a narrative void that doesn’t enrich our lives. Donald’s new book, <em>Hero On A Mission: A Path to a Meaningful Life</em>, sets up readers to create meaning and nuance in the story of their lives. Sharon and Donald also talk about the two-party system in the U.S. and what it would take to have an alternative system, or add a third party.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon talks with Mónica Guzmán, whose new book, <em>I Never Thought of It That Way: How to Have Fearlessly Curious Conversations in Dangerously Divided Times </em>helps us learn how to get more comfortable with the uncomfortable. Monica argues that we need to chase “I never thought of it that way” moments we have in order to grow in curiosity. When we manufacture certainty, we tend to see people and the world around us as one-dimensional. It’s important to understand the views of others because we’re not always happy in our echo chambers; we lose relationships, we feel anxiety about the future, and we pin the blame wherever we can. Once we begin to get curious and shine a light on what we perceive as a threat, that threat feels less insurmountable. It’s through curiosity that we can begin to see people from multiple dimensions–they aren’t monsters, they are people, just like us.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Susan’s new book, <em>Bittersweet</em>, is about the undervalued power of a melancholic view of the world. Susan talks about how melancholy and bittersweet emotions are connected to our sensitivity and our sense of transcendence, and this view of the world is often overlooked. Instead, we can be bound by the tyranny of positivity: the cultural expectation that we should present a positive outlook at all times, regardless of what we may be experiencing or feeling. When we’re willing to take in the truth and complexity of human experience–the this <em>and</em> that of emotions–we leave ourselves open to a deeper sense of meaning, more gratitude, and forge more connected relationships.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Barb and Sharon talk about ways we can feel less overwhelmed by the news and negativity and be more confident with being ourselves (the world needs YOU, not a duplicate of someone else!) Barb also shares how she likes to combat repetitive negative thinking. There’s no use in wasting our precious, finite energy on negative things that, ultimately, aren’t going to help us live the lives we want to live. Instead, Barb champions getting to know ourselves well enough that we can make wise decisions and recognize our stressors in the moment so we can know our next step forward. That next step is important, and while it isn’t feasible for most of us to lighten the suffering of many, we can choose to use stressful moments to ease the suffering of someone around us with a smile, a positive thought, or a simple action.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon speaks with Vanessa Otero, the founder of Ad Fontes Media–the media company that is responsible for the dynamic Media Bias Chart. If you’ve follow Sharon on Instagram at @sharonsaysso, then you’ve seen her link to the Media Bias Chart many times. The conversation today centers around the importance of trust and reliability in the media. Ad Fontes analysts use the acronym RELI as news source benchmarks, which stands for reputation, evidence, likelihood, and incentive. As news consumers, it’s important for us to remember that true news&nbsp; journalism seeks to answer our questions, not provide analysis or opinion. We are used to thinking about news in a binary: real news vs. fake news, but as Vanessa explains, it’s more of a gradient of reliability, from a top tier of fact-based “who, what, when, where” news reporting down to misleading and inaccurate information. Most of our news media falls in the middle.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Will recently released his book, <em>American Reboot: An Idealist’s Guide to Getting Big Things Done</em>. In it, he details some of the issues he’s seen up close and personal through his careers, and carries with him his mother’s advice: you’re either part of the problem or part of the solution. Will talks about what being part of the solution looks like: appealing to the middle, not to the edges, showing up for people, and learning to inspire and not fear-monger. Will and Sharon also talk about the importance of America retaining its democracy, which may seem like a given, but is dependent on how we uphold the principles that support political involvement and freedoms.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon and entrepreneur, author, and podcast host, Jordan Lee Dooley have a discussion about the lessons to learn in the almost spaces of our lives. For many of us, achievement of one goal leads us to feel like the finish line is always moving; we’re always reaching to complete the next goal. Jordan advocates for slowing down and redefining contentment, and to consider it active engagement in our lives no matter where we are in relation to our goals. We can find this active contentment by looking for ways to serve, finding a hobby, getting curious, checking something off our bucket lists, and plugging in to a good community. The “almost” space is also a great place from which to pause and evaluate; sometimes our dreams shift and change, but change does not mean we have failed.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon talks with Zoe Chance, author of Influence is Your Superpower and Yale professor (who teaches the most popular course at the university: Mastering Influence and Persuasion). Zoe argues that the goal of mastering the path of influence is personal development and becoming someone people want to say yes to. An effective influencer respects the freedom, autonomy, and humanity of others. The goal of influencing the behavior of others takes a more nuanced approach than simply giving people information; increasing awareness is not enough to change minds. Sharon and Zoe use the example of voting, and the ways in which we can have an effective influence on increasing voter turnout.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Katharine, a self-described tomboy from the start, carried her strong-willed and independent nature with her to her acting, often imbuing her roles with&nbsp; a “vital something” that attracted audiences. But she wasn’t without her critics–those who felt she was rude and lacked the more feminine traits of a starlet.

						<description><![CDATA[In today’s episode, Sharon talks with author Julia Sweig about her newest book, <em>Lady Bird Johnson: Hiding in Plain Sight</em>. The research and writing took Julia over six years, as she meticulously poured over the details of not only Lady Bird’s life, but also the 1960s era and the state of the nation at the time. Lady Bird, a whip-smart Southern woman, met Lindon Johnson in Austin, Texas where he proposed to her at the end of their first date (she said no!). Eventually, the pair married and moved to Washington DC. As LBJ’s political career progressed, Lady Bird’s influence spread; she was a woman who showed up. Listen to learn more about Lady Bird: her real first name, the complexities of her marriage to LBJ, her relationship with the Kennedys, her environmentalism, and her propensity to document her life, from the major moments down to the mundane details.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon reunites with the hosts of Pantsuit Politics, Sarah and Beth, to talk about their brand new book, <em>Now What? How To Move Forward When We’re Divided (About Basically Everything)</em>. While we all want the next step to be solving conflict together, it’s not a realistic approach. Instead, think of asking “Now what?” as a catalyst for connecting with people in a more heartfelt way. The goal isn’t to fix other people, the goal is to strengthen our understanding about the complexities of human relationships. Seeking peaceful solutions looks like honoring other people’s stories, giving them the benefit of the doubt, and authentically showing our own beliefs and joys. The ways in which we live our beliefs is often varied; we show up in different ways during different stages of our lives.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In today’s episode, Sharon has a light-hearted conversation with her friend, Kendra Adachi, the genius behind The Lazy Genius books, podcast, and online collective. Kendra and Sharon first bonded over Kendra’s motto of “be genius about the things that matter and lazy about the things that don’t”, which can be applied to all areas of life–whether you’re in the kitchen or in the comments section of a political post. Kendra talks about the time she visited Sharon’s home with a film crew to help her reorganize parts of her kitchen using five steps: prioritize, essentialize, organize, personalize, and systemize. Copies of Kendra’s new book, The Lazy Genius Kitchen, are available on May 3rd (after surviving the harrowing adventure of&nbsp; being lost at sea!)<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

This elite group of men created and used a code used for relaying information between military units during World War II. The Navajo code is the only spoken military code never to have been deciphered, and the code talkers were instrumental in the victories of several battles during the war. They returned as unsung heroes because of the classified nature of their mission, living with their wartime secrets for more than 25 years before receiving official recognition by the U.S. government.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon sits down with psychologist and best-selling author, Dr. Edith Eger and her daughter–who is also a psychologist–Dr. Marianne Engle. When Dr. Eger was a young girl, she was a talented gymnast who trained for the Olympic games but was instead imprisoned at Auschwitz. As a survivor, she has written beautiful books full of light and healing. Dr. Eger advocates that we don’t ask “Why me?” but rather, “What now?”, which is a question that promotes action and an openness to change and possibility. Both Dr. Eger and Dr. Engle remind us that you can’t heal what you don’t feel; acknowledging our stories is a step toward freedom.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon sits down with author Shauna Niequist, who–along with her husband and young sons–moved from their suburban midwestern home to NYC. When her sons expressed discomfort and frustrations with learning a new way of living, Shauna set about softening their mindsets by writing “I guess I haven’t learned that yet” on a sticky note for the whole family to see. The mantra expanded, and Shauna realized that it pertained to both little life skills and larger life goals. When we give ourselves grace to live for a while in the state of uncertainty, we open ourselves up to curiosity, mistakes, possibility, and perseverance. Shauna and Sharon also chat about training ourselves to find delight in our days, what it's like to make writing a full-time job, and the joy of dinner parties.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Sharon walks listeners through how the U.S. acquired Puerto Rico through the Treaty of Paris, and how the island’s people are split on the issue of statehood. While many would like to see Puerto Rico become the 51st state of the U.S., others are hoping to see the island become its own independent nation. Sharon and Jeena also talk about Puerto Rico’s blue cobblestone streets, the many iguana species, and the brain-tingling fact that coconuts are not indigenous to the Caribbean island.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

After working hard for a successful career in traditional television journalism, Emma realized that she wanted better balance between her work and family, which led her to explore new ways to communicate the news to others, specifically mothers. She created her own daily newscast from her home, Momcast, and now curates news on her independent social media platforms.

Effective dissent looks like encouragement and collaboration for the good of many. Change does not always happen as an immediate result from going against the status quo, but it does open up others to the idea that there is more than one way to do something. It is healthy to welcome dissent into our lives and into our homes because it makes us realize that our perspectives are not the only approach to finding effective solutions.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon chats with Julie Bogart, creator of the award-winning Brave Writer program. Sharon and Julie talk about the benefits of leaving behind our information safety nets–the communities that only reinforce our own opinions–to explore information in new and open ways. Julie emphasizes that the best way to understand and care about each other is to be open to, and become fascinated with, different viewpoints. Being a critical thinker, and raising critical thinkers, does not mean we need to dismiss new technology all-together, but rather, find our “technological optimism.” If we’re going to be critical thinkers, we need to get in the habit of asking questions to understand instead of listening to argue.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

After the Civil War, rebuilding the country was a messy task, but Black Americans knew that creating educational opportunities for their children was highly important. What started in rural Virginia as the success of one teacher–Virginia Randolph–who put love, care, and oftentimes her own salary into her one-room school, grew into an unstoppable educational evolution for Black students. Learn about Randolph’s philosophies, the creation of the Jeanes Foundation, and the teachers who continuously pushed themselves to do the next needed thing for their students and their communities. <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Charlie talks about how he doubled down on his Midwestern character after realizing just how different he sounded to people when he traveled outside of the Midwest. He channels his dad and his grandfather in his comedy, turning on that gruff but unfailingly polite Wisconsinite personality. Sharon and Charlie compare their Midwestern upbringings, laughing together about what it really means to say, “<em>I’m fine</em>” in the Midwest, how catchin’ fish is like going grocery shopping on the lake, and the rivalry–and striking similarities–between Minnesota and Wisconsin.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Lyon, a “redemptioner” from Dublin, made a name for himself as a fierce Democratic-Republican when he got into not one–but two–scuffles with a congress member of the opposing party… during an active House session.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon talks with Dr. Paul Zeitz, author of Waging Optimism, about how to identify our complacency and make a move toward impacting the world around us. Together, the pair discusses how optimism leads to courage, and how courage leads to action. Oftentimes, making change requires experimentation; Plan A doesn’t always work out, so it’s good to have more than one Plan B in place. While it can be easy to feel discouraged that our actions don’t lead to revolutionary change, we can bolster our optimism by remembering that every action ripples outward and carries an impact. Two foundational ways to be a catalyst for change? Always be ready to act and continue to learn new things about how the system works so you can generate ideas on how to improve it.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Tubbs served as the mayor of his hometown of Stockton, CA. On a fast-track from Stanford University to the White House, Tubbs decided instead to return home, walking from door-to-door to campaign for a seat on city council and, ultimately, mayor. Sharon and Michael talk about what learning outside the box looks like, and how local politics is an ideal vehicle for change. Change can often happen faster at the local level, but making strides at the requires an across the aisle collaboration and willingness to innovate.

Dr. Becky and Sharon have a conversation about communicating the tough topics with our kids; how and when to share current event news so they feel safe. Dr. Becky argues that it’s not always the information that feels scary and off-putting, but the act of having to process it alone. As parents, it's our responsibility to support our children through our loving, supportive presence and guided conversations. Children need to learn distress tolerance in order to accomplish big, meaningful things, and we help by teaching them AVP: acknowledge, validate, and permit. Acknowledge that something is happening inside of you, tell your feelings why they make sense, and give your body permission to feel what it’s feeling.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Listen in as they swap their favorite facts about his blasphemous parrot, Poll, his early capture as a prisoner of war, his propensity for dueling, and even how his opposition to the electoral college shaped the future of federal politics. Andrew Jackson was very instrumental in the early growth of Nashville, and the state of Tennessee. It was there that he met and married his wife, Rachel… who was already married to someone else. While in office, he also completely paid down America’s national debt by vetoing many spending bills. He was a president who reflected the people: both their great flaws and their great abilities.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon is joined by FOX News and Forbes contributor, Richard Fowler, to talk about storytelling and how it shapes American politics. Richard shares how and why storytelling plays a powerful role in our democracy; people will not always remember the policy, but they will always remember the story attached to it. As well, Sharon and Richard explore how storytelling helps humanize others, enabling us to see them as an individual instead placing them in a collective category of people. Sharon and Richard discuss why polarizing issues do not have to be strictly black or white and why it is important to see the shades of gray. Join Richard and Sharon as they teach us how to empathize through listening to others’ stories and how we can spark change by telling our own. <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

A sacred place to the Lakota, <em>Tunkasila Sakpe Paha</em>, or Six Grandfathers Mountain, was transformed in the 1920s and 30s into what we know as Mt. Rushmore. The mountain’s complicated history includes broken treaties, a white supremacist sculptor, 14 years of construction, scads of dynamite, and the 60-foot tall faces of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon is joined by author Catherine Price, whose new book, <em>The Power of Fun: How to Feel Alive Again</em> explores the concept of fun and why it’s a necessary part of the human experience. Catherine set out to pinpoint the definition of “fun” and she found that universally fun experiences meet three criteria: playfulness, connection, and flow. Catherine explains why play is so much easier when we’re children, and how passive “fun” like scrolling through social media, is not an equal stand-in for active fun. Learn how to create the habit of noticing daily delights and embrace opportunities for fun.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Today, the Hershey Company produces over a billion pounds of chocolate each year, but its origins are much more humble. Milton Hershey, armed with only four years of elementary education, spent decades learning and honing his chocolate-making craft. His hard work and business acumen led to the company’s rapid success, as well as the growth of an entire town and tourist destination. Hershey is one of the most recognizable and most philanthropic companies in the nation, and it all began on farmland in rural Pennsylvania.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this solo episode, Sharon dives into some of the myths vs. facts about Manifest Destiny and the Oregon Trail. What did it really look like, in the mid-1800s, for a family to travel the trail from Independence, Missouri to the beautiful Willamette Valley region of Oregon? All-in-all, about 400,000 people traveled along the Oregon Trail in the mid-1800s, hoping to move from crowded Eastern communities to work the riches of the land out West. Much of what we know was probably gleaned from playing the computer game, The Oregon Trail. Chances are, it was one of the first games you played in your youth on a computer, but do you know its humble Minnesotan history?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Sharon returns for a solo episode about the musical that opened the floodgates to the nation’s obsession with Broadway. <em>Oklahoma!</em>, the infamous Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, opened on a Broadway stage in the spring of 1943. It was wildly successful from the get-go, and it ushered in the golden age of musical theater. Listen while Sharon explains why <em>Oklahoma!</em> hit such a nostalgic chord with audiences who longed for the simple joys of homesteading on the American Frontier. You’ll also learn how the musical was reworked from its original play which had been written by a Cherokee man who came of age as Oklahoma was declared the 46th state of the Union. (This episode may also contain some singing!)<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Kristina gets candid about her childhood with Sharon, talking about the survivor’s guilt she felt as a teenager who immigrated to the US from war-torn Croatia in the 1990s. When Kristina was at her lowest–a broke, single mom to two young children–she began cooking dinners for friends and strangers, choosing to put her energy into the things she was good at instead of dwelling on the things she couldn’t do.

Join the duo as they discuss why Ohio has long been dubbed “The Bellwether State” and why that title may be in jeopardy. What exactly is a “bellwether” and why do political pundits claim it has been unrung? Ohio has a fascinating geographical settlement history that has shaped the way the state’s demographics have participated in national politics. Sharon tells Lauren how this is evolving, and why Ohio voted for Trump in 2020 but the nation voted for Biden. Of course, there’s no shortage of presidential facts in this episode, as Ohio has produced eight presidents and six first ladies!<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Welk, a household name, and host of his own show (that you probably only watched at your grandma’s house), was one of the wealthiest entertainers in the U.S before his death in the early 1990s. He came from humble beginnings, growing up on a farm in North Dakota with his German immigrant parents and several siblings.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Dr. Keisha Blain joins Sharon to talk about voting rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer. In her new book, <em>Until I Am Free</em>, Dr. Blain chronicles the life of Fannie Lou Hamer, a change-maker who has been set on the back shelf of history. Fannie Lou gave a powerful speech at the Democratic National Convention in 1964 at a time when Black voter suppression and violence against Black Americans was practiced across the country, especially in the South.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon tells Austin Graff fascinating stories about New Mexico and its 60-year journey in becoming a U.S state. New Mexico - or the land of enchantment, as some call it -&nbsp;is home to ancient cultures and breathtaking landscapes.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon shares the fascinating story behind New Jersey’s <em>Hadrosaurus foulkii</em>, the first full dinosaur skeleton to be discovered anywhere in the world. The skeleton was unearthed in 1858 when naturalist William Parker Foulke was vacationing in Haddonfield, New Jersey. At the time, very few people had heard the term “dinosaur” but Foulke and his comrade, paleontologist Joseph Leidy, spent the next few years uncovering, researching, and sharing the two-story tall “Bulky Lizard” with museum crowds of visitors who were in awe of the prehistoric creature. And here we are, still fascinated with dinosaurs today!<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

This history lesson is cast from the perspective of one of America’s most cherished ordinary heroes, Sharon Christa McAuliffe, a school teacher from New Hampshire who was selected by NASA to become the first teacher in space. In 1984 President Ronal Reagan announced the Teacher in Space Project designed to inspire students, honor teachers, and spur interest in mathematics, science, and space exploration by sending a teacher on a voyage to space with NASA. The infamous program ended fatally, however, when after just 73 seconds into its flight on January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, killing Christa and all six other crew members aboard.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon walks through the last two centuries of history in Las Vegas to uncover the making of America’s “Sin City.” The Las Vegas strip has not always been glitz and glamour and its history is marked by brushes with Spanish settlers, the mafia, wall street millionaires, the Mormon Church, and most of all, the U.S. government. Tracing back to the 1820s, Sharon explores how Las Vegas developed from illegal speakeasies during prohibition to modern mega-resorts that attract over 42 million visitors annually. Listen to learn how the Hoover Dam, the 18th amendment, and atomic bombs turned Las Vegas into the entertainment mecca we know and love today. <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon is joined by Brittany Ratelle to talk about the life and legacy of Mildred Brown. Though Mildred is not in most history books, she should be! Mildred was a savvy businesswoman and the owner of an Omaha newspaper in the 1930s. As a Black woman in the 1930s, this was impressive on its own. However, Mildred used her power of the press to positively reinforce good business practices in Omaha, and she highlighted the good works of the people in her community. Mildred received 150 community service awards and was appointed as a Goodwill ambassador by U.S President Lyndon B. Johnson. Join Sharon and Brittany as they talk about this uplifting story and explain why there needs to be a Mildred Brown t-shirt! <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Sharon shares a story only the buffest of history buffs will know about Montana in this solo episode. In the early 1900s, Indigenous children were taken from their families to attend residential schools where they were assimilated into European culture - cutting their hair, learning new languages, and wearing European clothes. However, they wanted the women to get just enough physical activity at the Fort Shaw school, so they started a basketball program. The program exploded and became wildly popular, drawing crowds of hundreds of people per game. In this episode, Sharon will tell the story of how these women went from playing in a small gym to being named World Champions at the 1904 World’s Fair, to playing an exhibition game at the Olympics.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Sharon is joined by bestselling author, Kate Bowler. At the age of 35, Kate was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer. Tired of relentlessly positive mantras and advice on how to live her “best life now,” Kate questioned how to grapple with her grim diagnosis in a culture that believes everything is fixable. Kate explains the idea of toxic positivity and why so many Americans practice it. As well, she shares the key to living a courageous life... and it has nothing to do with overcoming fear. In an episode that is sure to make you laugh and cry, join Sharon and Kate as they walk through the beauty, magic, heartbreak and hilariousness of the human experience.&nbsp; <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

As well, she spends two months of the winter in complete darkness and two months of the summer in 24-hours of sunlight. From living in a cabin with no running water to whale watching from her front porch, Cecilia’s life is anything but ordinary.

What started as a ploy to throw off the mayoral election by a group of men in her small Kansas town quickly turned into a historical moment. At this time, candidates could create their own ballots and campaign for votes, so Susanna had no idea that she was even on the ballot during the election.

Iowa caucuses are electoral events that take place every presidential election among Iowa voters.

The World’s Columbian Exposition was a fair like none other. Located in Chicago on a 690-acre fairground, the exposition attracted over 27 million people. The fair dazzled visitors with 200 extravagant buildings and palaces, impressive spectacles of electric lights, the world’s first ferris wheel and exact replicas of the Niña, Pinta and Santa Maria (Columbus’ ships). Fair visitors never went hungry and were introduced to foods such as Cracker Jacks, hot dogs, brownies, Quaker Oats and cream of wheat. The World’s Columbian Exposition changed U.S history, architecture and culture in a profound way.

Rebecca was known to have a “fire in her bones” that fueled her deep passion for education and justice. Rebecca’s story begins on the dirt-floor of an abandoned saloon in Idaho Falls. There, she taught the town’s children how to read and write, and she hosted weekly Sunday School. Flashing forward a few years, Rebecca established the town’s first school and church, became deeply involved in the Idaho State legislature and led a women’s rights movement within the state.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Sharon tells Kristina Kuzmic the story of Soichi Sakamoto, a man from Hawaii who became an Olympic swim coach when he didn’t even know how to swim himself. After teaching his boy scout troop to swim, Soichi set out on a new life’s mission: to coach Olympic swimmers. He started the Three Year Swim Club, promising his students that they would be world-class swimmers within three years. His swim club was made up of impoverished children, many of whom did not have bathing suits or enough food to sustain them through practice. As well, because he didn’t have access to a pool, Soichi resorted to teaching his first students in the water-filled ditches of Hawaiian sugar plantations. Despite the many challenges, Soichi did whatever it took to raise up Olympic athletes - from feeding them his own meals to inventing new ways to train his swimmers. This is the story of Coach Soichi Sakamoto and his journey to the 1948 Olympics.</p> <p>For more information on this episode including all resources and links discussed go to <a href= "https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast">https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

While a conversation about bubble baths and spa trips would be fun, Faith shares something so much better - how to implement practical self-love into your life.

As well, Sharon and Faith speak on the immense responsibility we all carry: the responsibility of our personal mental health. This episode covers how we can address the anxiety and overwhelm we may be feeling from the past year by setting boundaries, protecting our emotions and practicing joyful and meaningful rest everyday.</p> <p>For more information on this episode including all resources and links discussed go to <a href= "https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast">https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Sharon, Beth and Sarah teach us how to have fruitful political conversations with our friends and family - even if they hold opposite views.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>In this solo episode, Sharon shares the story and career of opera sensation Jessye Norman from Augusta, Georgia. By the end of this episode, you will love and adore the voice of this woman, who was a pioneer in so much more than opera. Jessye was born in the 1940’s South, where Jim Crow Laws were in place - schools, businesses, and her town were still segregated. Her mother was a school teacher and taught all her children to read and play the piano - and that is where her family discovered her ability to sing. Her parents taught her that she is no different than anyone else and deserves to live her dreams. Sharon walks listeners through stories from Jessye's career and how she helped change the opera.</p> <p>For more information on this episode including all resources and links discussed go to <a href= "https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast">https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Born on the eve of the women’s suffrage movement, Annie Jump Cannon was an American astronomer and pioneer of star classification who acquired a college education and made a career for herself in a society that discouraged both of which. Known as the “Census Taker of the Sky,” Annie is most well-known for developing a star cataloging and classification system that astronomers still use today, known as the Harvard spectral classification system. Born and raised in Delaware, today Annie is considered Delaware’s contribution to American innovation, she has been inducted into the Royal Astronomical Society, and the asteroid 1120 Cannonia is named in her honor.

Sharon takes listeners back to the year 1800 when Clara Brown was born into slavery in Kentucky. When she was 56, Clara was granted her freedom, but her husband and children were abruptly sold off as slaves. With nowhere else to go, Clara set West for Colorado, travelling 700 miles on foot. In Colorado, Clara became a successful entrepreneur and gave away nearly all of her wealth to her community. This is the story of determination and success as well as compassion, family reunion and ultimate generosity. Listen to find out exactly why Clara is named the “Angel of the Rockies” and why Sharon and Jessica shed a few tears while recording this episode.</p> <p>For more information on this episode including all resources and links discussed go to <a href= "https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast">https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Sharon and Kendra discuss the passionate nature of John Muir, an environmental philosopher, mountaineer, botanist, glaciologist, and preservation advocate who is considered to be the Father of the National Parks. During the westward expansion of the late 1800s, John Muir dedicated his life to the preservation of America’s most pristine geography and played a prolific role in the establishment of Yosemite National Park. Americans will forever reap the benefits of John Muir’s passion for nature, and today, there are parks, glaciers, trails, asteroids, and mountains named after his legacy, a testament to the impact one person can have on an entire society.</p> <p>For more information on this episode including all resources and links discussed go to <a href= "https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast">https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

At the end of the 1950s, following the Brown v.

Sharon details the complex and outrageous occurrences that happened in Little Rock during those years, including the arrival of the National Guard to block the Little Rock Nine from entering, followed by the governor’s order to close all Little Rock schools rather than integrate.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Sharon is joined by friend and successful entrepreneur, Jami Nato, to discuss the story behind <em>Miranda v Arizona</em>. We’ve all heard the line “You have the right to remain silent” but most don’t know the fascinating tale of Ernesto “Ernie” Miranda and how his smalltown trial led to one of the most iconic Supreme Court cases in American history. Sharon and Jami share their thoughts about why the trial of an undoubtedly guilty man was appealed by the Court and how it reflects the Court's emphasis on upholding constitutional rights. Sharon explains why sometimes the Supreme Court doesn’t necessarily focus on “putting the bad guys away” but instead strives to uphold and reestablish constitutional principles.</p> <p>For more information on this episode including all resources and links discussed go to <a href= "https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast">https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
