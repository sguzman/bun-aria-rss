      <title>The Dead Among Us</title>
      <description>We are all born into this world, live our lives, and then die. It's something everyone of us will experience. Although we shouldn't fear death, fearing the dead is a different story. Souls trapped on the wrong side, waiting to be freed, or ready to do damage to those who harmed them on earth. So be aware of the dead among us. 

First, death in Sleepy Hollow
Followed by bedtime blues
Then, the house breaths 
Finally in our featured story, the Day of the Dead

      <title>All Hallows Hell</title>

There's no anticipating the chaos and hauntings that can happen to you on halloween. 

First, curiosity killed the cat
Followed by a towns murderous curse
Then, more death in Salem
And in a special bonus story, No Tricks, Only Treats 
Finally in our featured story, legend that strikes you dead

      <title>Creatures of the Night</title>
      <description>The dark night becomes a playground for all of us during the halloween season. But we don't realize we're contenting with the supernatural who thrive in the dark. Entities, spirits and creatures who are so vile looking they can only come out at night. If we're not prepared, the monsters may kill us, before we even have a chance to yell boo. 

First, a dog eat dog world
Followed by the masked monster
Then, truth that kills
Finally in our featured story, laughter made of nightmares

      <title>Killer in Plain Sight</title>
      <description>It's spooky season so we're all on edge. Getting a good scare from horror movies and haunted houses. We know to be on the lookout for witches, vampires and ghosts and while that is all "fun and games" we can’t let our guards down too much. While we're enjoying Halloween, there are those that use the opportunity to carry out evil plans and get away with it, because they're killers hiding in plain sight. 

First, an office nightmare 
Followed by being scared to death 
Then, stalked in the woods
Finally in our featured story, some dolls are for toys, others are for death

Kick off the spooky season with a new Something Scary mug for your coffee, tea or pumpkin spice latte! Go to SomethingScary.com for an early Halloween treat and get a 20% discount applied at checkout all month long.
Thanks so much for listening!

      <title>Sacrificial Lambs</title>
      <description>Halloween season is officially upon us! The leaves are beginning drop, the air is crisp, and as the nights get colder we can see our breath in dark. It's tempting to get in the spooky spirit watching horror movies with friends, and even lighting a few candles to see what paranormal entities you can conjure. But don't be fooled by what you think is just fun and games. Because there are evil spirits all around us, and they're just waiting for you to play with dark with magic, or accidentally open a portal, so they can come to our realm and wreak deadly havoc on our lives. 

First, the choice to live or die 
Followed by a waking nightmare
Then, the real horror of Burkittsville 
Finally in our featured story, long awaited revenge

      <title>Horror in the Hospital</title>
      <description>Advancements in the medical field have been nothing short of a miraculous. Doctors can cure all types of diseases and ease the pain of the unwell. But going to a hospital can be scary. They are filled with the sick, dying and spirits of the already dead. Surrounded by all that death makes you question, if you go in, will you get out alive?

First, healing the devil 
Followed by a malicious imposter 
Then, a tortured replacement 
Finally in our featured story, the dead don’t leave

      <title>Deadly Paranoia</title>
      <description>Our nerves can be a good thing. They are a symptom of our instincts. Telling us something big is about to happen, be it exciting or dangerous.

Or is death lurking around the corner. 

First, breathless and dying 
Followed by a deadly time warp 
Then, a family haunting

      <title>Four-Legged Fury</title>
      <description>So many of us have four-legged, furry friends that we consider members of our family. Pets are there to greet, love, and console us, there's a reason they are called 'man's best friend'. But no matter how domesticated they are, they are still animals. And four-legged creatures, particularly ones in the wild, have their own agendas. They may be possessed by spirits, or will kill you if the circumstance is right. You must always be careful to never turn your back on an animal, because you never know if they will turn on you. 
﻿
First, haunting of the black cat
Followed by the future brings death
Then, destiny preordained 
Finally in our featured story, the contaminated bloodline

      <title>Till Death Do Us Part</title>
      <description>They say that soulmates are one soul that is split into two different bodies. When you have that kind of deep connection with someone it can feel all encompassing. But if only one person feels that way, and the feelings are not reciprocated, it can become an obsession. And obsessions can haunt you and sometimes cause you harm.

First, playground horror
Followed by troubling texts
Then, wrong place, deadly time
Finally in our featured story, the cursed temple of destruction.

      <title>A Hellish Place</title>
      <description>It’s difficult to imagine what makes a seemingly good person do bad things. When something snaps in their brain and they start to crumble or even go as far as to commit murder, we must examine the circumstances. Were they evil all along? Or was something else compelling them? They may have unfortunately ended up in Hellish place. 

First, dying to breathe
Followed by a sea of death
Then, a hellish haunt 
Finally in our featured story, a copycat killer.

      <title>The Devil's Magic</title>
      <description>We all do our best to count our blessings and be grateful for the abundance surrounding us. But it’s much easier to obsess over the bad things and all we lack. Life would be so much easier if there were a way to just get what we want. When people feel that desperate they’ll try anything to have it their way, even dabbling with the devil’s magic. But people never seem to realize when dealing with the devil a hefty price must be paid, and you’ll pay it with your life. 

First, freshman year terrors
Followed by the unforgivable deal 
Then, shopping hell
Finally in our featured story, black magic backfires

      <title>Creepers of the Night</title>
      <description>The nightime can be filled with magic. The fun of parties, staying up late hanging out with friends, getting to gaze up at the moon and the stars. But nighttime can also bring out the worst in us. When we believe that no one can see us in the dark, is the time for all the night time creepers feel most alive. 

First, alone in the dark
Followed by man’s best friend or worst enemy?
Then, a monster in the woods
Finally in our featured story, Not every frog turns into a prince

      <title>Carnival Carnage</title>
      <description>The carnival coming to town brings so much joy to so many. But others see through the facade of the music, games and clown make-up to see the darkness people are trying to hide. People can try to ignore their issues, but once their anger comes to the surface there's no telling the deadly damage they can cause. 

First, a deadly game 
Followed by cemetery celebration
Then, don’t go into the park
Finally in our featured story, clowning around kills

      <title>The Price of Beauty</title>
      <description>We’re constantly surrounded by false standards of beauty on social media that can trick us into believing that external beauty is more important than what’s on the inside. When we don’t know where the fake narrative ends and the truth begins, we leave the odor open for demons to enter our mind, body and soul.

First, a fountain of death
Followed by there are no shortcuts 
Then, killer competition
Finally in our featured story, there’s only one Queen Bee.

      <title>Sleep When You’re Dead</title>
      <description>Some people love to crawl into their cozy beds and doze off to sleep. But for some of us, bed is more like a prison just waiting till our bleary eyes can no longer stay open to trap us. It's when the Old Hag strikes and sleep paralysis sets in. For those of us who fear the dark, and suffer from all the terrors of the night, well, we'll sleep when we're dead. 

First, deadly obsession willed to life
Followed by silent screams
Then, a vengeful nightmare 
Finally in our featured story, sleep deprived madness

      <title>Fear and Legends from Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage</title>
      <description>We're in the middle of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage month. While many people are celebrating the beautiful culture, we're sinking our teeth into the community's spooky folklore. With thousands of years of tradition, superstition and myths, there are so many horror stories that have been passed down over the years. The most frightening part about these tales is that sometimes people don't believe them, and by the time they do, it's already too late. 

First, deadly delusions
Followed by terror on the Island
Then, dying to survive 
Finally in our featured story, see no evil

      <title>Blood Moon</title>
      <description>Things always seem to go awry when Mercury is in retrograde, and today happens to be the start of that shift in the planets. It’s an excuse for people to be erratic, emotional, and driven to do terrible things. It’s also a time when the supernatural creeps into our lives just to mess with us. As if that wasn’t bad enough, this week we’ll have a total lunar eclipse, also known as a Blood Moon, so this is a warning to all my listeners: beware of the dark. 

First, a death wish
Followed by know thy neighbor or suffer
Then, cards of misfortune 
Finally in our featured story, the monster strikes again

      <title>Deal With the Devil</title>
      <description>We all possess the ability to be both good and evil. But it’s our circumstance that will dictate which path we take. When we’re on top, it’s much easier to be kind, giving and sympathetic. But when our luck has run out, when we’re desperate… that is when we make deals with the devil. 

First, a detective asks for help
Followed by a battle of demons
Then, the Devil’s plaything wants company 
Finally in our featured story, the truth yields deadly consequences

      <title>Mexican Legends and Murderous Lore</title>
      <description>In honor of Cinco de Mayo, we reprise one of our favorite episodes. Mexican culture has a strong connection to the dead and deep roots in their beliefs of the supernatural world. These beliefs have evolved over centuries to include experiences with ghosts and spirits. While these and stories can be fun stories to share, we must never forget those who have suffered to teach us these lessons. If we don't pay heed, history will be doomed to repeat itself and cause more legends and murderous lore.

First, an old and malevolent hospital
Followed by a Ouiji board that summons murder
Then, a dance, that leads straight to Hell. 
Finally in our featured story, a love so deep it burns

      <title>Killer Beauty</title>
      <description>We live in a society where too much emphasis is placed on external beauty. On the daily, seeds are planted to make us obsess over appearance and posts on social media above everything else. Bit don't obsess too much over what you see in a mirror, make sure that what's spiritually and morally inside of you also gets that invigorating cleanse. Otherwise, those planted seeds will rot and that outer influence will grow, that inner evil is bound to come out. 

First, obsession will kill you
Followed by a offer to good to be true
Then, this way a monster comes
Finally in our featured story, 7 years bad luck.

      <title>Wrath of Mother Earth</title>
      <description>With Earth Day coming up we tend to take a better look at the planet around us. Typically we see the lush trees, dancing rivers, and the earth on which we ground ourselves. But the climate is changing and Mother Nature isn't happy. Hidden in her darkest corners luck powerful crystals, trees that breathe, and monsters that would do anything protect the sacred secrets of the earth. Especially if that means killing humans. 

First, nature’s always listening 
Followed by a deadly family secret
Then, a trapped soul’s revenge
Finally in our featured story, the shrill cry of death

      <description>Many of you have seen a shadow out of the corner of your eye, or had a feeling in your gut you were not alone, most likely you encountered a ghost. But the idea of an entity is so terrifying, it's often brushed off as nothing. An apparition can be friendly, but it can also be a murderous phantom seeking revenge. One thing is certain, if an entity is lurking, it wants something from you.

One thing is certain, if an entity is lurking, it wants something from you.

      <title>DEADLY DECEIT</title>
      <description>When you care for someone, you do your best to be faithful and loyal. But when that someone is deceitful, and betrays your confidence, it will do more than shake you. It will make you question everything you know about them. That is if you're still alive, because when someone stabs you in the back, you might not survive their deadly deceit.

First, friends aren’t always forever 
Followed by, comfort in evil
Then, the devil lurks right below you
Finally in our featured story, a midnight massacre

      <title>Insect Invasion</title>
      <description>More people are scared of bugs than they are afraid of becoming the victim of crimes, or even dying. These people suffer from entomophobia, the fear of insects. And when you think about crawlers that are small enough to burrow into the crevices of your skin, winged bugs that can attack from above, and billions of cockroaches that can survive a nuclear apocalypse, maybe we should all be scared to death on an insect invasion.

First, killer growing pains
Followed by, death lurks from above 
Then, art imitates murder
Finally in our featured story, dying from the inside out

      <title>The Unlucky Living</title>
      <description>Luck is having great success (or failure) that happens by chance rather than through one's own actions. Finding a hundred dollar bill could be your lucky day, (but probably the worst day for whomever lost it). And that's the thing about luck, if you get caught on the wrong side of it, it might be the death of you.

First, “finders keepers” may not be lucky after all
Followed by nefarious deeds with killer consequences
Then, be careful what you wish for
Finally in our featured story, destruction lurks right under your nose

      <title>Terrors Haunt the Night</title>
      <description>There's no better way to escape the exhaustion of a long day than cozying up in your bed for a good night's sleep. But when you settle in, and the sounds begin to seep in, it will be obvious you are not alone. Creatures, ghosts, and shadows emerge in the dark. And you'll be plagued by all the terrors that haunt the night.

First, the mark of evil
Followed by recurring nightly visits
Then, mother nature kills
Finally in our featured story, dying to awake

      <title>Lying Eyes</title>
      <description>Most of us walk around feeling completely safe as long as we don't see anything that's scary. But just because you can't see a ghost or an entity, doesn't mean it isn't there. What is truly terrifying is when you think you see something. Because you'll never know if your eyes are deceiving you, or if you life is truly in danger.

First, shadows moving around you
Followed by be careful what’s behind you
Then, a deathly, lonely night
Finally in our featured story, memory lane is a living nightmare

      <title>Bloody Thanksgiving</title>
      <description>Thanksgiving is a time for food and family. We also take stock of what we are grateful for. Things like if you're able to feast on good food, and be surrounded by family. But all families aren't a blessing, they can be your greatest curse. If you don't watch your back, these happy gatherings just may kill you.

First, a boring little town is a living hell
Followed by a mother's fierce protection
Then, animal instinct kills
Finally in our featured story the truth comes from beyond the grave

      <title>Native American Spirits and Demons</title>
      <description>Native American culture has a strong connection to the physical world, and the world beyond. Disturbances to the dead are disrespectful and are believed to bring suffering to the family of the departed. It will also bring great pain, even death to those who dare mess with any Native American spirit, dead or alive.

First, obsession that destroys you
Followed by humans, the worst kind of evil
Then, the teeniest things bring the greatest danger
Finally in our featured story, being brave enough to die

      <title>Scared to Death</title>
      <description>If you're listening, then you are one of those people who loves a good scare. And that means Halloween is your tie of year. It's ours, too. We get a thrill from losing our breath as our blood pumps extra fast through our veins. We delight in stories of witchcraft, fairies, and other mythical folklore. Knowing, praying deep down that the tales we hear may be real. But the reality is when we're faced with these things in real life, that good scare, may scare us to death.

First, fairytale wishes haunt your days
Followed by Dante's hellfire
Then, it's the little things that can kill you
Finally in our featured story, no matter where you hide, horror will find you

      <title>Monsters of the Night</title>
      <description>Zombies, werewolves, and vamps, oh my. These three staples of halloween have become so mainstream we almost forget their origins. We forget the deep in the shadows lurk blood suckers pining for a taste of you to survive. Broken boned beasts with an instinct to kill. And mindless bodies ready to eat your brains. Never forget that these are the monsters of the night.

First. Halloween pranks that kill
Followed by the ultimate predator becomes prey
Then, a funhouse of terror and blood
Finally in our featured story, a killer party to die for

      <title>Eternal Doom</title>
      <description>Satan, beelzebub, el diablo, the devil has many names. But in the present day we can be so metaphorical with our language. We will call anyone we disagree with, "the devil," or say anything that makes us uncomfortable is like being in hell. But when someone truly crosses the path of evil, they will undeniably be eternally doomed.

First, the devil is a family affair
Followed by El Diablo’s bleeding heart
Then, lucky 13 strikes New Jersey
Finally in our featured story, there is nowhere to hide from justice

      <title>Confront the Danger</title>
      <description>We've all heard the tall tales and urban legends around the campfire. Some passed down from generation to generation, yet never with an actual eye-witness. But when faced with those terrible things yourself - you become a true believer. And if you can't convince anyone else, then you'll be forced to confront the danger...alone.
First, secret tragedies taunt in the night
Followed by a canoeing catastrophe in the woods 
Then, never look directly at the man on fire
Finally in our featured story, a car that takes you right to hell

      <title>INHERENT DANGER</title>
      <description>We make assumptions about the things that scare us: a stranger, the darkness, even abandoned hallways. We presume that they are inherently dangerous. But the truth is, they're just the unknown. You may be surprised at the protection you'll get from a stranger, or the peace you'll find in the dark. As with many things, the answer isn’t always clear cut - instincts can be wrong. That inherent danger you’ve been taught to fear, may have been trying to save you all along…. 

First, life imitates a horror movie
Followed by murderous vigilante justice 
Then, terror lurks inside a forbidden corridor
Finally in our featured story, a gamer finds solace within a living nightmare

      <title>South African Tales of Terror</title>
      <description>So often when we know we are surrounded by people we can trust, we let down our guards. In the company of family, co-workers, or care-givers we feel out of harm's way. But when ghosts, spirits, or even evil entities become involved, no one is safe.

First, a devil's got your tongue 
Followed by a deadly family secret
Then, a violent uprising 
Finally in our featured story, an infamous hospital of many secrets

      <title>Evil Will Prevail</title>
      <description>Krishna Janmashtami (Jan-mosh-tuh-me) is an important Hindu celebration. It marks the birth of Lord Krishna, an avatar of the Lord Vishnu (Vish-new) , and the intention of ridding the people from the tyranny of King Kansa (Con-za). It was envisioned as the embodiment of good versus evil. Yet somehow, as you will see, evil always finds a way to prevail ...

First, eyes that stalk in the night
Followed by paranoia underlined with a death-stroke 
Then, literally, being blinded by evil 
Finally in our featured story, death lurks in the Banyan trees

      <title>The Hungry Ghost Festival</title>
      <description>We are entering the month of The Hungry Ghost Festival. Many East East Asians, Buddhists, and Taoists believe this is when ghosts can return to Earth to haunt the living. So, their descendants burn paper money, and incense, as well as serve food to pay respect to their ancestors and sooth wandering or angry spirits. There are many important rules for humans to follow in order to stay safe during the festival. A list of Do and Don'ts you better follow, or the ghosts will satisfy their hunger with YOU.
First, Do NOT be alone in the dark.
Then, Do NOT mock the dead.
Finally in our featured story, whatever you do, Do NOT take the last bus.

      <title>Blood Lust</title>
      <description>Anything that is worthwhile in life typically requires lots of hard work and sacrifice. And when you are compelled to achieve, be it perfecting a skill, or protecting your family, you must be disciplined to achieve your goals. But when it becomes an obsession, you're driven by a blood lust to succeed, and nothing had better stand in your way.  

First, blood thirst plagues a family
Followed by practice makes perfect, or it will kill you
Then, friends that literally drive you insane
Finally in our featured story, a yearly sacrifice hits home

      <title>Deadly Disappearances</title>
      <description>We often believe the stories we are told because they comfort us. These stories can explain the mysterious, the inconceivable, even deadly disappearances. But sometimes stories are used deceptively to hide and obscure the truth. To avoid horrible realities that are staring at us right in the face.
First, art so breathtaking it kills
Followed by a scorned widow turns deadly
Then, a hidden book filled with terrifying secrets
Finally in our featured story, don’t be fooled by sonorous beauties.

Then, hide and seek gone devastatingly wrong

      <title>Suffer in Silence</title>
      <description>Life is filled with pain and suffering. Thankfully there are many different ways we learn to cope. We let things roll off our backs, we toughen up and face problems head on. We can rely on good friends and family help. But when none of that works, the people who suffer in silence will enact their revenge on those who have caused them pain. And there's nothing anyone can do about it.

First, there’s something fishy about the school bullies
Followed by the menacing glare of feral cats
Then, a friendly neighbor with sinister secrets
Finally in our featured story, a lover’s quarrel gone awry

      <title>Horrors Under the Skin</title>
      <description>We are taught to try to ignore the little things that get on our nerves and bugs us. Like a noisy neighbor, a pesky sibling, or even a little shoo-fly. But when something really gnaws at you, and gets under your skin, you must address it. Or it could end up being the death of you.

First, death from deep within,
Then, a sleepover turned terrible nightmare.
Followed by a neighbor's kindness that kills.
Finally in our featured story, a deadly bite.

First, lifestyles of the dead and famous
Followed by A killer psychic 
Then, dancing with the dead

      <title>Enter At Your Own Risk</title>
      <description>Some places may just seem like a dot on a map, but all those dots are living, breathing spaces. Any entity that passes through somewhere leaves a piece of itself behind.

First, the true horror story of taunting footsteps 
Followed by a most deadly game
Then, dead lovers seek retribution

      <title>Predator Parasites</title>
      <description>A parasitic person never earns or deserves the things they take. It can be as simple as physical objects or they can take the energy from the room itself. Even worse they can take the life from your very soul. So pay close attention because these Predator Parasites are always lurking where you least expect. 
First, mistakenly summoning death
Followed by a secret that will kill you
Then, peaceful woods turned into a living nightmare 
Finally in our featured story, the monster that seeks fresh victims

      <title>Killers Hiding in Plain Sight</title>
      <description>In a world filled with ghosts and spirits the most frightening thing is often other humans. Be careful who you trust and remember to listen to your own intuition.

Followed by a love worth dying for

      <title>It’s The Little Things That Kill You</title>
      <description>Episode DescriptionOur parents and teachers try to alert us to the obvious big things that we should fear. Going where we aren't supposed to, walking down dark alleys alone, or strangers with bad intentions. These things we can avoid. But it's the little things we don't notice. Those small unexpected instances can sometimes be our salvation but more often than not it’s the little things that kill you.

First, screams of the dying, ignored
Followed by deadly camp secrets
Then, the bluest eyes hide the loneliest soul
Finally in our featured story, cursed revenge

      <title>No One Is Safe</title>
      <description>Deep in the jungles and waters of China, the Philippines, Japan and other parts of the Asian Pacific, lurk demons beyond the imagination. The few who survive the encounters endure horrible flashbacks and struggle to stay sane enough to tell their tales. But the one thing that remains consistent with all their stories is that absolutely no one is safe. 

First, death comes at night
Followed by hidden tragedies of war
Then, fear on a college campus
Finally in our featured story, murder in the water

      <title>Warnings of the Wounded</title>
      <description>We have the world at our fingertips with the swipe of a finger. It makes us feel as if we know everything. It's difficult to imagine that anyone, particularly our elders have anything new to teach us. But when they tell us their stories, we would be wise to remember that their lessons often come from devastating experiences. We should always heed the advice of these hard-lived warnings from the wounded.  

First, a family ritual gone dead wrong
Followed by the eyes of the possessed  
Then, a child’s evil revenge 
Finally in our featured story, the dead want blood

      <title>Mexican Legends and Murderous Lore</title>
      <description>Mexican culture has a strong connection to the dead. They have deep roots in their beliefs of the supernatural world. These beliefs have evolved over centuries of their experiences with ghosts and spirits. While these and stories from other countries can be fun stories to share, we must never forget those who have suffered to teach us these lessons. If we don't pay heed to the lessons, history will be doomed to repeat itself and cause more legends and murderous lore.  

First, an old and malevolent hospital
Followed by a Ouiji board that summons murder
Then, a dance, that leads straight to Hell. 
Finally in our featured story, a love so deep it burns

      <title>Menacing Moon</title>
      <description>The full moon is the lunar phase where the moon is round and completely illuminated. It is at the height of power, a sign of rebirth and peak of clarity. But when the moon glows brightest is when it shines a light in the darkest corners of the earth. The moon becomes a menace, waking all of the beasts that otherwise would lay dormant in the dark. 

First, a game turned into a haunted reality
Followed by a bad morning that keeps getting worse
Then, terrifying family origins
Finally in today's featured story, dark secrets uncovered

      <title>New Year, Old Horrors</title>

So enjoy the new year but beware the old horrors.


First, the knock of death 
Followed by the heartbroken seeking revenge
Then, any price paid to save a life

      <title>Wicked Witchcraft</title>
      <description>Witchcraft is the study and practice of magical skills and abilities. Some are gifted with a natural talent, such as being extra empathic of others’ emotions, having a heightened sense of people’s auras, or being able to see things that others cannot. Those with these aptitudes have been around for generations, most using their powers for good. But beware those with ill intent who practice wicked witchcraft. 

First, actions intended to help, cause lasting harm
Followed by, jealousy that kills a love triangle
Then, a battle between good versus evil 
Finally in today's featured story, a sister seemingly consumed by greed

First, a warning from the bones of the dead
Followed by a haunting childhood memory
Then, a cat seeks revenge

      <title>The Luck of the Damned</title>
      <description>As human beings we often find it difficult to take responsibility for our lives. We attribute our successes or our failures to a little thing called Luck. But when you believe that everything is connected, and that karma exists, you know you are the true cause of your own good luck, or… your own very bad luck. 

First, Tinder’s perfect match
Followed by, a sailor trying to cheat a deadly fate
Then, a Celtic curse
Finally in our featured story, a very unlucky St. Patrick's Day

      <title>If Walls Could Scream</title>
      <description>When we inhabit a space to live, we try to do everything to make it feel like home. We choose colors and furniture that are the physical manifestation of how we want the space to feel. But we never stop to think about the life that inhabited that space before we came along. Would that space tell stories of joy or terror? What would the walls say, if walls could scream? 

First, sins are revealed beneath the surface
Followed by, haunting cries over stolen goods
Then, a spirits evil intentions revealed
Finally in our featured story, a warning: don’t look in the mirror at night

      <title>Worked To Death</title>
      <description>Everyone needs to work, but we all do it for different reasons. Some get jobs wherever they can to pay the bills, others are lucky enough to work in pursuit of a passion. Regardless of why you work, It pays to put in the time and effort to excel at whatever you do. Otherwise, you could end up being worked to death. 

First, an Uber driver who must pick up a frightening passenger
Followed by a telemarketer who gets in too deep with a customer 
Then, a ballerina willing to rehearse herself to death
Finally in our featured story, a video game developer tries to survive crunch time

      <title>Terrible Totems</title>
      <description>Our earthly possessions are just that, physical things of the earth that we can’t take with us to the next life. What truly matters are our world experiences and what kind of people we are when we interact with others. But often we do place too much value on the things we own, and they can turn into terrible totems, and end up owning us. 

First, heed the messenger or reap the wrath
Followed by a disturbing secret revealed at the cost of death
Then, a spirit is released and seeks revenge
Finally in our featured story, beware the obsession of the collector.

      <title>Primal Protectors</title>
      <description>As human beings we thrive off of our connection to others, it’s key to our survival. Those relationships can be with other people, but often our deepest connections are with animals. They comfort us in our darkest hours, make us feel safe, they are our primal protectors. But like in these stories, you never know if the one who is supposed to protect you, will turn on you.

First, a creepy critter in the woods reveals its true power.
Followed by a dog will risk everything to protect its human.
Then, a guy who will stop at nothing for the attention of his big brother. 
Finally in our featured story, a sweet house cat turned feral hunter.

      <title>A Wolf In Sheep's Clothing</title>
      <description>The one thing more threatening than a snarling wolf at the door is the one in sheep’s clothing. The unknown threat that you’re not prepared for lurking in your place of sanctuary. Perhaps someone you trust or something you’ve too long taken for granted. As we’ll learn in today’s stories, unforeseen danger should be feared the most.

First, coveted mittens are more than what was wished for
Followed by sisters who must take on the man in the attic
Then, find out the horrifying history of a family home
Finally in our featured story, a warning to those who don’t take devils seriously

      <title>No Good Deed</title>
      <description>You should always stand for what’s right and do the honorable thing. Evil will flourish when the good do nothing. Sacrifices often must ultimately be made for the greater good to triumph. So it’s important to remember to also be careful because as today’s stories show us, no good deed goes unpunished.  

First, the danger when you can’t trust mother
Followed by, the unexpected lurking in a graveyard
Then, desperation to make a friend turns deadly
Finally, in our featured story, an officer will try to save a life, not realizing who the real victim is

      <title>You’re Too Late!</title>
      <description>It is common to fear that which we do not know. That terrible feeling in the pit of your stomach is the perception of danger, real or imagined. Unfortunately, by the time you know where the true danger lies, you’re too late.
First, horror unleashed on a Christmas morning.
Followed by a smile that brings panic, not joy. 
Then, the terrifying echoes of a haunted forest. 
Finally in our featured story, it’s kill or be killed for two sisters stuck in the snow.

      <title>Lurking Behind You</title>
      <description>We think we’re safe when we can see what is around us, but we’re only seeing one dimension. When we open our eyes to what is beyond, we can see all of the goodness that truly surrounds us. And the evil lurking behind us as well.  
First, a ghost stirs when two girls are left alone.  
Next, we see what is looking back at you in the mirror. 
After that, a prank phone call turns into a real threat. 
Finally in our featured story, two bullied kids get more help than they bargained for.

      <title>Don’t Look Too Closely</title>
      <description>It’s easy to get fixated on one thing: one rule, one tale, one person’s point of view. But when we focus on only one thing, we lose sight of the bigger picture. And that can blind us to the dangers around us if we don’t look too closely.
First, a game of hide and seek goes too far 
Then we’ll discover the true intentions of a mysterious stranger
Followed by, a confession of a dark family secret 
And finally in our featured story, the consequences when you misbehave

      <title>Ravenous Ravings </title>
      <description>All-consuming terror can bring us to our most vulnerable. Like a hunger, it can strike suddenly or slowly creep into our minds. It makes monsters and also monsters of us. That’s how it feeds its ravenous ravings. 

First, a haunted doll is a terrifying inheritance
Followed by a stomach-churning letter
Then, the thing in the fields feeds indiscriminately 
Finally, in our featured story, some horrors are insatiable.

      <title>Spirits of the Season</title>
      <description>Now, Halloween is a powerful night made even more powerful this year by light of a blue moon. Special care should be taken on this night unless you want to release the spirits of the season that beckon from the darkness. First, preparations for a Halloween party go horribly wrong. And then, a necromancer is born against his will. Followed by a house too haunted to call home. And finally, a soul laid to rest far too soon.

      <title>Bag of Monstrosities</title>
      <description>Life’s stories are like a pumpkin pail of candy filled with unexpected tricks, treats and monstrosities. You never know what you’ll pull out of it. In every turn a new surprise tale waits to be unwrapped. It may be something sweet or as sharp as a razorblade. You may get cut, you may be cursed or worse pulling from your bag of monstrosities. First, just one bite of stolen candy has horrific consequences. And then, a creepy sibling rivalry goes too far. Followed by, the ringing phone you must not answer. And finally, we bring you part two of “Jeff the Killer”, our abridged retelling of the anonymous creepy pasta.

      <title>Serial Shivers</title>
      <description>As Halloween grows closer so do all the scary creatures that come along with it. Scarier than any ghost or mythological monster however, are the evils that people are capable of doing to each other. The inner demons that can drive humankind to do the unthinkable, like kill another person in cold blood. And how that taste has led to notorious murders throughout history from Jack the Ripper to the Zodiac killer. These homicidal tendencies have inspired the most chilling of tales. Enough to give you serial shivers. First, by popular demand, the horrific Return of the Grim Gouger. And then, we're lured astray by a familiar whistle, followed by a tragic update on the Randonatica murder case, and finally, a young girl’s investigation uncovers deadly secrets.

      <title>Wickedness by Moonlight</title>
      <description>There’s magick afoot when night falls, the night sky and stars hungrily cloak places both new and ancient. These locales hold traces of powerful enchantments which surround us all. If you're up to mischief, be careful to protect yourself when venturing out at night. Those stars gaze silently, witnessing our rituals and our wickedness by moonlight. First, two girls play telephone in the cemetery. And then, a crew encounters a witch by the sea. Followed by, fanmail &amp; morbid moonlit poetry. And finally, there’s no way out of this ritual.

      <title>Beneath The Surface</title>
      <description>What lies between the walls of a house, inside the eyes of a toy, or beneath someone’s skin can often be more than we bargained for. If we’re not careful, we can fall victim to other presences that watch and wait to strike when we’re most vulnerable. Always be wary of what lurks just beneath the surface of things. First, a doll just wants a new friend to play with. And then, a home that houses the eternal battle of good vs evil. Followed by the true story of toys that can eat children. And finally, a tale of imaginary sisters.

      <title>The Shape of Horror</title>
      <description>Something lurks in the darkness. Slithering away just out of sight when you turn on the lights. Morphing into the shadows it watches you even now as you listen to this. Don't allow yourself the illusion of safety because horror can take on many shapes and many faces to lure you into the deep black abyss. First, a room for two becomes a room for more. And then, the true story of a haunted movie theater. Followed by our rendition of a classic Creepypasta: The Branches in the Wind. And finally, the Cloaks are coming.

      <title>Final Destination</title>
      <description>There’s never a last time until the last time you do anything. Supernatural limits can be pushed to the max until we can’t come back from them. But more often than not, we like to tempt fate for the thrill of seeking out what can be hiding out there. Hiding within the unexplored parts of our minds and even inside the digital sphere in the palm of our hands. We all keep pushing further and further subconsciously hoping to find our final destination. First, flying high on the thrill of a final score. Next, seek the grave watcher and you shall find your end. After that, a reading of The Russian Sleep Experiment by Anonymous. And finally, a warning from the ghost in the machine.

      <title>Depths of Despair</title>
      <description>Water is elemental, sustaining all manner of human and sea life. The ocean, rivers, and lakes we gaze upon are also home to so many other creatures. Some are friendly, most are indifferent to us, but others..others are quite deadly when we encounter them. Like the aquatic monsters of lore drawn out by a need to feed. Fearsome beasts dragging our souls down into their depths of despair...leaving our bodies to float lifelessly on top of the water. First, do you hear the deadly siren song? Next, an ancestors' promise becomes a modern day peril. After that, Classic haunted poetry by the sea from Edgar Allan Poe. And finally, never float down the river alone.

      <description>On today’s show, we venture into the power of lost humanity. The tragedy of those on the precipice of turning into something more.

These are the invocations of the damned. First, a terrifying makeup tutorial transformation. Next, the girl in theater wants to haunt you. After that, poetic words seal a soul in a book. And finally, beware the power of the wolfpaw.

      <title>Distorted Reality</title>
      <description>What we see or hear may not always be what it seems. Often there are obscuring tricks of the light or ghostly whispers that sound like whistles on the wind. It comes down to the mind’s eye to believe in the stories that reveal horrors that can deceive. All of it hides behind the veil of a distorted reality. First, a harrowing tale based on the mythic internet video “Girldog." Next, a visitor’s facade falls when faced with their hunger. After that, a letter for the lady in the frame &amp; a new tale of a demon on the wall. And finally, a message from beyond demands your attention.

      <title>Carn-Evil of Frights</title>
      <description>Pop some popcorn, imagine the flashing lights, and step right into the big top of your mind. The sounds of laughter and carnival music are so loud you almost can’t hear the clowns feasting on the children or the screams behind the curtains. This circus is free to enter but it will take something that you’ll miss...if you make it out alive. Enjoy the show at the Carn-evil of Frights. First, "Fancy Flopsy" is your clown friend till the end. Next, a death-defying high-wire act goes wrong in "The White Rabbit". After that, a detour to the real-life haunted clown Motel. And finally, a circus trinket goes POP and you’re next, in Jack in the Box (Abridged) by Michael Thomas Lee.

      <title>Beware the Uninvited</title>
      <description>When presences make themselves known, we often wonder if they knowingly crossed boundaries to invade our surroundings or the spaces of our minds. They can appear as ghosts or demons and sometimes as even yourself. Fight and push back on the creeping powers cornering us before it’s too late. Protective measures can be taken. Light the sage, hold those crystals, focus your energies and say a prayer if you need to. Just beware the uninvited. First, doppelganger paranoia in “The Tulpa” an anonymous creepypasta. Next, the woman in the painting is staring at you. After that, fan mail and “The Dark Wraith” a creepypasta to invade your senses. And finally, Mary Stockum sees you, Mary Stockum haunts you.

      <title>Final Acts of Free Will</title>
      <description>Are we ever really acting of our own free will? All around us are unexplained scrapes or splashes, presences, all around us. Who's to say they don’t influence us...some are guiding us, while others are waiting to take hold and over our actions. At any moment, they might strike, taking away our final acts of free will. First, an accessory can transform your entire look. Next, a sinking feeling of dread at church camp. After that, the ghostly grip of the past tightens around our necks. And finally, “You’re Not Going Crazy” a Creepy Pasta written by Anonymous.

      <title>Hidden Terrors: Unleashed II</title>
      <description>Last we ventured together we unleashed hidden terrors lurking in the cartridges of old school video games. It begs the question what exactly do we hope to find in the video games of yore? Perhaps these forces should remain in the past, locked in the machinery of old systems. First, we hear the chilling conclusion of our story Critter Valley. Then we read some fanmail that shares how the supernatural can shape us while we’re young. And finally we end with a classic Creepy Pasta titled “Looking for an Old Game” by Anonymous.

First, Beware the used games you buy, a killer deal might come at a price. Next, body art can bring out demons beneath the skin. After that, A poem follows what needs to feed. And finally, an anonymous creepy pasta delves into twisted mechanics of a popular game.

      <title>Cold As Death</title>
      <description>The spider’s web that stories create online are spun over and over as they get retold and spread. The lines blur fact and fiction and as you get closer to look, it’s already too late--you’re trapped. It’s dangerous to believe every scary story you read online because even the most ridiculous tales hold a frightening grain of truth. But we never know for sure since so few live to spread the word. Only scraps of digital footprints remain and even those grow cold as death. First, we search for Smile.dog, the iconic Creepypasta abridged. Next, beware what you say, it’s dying to come true. After that, a cyber threat befalls us in The Theater, a beloved Creepypasta. And finally, a couple’s retreat makes for some killer romance.

      <title>Never Alone</title>
      <description>As we go about our daily lives, we’ve been trained to think that the material world that we see is all that exists. But that’s just not true, and it’s foolish to continue to believe so even when the shadows surround us. When we hear mysterious noises and feel as if we’re being followed...but no one is there. Don’t ignore the truth of the matter. We are never alone. First, and I repeat, we are never alone. Next, we get lost on a chilling walk in the woods. After that, frightful spirits in poetic verse. And finally, there’s danger in the mines in “Coal Dust” an anonymous creepypasta.

      <title>Tales of Classic Terrors</title>
      <description>It’s important to know where things come from.

First, our modern reimagining of Edgar Allen Poe’s The Masque of The Red Death. Next, an art collection displays deadly secret. After that, a home housing a negative being within it.

Next, a picture is worth a thousand screams. After that, a filipino legend guides us to fortune or doom. And finally, the final light speaks in classic creepypasta “Gateway of The Mind”

      <title>Tales of Cosmic Horrors</title>
      <description>Just when we’ve overcome the horror of ghosts and monsters surrounding us but look up at the night sky, imagine if there is greater terror out there. What lies beyond us? Could we be their allies or are we their meat? We hear stories of sightings and disappearances. The more and more we explore out there the more we wonder if they’re already here. First, visitors take much more than a family's hospitality. Next, the real face on the surface of Mars. After that, romance, and something else, is in the air on the night of the school dance. And finally, the classic creepy pasta, A Gift of Mercy.

      <title>Chased by Fate</title>
      <description>Fate is a tricky thing, they say that it can’t be escaped. That when the writing's on the wall or the warnings have been read, that’s it for you. Because we can only be so cautious when facing the dangers in our path, because unfortunately, even the best security sometimes just isn’t enough. First, owing a debt means more than just owing money. Next, technology opens unsuspecting doorways, right into your home. After that, we’ll do our chores alone, in the dark. And finally, we end up in a place of healing, a children’s hospital.

      <itunes:summary>What happens when creatures of legend and monsters of modern mythology are pushed out into the world we live in now? These mythical monsters will creep ever closer to our doors, our homes. Don’t bother to barricade the windows, they’re already inside. First, work is Hell and then there are demons. Next, a classic Creepypasta of the zombie apocalypse around the corner. After that, a Chupacabra fueled by vengeance. And finally, Beware the Nokken, the Norweigen shapeshifters of myth.

      <title>Screams Are Closer Than They Appear</title>
      <description>When sirens splinter the night, do you go toward the noise? Or take it as a sign to run away? Sounds can be warnings of dangers near it, or waiting for you to flee towards where it waits around the next corner...closer than you might think. First, buzz is that there is a new girl at school. Next, that sound you hear is a catchy jingle beckoning to be heard. After that, we hear skittering scratching away in the night. And finally, the cries of children call for you in a park late at night.

      <title>Safety NEVER Guaranteed</title>
      <description>As children we are given many cautionary phrases to ensure our safety. "Don't talk to strangers. Always lock the door. Never travel alone. Be home before dark." As well meaning and sound as those warnings are, like with the characters in today's stories, within each of us is the need to answer that burning question..."Why not?" First, we're told never to respond when called at night. Next, we're instructed to never crash a house party. After that, we're told to take the long way and never take the shortcut. And finally, we're begged to never respond to the voices that whisper to us.

      <title>Ghosts in the Machine</title>
      <description>Technology is our constant companion, for some it is a salve for superstitions and fears of the dark. But this Big Brother with infinite knowledge has you fooled. Ghosts in the machine are real. And while you can choose to not enter a haunted house, the entities in these stories have already been invited into your home within the very devices meant to entertain you. First, some virtual reality frights are more real than we would like them to be. Next, Polybius, a video game of urban legend, is given new life, much to the woe of its players. After that, nighttime video binging will lead us to eerie prophecies. And finally, pushing shuffle play will have dire consequences.

      <title>Happy Haunted Holidays</title>
      <description>The holidays are a time to gather your loved ones close with scary ghost stories to remember the past, look to the future, and reflect on the gift of the present. Time gives gifts in different forms. Often, they're material, other times they're wrapped in lessons, and sometimes they're spectral anomalies. First, we will be haunted by mysterious coins on Christmas. Next, in the holiday of now, a gorgeous woman receives an unexpected gift. Then, we look to the future where a voice cries out to the present. Finally, we’ll re-live a tragic past life during the Winter War.

      <title>Friend or Foe?</title>
      <description>In today's stories, we venture into familiar locations like a bar in Texas and a subway stop in Japan. Familiar places that all of us can hold both friends...and foes alike. Come close and listen to these harrowing tales of friendship and betrayal. First, we follow a detective on a legendary case into the backwoods of Texas. Next, we’ll buy our first used car, and receive all of the “baggage” that comes with it. After that, a birthday toy that is much more than it seems. And finally, we’ll pass along a grisly story that bears repeating.

      <description>Earth, Wind, Fire and Water. Elements we need to live, the nature of the world. Each one gives life in its own way but to make way for that life there is the wrath of destruction. The almost hungry transformative forces of nature. Some of the most terrifying things in human life are those forces we can’t control or even see until it’s too late. First, we will encounter a fiery force waiting for interlopers in a field. Next, a sunny day at the beach leads to a family tragedy. After that, a fairytale dream becomes a nightmare. And finally, a sweet voice in the wind is not as innocent as it appears.

Next, Markeia investigates the story of some strange-looking snowmen around campus. After that, we’ll work a night shift in the middle of a blizzard.

      <title>Life After Death</title>
      <description>It’s a question as old as time itself: does the soul continue on after death? We may never have a definite answer, but there are certainly stories out there that make it hard to believe that death is truly the end. 
First, Sapphire shares an urban legend about an Indonesian girl’s encounter with a shrouded corpse.  Then, we’ll try to solve the mystery of a young girl’s outbursts. After that, we’ll visit a school in the Philippines where a dead girl might still roam. And finally, we'll pay visit to an Irish church where a lonely bride remains.

      <title>Fatal Friendship</title>
      <description>The concept of making friends is kind of odd if you think about it. You meet a total stranger, and you both mutually decide to build a relationship. It requires a lot of trust. But if you choose correctly, those relationships can be so meaningful, and beneficial. This episode is about the times that are not. First, Sapphire shares a story about a young boy who befriends the new kid at school. Then, we’ll follow a demonologist and his companion to an exorcism. After that, a girl creates an imaginary friend to keep her company. And finally, we’ll witness the blood oath of 2 best friends.
