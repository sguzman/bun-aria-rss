        <![CDATA[The hottest stock of the year isn't Tesla. It's not Beyond Meat. And it isn't even a tech stock. Not really, at least. So what's left? How about space? Since becoming public late last year, Virgin Galactic is up some 500%. The company is promising the first tourist rides to space later this year. So the dollars must be flowing in, right? Not exactly. Barron's Tae Kim joins host Alex Eule to explain why. Producer: Mette LÃ¼tzhÃ¸ft.<p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>69: Berkshire After Buffett</title>
      <description>Athletes retire, presidents leave office, and musicians lose their voice. Not Warren Buffett. For more than five decades, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) has sat in the same chair and stuck to the same strategies. But the Oracle of Omaha can't stop time, and this year he'll turn 90. Today on the Readback, Barron's Andrew Bary joins Alex Eule to discuss how Berkshire Hathaway could look after Buffett. Produced by Mette LÃ¼tzhÃ¸ft.

      <title>68: The SoftBank Question</title>
      <description>For years, tech startups could do no wrong. They were changing the world - and always for the good, or so we thought. The thinking changed when office leasing startup WeWork imploded last year. Much of the hype that built up WeWork and tech unicorns can be tied to SoftBank, a Japanese telecom giant that has poured $100 billion worth of investment into startups. It's become the face of tech's failures, but ask SoftBank and, for the most part, things are still going according to plan. This week Barron's Eric Savitz joins Alex Eule on The Readback. Produced by Mette LÃ¼tzhÃ¸ft.

      <description>2019 was a banner year for stocks, but it's possible that it was an even better time for consumers.

Tech reporter Tae Kim joins Alex Eule to discuss whether these new offerings are all too good to be true -- and how long they will last. Producer: Mette LÃ¼tzhÃ¸ft.

      <title>52: Why Interest Rates Are Going Negative (Rebroadcast)</title>
      <description>The Readback team is taking a quick break. We'll be back with a new episode next week. In the meantime, we've selected one of our favorite episodes to re-release:
Anyone with a savings account is familiar with the impact of low interest rates. The most generous savings accounts in the U.S. barely pay 2%. Bonds aren't a whole lot better. But in Europe and much of the world, interest rates are not just low -- they're actually negative. Matt Klein joins host Alex Eule to explain. First published on October 16, 2019.

      <title>62: Tesla vs. the Minivan</title>
      <description>Everyone loves to talk about electric cars. And, based on the success of Tesla, it seems like everyone wants to drive one. The strange thing is no one really wants to buy them. Less than 2% of the cars sold in the U.S. this year were electric. This week, Alex Eule talks to Barron's Jack Hough about whether -  after years of false starts  - we might finally be on the cusp of the electric car revolution. Produced by Mette LÃ¼tzhÃ¸ft.

      <description>Shares of Apple are up a staggering 70% in 2019. That's not supposed to happen.

Barron's Avi Salzman and Alex Eule discuss the investment case for small-cap stocks and whether they might be having a comeback. Produced by Mette LÃ¼tzhÃ¸ft.

      <title>23: Finding Value in Stamps</title>
      <description>You might have heard that Bill Gross recently retired from his portfolio manager role at Janus Capital Group. There are few names in the investment world, more recognizable than Bill Gross. The so-called bond king reinvented the way investors think about debt. For years, he's been a staple in the pages of Barron's, and he sat on Barron's annual roundtable of top investors.

Barron's senior writer Mary Childs has covered Bill Gross' career for several years and is working on a book about him. The Readback team thought this was a good time to re-release one of our favorite episodes of the podcast in which Mary talks about a more obscure side of the bond king: His love of stamps.

      <title>22: The Cold War in Tech</title>
      <description>This week opened with some good news in the long-running trade battle between the U.S. and China, when Donald Trump agreed to delay the big hike in tariff rates originally scheduled for March 1. U.S and Chinese investors cheered the move. But the issues are not close to being resolved.

In the latest episode of The Readback, Alex Eule is joined by Barron's senior writer Reshma Kapadia to talk about why progress in U.S.-China trade talks won't solve the bigger issue-a growing battle over tech supremacy.

      <title>20: Blaming Buybacks</title>
      <description>Corporate stock buybacks have always received attention from investors but suddenly they're a part of the mainstream conversation. Politicians on the left and right-from Bernie Sanders to Marco Rubio -have targeted stock buybacks as they think about ways to address wealth inequality and tax reform. But how much are buybacks really to blame for society's ills?

In this episode of The Readback, Alex Eule is joined by Barron's associate editor Andrew Bary to discuss the suddenly hot topic of stock buybacks and whether politicians from both sides of the aisle are right to target buybacks as they seek to close the wealth gap.

      <title>19: 'Tis the Earnings Season</title>
      <description>You might have noticed some big swings for some well-known stocks in recent weeks. Apple jumped 7% one day, Facebook surged 11%, Amazon fell 5%. You can thank a wave of corporate results for the big moves. After all, it's earnings season, and that means corporate America is revealing its secrets to investors and everyone else paying attention.

In this episode of The Readback, Alex Eule is joined by Barron's associate editor Jack Hough to talk about the latest round of earnings and whether three months from now corporate profit growth might actually turn negative.

      <title>18: The S&amp;P 500's Climate Risk</title>
      <description>Just a few months ago, shares of PG&amp;E, the California utility, were trading near $50 share. That was before the company's power lines were blamed for California's devastating forest fires. This week the company filed for bankruptcy. It's a clear example of how climate change has imperiled companies and investors.

In this episode of The Readback, Alex Eule is rejoined by Barron's senior writer Leslie Norton who has just finished a major project ranking how big companies are exposed to climate risk.

      <title>12: Robinhood's Savings Mirage</title>
      <description>A host of digital start-ups have gotten a lot of attention in recent years for using technology to improve investing and democratize finance. Companies like Robinhood have targeted younger investors with commission-free stock trades. That's a compelling offer-but sometimes the offers are a little too compelling.
Last week Robinhood announced it was offering a new checking and savings account with 3% interest. That's way higher than anything offered by banks. But there's a catch. 
This week on The Readback, Alex Eule talks with reporter Ben Walsh about his recent story on Robinhood.

      <title>10: Wall Street Wants Your Data</title>
      <description>For decades, corporations and investors have been fighting a battle over data. Shareholders push for transparency, while companies do the bare minimum to comply. Just last month, Apple said it would no longer provide details on its iPhone sales. But investors are a resourceful bunch and there's a booming world of alternative data that's helping to fill in the gaps.

This week on The Readback, Alex Eule talks with Barron's senior writer Avi Salzman about how alternative data can give investors an edge-and what the risks are.
