      <title>Guido Magician with Mark Normand | Sal Vulcano &amp; Chris Distefano Present: Hey Babe! | EP 65</title>
      <description>Hey Babe! is a podcast where comedians Chris Distefano and Sal Vulcano share stories and have fun. Let your hair down &amp; come hang out with the BABES!
The babes are joined by comedian Mark Normand!!! The guys are welcomed by Mark Normand who you know from his special Out To Lunch and appearances on Comedy Central and Netflix. Guys get straight into and are shocked that Chet Hanks claims he wasn't raised by a good male role model. HIS DAD IS TOM HANKS! Do you think Tom Hanks is a good role model? I mean that Jamaican accent says a lot.. The three quickly transition into another topic to where we learn, Bill Hader stole a ravioli bit from Chris!

Do you know what a Hermès Birkin bag is? Or how much it costs?? For a Berkin bag Mark will be sure to sing whatever you want. Julia Fox was lucky enough to celebrate her birthday with Kanye West who gave all her friends Birkin Bags. Those babies go up to 400,000 dollars! WILD!

We learn that the boys enjoy a good drink, but don't do drugs, BUT enjoy edibles. Headlines are read and it makes the 3 question, Are we going to sh*t?! Is this armageddon? Hollywood signs everyone, even the Tinder Swindler!

Mark is getting married in New Orleans. Shane Gillis, Dan Soder, Tim Dillon will be there and so will Yamineka! Will his wedding turn into a comedy show?! Mark tells us about growing up in New Orleans and getting two weeks off from school for Mardi Gras. Sal shares a story about being on a float in Mardi Gras with Harry Connick Jr. !!!!
 
Chris tells us about Harpers Ferry in  West Virginia and that we have to go! From there we get a History lesson from Chrissy histories about colonial times.  Soon after, we learn that Victoria Secret hired a model with down syndrome for the first time. That brings the conversation to talking about Miss America Show Us Your Shoes Parade, home break ins and  is avocado a dessert?
