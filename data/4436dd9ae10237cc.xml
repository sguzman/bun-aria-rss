   <media:description>Update: The competition is now over. The winner is jongyon7192p, as he submitted a 0 A press entry. Consequently, all restrictions around collaboration and discussion about the trials are lifted. So you may stream the trials, make videos about the trials, discuss the trials, share m64s of the trials, etc. I will now start working on a video about the trials, explaining the intended solutions and how the competitors did. Please be patient as I do this, as it will take quite some time to do.

I showcase The ABC Trials (a ROM hack that Kaze and I created) and offer a $1000 prize to whoever can submit a TAS of it using the fewest A presses by January 20th, 2021. This ROM hack tests your ABC TASing skills and knowledge, so I hope you’ve been paying attention all these years! In case it wasn't clear, this is a *TAS* competition, which normally doesn't allow people to share their strats, since then other TASers would see their strats and copy them.

Find all rules and resources in the discord: https://discord.gg/VNZcr4C

Big thanks to Kaze (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuvSqzfO_LV_QzHdmEj84SQ) for all his help. You see, Kaze has a Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/Kazestuff) where you can pay him to make ROM hacks for you, and so I took him up on this offer. Specifically, I told Kaze all the details of how I wanted the ROM hack to be (e.g. what platforms/objects there should be and where, what the HUD should look like, what the music should be, etc.) and he made it exactly as I envisioned. So this hack is the brainchild of my level design and Kaze’s hacking skills.

Also, thanks to JoshDuMan (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKd0W028Csk7WhEPjeLN5pg) for making a ROM hack for me that made it easier to test pieces of my level design.

   <media:description>I collect the star Watch for Rolling Rocks in Hazy Maze Cave using 0.5 A presses. The A press is to perform AB kicks on the rising elevators. Without doing these kicks, Mario would go through the elevator, and so there'd be no way to navigate out of the lake area with QPU speed. For the record, this is TAS.

This video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected this star in 1 A press. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/yGic8wwhm6g. Since then, we discovered PU movement and scuttlebug raising, which made this strat possible.

For convenience, here are the informative parts of the video:
0:35 for half A presses
3:44 for scuttlebug transportation
5:01 for scuttlebug raising
8:07 for hyper speed walking (HSWing)
10:40 for parallel universes (PUs)

Here is a play by play of what I do. First, I use scuttlebug transportation to move a scuttlebug to the corner of the Watch for Rolling Rocks platform. Then, I use scuttlebug raising to raise him to about the height of the platform. Next, I use hyper speed walking to generate massive speed. Finally, I use PU movement to navigate to the top of the course, launch to the scuttlebug to bounce on him, and ground pound in the misalignment of the platform to get onto it. And from there, I collect the star.

If you want to see my workspace/calculations and read about the process of TASing this, I've chronicled it here: http://imgur.com/gallery/rK24p

This video is without a doubt the one that I've put the most time into out of all my videos. I knew this going in, and so I decided to keep a log of how much time I spent on each aspect of it (note: if my computer was doing work like compiling/recording and I could let it be, I didn't count that time). Here are the stats:

Time to record/manage raw avis: 9 hours
Time to create uncommentated version: 31 hours
Time to add visuals/commentary: 75 hours

Update: The PU route used in this video actually crashes on console, as it turns out PU crashes can still occur even when locking the camera in the main map. Nevertheless, an alternate route has been found that avoids these PU crashes and has been console verified: https://youtu.be/T-G4ymVwajw

https://youtu.be/7S5CF1vsDPQ

I collect the star Stomp on the Thwomp in Tick Tock Clock using 6 A presses. The A presses are as follows:

A Press #1: to get past the first rotating block
A Presses #2-3: to get past the 3 rotating blocks onto the mesh floor
A Press #4: to get onto the rotating cogs
A Press #5: to double jump to the top of the clock
A Press #6: to jump onto thwomp

This video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected this star in 7 A presses. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/5W6_55IDpbU. Since then, Tyler Kehne discovered that there is a pedro spot within the cogs if the clock parts are frozen. Furthermore, he figured out that Mario could reach this pedro spot using a bob-omb. I then optimized the A presses needed to achieve that pedro spot enough so that we ended up saving an A press.

Here is a play by play of what I do. First, I use the crazy box in TTM to set the HOLP to a precise location. Then in TTC I use instant release to place the bob-omb at the HOLP. I then climb up TTC and reactivate the bob-omb to have it snap to me. I bring it to the cogs and use its hitbox to push Mario into the pedro spot. From there, I use the pedro spot to build up speed until I have enough to double jump to the top of the clock, and from there I collect the star.

What is instant release? If Mario both dives into a grabbable object and bonks his head on a wall simultaneously, he'll both grab the object and release it on the same frame. The HOLP is a variable in the game that keeps track of the last place Mario has held an object. It updates continuously as Mario holds an object, and it's the position where released objects appear. However, when Mario performs instant release, the object is released at the HOLP (as it usually is), but the HOLP has not been updated to where it should be since Mario released the object after 0 frames! This means the object will appear at the previous HOLP, i.e. the coordinates of the last place Mario held an object.

What is a pedro spot? It's a spot where Mario can be airborne and about to move onto a floor that has a ceiling right above it. The game calculates Mario's intended position, which is then raised up by the floor. However, the ceiling prevents Mario from moving to that spot. Consequently, Mario will end up remaining in place while able to gain forward speed. His forward speed will increase until the ceiling or floor runs out and he breaks free from the pedro spot.

https://youtu.be/7YhJcF9v7QQ

I go to The Secret Aquarium using using 0 A presses. Unfortunately, this method is only possible on emulator and virtual console, and NOT console. This is because if Mario goes to a PU on console without fixing the camera in the main map, the game will freeze. Normally we can get around this by fixing the camera, but this isn't possible in the castle foyer because the foyer has a special camera that automatically follows Mario around. Thus, whether or not this A press save truly counts is up for debate.

This video is an improvement from my previous video in which I did this using 1 A press. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/mlHzqJn2SMs?t=5m37s. Since then, Tyler Kehne discovered how to exploit PUs and described to me how one could use them to get into the Secret Aquarium using 0 A presses. Consequently, I planned a route, tested it, and ultimately made a TAS that did just that.

So what are PUs? Well, Mario's position is a float, but is treated as a short for testing collisions. Since shorts can only hold up to 2^16 values, some information is lost in this conversion. For example, a float of 1 is converted into a short of 1, but a float of (2^16)+1 is also converted into a short of 1. In other words, the modulo 2^16 operation is performed. This means that in some sense, being at position p + k*(2^16) for some integer k is treated the same as being at position p. Following this logic, there isn't just one map, but a grid of near infinite maps spread out by 2^16 intervals. These other maps are invisible, and are called Parallel Universes (PUs). With enough speed, Mario can travel to these PUs. However, 2^16 speed isn't enough, because the game checks if Mario is above land at each quarter step of his movement. Consequently, Mario needs 4 * 2^16 = 2^18 speed, so that each quarter step point is above a different PU. Thus, 2^18 is referred to as a quadruple PU distance, or QPU. Read Tyler's full description of PUs here: http://pastebin.com/uH5GhHbp

Here is a play-by-play of what I do in the video. First, I go into HMC and use hyper speed walking to generate a vast amount of speed. Hyper speed walking occurs when Mario walks uphill on a steep slope in shallow water. After 25 hours, I've accumulated enough speed for the rest of the journey. From there, I navigate through PUs to arrive back in the HMC main map's water. I then exit out, and conserve my speed into the castle by pressing Z+C^ and punch to get out of C^ mode. From there, I navigate through PUs to ascend up the foyer stairs and then up the BitDW stairs. See, I needed to get sufficient elevation in order to grab onto the SA entrance, and the BitDW hallway was the only place high enough to do so. Once there, I simply return to the main map exactly at the SA entrance.

Note that platforms with different slopes require different speed multiples to cross PUs from. Thus, when going from a platform of one slope to a platform of a different slope, I must drop my speed until it syncs up with the next available speed multiple of the new platform. Decreasing speed can be done quite quickly by jumping with A, but since this is the A button challenge, the quickest way to decrease my speed is to continuously punch, which can take quite some time.

For viewer pleasure and enlightenment, I also show the route a second time with helpful visuals. The 4 screens I show are:
(1) a Standard View: showing the natural view that the game displays
(2) a Relative View: showing Mario's relative position within each PU, which normally cannot be discerned because each PU is invisible
(3) a PU Map: showing which PU Mario is in out the infinite grid of PUs
(4) a Relative Map: showing an overhead view of Mario's relative position within each PU

   <media:description>Update: Due to people using hacked savestates to fraudulently recreate the upwarp, all submissions going forward must be an m64 file that begins from game start.

Recently, a video by twitch user DOTA_TeaBag was brought to my attention, in which he did an upwarp in Tick Tock Clock. I believe this is a new, unexplored glitch, but unfortunately I have been unsuccessful at recreating it myself. Thus, I'm putting a bounty of $1000 on the glitch. In other words, the first person to recreate the glitch and send it to me will earn $1000 from me.

The submission should be a .m64 from game start. The bounty will hold until the first person successfully submits a recreation of the glitch, at which point I will add the word [CLAIMED] to the end of this video's title, and then no one else will be eligible for the prize.

Helpful downloads (a savestate in the TTC room on the Japanese version and an MHS file showing the ceiling currently above Mario):

The song I used at the end was a Benny Hill Techno Remix Demo made by Dj Freshwinter, which you can find here:
https://youtu.be/fesYUkG4Kyg

Additional Notes:
(1) Some people are wondering why the spinners are rotating instead of being still. You must enter Tick Tock Clock when the long hand is at 12 for the objects in the course to be still.
(2) I've been told others have reuploaded this video. Basically, the bounty is awarded to the first person to submit a valid recreation of the glitch. If you submit your entry to someone else and they send it to me, then that person will earn the bounty. I'm not responsible for tracking down the original creator of the .m64; I award whoever sends it in, as is said in the rules. So don't submit to someone else.
(3) Your submission should be a .m64 file that Mupen64 can play. Anything else (such as .avi, .rec) is not valid. So don't use Project64 or Bizhawk.
(4) I've heard of and thought of every theory in the book. Maybe it was the bob-omb, the bob-omb's explosion, the bob-omb's coin, when Mario hits the corner, when Mario presses the wall, when Mario hits his head on the spinner, when Mario touches the other corner, when Mario lands at the edge, being under certain ceilings, etc. Telling me you believe one of these is the cause is not very helpful. I'm looking for hard evidence.</media:description>

   <media:description>I collect the star Snowman's Big Head in Snowman's Land without using any buttons (I only use the joystick and adjust the camera angle).

Here are the specifics of what I do. I first moved a moneybag all the way over to the shell's item block, duplicated the moneybag excessively, and then rode over to the shell by repeatedly bouncing on the moneybags. From there, I use the shell to gain hyper speed in order to reenter fly guy's zone exactly in front of him, causing him to lunge forwards. I then move far away enough from fly guy to deactivate him. Note that in order to manipulate fly guy, he needs to be deactivated 2000+ units away from his starting point, so to accomplish this, it was necessary to have him lunge away and then quickly deactivate him before he turned back. From there, I repeatedly manipulate fly guy to transport him closer to the snowman. Then I climb the snowman, reactivate fly guy, and bounce on him as he flies by. The twirl from bouncing on him provided Mario with enough height to get onto the snowman's head to collect the star.

I collect the star Elevate for 8 Red Coins in Hazy Maze Cave using 0.5 A presses. The A press is to perform AB kicks on the rising elevators in order to maintain the hyper speed while going up.

This video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected this star in 1 A press. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/zQgBScffFXI. Since then, Tyler Kehne discovered that hyper speed walking could be performed in the underground lake in order to accumulate 1500+ speed [https://youtu.be/EX2CCKfXBpc]. Additionally, Plush collaborated with Sonicpacker to figure out how to bring hyper speed up an elevator without losing too much of it [https://youtu.be/4e6neRw-32E]. Expanding upon this, I figured out that by relocating the scuttlebug in the rolling rocks room, we could bounce on it to cross the gap back to the beginning area, and from there clip into the red coin room on the other side of the red wall [https://youtu.be/4ekMOxfn0bs]. And from there, it's it's history!

So how does hyper speed walking work? It involves a steep slope that descends into water. Normally, Mario wouldn't be able to stand on a slope this steep, but the shallow water gives the ground special properties that allows him to do so. Furthermore, if Mario tries to run uphill on this ground, he will end up running backwards at an increasingly fast rate. Usually, this walking can't be used to accumulate all that much speed, because (1) the slope runs out, (2) the slope connects to a wall at angle that isn't 90 degrees and so running backwards into it moves Mario either uphill or downhill, or (3) Mario gains too much speed and can no longer properly follow along the shallow water. Of course, all of this was already known. What wasn't known (and what Tyler discovered) was that the red wall stops Mario from moving while allowing his backwards speed to increase.

If you're wondering about the half A press, read this before commenting to ask why. I use a special notation that allows for half A presses. Specifically, if you enter a level already holding the A button, then that A press only counts as half. It's actually pretty important to distinguish between the A button being PRESSED and the A button being HELD. While pressing A allows Mario to execute several kinds of jumps, the holding of A allows Mario to swim in water, do little kicks up slopes, grab the owl, and twirl slowly. So if a star requires the A button to be held, the pressing of the A button could have been done at some point in the past, and just held until that moment. For instance, let's say there are two stars: one that requires the A button to be pressed (1x A presses), and another that only requires the A button to be held (0.5x A presses). Individually, these stars would both require a full A press. But if these stars were collected one after the other, then the A button could be pressed during the former, and held all the way through to the next star to be used in the latter. In this manner, these stars together would only use 1 A press, whereas they would take 2 A presses if done individually. So during a 120 star run, you would round these half A presses down, but on a star-by-star basis you would round them up.

I collect the star A-Maze-ing Emergency Exit in Hazy Maze Cave using 0.5 A presses. The A press is to perform AB kicks on the rising elevators in order to maintain the hyper speed while going up.

This video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected this star in 1 A press. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/l802xZp4TBY. Since then, Tyler Kehne discovered that hyper speed walking could be performed in the underground lake in order to accumulate 1500+ speed [https://youtu.be/EX2CCKfXBpc]. Additionally, Plush collaborated with Sonicpacker to figure out how to bring hyper speed up an elevator without losing too much of it [https://youtu.be/4e6neRw-32E]. Furthermore, Plush worked out a route for A-Maze-ing Emergency Exit that seemed promising, though he was unable to conserve enough speed to make it fully work [https://youtu.be/TXiXN0njdFg]. Finally, I came along and put everything together, managing to conserve enough speed to make the strat work.

I actually didn't know how much speed would be optimal, so I just got as much as I could (~1450). However, the out-of-bounds clip to the second elevator hallway turned out to have a speed cap, as bringing more than ~430 speed caused all my momentum to be lost. Consequently, I had to drastically reduce my speed at the top of the first elevator to comply with this speed limit. After this speed reduction, I had to be EXTREMELY conservative with what remaining speed I had, since I needed 236+ speed to initiate a successful launch to the star platform. Note that Mario cannot simply AB kick onto the star platform, since that move doesn't go high enough. Instead, he must launch fast enough to grab onto the ledge, and launching with anything less than 236 speed causes Mario to be too low to grab on by the time he's within grabbing-on distance.

So how does hyper speed walking work? It involves a steep slope that descends into water. Normally, Mario wouldn't be able to stand on a slope this steep, but the shallow water gives the ground special properties that allows him to do so. Furthermore, if Mario tries to run uphill on this ground, he will end up running backwards at an increasingly fast rate. Usually, this walking can't be used to accumulate all that much speed, because (1) the slope runs out, (2) the slope connects to a wall at angle that isn't 90 degrees and so running backwards into it moves Mario either uphill or downhill, or (3) Mario gains too much speed and can no longer properly follow along the shallow water.

I collect the star Watch for Rolling Rocks in Hazy Maze Cave using 1 A press. The A press is to do a hyper speed double jump up to the star from the underground lake.

This video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected this star in 2 A presses. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/DZxaWsnucGM. To understand the improvement since then, we're going to need some background information:

Originally, Plush figured out we could accumulate hyper speed in the underground lake using hyper speed water sliding, which can be seen here: https://youtu.be/69NMgKGFKC0?t=1m29s. This technique involved using Z to conserve horizontal speed out of water, and C^ to slide down steep slopes while gaining speed. Soon after this, I realized that with enough hyper speed, we could do a very high double jump all the way to the Watch for Rolling Rocks star [https://youtu.be/DahyjxZzRIs]. Unfortunately, this technique required ~1500 horizontal speed, whereas hyper speed water sliding could only accumulate ~500 speed, and this was simply not enough [https://youtu.be/hipaBm6UWUM]. All hope seemed lost, until today when Tyler Kehne discovered that hyper speed walking could be performed in the underground lake as well [https://youtu.be/EX2CCKfXBpc]. With this technique, we could accumulate 1700+ hyper speed, which was more than enough to collect the Watch for Rolling Rocks star using 1 A press.

So how does hyper speed walking work? It involves a steep slope that descends into water. Normally, Mario wouldn't be able to stand on a slope this steep, but the shallow water gives the ground special properties that allows him to do so. Furthermore, if Mario tries to run uphill on this ground, he will end up running backwards at an increasingly fast rate. Usually, this walking can't be used to accumulate all that much speed, because (1) the slope runs out, (2) the slope connects to a wall at angle that isn't 90 degrees and so running backwards into it moves Mario either uphill or downhill, or (3) Mario gains too much speed and can no longer properly follow along the shallow water. Of course, all of this was already known. What wasn't known (and what Tyler discovered) was that the red wall stops Mario from moving while allowing his backwards speed to increase. With this observation, the Watch for Rolling Rocks strat became 100% doable.

I collect both the 100 coin star and the star Red Coins on the Ship Afloat in Jolly Roger Bay using 1 A press. Individually, the 100 coin star requires 1 A press, and Red Coins on the Ship Afloat requires 1 A press. That makes a total of 2 A presses, whereas collecting them together only requires 1 A press. Thus, I recommend combining these two stars, as it is the optimal strategy.

This video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected these stars in 2 A presses. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/GBRLdHZYabo. Since then, Tyler and I worked out a way to ground pound the blue coin block without needing to press A. You see, we had known for a while that a goomba bounce could be used to ground pound the blue coin block, though it seemed impossible to lure goombas far enough [https://youtu.be/eQ2GG08l3j8]. We knew we could lure goombas a bit by repeatedly knocking into them, but this required too much health to be used in practice [https://youtu.be/4jujYUtJm8E]. Fortunately, Tyler came along and analyzed the code behind goombas' behavior, and realized that there were ways to exploit their behavior to extend their chase sequence. By doing so, Tyler was able to make goombas walk further away from their home than they normally would [https://youtu.be/lonr-XBRwnY]. Seeing Tyler's progress and hearing his explanation of the exploit, I played around with it myself and ultimately worked out a technique that saved the A press [https://youtu.be/955e-pay6bg].

Here is how the goombas' code works: When Mario gets close to a goomba, it will notice him and then chase after him. This chase ends when any of the 3 following conditions are met:
(1) the goomba moves too far away from its home
(2) Mario moves too far away from the goomba's home
(3) Mario moves too far away from the goomba
During a chase, the goomba's target angle is towards Mario, and the goomba turns to try and face this target angle. However (and this is where things get complicated), there are 3 situations that &quot;extend&quot; the chase:
(1) when the goomba walks into a ledge
(2) when the goomba walks onto a steep slope or into a wall
(3) when the goomba collides with another goomba
When any of these occur, the goomba's target angle is recalculated (using complicated equations that aren't too important for this discussion). Thus, the target angle is no longer being set to towards Mario - instead, it will just stay constant, unless another chase extension is performed. Following a chase extension, the goomba will just turn towards its target angle, and once it reaches this angle, then the chase stops.

Upon reading this behavior, you may have realized just how we can exploit it. We simply need to have the goomba chase Mario, then extend the chase, and then repeatedly extend it so that the goomba's facing angle never actually reaches its target angle. In other words, the goomba will constantly be turning towards its target angle, but we have the goomba keep bumping into things that cause this angle to change, and so it never manages to face its current target angle and instead just keeps chasing forever. This is precisely what I do in the video to move a goomba all the way to the blue coin block. Using a rock's steep slope and a wall, I extend Goomba A's chase to move it far away from its home. Then, using a rock's steep slope, a wall, and Goomba A, I extend Goomba B's chase all the way to the blue coin block!

   <media:description>THIS VIDEO IS OUTDATED - SEE A BETTER VERSION OF THIS VIDEO HERE:
https://youtu.be/Onae2YHOv9E

I collect the 100 coin star in Jolly Roger Bay using 1 A press. The A press is to jump onto the ship / neighboring platforms, since there are 21 coins located up there, and so collecting 100 coins without them is impossible.

This video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected this star in 2 A presses. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/16wI-vutotw. Since then, Tyler and I worked out a way to ground pound the blue coin block without needing to press A. You see, we had known for a while that a goomba bounce could be used to ground pound the blue coin block, though it seemed impossible to lure goombas far enough [https://youtu.be/eQ2GG08l3j8]. We knew we could lure goombas a bit by repeatedly knocking into them, but this required too much health to be used in practice [https://youtu.be/4jujYUtJm8E]. Fortunately, Tyler came along and analyzed the code behind goombas' behavior, and realized that there were ways to exploit their behavior to extend their chase sequence. By doing so, Tyler was able to make goombas walk further away from their home than they normally would [https://youtu.be/lonr-XBRwnY]. Seeing Tyler's progress and hearing his explanation of the exploit, I played around with it myself and ultimately worked out a technique that saved the A press [https://youtu.be/955e-pay6bg].

Here is how the goombas' code works: When Mario gets close to a goomba, it will notice him and then chase after him. This chase ends when any of the 3 following conditions are met:
(1) the goomba moves too far away from its home
(2) Mario moves too far away from the goomba's home
(3) Mario moves too far away from the goomba
During a chase, the goomba's target angle is towards Mario, and the goomba turns to try and face this target angle. However (and this is where things get complicated), there are 3 situations that &quot;extend&quot; the chase:
(1) when the goomba walks into a ledge
(2) when the goomba walks onto a steep slope or into a wall
(3) when the goomba collides with another goomba
When any of these occur, the goomba's target angle is recalculated (using complicated equations that aren't too important for this discussion). Thus, the target angle is no longer being set to towards Mario - instead, it will just stay constant, unless another chase extension is performed. Following a chase extension, the goomba will just turn towards its target angle, and once it reaches this angle, then the chase stops.

We simply need to have the goomba chase Mario, then extend the chase, and then repeatedly extend it so that the goomba's facing angle never actually reaches its target angle. In other words, the goomba will constantly be turning towards its target angle, but we have the goomba keep bumping into things that cause this angle to change, and so it never manages to face its current target angle and instead just keeps chasing forever. This is precisely what I do in the video to move a goomba all the way to the blue coin block. Using a rock's steep slope and a wall, I extend Goomba A's chase to move it far away from its home. Then, using a rock's steep slope, a wall, and Goomba A, I extend Goomba B's chase all the way to the blue coin block!

   <media:description>I collect the star Pole-Jumping for Red Coins in Dire, Dire Docks using 0.5 A presses.

The A press is to swim with the shell in order to:
(1) clone a pole
(2) place the HOLP using a dummy clone
(3) clone the whirlpool

This video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected this star in 1.5 A presses. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/2irYbgBSppU. Since then, I worked out a way to get to the red coin in the cage using a whirlpool clone and a new glitch known as &quot;no translation loading&quot;.

You see, all red coins can be collected easily except for the two behind the red walls and the one in the cage. To collect the two red coins behind the red walls, I first placed the HOLP in a specific location using Whomp's Fortress. I then cloned a pole and released it at this HOLP using the hat in hand glitch. Consequently, I could use this cloned pole as an intermediate stopping point to help traverse the distance between two far apart poles.

Collecting the red coin in the cage was an entirely separate and more complicated matter. Backstory: Kyman showed the ABC crew some odd behavior he observed upon releasing the whirlpool clone at the loading point. Specifically, he demonstrated that he ended up in different locations throughout the course, which peaked our interest since what if it could warp Mario directly to the red coin in the cage? Tyler then looked into the matter, and informed us that Mario continues to spiral around whatever object overwrites the whirlpool's slot. Thus, I tested and played around with this, but ultimately declared it to be impossible to use [https://youtu.be/NCCID9hHrlI]. All hope was lost, until I realized Kyman had one more clip that seemed to defy my model. In this clip, he ended up going around in a big spiral in the beginning area (what I show at 13:31). I then looked into this and meticulously mapped it out [http://imgur.com/Mn1ut23], and realized Mario actually evaded the translation that normally applies to him at the loading point. Hence, no translation loading was discovered. I then tested and played around with the new possibilities and came up with a theoretical route that worked, but again declared it to be impossible in practice [https://youtu.be/EHWitWBHzi4]. However, after even more testing and playing around, I discovered that we could use the original whirlpool clone to achieve no translation loading, IF we placed it out of bounds. And of course, we could achieve this by placing the HOLP using the OTHER area's coordinate system and then using the hat in hand glitch. Finally, the strat all came together and an A press was saved!

To learn more about object displacement and the HOLP, you can watch my video on them here: http://youtu.be/seQ-IL-eNqk

If you're wondering what a half A press is, read this before commenting to ask. I use a special notation that allows for half A presses. Specifically, if you enter a level already holding the A button, then that A press only counts as half. It's actually pretty important to distinguish between the A button being PRESSED and the A button being HELD. While pressing A allows Mario to execute several kinds of jumps, the holding of A allows Mario to swim in water, do little kicks up slopes, grab the owl, and twirl slowly. So if a star requires the A button to be held, the pressing of the A button could have been done at some point in the past, and just held until that moment. For instance, let's say there are two stars: one that requires the A button to be pressed (x1 A presses), and another that only requires the A button to be held (0.5 A presses). Individually, these stars would both require a full A press. But if these stars were collected one after the other, then the A button could be pressed during the former, and held all the way through to the next star to be used in the latter. In this manner, these stars together would only use 1 A press, whereas they would take 2 A presses if done individually. So during a 120 star run, you would round these half A presses down, but on a star-by-star basis you would round them up.

Note: If it ever looks like I'm goofing around or stalling, it's because I'm waiting for the poles to get into position, and there's nothing I can do to speed it up. So just because I'm styling doesn't mean I'm wasting time!
