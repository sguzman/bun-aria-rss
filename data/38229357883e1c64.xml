        <![CDATA[<p>There are sounds you long to hear, smells you can’t unsmell, and tastes you forget about entirely when you’re in prison. Five San Quentin residents go deep in the SEASON 10 PREMIERE of <a href="https://www.earhustlesq.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ear Hustle</a>. And what does it mean to be found “Suitable?” Who is, who isn't and why the hell not? Nate McKinney and his family at the <a href="https://www.kalw.org/podcast/uncuffed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Uncuffed</a> podcast get together for an award-winning send-off.</p>

<p><strong>The Five Senses from Ear Hustle</strong></p>

<p>Life in prison can mess with your senses. There are smells you can’t unsmell, and sounds you long to hear. Some tastes you forget about entirely, and some forms of touch are almost too evocative to bear. Five San Quentin residents reflect on the sights, tastes, touch, smells, and sounds of prison life.</p>

<p>Voices heard on this episode: David Ditto, Andrew “Boots” Hardy, Ryan Pagan, Kevin Arbuckle, and Reggie Thorpe, and Tony de Trinidad</p>

<p>Scored with music by: Lee Jaspar, Antwan Williams, Rhashiyd Zinnamon, Fernando Arruda, and David Jassy</p>

<p><strong>Nate’s Going Home from Uncuffed</strong></p>

<p>After over 20 years of incarceration, Uncuffed producer Nate McKinney is going home. Like other lifers in the system, he could have been incarcerated for life. But recently, the Board of Parole Hearings found him suitable to re-enter society. In today's episode, stories of facing the board — and wishes for a friend heading back into the big wide world.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.weareuncuffed.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Uncuffed</a> is a show made by people behind bars in California prisons.

Uncuffed is vulnerable and personal. <a href="https://www.weareuncuffed.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Listen now</a>!</p>

<p>URGENT: Uncuffed suddenly lost their funding. <a href="https://kalw.givecloud.co/uncuffed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Donate NOW</a> so the program can survive.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Isabell is Jason’s mother. She raised him to be ambitious and selfless, which means she’s also raised him to be… overwhelmed. With life. But not to worry, Jason’s mom also knows exactly what to say to pull him out of a rut, which she does every Sunday, when Jason rolls up to her house for their weekly visit.</p>

<p>Thank you Jason, Isabell, and our <a href="https://www.radiotopia.fm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Radiotopia</a> Presents fam for sharing this story with the Snap!</p>

<p>This is Episode 1, “I Can Do Anything,” from, <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/radiotopia-presents-my-mother-made-me/id1260747339" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">My Mother Made Me</a>,</em> a four-part series from Radiotopia Presents where writer Jason Reynolds and his mother, Isabell, explore their shared history, how she raised him, and what they’re teaching each other. It’s a love letter to their connection, an homage to parent-child friendship, and a testament to how growth can be perpetual, despite age or circumstance. Across four episodes, Jason and Isabell go deep – into birth, death and spirituality… but they also keep it light: pushing a cart through Costco, birthday lunches, and hitting the casino together. That’s just how they do.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/radiotopia-presents-my-mother-made-me/id1260747339" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">My Mother Made Me</a></em> is written and narrated by Jason Reynolds with his mother, Isabell Reynolds. The series is produced by Mark Pagán and edited by Julie Shapiro, with production support from Yooree Losordo. Julie Shapiro and Audrey Mardavich are Executive Producers for Radiotopia Presents. Special thanks to Levar Burton. Cover art by Jason Griffin. Theme song by Christian Reynolds. Mixing, sound design and additional original music is by Ian Coss.

<p><strong>White Gold Fever</strong></p>

<p>What's rich, buttery, and tastes like opportunity? Callo de Hacha. The shellfish delicacy that gave one Sinaloan town... "White Gold Fever.</p>

<p>Thank you, Belen, and to everyone in Teacapan for sharing this story with us!</p>

<p>This story was produced in collaboration with <a href="https://thefern.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fern: the Food &amp; Environment Reporting Network</a>, a nonprofit investigative journalism outlet. BIG thanks to Brent Cunningham and Sam Fromartz at Fern.</p>

<p>Our friends at Fern have a new podcast called <a href="https://thefern.org/podcasts/hot-farm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hot Farm</a>. Over four episodes, host Eve Abrams talks to farmers across the Midwest about the reality of climate change and what they are doing -- or could be doing -- to fight it.

<p><strong>Escape From Mammoth Pool</strong></p>

<p>We like to think of time as a constant, as steady, unfluctuating, and infallible. But in some situations—like if you think you’re about to be overtaken by a raging wildfire—time can bend and flex. This week, Snap spotlights <a href="https://www.kvpr.org/podcast/escape-from-mammoth-pool-podcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Escape From Mammoth Pool</a>, a podcast about the harrowing rescue of 242 people and 16 dogs from one of the fastest-moving wildfires in California’s recorded history.</p>

<p>Produced out of <a href="https://www.kvpr.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KVPR</a> in Fresno, California, by reporter/producer Kerry Klein. Edited by Alice Daniel, engineering and sound design by Kerry Klein, web support from Alex Burke, music by <a href="https://filmmusic.io/search" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kevin MacLeod</a> (songs: Acid Trumpet, Beauty Flow, Half Mystery, Rising Tide, Unanswered Questions, Winter Reflections), and sound effects by <a href="https://freesound.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FreeSound</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[Richard Hatch is overseas on a top-secret mission… to win over Jill, the most elusive, electrifying student in his 7th-grade class. He isn’t suave or sophisticated, so he’s gonna need help from The Beatles, the Russians, and even the CIA to pull it off.

Thank you, Richard Hatch aka Danger 9b, for sharing your story with us!

Rick is back in the US and is putting the finishing touches on a kid-friendly memoir about his travels abroad.

        <![CDATA[<p>This past year Adizah Eghan noticed an interesting trend on social media: everyone seemed to be living it up in Tulum, Mexico. Some were flocking there to have a good time, while others were seeking something much deeper: they wanted to escape racism and seek refuge with like-minded people. Adizah traveled to Mexico to experience the vibes of Tulum for herself -- and also dig into why Black people are seeking refuge in a small fishing town south of Cancun.</p>

<p>This piece comes to us from our friends at <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/vice-news-reports/id1525769448" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VICE News Reports.</a> VICE has so many amazing stories, make sure you subscribe to their podcast asap!</p>

<p><em>This episode contains explicit language, sensitive listeners please be advised.</em></p>

<p>Special thanks to Nubia Younge, Patricia Talley, and all those in Tulum!</p>

<p>This episode was produced by Adizah Eghan and edited by Kate Osborn and James T. Green with help from Annie Aviles and Stephanie Kariuki. The original score is by Kyle Murdock.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s when the last glow of amber fades from the sky. When you can’t quite tell who approaches you on the dark path. When everyone starts to speak with lowered voices. That when you know… it’s time for Campfire Tales.</p>

<p>This week, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/snap-judgment-presents-spooked/id1279361017?mt=2&amp;id=1279361017&amp;ign-itsct=luminary_podcasts&amp;ign-itscg=30200" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spooked</a> stories that will keep you up at night! A policeman experiences a sinister omen with deadly consequences. Crows set out to send a man warnings in Santa Fe. And it’s confirmed… all dogs <em>do</em> go to heaven.</p>

<p>STORIES</p>

<p><strong>The Head</strong></p>

<p>We all know the old wives’ tales: don’t walk under a ladder or you’ll have bad luck; don’t step on the crack or you’ll break your mama’s back. Dan is about to discover another, more sinister omen… with deadly consequences.</p>

<p><em>This story does contain graphic content, sensitive listeners please be advised.</em></p>

<p>Thanks, Dan, for sharing your story with Spooked!</p>

<p>Produced by Anne Ford, original score by Maryam Qudus</p>

<p><strong>A Murder of Crows</strong></p>

<p>Mike is pretty sure he’s going crazy. Every time he sees a crow, it seems like it’s trying to tell him something: to watch out, to beware. What are they trying to warn him of?</p>

<p>Thank you, Mike, for sharing your story with Spooked!</p>

<p>Produced by Alyia Yates, original score by Lauryn Newson</p>

<p><strong>All Dogs go to Heaven</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, spirits reach out and ask us for help. And sometimes, they reach out to give us what we need, too.</p>

<p>BIG thanks to, Kristin Kent, for sharing her story with Spooked!</p>

<p>Produced by Zoë Ferrigno, original score by Moyses Nunez</p>

<p>Artwork by Teo Ducot</p>

This week, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/snap-judgment-presents-spooked/id1279361017?mt=2&amp;id=1279361017&amp;ign-itsct=luminary_podcasts&amp;ign-itscg=30200" target="_blank">Spooked</a> stories that will keep you up at night! A policeman experiences a sinister omen with deadly consequences. Crows set out to send a man warnings in Santa Fe. And it’s confirmed… all dogs do go to heaven.

STORIES

The Head

We all know the old wives’ tales: don’t walk under a ladder or you’ll have bad luck; don’t step on the crack or you’ll break your mama’s back. Dan is about to discover another, more sinister omen… with deadly consequences.

This story does contain graphic content, sensitive listeners please be advised.

Thanks, Dan, for sharing your story with Spooked!

Produced by Anne Ford, original score by Maryam Qudus

A Murder of Crows

Mike is pretty sure he’s going crazy. Every time he sees a crow, it seems like it’s trying to tell him something: to watch out, to beware. What are they trying to warn him of?

Thank you, Mike, for sharing your story with Spooked!

Produced by Alyia Yates, original score by Lauryn Newson

All Dogs go to Heaven

Sometimes, spirits reach out and ask us for help. And sometimes, they reach out to give us what we need, too.

BIG thanks to, Kristin Kent, for sharing her story with Spooked!

Produced by Zoë Ferrigno, original score by Moyses Nunez

Artwork by Teo Ducot

<p>STORIES</p>

<p><strong>Theodora</strong></p>

<p>Making sense of the world is always a struggle.  And that's why, as far back as time has existed, some people have chosen to stand up in front of others and tells stories and share ideas that make sense of the chaos around us. We call them "orators" or "the ones who speak"  They turn the chaos into meaning and inspiration.</p>

<p>But there's a bad side of orators too—it's the snake oil salesmen....the buzzword charlatans...the intellectual xenomorphs who prey upon those who just want to find some deeper truths.</p>

<p>Producer <a href="http://jeffemtman.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jeff Emtman</a> is particularly sensitive to this dual nature of public speaking...he's got some of those darker traits himself.  So he developed a simple robot named Theodora who could speak to him about the highly porous barrier that separates inspiration and madness.</p>

<p>This piece comes to us from the podcast <a href="http://hbmpodcast.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Here Be Monsters</a> (<a href="http://bit.ly/HBM146" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HBM146: </a><em><a href="http://bit.ly/HBM146" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Theodora</a>).</em> Music by James Li, of <a href="https://liance.bandcamp.com/album/this-painting-doesnt-dry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Liance</a>.  Album: <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/24DRWu288zPVewjzUHtb4t" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">This Painting Doesn't Dry</a></em></p>

<p><strong>The Other Secret Weapon</strong></p>

<p>A young man has the chance to work on a very secret, very powerful weapon that could put an end to World War II. The project involves no toxins, no chemicals, no shrapnel and no bullets. Instead, the project involves lots and lots of flying mammals. Lots.</p>

STORIES

Theodora

Making sense of the world is always a struggle.  And that's why, as far back as time has existed, some people have chosen to stand up in front of others and tells stories and share ideas that make sense of the chaos around us. We call them "orators" or "the ones who speak"  They turn the chaos into meaning and inspiration.

But there's a bad side of orators too—it's the snake oil salesmen....the buzzword charlatans...the intellectual xenomorphs who prey upon those who just want to find some deeper truths.

Producer <a href="http://jeffemtman.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Emtman</a> is particularly sensitive to this dual nature of public speaking...he's got some of those darker traits himself.  So he developed a simple robot named Theodora who could speak to him about the highly porous barrier that separates inspiration and madness.

<p>STORIES</p>

<p><strong>Map to the Disappeared</strong></p>

<p>A woman in Veracruz, Mexico receives a map from a pair of anonymous strangers that leads her on a search to solve a mystery that’s haunted her for years.</p>

<p><em>This story includes descriptions of corpses, graves sites, and a brief mention of torture. Sensitive listeners, please be advised.</em></p>

<p>Thank you, Griselda Barradas, for sharing your story with us! Special thanks to journalist Felix Marquez for his assistance in producing this story and to actress Norma Yolanda Lopez.</p>

<p>Griselda is still a member of the group, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lucidige" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">El Solecito</a>. They’ve just begun excavating a second mass grave in Veracruz and have so far found close to 50 bodies. Today there are more than 70 groups of parents across Mexico like El Solecito. Searching for the remains of their missing children while the authorities do little to help. On average, two graves are uncovered each day.</p>

<p>Produced by <a href="https://www.estherhonig.me/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Esther Honig</a>, original score by Renzo Gorrio, artwork by Teo Ducot</p>

<p><strong>The Three Christs Of Ypsilanti</strong></p>

<p>In 1959, psychiatrist Milton Rokeach brought together three schizophrenic men who believed they were Jesus Christ, hoping to cure them of their delusions. But over time, his methods became dangerously amoral.</p>

<p>Thanks to Richard Bonier and Ronald Hoppe for their help.  Additional thanks to Peter Shyppert as the voice of Milton Rokeach.</p>

<p>You can buy The Three Christs of Ypsilanti, Rokeach’s book, right <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Christs-Ypsilanti-Review-Classics/dp/1590173848" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

STORIES

Map to the Disappeared

A woman in Veracruz, Mexico receives a map from a pair of anonymous strangers that leads her on a search to solve a mystery that’s haunted her for years.

This story includes descriptions of corpses, graves sites, and a brief mention of torture. Sensitive listeners, please be advised.

Thank you, Griselda Barradas, for sharing your story with us! Special thanks to journalist Felix Marquez for his assistance in producing this story and to actress Norma Yolanda Lopez.

Griselda is still a member of the group, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lucidige" target="_blank">El Solecito</a>. They’ve just begun excavating a second mass grave in Veracruz and have so far found close to 50 bodies. Today there are more than 70 groups of parents across Mexico like El Solecito. Searching for the remains of their missing children while the authorities do little to help. On average, two graves are uncovered each day.

Produced by <a href="https://www.estherhonig.me/" target="_blank">Esther Honig</a>, original score by Renzo Gorrio, artwork by Teo Ducot

The Three Christs Of Ypsilanti

In 1959, psychiatrist Milton Rokeach brought together three schizophrenic men who believed they were Jesus Christ, hoping to cure them of their delusions. But over time, his methods became dangerously amoral.

Thanks to Richard Bonier and Ronald Hoppe for their help.  Additional thanks to Peter Shyppert as the voice of Milton Rokeach.

You can buy The Three Christs of Ypsilanti, Rokeach’s book, right <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Christs-Ypsilanti-Review-Classics/dp/1590173848" target="_blank">here.</a>

        <![CDATA[<p>One officer in Los Angeles used car inspections to hit on women. Three hundred miles away in the San Francisco Bay Area, another woman says an officer used police resources to harass and stalk her.</p>

<p>This episode investigates these two cases of sexual misconduct by California Highway Patrol officers. While the officers were fired, the agency did not refer potential crimes to prosecutors. And the files show some women who came forward were met with suspicion, discouragement, or what one woman saw as intimidation.</p>

<p>Snap presents, “Conduct Unbecoming,” the second episode of <em><a href="https://www.kqed.org/podcasts/onourwatch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">On Our Watch</a></em>, an investigative podcast from NPR &amp; KQED.</p>

<p><em>This episode contains instances of sexual misconduct but it does not contain sexual assault. Sensitive listeners, please be advised.</em></p>

<p>Thank you, Sukey Lewis, Sandhya Dirks, Alex Emslie, and the entire <em>On Our Watch</em> team!</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.kqed.org/podcasts/onourwatch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">On Our Watch</a></em> is an amazing seven-part podcast series, hosted by Sukey Lewis. It was created after a new police transparency law unsealed scores of internal affairs files. NPR and KQED reporters set out to examine these cases and the shadow world of police discipline.

        <![CDATA[One officer in Los Angeles used car inspections to hit on women. Three hundred miles away in the San Francisco Bay Area, another woman says an officer used police resources to harass and stalk her.

This episode investigates these two cases of sexual misconduct by California Highway Patrol officers. While the officers were fired, the agency did not refer potential crimes to prosecutors. And the files show some women who came forward were met with suspicion, discouragement, or what one woman saw as intimidation.

Snap presents, “Conduct Unbecoming,” the second episode of <a href="https://www.kqed.org/podcasts/onourwatch" target="_blank">On Our Watch</a>, an investigative podcast from NPR &amp; KQED.

This episode contains instances of sexual misconduct but it does not contain sexual assault. Sensitive listeners, please be advised.

Thank you, Sukey Lewis, Sandhya Dirks, Alex Emslie, and the entire On Our Watch team!

      <title>Hot Trash - Snap Spotlights “Ear Hustle”</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Snap Judgment presents, “Hot Trash,” a special spotlight on the <a href="http://www.earhustlesq.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ear Hustle</a> podcast, from <a href="https://www.prx.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PRX</a>’s <a href="http://radiotopia.fm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Radiotopia</a>.</p>

<p>Visiting a loved one in prison is both emotionally intense and constrained by countless rules — from how much PDA is too much PDA, to what kind of candy you can eat inside. One year after California prison authorities suspended in-person visits due to COVID-19, hear stories from and about visiting rooms… and how families are adjusting to video “visits.</p>

<p><em>This episode contains explicit language, sensitive listeners please be advised.</em></p>

<p>Heard on this episode: Nicola Christopher Bucci and Frank Jernigan, Sgt. Cuevas, Helen Theresa Guion, Michael Hatch, Vesta, and Ruben. Inside San Quentin: Hamisi Spears, Lacedrick Johnson, Elton Spencer, Michael Marler, Kim Puckett, Anthony Ammons, Bashar Aremu, Floyd Collins, Brandon Browner, and Nephew.</p>

<p>Thanks also to Alesha Monteiro, Michelle Garcia, Michelle Tran, and all the women who shared stories about their video visits.</p>

<p>This episode was scored with music by Antwan Williams, David Jassy, Gregg Sayers, and Rhashiyd Zinnamon.</p>

<p>As always, big thanks to Lt. Sam Robinson and Acting Warden Ron Broomfield for their support of the show.</p>

<p>Ear Hustle is a proud member of<a href="https://www.radiotopia.fm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> Radiotopia</a>, from PRX.

Visiting a loved one in prison is both emotionally intense and constrained by countless rules — from how much PDA is too much PDA, to what kind of candy you can eat inside. One year after California prison authorities suspended in-person visits due to COVID-19, hear stories from and about visiting rooms… and how families are adjusting to video “visits.

This episode contains explicit language, sensitive listeners please be advised.

Heard on this episode: Nicola Christopher Bucci and Frank Jernigan, Sgt. Cuevas, Helen Theresa Guion, Michael Hatch, Vesta, and Ruben. Inside San Quentin: Hamisi Spears, Lacedrick Johnson, Elton Spencer, Michael Marler, Kim Puckett, Anthony Ammons, Bashar Aremu, Floyd Collins, Brandon Browner, and Nephew.

Thanks also to Alesha Monteiro, Michelle Garcia, Michelle Tran, and all the women who shared stories about their video visits.

<p>Glynn knows… sometimes the sum of the parts does not equal the hole.</p>

<p>Produced by Pat Mesiti-Miller</p>

<p><strong>The Scientist and the Psychopath</strong></p>

<p>Neuroanatomist James Fallon, Ph.D. studies the most dangerous kind of person: the psychopath. His job is to get up close and personal with the mind of the psychopath so that we can better understand what makes them tick. He treats their brains with the cold calculation of a scientist at work. But in the process, things get mighty personal.</p>

<p>James Fallon, Ph.D. is a neuroanatomist and geneticist at UC-Irvine. For more about his work and his own life, check out his book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Psychopath-Inside-Neuroscientists-Personal-Journey/dp/1591846005" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Psychopath Inside: A Neuroscientist's Personal Journey into the Dark Side of the Brain.</a></p>

<p>Produced by Julia DeWitt</p>

<p><strong>About Face</strong></p>

<p>You’ve heard the saying, right? You can’t see the forest for the trees. Well, imagine if your whole life all you could do, all you knew how to do, was see the trees, the details, the minutiae of the world. What would you miss out on? Let’s take a walk in Tom Conces’ shoes and find out.</p>

<p>Produced by Nancy López, original score by Renzo Gorrio</p>

<p><strong>Across the DMZ</strong></p>

<p>What happens when you are reunited with your North Korean sister for the first time in over five decades?</p>

<p>Thank you to our voice actors, Yongnam and Mikyung Kim!</p>

<p>Produced and scored by Davey Kim</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>An Iranian American examines herself and her life in a one-woman audio show that straddles the line between fiction and truth. Snap Judgment presents, “A Person Who Has Never Even Been Married...” a special spotlight on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/appearances/id1531380479" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Appearances</a> podcast.</p>

The difficulty of finding the right partner seems to be directly connected to the struggles witnessed in her home throughout her entire childhood.

This week, we are featuring <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510357/louder-than-a-riot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Louder Than A Riot</a>, an incredible new podcast from <a href="https://www.npr.org/music" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NPR Music</a>. It reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America.</p>

<p>STORY</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/03/930906348/the-badder-the-better-bobby-shmurda-pt-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Badder, The Better: Bobby Shmurda (Pt 1)</a></p>

<p>Just like his legendary disappearing hat, Brooklyn rapper Bobby Shmurda's career was on the rise in 2014. But so was the evidence in a murder case against his crew, GS9. In the first of three episodes exploring Bobby's story, we look at his come-up through the eyes of former Epic Records exec Sha Money XL, who guided Bobby on his tightrope walk from the streets to superstardom. What happens when the industry capitalizes on a criminal persona? And do record execs have the juice to back Bobby up when things get too hot?</p>

<p>Content Advisory: This story contains strong language and the mention of drug use and guns. Sensitive listeners, please be advised.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>What’s keeping you from feeling proud today? We’re exploring that question with a special Snap two-for-one: <a href="https://shamebooth.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SHAMEBOOTH</a>, a traveling art installation, hotline, and podcast featuring the voices of real people sharing their shame, and “Quiet Is Best,” a story from Julie Lindahl about her shocking discovery of a secret -- and shameful -- family legacy.</p>

<p>Content advisory: These stories detail substances, violence/graphic images of Nazi Germany, and sexual assault. Sensitive listeners, please be advised.</p>

<p>STORIES:</p>

<p>SHAMEBOOTH Recordings</p>

<p><a href="https://shamebooth.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SHAMEBOOTH</a> explores the science &amp; psychology behind one of the most intense and isolating emotions a person can feel by capturing the voices of real people who step into a refurbished phone booth to speak their truths.

        <![CDATA[<p>Team Snap brings you the story of the devastating COVID-19 outbreak at San Quentin State Prison, as told by people on the inside.</p>

<p>STORIES</p>

<p>Outbreak at San Quentin</p>

<p>As the Coronavirus outbreak overwhelms San Quentin State Prison, one incarcerated person, Chanthon Bun, is awaiting his release on parole. Bun tries to protect himself from the virus, while incarcerated first responders and cleaning crews attempt to treat those who are collapsing and stop the spread of COVID-19. In this episode, we hear first-hand accounts from incarcerated people inside San Quentin trying to survive the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.</p>

<p>This story contains graphic content, listener discretion is advised.</p>

<p>At the time of this recording, 13 people from San Quentin have died due to coronavirus, bringing the total number of lives lost in California prisons to 40. Our hearts go out to them and theirs, sincerely.</p>

<p>Find out how you can support people on the inside with care packages and more at <a href="https://www.classy.org/give/281723/#!/donation/checkout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Prison University Project</a>.</p>

<p>Chanthon Bun is a producer now living on the outside. Greg Eskridge and Thanh Tran are both multimedia journalists currently incarcerated at San Quentin. Checkout <a href="https://www.weareuncuffed.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Uncuffed</a> and <a href="https://restorecal.org/firstwatch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">First Watch</a> for more of their work.

STORIES

Outbreak at San Quentin

As the Coronavirus outbreak overwhelms San Quentin State Prison, one incarcerated person, Chanthon Bun, is awaiting his release on parole. Bun tries to protect himself from the virus, while incarcerated first responders and cleaning crews attempt to treat those who are collapsing and stop the spread of COVID-19. In this episode, we hear first-hand accounts from incarcerated people inside San Quentin trying to survive the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

This story contains graphic content, listener discretion is advised.

At the time of this recording, 13 people from San Quentin have died due to coronavirus, bringing the total number of lives lost in California prisons to 40. Our hearts go out to them and theirs, sincerely.

        <![CDATA[<p>For 110 days Peter Hammarstedt and his group of ocean vigilantes hunted the most notorious poacher on the high seas, known as the Thunder. Their journey turns into an epic chase across 10,000 miles, two seas, and three oceans, through massive ice floors, violent clashes, and storms-tossed seas, where only one ship makes it home.</p>

<p>Thank you so much to Peter Hammarstedt for sharing your story with us!</p>

<p>Thanks as well to Ian Urbina. We first heard about this story thanks to his reporting. You can find his book, <em>The Outlaw Ocean: Journeys Across the Last Untamed Frontier,</em> on <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/538736/the-outlaw-ocean-by-ian-urbina/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Knopf</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outlaw-Ocean-Journeys-Untamed-Frontier/dp/0451492943" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, or anywhere books are sold. Ian has a great collection of stories and books about the lawless ocean.</p>

<p>Also, BIG thanks to <em>Brick City TV</em> &amp; Mark Benjamin for sharing the audio from their documentary, <em>Ocean Warriors: Chasing the Thunder</em>. You can see a trailer of the film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guje_qFj0Js" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>While most of the world continues to shelter-in-place, Team Snap brings you the third installment of, "Letters from Lockdown.” </p>

<p>STORIES</p>

<p>Jericho</p>

<p>Osama Iliwat spent days in solitary confinement inside an Israeli prison during the First and Second Palestinian Intifadas. Learn how peace reached him in the midst of conflict.</p>

<p>Today, Osama runs a cell phone shop in Jericho, is a peace activist, and leads international tours in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. He advocates for dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians and speaks to international groups with an organization called <a href="https://cfpeace.org/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Combatants for Peace</a>. </p>

<p>Rwanda</p>

<p>In the 90s, Eric Murangwa was the star goalkeeper of Rwanda’s most beloved football team, Rayon Sport. He was also a Tutsi - at the time when death squads were hunting Tutsis. Find out where - and with who - Eric took refuge.</p>

<p>Eric now runs a charity called <a href="https://ishamifoundation.org/programmes-in-the-uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ishami Foundation</a>, which brings people together through sport.  He’s currently raising money for vulnerable families affected by coronavirus during the genocide commemoration in Rwanda. Help him <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/nwcutu-survivors-in-solidarity" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reach his goal</a>. </p>

<p>Brooklyn</p>

<p>Estee grew up in an ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn where her then-husband isolated her from friends, family, and activities for nearly two decades. Hear how Estee’s spirit could not be contained by four walls. </p>

<p>Today, Estee lives in Jerusalem with her eight children and recently remarried a very kind man. She teaches Zumba Extreme at the Jerusalem YMCA. Hear more of <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/snapjudgment/episodes/snap-901-how-estee-got-her-zumba-back" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Estee’s story</a> in the Snap archives.</p>

<p><strong>If I Only Had A Heart</strong></p>

<p>The sum of the parts cannot equal the hole in your heart.</p>

<p><strong>The Scientist And The Psychopath</strong></p>

<p>Neuroanatomist Dr. James Fallon studies the most dangerous kind of person: the psychopath. His job is to get up close and personal with the mind of the psychopath so that we can better understand what makes them tick. He treats their brains with the cold calculation of a scientist at work. But in the process things get mighty personal.</p>

<p><strong>About Face</strong></p>

<p>You’ve heard the saying, right? You can’t see the forest for the trees. Well, imagine if your whole life all you could do, all you knew how to do, was see the trees, the details, the minutiae of the world. What would you miss out on. Let’s take a walk in Tom Conces’ shoes and find out.</p>

        <![CDATA[What if you don't have a heart?
If I Only Had A Heart
 The sum of the parts cannot equal the hole in your heart.
The Scientist And The Psychopath
Neuroanatomist Dr. James Fallon studies the most dangerous kind of person: the psychopath.

You’ve heard the saying, right? You can’t see the forest for the trees. Well, imagine if your whole life all you could do, all you knew how to do, was see the trees, the details, the minutiae of the world. What would you miss out on. Let’s take a walk in Tom Conces’ shoes and find out.
