			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mindfulness and meditation aren’t just about spirituality or stress relief.</p> <p>In today’s world of constant demands and digital distractions, mindfulness is about making your moments truly matter and living up to your full potential.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 years ago, Tony Robbins gave behind the scenes access of his annual life changing event, Date With Destiny to Netflix and filmmaker Joe Berlinger, and the movie I Am Not Your Guru was born. Today, Tony and his wife Sage sit down with Joe and discuss how the film came to be, as well as check in with some of the people highlighted in the documentary and what their life looks like today, years after this transformative event. If interested in attending yourself, visit DWDVirtual.com</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filmmaker Joe Berlinger is known for making mostly dark documentaries about rock singers & serial killers. However, when Joe attended Tony Robbins’ Date With Destiny event and moved from the dark to the light in his own life, he knew he had to make a movie about this transformative event. After months and months of convincing Tony and Sage to say yes, he agreed to their terms of not letting his crew get in the way of the event or experience of the people in the room in any way, and  I Am Not Your Guru was born. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we celebrate the 5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">anniversary of this ground-breaking film, Joe sits down with Tony and Sage to share moving stories, behind the scenes anecdotes and life updates from several people followed in the documentary.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>5 years ago, Tony Robbins gave behind the scenes access of his annual life changing event, Date With Destiny to Netflix and filmmaker Joe Berlinger, and the movie I Am Not Your Guru was born. Today, Tony and his wife Sage sit down with Joe and discuss how the film came to be, as well as check in with some of the people highlighted in the documentary and what their life looks like today, years after this transformative event. If interested in attending yourself, visit DWDVirtual.com</p> <p>Filmmaker Joe Berlinger is known for making mostly dark documentaries about rock singers & serial killers. However, when Joe attended Tony Robbins’ Date With Destiny event and moved from the dark to the light in his own life, he knew he had to make a movie about this transformative event. After months and months of convincing Tony and Sage to say yes, he agreed to their terms of not letting his crew get in the way of the event or experience of the people in the room in any way, and  I Am Not Your Guru was born. </p> <p>As we celebrate the 5th anniversary of this ground-breaking film, Joe sits down with Tony and Sage to share moving stories, behind the scenes anecdotes and life updates from several people followed in the documentary.

			<title>The Future of Food, Energy and Space | Tony sits down with 4 visionary business leaders creating solutions to global problems</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past year was a trying one for all of us, and this new year has started off with challenges, too. It would be easy to believe that we as a society are headed in a negative direction, to be fearful of the future – but as Tony says, Fear is simply imagination undirected. What happens when you give direction to your imagination? That’s what we call faith.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faith is not learned, it’s something we are born with. Faith is what fuels us through times of fear and uncertainty. It is more powerful than any emotion, even fear. When all hell is breaking loose, it gives us the ability to find our center, to help ourselves and others to find answers, to find a higher meaning in the midst of our pain and in spite of our fear. And if you’re a leader, you take that certainty and transfer it into others, because human conviction has a viral effect and will spread. Faith is knowing that at our core we're more than anything we will ever face, and we can handle whatever life brings us. We always have and we always will.

And faster than anyone thought possible. They're doing things that will change the lives of billions of people all across the globe.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past year was a trying one for all of us, and this new year has started off with challenges, too. It would be easy to believe that we as a society are headed in a negative direction, to be fearful of the future – but as Tony says, Fear is simply imagination undirected. What happens when you give direction to your imagination? That’s what we call faith.</p> <p>Faith is not learned, it’s something we are born with. Faith is what fuels us through times of fear and uncertainty. It is more powerful than any emotion, even fear. When all hell is breaking loose, it gives us the ability to find our center, to help ourselves and others to find answers, to find a higher meaning in the midst of our pain and in spite of our fear. And if you’re a leader, you take that certainty and transfer it into others, because human conviction has a viral effect and will spread. Faith is knowing that at our core we're more than anything we will ever face, and we can handle whatever life brings us. We always have and we always will. That is the power of the human race.</p> <p>In this episode, Tony sits down with four extraordinary human beings that are working to solve major global issues, who believe so strongly in their solutions and have so much certainty that it’s almost contagious! </p> <p>These four leaders are not only world changing technology experts, but the founders and CEOs of companies that are bringing the stuff of science-fiction novels <em>to life</em>. And faster than anyone thought possible. They're doing things that will change the lives of billions of people all across the globe. Their ultimate outcome is to increase that quality of life for everyone in existence and for generations to come. </p> <p>In this episode, you will learn about: </p> <p>The future of food.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a universally challenging year for all, there have been so many blessings – if we take the time to stop and look. In this third and final Fireside Chat of 2020, Tony and Sage share the simple rituals they do together with their family at this time each year.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to hear their own new year traditions, and they’ll encourage you to put together a few photos, too. Note your big accomplishments (and the little ones!), remember the magic moments, reconnect to the joy and laughter that can easily be forgotten but recreated just as quickly as you ground yourself in gratitude and appreciate those moments all over again. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the challenges of the past year, too, through a different lens – the circumstances or situations that may have caused pain at the time but pushed you to evolve and grow, built resilience, forged progress, and, as a result, ultimately blessed your life. Find the blessing, be the blessing, and your life will be blessed.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, as you’ll hear in this episode, as we head into the New Year and this entirely new world we all find ourselves in, Tony wants to give you the opportunity to grow even more, and create whatever it is you truly desire – the life you were made for.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch below to take part in the <a href="http://www.make2021myyear.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">gift he is offering</a>, free of charge, so that you can make 2021 not just better than the last, but your best year ever.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re resolved, you’ve cut off anything other than what you’re committed to – every ounce of your soul is there.” – Tony Robbins</span></p> <p><strong>About The Fireside Chat Series:</strong> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">In the 1930s and 40s, a time when the country was struggling even more than it is today, we had an amazing leader named FDR. He began doing evening radio programs called “fireside chats,” designed to communicate directly with the American people. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, 90% of people in the U.S at that time had a radio. Today, 96% of people have a cell phone and nearly all have internet access.</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">Instead of being unified and watching all the same things, and having a collective experience, now we're all kind of separated. And we can see division in our culture. We desperately need a form of unity, a form of connection, more humanity and more kindness in the world.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony and Sage thought to bring back this time-honored tradition of a fireside chat as a means of unity and compassion. We’re entering the winter season, drawing inward into our homes and into ourselves, reflecting on the hardships and blessings alike this unique year has brought. In this three-part series, you will hear them dispel their hopes and dreams for you this holiday season, as well as share some of Tony’s powerful tools and strategies to not only survive the coming months, but to step up and <em>thrive</em>.</span></p>]]></description>

			<title>How will we feed the next billion? | Tony's interview from XPRIZE: Future Positive</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over 25 years, XPRIZE has convened the brightest minds from around the globe to tackle the world’s greatest challenges. One of the most pressing problems facing humanity today is food insecurity, and the need for nutritious, affordable, and sustainably-sourced food has reached critical status.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this exciting interview with XPRIZE Founder and Executive Chairman, Peter H. Diamandis, Tony talks about the inspiration behind the latest competition, the $15M XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion. This episode is from XPRIZE's own <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/future-positive/id1512234507"> Future Positive podcast</a> and released with their permission here.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2050, Earth’s population will have reached 9.7 billion. The demand for high protein products is increasing while the impact from current meat production practices is devastating our planet. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened food insecurity, food safety, and access for many communities around the world. Furthermore, cities projected to face rapid population growth and wealth increase are experiencing surges in demand for poultry and fish as opposed to red meat.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is increasing activity in utilizing plant-based and cultivated approaches to create meat alternatives, more work is needed to make it widespread. XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion is a $15M competition incentivizing teams to produce chicken and fish alternatives that replicate or outperform conventional protein in structure, versatility, sensory properties, and nutritional profile, while having a lower comparable environmental footprint.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony has made it one of his life's missions to help feed as many people as possible. His family struggled to put food on the table growing up, and it was one stranger’s kindness that inspired Tony to give back as an adult. As a philanthropist, through his partnership with Feeding America, Tony has provided over 500 million meals in the last 5 years to those in need. He’s on track to provide 1 billion meals over the next 5 years.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter H. Diamandis is the founder and executive chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation, which leads the world in designing and operating large-scale incentive competitions. He is also the executive founder of Singularity University, a graduate-level Silicon Valley institution that counsels the world's leaders on exponentially growing technologies.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an entrepreneur, Diamandis has started over 20 companies in the areas of longevity, space, venture capital and education. He is cofounder of BOLD Capital Partners, a venture fund with $250M investing in exponential technologies, and co-founder and Vice Chairman of Celularity, Inc., a cellular therapeutics company. He earned degrees in molecular genetics and aerospace engineering from MIT and holds an M.D. from Harvard Medical School.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diamandis is a New York Times best-selling author, and his newest book in this series of exponential technologies – The Future is Faster Than You Think – was released on January 28, 2020. His favorite saying is “the best way to predict the future is to create it yourself.”</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony and Sage sit down for an intimate fireside chat to unpack the stress many of us feel around the holidays. We all have rules and beliefs about how things are supposed to be or how people are supposed to be. And when they do not meet our expectations, we suffer. The holidays can hold a magnifying glass over these expectations, whether that be family dynamics, budgets, or how well the turkey turned out.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen as Tony and Sage suggest a new approach: To replace expectation with appreciation, to lead with gratitude and thanksgiving instead of worry, fear or anger. Sage eloquently calls us to take pause on the list-making and to-do’s associated with getting ready for the holidays. And Tony provides us with an invaluable tool for how to get more joy out of each individual moment and experience. It’s time to make a decision about what kind of holiday you want to have, to bring a new level of enjoyment for yourself and to be a blessing to those you love most. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s wrong is always available, so is what’s right.” - Tony Robbins </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>About The Fireside Chat Series:</strong> In the 1930s and 40s, a time when the country was struggling even more than it is today, we had an amazing leader named FDR.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em>“Let’s create not only some healing here but some real change. … Change is automatic, but progress is not. And so this is a conversation today to see if we can create some progress. … What this is really about is getting to what we can do to tap into unity, and love, and compassion, and connection to one another. What can we do to move forward?” – Tony Robbins</em></p> <p> </p> <p>It’s been over three months since the death of George Floyd, the unarmed, 46-year-old black man, who was unconscionably killed by police in broad daylight during an arrest in Minneapolis. Captured on cell-phone video and amplified in the media, the whole world witnessed his horrific death, and it has reignited a centuries-long conversation around race supremacy in the United States and the injustice that African Americans can face.</p> <p>The aftermath of George Floyd’s death — and combined stacking of others like Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, and most recently the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis.  — has brought this nation to a threshold. With thousands of people around the world in grief, humanity is speaking loud and clear: enough is enough, the time is now to create real change rooted in our nation’s foundation of ‘justice for all.’ Beyond change, we need progress. As Tony said in the first episode of this special two-part podcast series, change is automatic – but progress is not.</p> <p><strong>The conversation continues</strong>. In this 2-hour episode, Tony hosts a panel of five unique, multi-generational leaders who share their experience of what it is to be Black in America and lend their voice to what we, as a unified society, need to listen to and hear, to unite, to make progress, and ultimately to tap into love, compassion, and our deep connection to one another.</p> <p><strong><em>“If love is not yet won, the battle is not yet over.”</em></strong></p> <p><em>– Martin Luther King III</em></p> <p><strong>Part 2 Guests:   </strong></p> <p>Charlamagne tha God (Radio show host, author, influencer)</p> <p>Rev.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 11, 2020, people all over the world were thrust into a new reality when the coronavirus was declared a global pandemic. It was as if the globe had ground to a halt as businesses closed, schools shuttered, and stay-at-home orders emptied city streets. Thousands of lives have been lost; all lives have been changed. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two months, despite these uncertain and unprecedented circumstances, there have been shining examples of goodness and triumphs of the human spirit solidifying the fact that we as a species are both adaptable and resilient. Scientists around the globe have aligned their focus to find solutions to this challenge of historic proportions, and groundbreaking discoveries have been made. Everyday, we continue to make progress in quelling the impact of this virus and protecting our loved ones at risk. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, much of the COVID-19 news comes to us clouded by the business of mass media which built momentum selling us a narrative of fear. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, Tony goes on a journey to uncover the truth about coronavirus with a 7-person panel of highly qualified researchers, an experienced epidemiologist, a Nobel Laureate, and M.D.s testing and treating patients on the frontlines. Together, they reveal the evidence-based research that has come to light and the emerging facts that you’re not hearing in the headlines that are absolutely crucial in shaping decisions about how to move forward. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the most important interviews that Tony has conducted in his 40+ year career. It reminds us to stand guard at the door of our mind, practice discernment when determining trustworthy sources, and think critically for ourselves in order to stay flexible and maintain the ability to pivot in light of new information – especially when lives depend on it. </span></p> <p><strong>Podcast panelists in this episode include: </strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dr. Michael Levitt</strong>, PhD, Nobel Prize – Chemistry; Professor of Structural Biology, Stanford University </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dr. Eran Bendavid</strong>, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine, Stanford University </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dr. Michael Roizen</strong>, M.D., Chief Wellness Officer Emeritus, Cleveland Clinic</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dr. Alan Preston</strong>, Sc.D, Former Professor of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Texas A&M University</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"><strong>Senator Scott Jensen</strong>, M.D., Family Physician; Senator (R-Minnesota) </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dr. Dan Erickson</strong>, M.D., Co-Owner, Accelerated Urgent Care</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dr. Artin Massihi</strong>, M.D., Co-Owner, Accelerated Urgent Care</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EPISODE NOTES:</strong></span></p> <ul> <li class="p1">[00:00:00] Introduction from Tony Robbins</li> <li class="p1">[00:08:30] Interview with Dr. Michael Levitt</li> <li class="p1">[00:27:00] Interview with Senator Scott Jensen, M.D.</li> <li class="p1">[00:39:00] Interview with Dr. Eran Bendavid, M.D</li> <li class="p1">[00:49:30] Interview with Dr. Alan Preston, Sc.D</li> <li class="p1">[01:17:30] Interview with Dr. Michael Roizen, M.D.</li> <li class="p1">[01:38:00] Interview with Dr. Dan Erickson, M.D.</li> <li class="p1">[01:45:30] Interview with Dr. Artin Massihi, M.D.</li> <li class="p1">[01:55:25] Round-Robin discussion</li> <li class="p1">[02:34:20] Tony’s closing comments</li> </ul>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>"Forgiveness is the gift you give yourself, not a gift you give someone else." – Tony Robbins</p> <p>We will always carry anger and hurt in our hearts as long as we have expectations of other people and life conditions we can’t control. But that built-up resentment only ends up hurting you. As Nelson Mandela said, "Resentment is like drinking a poison and then waiting for the other person to die." Forgiveness is understanding that the only person you hurt when you’re upset – no matter how justified it may be – is yourself.</p> <p>In this episode, you'll hear from two people who carried resentment with them from past events and expectations – and didn't even know it. But once they released the blame they held in their hearts, they experienced a level of freedom and strength of spirit. Hear the stories of Sarah Foley and Dimple Thakrar, both in entirely different situations, but tied together by the common thread of the power of forgiveness.</p> <p>To learn more about the gift of forgiveness, visit www.tonyrobbins.com/gifts.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Grace is not something you earn. It's not a reward, or something you pray or ask for. And it has nothing to do with karma, or your past actions. You don't deserve grace – it just falls on you.</p> <p>What's remarkable about grace is that the more you acknowledge it, the more it appears. Grace can be a guiding force when your intent is pure and your will is strong, but something else pushes you through.</p> <p>Janet Taylor knows the power of grace. When her daughter landed in the emergency room after overdosing on drugs, Janet didn't know what to do. She didn't even know how to react – with fear? Anger? Sadness? When she finally let go of what she couldn't control and gave in to faith, that's when she started to appreciate her daughter's progress away from addiction, even the smallest steps.</p> <p>Jenn Ferris also knows the power of grace. As a child she was abandoned at a bus stop in her village in India. She could have chosen to put a negative meaning on that, and many other things in her life, events that were out of her control. But you'll see how grace appeared her life, because her heart was open and her faith was strong.</p> <p>To learn more about the gift of grace, visit www.tonyrobbins.com/gifts.</p>]]></description>

When everyone else was panicking in 2008 and 2009, Jenny and co founder Jennifer Hyman saw an opportunity.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem they were trying to solve was simple enough: Looking into your closet and realizing you don’t have anything to wear to an important event, like a wedding, but don’t have the budget to buy something new. So they innovated, and created an entirely NEW way to shop by allowing women to rent designer clothing, online, for a</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">fraction</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">of what it actually costs. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the rental, or sharing economy is booming – companies like WeWork, REI, and Zipcar make it possible for us to experience something, without the cost of ownership. But to put this in perspective, nothing like this existed at the time. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenny shares how she and her co founder got Rent the Runway up and running – and how they grew the business to where it is today. You’ll</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">also</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">hear Jenny’s philosophy on how she approaches hiring talent at JetBlack, a personal shopping service she co founded after leaving Rent the Runway, which is not only critical when you’re starting a business, but also when scaling it. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interviewer for this episode is Scott Harris, a coach, mentor and a speaker at many of Tony’s events, including his business event, Business Mastery. </span></p>]]></description>

He has trained and competed at the highest levels of elite swimming, has broken world records, and forged a lifelong career unrivaled by any other. Even after he announced his retirement in 2012, he made a valiant comeback in 2016 at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, where he won five</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">gold medals to bring him up to a remarkable 23 first-place finishes.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today on the The Tony Robbins Podcast, you are about to hear from this legendary athlete, as he and Tony have a one-on-one interview at Tony’s private home, as part of a small event held for his Platinum Partners. You’ll hear Michael Phelps, who shares with the groups how he came to dominate the sport of swimming –</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">and</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">the setbacks he faced along the way.

These are just a few words that have been used to describe Orangetheory – the fitness studio known for its science-backed, technology-tracked, coach-inspired workouts. The franchise has taken the world by storm – in just eight years, it has amassed a million members, expanded to over 1,100 locations around the world, and has crossed a threshold that very few businesses manage to reach: exceeding $1 billion in revenue in a single year.

At this panel, Tony spoke with Ellen Latham, the creator and co-founder of Orangetheory Fitness. You’ll also hear a bit from Danny Meyer, founder of Union Square Hospitality Group and creator of Shake Shack, as he participates in the panel, and even asks Ellen a question toward the end.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you'll soon find out, Ellen’s energy is boundless, and certainly infectious. And it was this very energy, in combination with her creativity, determination and pure grit, that got her through the most difficult time of her life – a time when she was laid off her job, out of work and a single mother to her 9-year old son.

For many of us, it’s fear. Fear of failure, fear of the unknowns. We become our own worst enemy, doubting ourselves into paralysis.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But imagine what your life could look like, if you were able to find a reason that was so much bigger than yourself to propel you forward. I’m not talking about money or material objects, I’m talking about a greater purpose and a resounding and unflagging faith that for you, there is no other option that to give it everything you have.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast, you will hear a very special conversation between Tony and Eagles Quarterback, Nick Foles.

But what you’ll see is that even in spite of his incredible accomplishments, Nick’s sense of past failures and mistakes is never too far from his mind.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick reveals his constant battles with self-doubt and a fear of failure. In fact, it was this fear that almost kept him out of the NFL entirely. But through his faith and his family, Nick found a greater sense of purpose and strength that have helped him move forward. And he’s even adopted an entirely new perspective when it comes to fear.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s a firm believer that if he hadn’t experienced failure and pain in his past, he wouldn’t be where he is today. And along his journey, he’s seen how immensely important it is to be open, honest and transparent about your weaknesses. Because by acknowledging and even embracing your deepest fears, you actually free yourself, and can then grow into the person you were meant to be.</span></p> <p><br /></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police shootings. Border protests. White nationalist rallies. There’s no denying that we live in a time of racial divide that only seems to be growing. And while it’s easy to direct our focus to these great chasms that separate us, this is actually when it becomes even more imperative to start focusing on what unites us.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast, Tony is sitting down with Pastor Miles McPherson of the Rock Church in San Diego, who leads tens of thousands of diverse individuals in sermon every month. He’s also a former NFL football player, motivational speaker, and he has recently authored</span> <a href= "http://milesmcpherson.com/thethirdoption/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The Third Option: Hope for a Racially Divided Nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pastor Miles brings a refreshingly different perspective to the discussion around race and race relations, asking the tough questions about how we ended up in this state of tension and turmoil, and what we can do on a psychological and practical level, so that we can initiate real change.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where does racism come from? Are we all biased in some capacity? How do we expose racial divides, and most importantly, how do we move beyond them? These are just some of the questions that Tony and Pastor Miles have a tough, honest conversation about so that we can all find a way to be part of the solution.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police shootings. Border protests. White nationalist rallies. There’s no denying that we live in a time of racial divide that only seems to be growing. And while it’s easy to direct our focus to these great chasms that separate us, this is actually when it becomes even more imperative to start focusing on what unites us.</p> <p>In this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast, Tony is sitting down with Pastor Miles McPherson of the Rock Church in San Diego, who leads tens of thousands of diverse individuals in sermon every month. He’s also a former NFL football player, motivational speaker, and he has recently authored <a href= "http://milesmcpherson.com/thethirdoption/">The Third Option: Hope for a Racially Divided Nation</a>. Pastor Miles brings a refreshingly different perspective to the discussion around race and race relations, asking the tough questions about how we ended up in this state of tension and turmoil, and what we can do on a psychological and practical level, so that we can initiate real change.</p> <p>Where does racism come from? Are we all biased in some capacity? How do we expose racial divides, and most importantly, how do we move beyond them? These are just some of the questions that Tony and Pastor Miles have a tough, honest conversation about so that we can all find a way to be part of the solution.

Perhaps you believed you would have achieved a number of goals by a certain time. Or maybe you expected that you’d be married by a certain age. Or that your relationship would last a lifetime. While it’s admirable to set goals, and aspire to find love and connection, it’s also dangerous to tie our happiness to our expectations.

Dano has been with his partner for decades. They’ve built a family and a life together, but they are finding themselves at a crossroad. He’s deeply in love, and struggling to let go, blaming himself for the relationship’s trajectory.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony works with Dano to take a new perspective on his relationship, and to learn how to trade his expectations for appreciation.

			<title>The #1 decision you will ever make | Create a life shaped by decisions you control, not conditions that you can’t</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re looking through the lens of depression, how do you see the world? How do you react to those around you? And how do you handle obstacles that come your way?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about when you’re in a state of peace? How do you act? How do you react? Do you sweat the small stuff, or do you just shake it off? Does adversity rattle you, or are you able to approach challenges with confidence and ease?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact is that you will have a very different experience in life when you are in a peaceful state, rather than a state of suffering. Your thoughts, actions and reactions - these stem directly from where you find yourself mentally and emotionally. This is why Tony says that the most important decision you will ever make is to live in a beautiful state - even when life doesn’t go your way.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because ultimately, our lives aren’t shaped by our conditions. Our lives are shaped by our decisions. And you must decide where to direct your focus. An undirected mind operates naturally in survival mode, constantly identifying and magnifying potential threats to our well-being. But the result? A life filled with stress and anxiety.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast, you’ll learn how most people make unconscious decisions, based on habit and conditioning. You’ll see how most people believe that suffering is an inevitable part of life. Frustration, stress, sadness, loneliness - yes, these are emotions we may all encounter - but Tony shows us that we all have the power to step out of these suffering states, and cultivate a life of love, joy, gratitude, playfulness, growth and appreciation. Because life is too short to be mired in suffering. Make the decision to master your mind. Choose a beautiful state, and start living the life you were meant to.</span></p> <p><br /> <br /></p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you’re looking through the lens of depression, how do you see the world? How do you react to those around you? And how do you handle obstacles that come your way?</p> <p>What about when you’re in a state of peace? How do you act? How do you react? Do you sweat the small stuff, or do you just shake it off? Does adversity rattle you, or are you able to approach challenges with confidence and ease?</p> <p>The fact is that you will have a very different experience in life when you are in a peaceful state, rather than a state of suffering. Your thoughts, actions and reactions - these stem directly from where you find yourself mentally and emotionally. This is why Tony says that the most important decision you will ever make is to live in a beautiful state - even when life doesn’t go your way.</p> <p>Because ultimately, our lives aren’t shaped by our conditions. Our lives are shaped by our decisions. And you must decide where to direct your focus. An undirected mind operates naturally in survival mode, constantly identifying and magnifying potential threats to our well-being. But the result? A life filled with stress and anxiety.</p> <p>In this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast, you’ll learn how most people make unconscious decisions, based on habit and conditioning.

That’s just the nature of the beast.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the stressful thoughts – the worries that we conjure in our minds about the</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">unknown</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">– these are not only impacting your emotional state, they’re hindering your path forward. And it’s up to you to make the decision to take back control of your thoughts, adopt a stronger, more focused mindset, and step into the role you were meant for.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode of the Real Breakthrough Series, we’re taking you back to Business Mastery, where Tony is working with business owners who have given into their negative beliefs, allowing these thoughts to hinder their path to growth.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony helps them understand that the challenge they must overcome is their own psychology. He shows them that these thoughts are ultimately just machinations of their greatest fears – and that they only have power if you believe them. But - if you are ready to step out of these limiting beliefs, then you must adopt the steadfast mindset and unshakeable state of a true leader. So that any negative thought that arises is immediately dismissed. And any challenge that comes your way is seen as an opportunity to grow.</span></p> <p><br /></p>]]></description>

And who did you feel you had to be for that person?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Answering this question will not only help you understand how your identity was shaped, you will start to see just why you do the things you do. You will learn why you are the way you are now. The patterns that you fall into and the standards that you hold for yourself will all start to make sense.

Because every single one of us has developed a model of the world based on the source of love we craved most growing up. This is the what influences the way we think and the way we act. This is what impacts the way we filter information. And this is what forms the entire way in which we experience the world.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony shows us that we all create certain rule structures to support our needs. And he shows us that by uncovering our top two needs, we can begin to gain more perspective on our lives.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all encounter challenges in our relationships, some more serious than others, but it’s how we handle them that ultimately matters.For many of us, when we feel pain, we tend to blame our partners. We criticize, close up. We avoid them, ignore them. All to play a game of who’s wrong and who’s right. But when you truly love someone - it doesn’t matter who’s wrong or who’s right. In fact, blame only takes our power away, and excuses only cause us to continue hurting each other.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back to the Tony Robbins Podcast. On today’s episode of the Real Breakthrough Series, we’re taking you back to Date With Destiny where Tony is working with Teresa and John, a couple fighting their way out of a painful past and trying to figure out a path towards a healthier, happier future.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Teresa and John have made substantial progress since dealing with infidelity, they still struggle when it comes to constructive communication. They slip back into old ways, making excuses for their behavior and shirking responsibility for their actions. But it’s clear they are still deeply in love, and are committed to finding a better way.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony helps them see that if you’re having problems in your relationship, and feeling pain, it’s because you’re focused on yourself, not your partner. He helps them see that you can’t continue to focus on what you’re not getting, and what your partner’s not giving you. Because if you want to build an extraordinary relationship, you need to tear up the rules and start holding yourself 100% accountable for your experience.</span></p> <p><br /> <br /></p>]]></description>

And in this episode, we’re taking you to Business Mastery, where you’ll hear Tony speak with Darcy: a woman who is struggling to find her niche, even despite an impressive resume of clients.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darcy runs a successful production company that works with some of the biggest companies around the world. But up to this point, Darcy has relied on word-of-mouth to propel her business’s growth.

And learn exactly how you can start to find your unique niche, and start building the brand that will take your company to the next level.

Why do we continue to let the most painful experiences in our lives not only influence, but control our future?

But as horrific as these experiences were, you may continue to hold on to them, fervently at times. Because letting go can be terrifying.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But holding on has profound consequences of its own. We continue to give the pain power. We keep cords of energy tied to the people that hurt us.

And for years, decades even, she allowed that pain to dictate her life. She lived in a story of hurt, and she suffered massively because of it. But by working with Tony, she was able to step outside of that pain and gain a new level of understanding and perspective.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast we’re continuing our Business Mastery Panelist series with an exclusive interview between Tony and Iqram Magdon-Ismail, the co-founder of the digital payment platform, Venmo.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you’re not familiar with Venmo, the premise is simple: you connect the app to your checking account and you can send and receive payments to anyone with just a tap and a swipe of your smartphone. It’s the ideal solution for splitting bills and paying your friends back - especially for anyone who doesn’t like carrying around cash. Venmo makes exchanging money incredibly simple, and it takes the awkwardness out of asking someone to pay you back. Paying for everything from cab rides to dinners to rent and utilities is streamlined.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venmo was acquired by Braintree in 2012 for $26.2 million, which in turn sold to PayPal for $800 million. And now, Venmo processes more than $6.8 billion in payments per quarter.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet as ubiquitous as Venmo is today, it wasn’t an easy path to success. Iqram and his co-founder Andrew Kortina endured countless obstacles in their early years, struggling to raise capital and almost closing their doors at one point.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, Tony talks to Iqram about the evolution of Venmo, from idea to fruition to acquisition, and how they were able to persevere through the darkest periods. They discuss the importance of learning to embrace criticism, creating your company’s story, and using the no’s to refine your approach to find that pivotal yes.</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re familiar with Tony’s renowned business seminar - Business Mastery, then you know it’s nothing like your average business growth conference. Business Mastery is 5-day immersive seminar where you go to build a platform for explosive growth. Tony takes you on a deep dive into the business growth strategies, systems and resources that you need to take your business to the next level. You learn the innovative strategies that industry leaders like Apple, Zappos and Facebook have used to build massive success. You address the critical factors impacting your own business and learn how you can refocus and realign with a winning business strategy and psychology to compete and innovate in any economy. Because when it comes to business, it shouldn’t be about surviving, it should be about thriving – having absolute mastery, ownership of purpose, and fulfillment like no other.</p> <p>In this episodes, we’re taking you to a special segment within Business Mastery, where Tony holds a panel discussion with leaders behind today’s fastest growing companies. And this time, you’re going to hear from Jonas Kjellberg: serial entrepreneur, author, investor and most notably – the co-creator of Skype.</p> <p>Jonas is the ultimate game changer. He’s driven by a deep-seeded passion to shake up the status quo. While others may focus on changing one variable at a time, Jonas has his sights set on changing as many variables as possible. This mindset has led him to take a number of risks and make a lot of big bets – some of which failed spectacularly, and some of which became massive successes like Skype.</p> <p>Tony and Jonas talk about the evolution of Skype, and how it became one of the internet’s most revolutionary businesses, disrupting the telecommunications sector in a way no one saw coming. Jonas reveals what he has learned from his past failures, and the key lessons he’s taken with him when it comes to eliminating costs, customer acquisition, why every company should be ready to embrace change and pivot on a dime.</p>]]></description>

Seeing the shift in the market towards e-commerce, Grant moved to Victoria’s Secret where she focused on merchandising and strategy for VS's digital arm. Once Grant realized she wanted to create her own brand, she spent a number of years at a thriving startup, Thrillist Media Group, overseeing their commerce division.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do the greatest leaders of all time have in common? You may think it comes down to a certain sense of charisma or some inhuman level of talent - because that’s what we’ve all been conditioned to think defines a leader. But</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">superstars</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">aren’t the same thing as</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">super leaders</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, the greatest leaders often fly under the radar and are actually easy to miss.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast, you’ll be hearing from renowned leadership expert and bestselling author,</span> <a href= "http://bysamwalker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Walker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former reporter, sports columnist and sports editor, Sam founded</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The Wall Street Journal’s</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">prizewinning daily sports coverage. And most recently, helped launch the</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Journal’s</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">leadership column.

The San Francisco-based company expanded its coverage to 95% of the United States.

Does the very thought of answering those questions make you uncomfortable?</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast, our host, Ana Yoerg, is sitting down with renowned sexologist, Jaiya, and her partner, Ian.</span> <a href= "http://missjaiya.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Jaiya</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">is the author of Red Hot Touch and Founder of New World Sex Education - a company dedicated to using education to help men and women get the sex lives they’ve always wanted.

Because it’s not just about being able to communicate what you need, it’s about speaking the same language as your partner, and learning how to honor and fulfill their needs.
