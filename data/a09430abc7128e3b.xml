<p>It has been a very tough decade for the sociology job market, and faculty jobs are getting tougher to land.  At the same time, doctoral students often feel discouraged from pursuing a career outside of the academy.  One viable response may be to reconsider old attitudes about a career in applied sociology.  In this episode, we discuss the applied field with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karenreneealbright/">Karen Albright</a>, former President of the <a href="https://www.aacsnet.net/">Associate for Applied and Clinical Sociology</a> and former Chair of the <a href="https://www.asanet.org/asa-communities/sections/sociological-practice-and-public-sociology">ASA&#8217;s Section on Sociological Practice and Public Sociology</a>.</p>

Stephanie Medley-Rath is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the Indiana University Kokomo, and is incoming Chair of the ASA's Section of Teaching and Learning in Sociology.



Derek Silva is an Assistant Professor of Criminology at King's University College.  He has a forthcoming article in Teaching Sociology on the use of podcasts in pedagogy, and hosts the podcast What's That Noise?

Laura Garbes is a doctoral student at Brown University.  She studies the racialization of voice in public radio.  Laura recently posted  “When the “Blank Slate” Is a White One: White Institutional Isomorphism in the Birth of National Public Radio” to SocArXiv.  



Victor Ray is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Iowa.  Victor recently published “A Theory of Racialized Organizations” in the American Journal of Sociology.

We discuss whether working class students are served well by a higher ed curriculum that eschews vocational training.



Recently, Albert Fu (Kutztown) pushed back on those who oppose fielding curricula with vocational focuses.



The anti-job view is elitist. I'm a second-gen immigrant, that teaches a lot of first gen college students. I went to college to open up career opportunities, as do my students.— Albert S. Fu (@Professor_Fu) January 27, 2020 



I teach at a school that serves working class students, and this view struck a chord with me.  I assembled a panel of faculty teaching at colleges who teach at colleges that serve the working class to discuss the role of vocational training in higher ed.



Albert Fu is an Associate Professor of Sociology at Kutztown University.   



Michelle Corbin is an Associate Professor of Sociology at Worcester State University.



Colby King is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of South Carolina, Upstate.

Alex Kentikelenis is Assistant Professor of Sociology at Bucconi.  He has a long and impressive list of publications on international organization and political economy.   Most recently, " “The Making of Neoliberal Globalization: Norm Substitution and the Politics of Clandestine Institutional Change" in the American Journal of Sociology.



Gabor Scheiring is a Postdoc at Bucconi.  He is a Hungarian economist and politician.  In addition to his impressive publication record, he is also a former member of the Hungarian Parliament.

<p>Today, we sit down with <a href="https://socy.umd.edu/facultyprofile/cohen/philip-n">Philip Cohen</a> (<a href="https://socy.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>) to discuss the American Sociological Association's opposition to a Trump Administration proposal to mandate the immediate public release of federally-funded research.</p>



<h3>Background</h3>



<p>The Trump Administration recently proposed a regulation that would require that <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/12/19/21029902/open-access-trump">publicly-funded research be distributed openly upon publication</a>.  This policy drew immediate opposition from the publishing industry, who makes money by selling licenses to view this research within the first 12 months of publication.  </p>



<p>The American Sociological Association <a href="https://www.aera.net/Portals/38/docs/Gov_Relations/Science%20Orgs%20Opposing%20Proposed%20Embargo%20Change%20121819.pdf">co-signed a public letter opposing the regulation</a>, arguing: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The current 12-month embargo period provides science and engineering society publishers the  financial stability that enables us to support peer review that ensures the quality and integrity of the research enterprise. Further, it enables us to drive advancement in our respective scientific fields through our meetings, programs and outreach... </p><p>...To take action to shorten the 12-month embargo would undermine cooperative efforts to address these bigger, higher priorities, and risks the continued international leadership for the U.S. scientific enterprise. </p></blockquote>



<p>Some sociologists, including members of the ASA Publications Committee.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm a member of the Publications Committee, and no one asked me, obviously.

Today, we sit down with Philip Cohen (University of Maryland) to discuss the American Sociological Association's opposition to a Trump Administration proposal to mandate the immediate public release of federally-funded research.



Background



The Trump Administration recently proposed a regulation that would require that publicly-funded research be distributed openly upon publication.  This policy drew immediate opposition from the publishing industry, who makes money by selling licenses to view this research within the first 12 months of publication.  



The American Sociological Association co-signed a public letter opposing the regulation, arguing: 



The current 12-month embargo period provides science and engineering society publishers the  financial stability that enables us to support peer review that ensures the quality and integrity of the research enterprise. Further, it enables us to drive advancement in our respective scientific fields through our meetings, programs and outreach... ...To take action to shorten the 12-month embargo would undermine cooperative efforts to address these bigger, higher priorities, and risks the continued international leadership for the U.S. scientific enterprise. 



Some sociologists, including members of the ASA Publications Committee.



I'm a member of the Publications Committee, and no one asked me, obviously. Because rushing out a statement on a hypothetical new policy is too important to the scientific enterprise to allow for deliberation by the actual elected membership. You know, sociologists.— Philip N Cohen (@familyunequal) December 19, 2019

<p>We discuss a recent paper from Samuel Jellison and colleagues in <em>BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine, </em>"Evaluation of Spin in Abstracts of Papers in Psychiatry and Psychology Journals", which found that published research in their field routinely use rhetorical tactics to magnify the purported strengths and impact of one's findings.  We discuss whether the practice is common in sociology, and whether it is a problem. </p>

<p>This week, <em>The Annex</em> discusses a cleavage in German sociology that resulted in the formation of the <a href="https://akademie-soziologie.de/">Academy of Sociology</a>, an organization that splintered from the <a href="https://soziologie.de/aktuell">German Sociological Association</a> in a spat that involved questions of scientific rigor in sociology.  Here's the back story:</p>



<h3>Background</h3>



<p>This summer, <a href="https://www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~pnc/">Philip Cohen</a> from the <a href="https://socy.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a> tweeted:</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To be a social science discipline sociology needs to adopt standards for transparency and reproducibility. All science is moving this way.

<p>This struck me as a tremendously interesting topic.  It also turned out to be painfully difficult to find discussants.

In her own work, Professor Firat uses brain scans to understand more emotional or visceral dimensions of social class, race, ethnicity, group cohesion, loneliness, agency, and other major concepts of interest to sociologists.  She discusses ideas about the role of emotion in social and moral life, and other ways that the human brain's workings influence how society operates.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of The Annex Sociology Podcast, the group discusses family estrangement. They get into the specificities of gender differences and degrees of estrangement. Kristina challenges the idea of parenting perceptions versus children’s parenting perceptions. Gabriel discusses that in American culture in which individualism is achieved, that may be a factor to family estrangement. Kristina and Gabriel get to the bottom of families unifying in ritualistic ways to ostracize certain family members. Leslie questions if family estrangement is a form of deviance. Joe leaves off the podcast questioning the aftermath of family estrangement and how resilience is exercised.</p>

So I realize this may sound silly and I’m sorry in advance if it does, I promise I’m not snooty or holier than thou in my day to day life. It’s just that I’ve always wanted to host a “sophisticated” party with great wine and food and decent conversation. I’m not opposed to bar nights and keg parties, it’s just that I wanted to do something different on this particular night (last Saturday).
I had literally been planning this party for over a month, I ordered special cheeses directly from Europe, I sent out “taste questionnaires” to all my guests to best accommodate their wine and food preferences. I cleaned for days, I even replaced our ratty old couch with a new sectional from Crate and Barrel and matched some really cool thrift store hauls to make it sort of “warehouse chic.” I hand made all the invitations and event matched the stamps to better fit the motif of the design.
Saturday night came around and everyone was having a great time, people were dressed to the nines and I was on cloud nine with what a great time everyone was having. We had intelligent and polite conversation and everyone was getting along great. I had at max 20 total guests (some left early and some arrived late).
After maybe 2 hours I noticed my husband was not present, no big deal I thought since he said he’d wanted to smoke some good cigars so I figured that’s where he was. Maybe 10 minutes later I hear him and his best friend bust through the front door saying really loud “Now we got a party folks!!!” as he and his friends were carrying huge boxes of Budweiser.
Well slowly but surely my sophisticated wine party turned into a beer bust, the guys took their ties and coats off, the girls got more loose and after an hour of beer drinking my new couches were pushed to the wall and everyone was dancing and grinding and my nice calm background music was changed to hip hop.
I basically went in my room and cried. I didn’t tell anyone so no one checked on me, not my friends, not my husband, no one. They were all having “too good” of a time. To make it worse, the next day nearly everyone sent me texts or emails saying what a great time they had and they didn’t expect to “party until 3am.” So not only did it not go my way, no even appreciates “my part” of the party.
I’m crushed. By my husband mostly since he knew how important this was to me, but also by my friends who so quickly went along with my husband and didn’t even seem to miss me at the party.

A tweet by Yale sociologist Nicholas Christakis, who argues that it takes a 60 hour work week to succeed in sociology. It drew criticism and evoked a discussion about work-life balance in sociology:

I tell my graduate students and post-docs that if they’re working 60 hours per week, they’re working less than the full professors, and less than their peers. https://t.co/mapWtvmBWp
— Nicholas A. Christakis (@NAChristakis) February 4, 2018



Photo Credit. Human Hay Racks. It is nothing unusual in Albania to see women carrying such burdens as these. The men consider it undignified to do such manual labor, spending most of their time in the army, or in carrying out family feuds. The severe life of the women is shown in premature old age.
