					<description><![CDATA[<p>The end of the month will be full of Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales on a wide variety of product categories. Kristin McGrath, shopping editor at RetailMeNot, said that the November sales events are “one of the best times all year” to buy apparel, toys, makeup, tech and home goods. McGrath advised that shoppers don’t need to wait until Black Friday itself to shop. Retailers may begin launching sales a few days before Thanksgiving, or even earlier in the month, so shoppers should begin to check for early deals online and plan to start shopping early.</p>
