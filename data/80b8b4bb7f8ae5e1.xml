      <title>'And There Was Light' traces Abraham Lincoln's views on slavery and religion</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ Abraham Lincoln made history in 1863 when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, effectively freeing enslaved people across the U.S. But he expected it to cost him reelection.

Meacham tells NPR's Steve Inskeep that Lincoln's views on God and morality can teach us a thing or two in today's political climate. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In this episode, we hear two interviews with author Namwali Serpell. Her two novels look at some variation on what it means to be part of a mixed-race family.

Then, Serpell and NPR's Juana Summers discuss her second novel <em>The Furrows</em>, which looks at grief  – and how it doesn't necessarily get easier with time. ]]></description>

The two authors discuss in an interview with Karen Grigsby Bates the importance of being proactive in racial justice. ]]></description>

      <title>Chinese American culture, murder mystery, and Dostoyevsky in 'The Family Chao'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Patriarch Leo Chao is murdered at his restaurant at the beginning of Lan Samantha Chang's new novel <em>The Family Chao</em>. Eventually family secrets and bitterness reveal themselves — much like a Dostoyevsky novel, from whom Chao took a lot of inspiration. But NPR's Scott Simon points out that even though this novel is about a murder, it's quite funny. Chang told Simon that she just enjoyed writing it so much that humor became a natural part of it. This is an encore episode from February 2022. ]]></description>

      <title>Devon Price on self-acceptance and expression for people with autism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For people with autism, navigating a neurotypical world can be exhausting. Many deploy strategies to fit in with others, a tactic often referred to as <em>masking. </em>Social psychologist Devon Price spoke to Eric Garcia, author of <em>Unmasking Autism</em>, on <em>Life Kit</em> about the freedom that comes from unmasking. Price says neurodivergent people can find greater self-acceptance by getting in touch with the person they were before they started trying to fit in. Price and Garcia, who both have autism, talk about how unmasking means progress for disability justice. This is an encore episode from May 2022. ]]></description>

      <title>Werner Herzog's 'The Twilight World' is inspired by a WWII Japanese holdout officer </title>

When the Japanese army evacuated, Onoda stayed and fought for 29 more years, living in the jungle and resisting all attempts to convince him the war was over. Renowned filmmaker Werner Herzog tells a fictionalized account of this story in his first novel, <em>The Twilight World. </em>In an interview on All Things Considered, Herzog told Ari Shapiro that he's always been a writer and that this book is finally putting into words a story he had in him for two decades. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Beach resorts are a favorite when it comes to travel destinations. But behind the infinity pools and the all-inclusive deals, these massive resorts are taking a toll on the environment and on local communities, says Sarah Stodola, author of <em>The Last Resort</em>. On one hand, they've proven to raise the standard of living for local communities, help create jobs and grow the economy. On the other hand, these communities have lost big parts of their culture and autonomy, and the impact they have on the environment is hard to miss. What is the tipping point in the growth and development of a place?  ]]></description>

      <title>Hanya Yanagihara grapples with pandemics in 'To Paradise'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Author of the wildly popular and, at times, controversial <em>A Little Life</em>, Hanya Yanagihara, is out with a new novel. <em>To Paradise</em> is an epic – in three parts – sprawling over 700 pages and 200 years about a make-believe New York City. Yanagihara was mostly through writing her story, which features pandemics prominently, when COVID-19 first hit in early 2020. But Yanagihara told NPR's Scott Simon that she was able to keep her story and her fears about the pandemic in reality separate.]]></description>

      <title>Finding simplicity and radical acceptance through animal sexuality </title>
      <description><![CDATA[A non-fiction science book about animal sexuality could read like a dry textbook, but Eliot Schrefer wanted his book to be accessible. <em>Queer Ducks</em> uses interviews with scientists, illustrations, and stories to help teenagers learn more about sexuality in the animal kingdom. In an interview with Sacha Pfeiffer, Schrefer said he didn't want his book to argue for human behavior based on that of animals, but rather to make the point that humans are not alone in their LGBTQ identities. And, according to Schrefer, there is a lot of simplicity and radical acceptance to be found in nature.  ]]></description>

Although many people argue against commemorating the holiday with barbecues and other celebrations, Taylor spoke to Here and Now's Scott Tong about the juxtaposition of sorrow and sadness and how Black Americans have always had to make space for both.  ]]></description>

      <title>Two books on fatherhood to help celebrate Sunday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Father's Day is this Sunday, giving us a good opportunity to reflect not only the art of fatherhood but also on the struggles that come after dads leave us. First, Helen McDonald talks to Robin Young on Here and Now about grieving her father's death by training a hawk – and finding her path again after grief. Then, Keggie Carew discusses her memoir <em>Dadland</em>, which talks about her relationship with her father, his fascinating stories from his time as a spy, and his struggle with dementia. In a way, these two nostalgic interviews are an invitation to give fathers their due, especially when they're still around.  ]]></description>

Then, Keggie Carew discusses her memoir <em>Dadland</em>, which talks about her relationship with her father, his fascinating stories from his time as a spy, and his struggle with dementia. In a way, these two nostalgic interviews are an invitation to give fathers their due, especially when they're still around.  ]]></itunes:summary>

      <title>A reflection on ambition and success in 'Tracy Flick Can't Win'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[You've probably seen it: Reese Witherspoon playing ambitious, throat-cutting Tracy Flick in the 1999 movie Election. It's the film adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of the same name. Now, Perrotta has written a sequel called <em>Tracy Flick Can't Win</em>. In it, we meet Tracy Flick in middle age and just a tad bit away from accomplishing her high school dreams of becoming president of the United States. In an interview with All Things Considered, Perrotta told Sascha Pfiffer that he wanted to revisit this character's story to reflect on ambition, success, and the softening that happens in middle age.  ]]></description>

      <title>In Keri Blakinger's memoir, the path from high-achieving teenager to prison to writer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Keri Blakinger says there are no rules behind bars. In 2010, she was arrested on a drug charge and spent two years in prison. And although that statement might sound counterintuitive, Blakinger says that inside the prison, no one is watching when it matters. In her memoir <em>Corrections in Ink</em>, she writes about her path from high-achieving teenager to incarcerated woman to reporter and writer. In an interview with Ailsa Chang on All Things Considered, she says reporting on the prison system has been meaningful because she gets to amplify the stories of those who are just where she used to be. ]]></description>

First, Simu Liu, Marvel's first Asian superhero, discusses his memoir <em>We Were Dreamers</em>, where he talks about his complicated relationship with his parents and what he calls his "immigrant superhero origin story."

      <title>Dan Chaon imagines a dystopian, dark future for America in 'Sleepwalk'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Author Dan Chaon wanted to find a way to write about current times – instability, fear, political division – by creating an alternate version of America. Set in the future, his new book <em>Sleepwalk </em>is a dark and shadowy dystopia "one more pandemic away." Through the story, however, his eccentric main character discovers a longing for kingship and connection that was partly inspired by Chaon's experience as an adoptee meeting his biological father. In an interview on Weekend Edition Saturday, Chaon told Scott Simon that novels are like black holes: Everything you see in the world gets sucked into it. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The last couple of years have been tough for everyone, and dealing with the plethora of emotions they have brought on can be complicated for many adults. In their new book, <em>Big Feelings: How to Be Okay When Things Are Not Okay</em>, Liz Fosslien and Mollie West Duffy explore seven emotions that they found particularly difficult to overcome: uncertainty, comparison, anger, burnout, perfectionism, despair, and regret. In an interview with Juana Summers on It's Been a Minute, the authors talk about how they don't intend the book to be self-help, but rather an invitation for people to learn how to give themselves some grace. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Trauma isn't finite. It doesn't happen only to one person – and its effects on people and communities don't always end. Today, two books that explore the different sides of generational trauma: First, Anjali Enjeti talks about <em>The Parted Earth</em>, a novel that traces the impact of India's partition across several generations and explores how understanding our families' pasts can help us understand ourselves. Then, Naheed Phiroze Patel discusses her novel <em>Mirror Made of Rain</em>, a personal, empathetic view on mothers who society has deemed 'failures.'  ]]></description>

      <title>Grady Hendrix reimagines the horror movie sequel in 'Final Girl Support Group'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Grady Hendrix loves horror movies, especially those old 80s slashers. And his new book is a tribute to that "final girl" at the end of so many of them: The one who doesn't necessarily survive by being smarter or stronger, but simply makes it to the end alive by not giving up. NPR's Audie Cornish interviewed him about his novel <em>Final Girl Support Group</em>, which is about exactly what it sounds like, a support group for women who survived psycho murderers — except it seems like someone's starting to hunt them down –  again. As Hendrix says, what's the scariest thing for a "Final Girl?" A sequel. ]]></description>

      <title>The illusion and power of money in Hernan Diaz's 'Trust'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Money is all things... or it can become all things, says Hernan Diaz, author of <em>Trust</em>. In his new book, readers are presented with narratives on wealth, reality, and a woman set on separating fact from fiction. In an interview on Weekend Edition Saturday, Diaz told Scott Simon that he thought a lot about money in the writing of this book, particularly about its power to warp and test reality. And although he wanted this story to be about money and class, he also wrote a book that gives women agency in narratives they've often been erased from.  ]]></description>

For one, the landmark case that legalized most abortions for women did not in fact end with an abortion. The baby, often referred to as Baby Roe, is Shelly Lynn Thornton, now a grown woman whose story is at the center of Joshua Prager's book The Family Roe.

Then, an interview from our archives: a 1989 chat with Amy Tan on All Things Considered about her novel <em>The Joy Luck Club</em>, the story of four Chinese American families living in San Francisco inspired by Tan's experience as a child of immigrants. ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Dolen Perkins-Valdez's historical novel fictionalizes involuntary sterilizations</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Dolen Perkins-Valdez says she's attracted to what she calls "silences in the archives," or – holes in our recollection in history, particularly those in African American history. In her new historical novel <em>Take My Hand</em>, she tackles forced sterilizations inspired by the 1973 case of the Relf sisters. On Weekend Edition Sunday, Perkins-Valdez told Ayesha Roscoe about her decision to tell this story from a nurse's perspective, the double-edged sword of birth control for Black women, and her goals on writing from real life. ]]></description>

      <title>Devon Price on the freedom of "unmasking" for people with autism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For people with autism, simply existing in a neurotypical world can be exhausting. Many learn early on to employ certain strategies to fit in with others, a tactic often referred to as masking. Social psychologist Devon Price, author of <em>Unmasking Autism</em>, spoke to Eric Garcia on Life Kit about the freedom that comes from doing the opposite: unmasking. Price says neurodivergent people can find greater self-acceptance by getting in touch with the person they were before they started trying to fit in. Price and Garcia, who both have autism, talk about  how unmasking means progress for disability justice. ]]></description>

But noticing a drift between her religious practice and her interest in its traditional stories put her on a path to reclaim her faith on her own terms. The result is 'Let There Be Light,' a graphic novel that retells the Book of Genesis starring a woman as God.

These range from physical insults to threats of violence, and they're forcing women – especially younger ones – to censor themselves out of fear of physical or emotional retribution.

      <description><![CDATA[Janelle Monáe's Afrofuturistic pop album 'Dirty Computer' was nominated for a Grammy in 2019. Now, Monáe brings the sci-fi world into literature through her latest collection of short stories <em>The Memory Librarian</em>. In an interview with Ayesha Rascoe on Weekend Edition Sunday, Monáe spoke about the nightmare that sparked this idea and how it prompted her to reclaim her full identity as a Black, queer woman.

      <title>Mortality, politics, and the power of poetry in Colm Tóibín's 'Vinegar Hill' </title>
      <description><![CDATA[After more than a dozen novels and collections of short stories, Irish writer ColmTóibín recently published his first book of poetry. His new collection, <em>Vinegar Hill</em>, examines a wide range of subjects: from mortality, religion, and the current political climate, to the power of poetry in life's most important moments. To celebrate Poetry Month, Tóibín read some of his poems to Scott Simon on Weekend Edition Saturday, and said that he wanted to write without the usual adornments of poetry. In a way, he hopes the simplicity of his writing will have more expression and power. ]]></description>

Next, the author David Wallace-Wells talks to NPR's Rachel Martin about his book <em>The Uninhabitable Earth, </em>which is a lot more hopeful than the title might suggest.

      <title>Humor, horror and social commentary blend in Percival Everett's detective novel</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Percival Everett's page-turning new detective novel is at once gruesome and screamingly funny. A racial allegory rooted in southern history, the book features two big-city special detectives with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation who are sent to investigate a small town crime. The murders are hideous in detail, the language is rough, there are racial epithets of all kinds, and somehow the politically incendiary humor is real. Everett talks with NPR's Scott Simon about how — and why — he blended these styles. ]]></description>

Next, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jhumpa Lahiri's book <em>Whereabouts</em> is about a sense of place – even though we are never told where exactly the book takes place.

      <title>Viet Thanh Nguyen follows Pulitzer winning 'The Sympathizer' with 'The Committed'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Viet Thanh Nguyen's novel <em>The Committed</em> follows the same unnamed character we met in his Pulitzer-winning thriller, <em>The Sympathizer</em>. The character is now in Paris; having become disillusioned with the revolution he was a part of when we last saw him, he hasn't given up on the idea entirely. Nguyen told NPR's Scott Simon the book is also about colonization: He "wanted it to be set in a Paris that was not the tourist Paris or the romantic Paris. [It's] a novel about French ideas and French Revolution and French colonialism, but it's also a crime thriller set in these immigrant neighborhoods."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Journalist Frank Bruni had lots of professional success: he was a White House correspondent, food critic, and opinion columnist. But then in 2017 he suffered a rare type of stroke that left him unable to see correctly. His new memoir, <em>The Beauty of Dusk: On Vision Lost and Found</em>, focuses on many people who, like Bruni, have had challenges or setbacks in their lives that they have had to adjust to. Bruni told NPR's Ari Shapiro that asking people about their pain "ends up being rewarding and enriching for everybody involved."]]></description>

      <title>Solving systemic racism and buying sensible cardigans with comic Phoebe Robinson</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Comic Phoebe Robinson told NPR's Rachel Martin that she doesn't wake up every day thinking "time to dismantle systemic racism!" But since she has a platform, she might as well use it to bring about some positive change. She also told Martin that her dream life involves buying sensible cardigans, getting day drunk with Kathy Lee and Hoda, and a loving marriage with Robert DeNiro. Robinson's book <em>You Can't Touch My Hair: And Other Things I Still Have to Explain</em> goes into the racism she experiences and why she would like to date either Michael Fassbender or Michael B. Jordan (sorry Mr. DeNiro).]]></description>

First, an interview from 2014 with the late political scientist Karen Dawisha on how Putin and his cronies became so fabulously wealthy.

      <description><![CDATA[Author NoViolet Bulawayo's new novel <em>Glory</em> is quite openly based on Orwell's <em>Animal Farm</em> and the 2017 coup in Zimbabwe that ousted then president Robert Mugabe. Horses rule the country, dogs are the military, cows, goats, sheep, and pigs are the everyday people. The government that has been in control of the country Jidada for 40 years has fallen to rebellion. But, as these things go, it quickly turns sour. Bulawayo told NPR's Scott Simon that "it is simply an issue of the leadership kind of forgetting [...] why the people they – that fought to serve – made the sacrifice that they did."]]></description>

In it, he agrees with President Trump on many things: modern day culture wars and that the progressives are dividing the country. But Barr also gives his own version of the events of the Trump White House and disagrees with the former president about the "stolen election." Barr told NPR's Steve Inskeep "after the election, [Trump] didn't seem to listen to anybody except a group of sycophants who were telling him what he wanted to hear."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Our interviews today are both children's books and even though they are about wildly different topics, they both aim to make reading more accessible for kids. Nikole Hannah Jones, with the help of Renee Watson, has turned the <em>1619 Project</em> into a picture book called <em>Born On The Water</em>. They told NPR their goal was "to say to young people - to young Black Americans, you belong here." Next, Adam Rubin has written a collection of short stories that are all different but have the same title: <em>The Ice Cream Machine</em>. Rubin told NPR's Rachel Martin that there are so many ways to tell a story.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Author Tess Hadley's new novel opens with an affair, but that's not really what the book is about. <em>Free Love</em> is set in the 1960s just outside of London and it starts with a wealthy woman in her 40s, Phyllis, sharing a secret kiss with a much younger man who is not her husband (gasp). The kiss has unintended consequences and Phyllis has to figure out what she really wants out of life. Hadley told NPR's Elissa Nadworny that being part of the bourgeois is not something she's familiar with, but she loves to write about it because she doesn't think that world exists anymore.]]></description>

      <title>Putin's use of Nazi rhetoric is not new according to historian Timothy Snyder</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin has framed his recent invasion of Ukraine as a "de-nazification" of the country. This is not a new move by Putin. In fact, he used this same rhetoric to attack the Ukranian protesters during the 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Back in 2014 historian Timothy Snyder talked to NPR's Robert Siegel about fascism in Ukraine and the rise of Stalinism in Russia. He told Siegel that calling Ukranians Nazis is both a way to confuse the European Union - because they know Nazis were bad - and a way to garner pro-Russian sentiment.]]></description>

She told NPR's Leila Fadel the book is arguing for the humanity of Black people. The second interview is with Alfred Woodfox, who served 43 years in prison – most of those in solitary confinement — for a crime he says he didn't commit.

      <title>Writer Arthur Brooks says strivers can end up unhappier later in life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Social science writer Arthur Brooks has figured out how you, yes you, can be happy later in life. He details it all in his new book, <em>From Strength to Strength</em>, but the gist of it is...maybe relax a little. Brooks argues that for people who work too hard to have it all it can be very upsetting when that part of their life is over. The good news is you can start working on your future happiness now. Brooks told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly you have to do the work when you're younger: You can't "leave your happiness up to chance."]]></description>

She followed her book about The Great Migration, <em>The Warmth of Other Suns</em>, with another that looks at <em>why</em> it happened. <em>Caste</em> argues that caste and not racism is actually what Black people were fleeing when they left the Jim Crow South. Wilkerson told <em>Throughline</em>'s Ramtin Arablouei and Rund Abdelfatah that the term racism is rooted in hate but caste is about "power and how those other groups manage and navigate and seek to survive in a society that's created with this ranked hierarchy."]]></description>

      <title>Octavia Butler imagines a world without racism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[During Black History month, <em>Book of the Day</em> is bringing you some interviews from the archives, including this one with author Octavia Butler. Butler wrote many sci-fi classics, like the <em>Parable</em> series and <em>Kindred</em>, so she's accustomed to imagining different worlds. NPR's Scott Simon asked her back in 2001 to imagine a world without racism. Butler believed that in racism's place we would have to have absolute empathy. But she told Simon that this would most certainly present its own challenges – and we would probably just find something else to fight about.]]></description>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[During Black History month, <em>Book of the Day</em> is bringing you some interviews from the archives, including this one with author Octavia Butler. Butler wrote many sci-fi classics, like the <em>Parable</em> series and <em>Kindred</em>, so she's accustomed to imagining different worlds. NPR's Scott Simon asked her back in 2001 to imagine a world without racism. Butler believed that in racism's place we would have to have absolute empathy. But she told Simon that this would most certainly present its own challenges – and we would probably just find something else to fight about.]]></itunes:summary>

      <title>Alex Haley nearly lost it all writing 'Roots'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[To recognize Black History Month, <em>Book of the Day</em> is digging into the archives to bring you some important interviews. In 1977, author Alex Haley told NPR he didn't want to put the main character of <em>Roots</em>, Kunta Kinte, on a slave ship. To prepare for writing that portion of the novel, Haley flew to Africa and caught a voyage home on a cargo ship — sneaking down into the hold after dinner. In the mornings, he would write notes about what he thought Kunta's experience would have been like. He told NPR's Marty Griffen that the experience weighed him down so much it nearly cost him his life.]]></description>

      <title>'The Color Purple' is about the bonding of women</title>
      <description><![CDATA[As part of Black History Month, we are running interviews from our archives. <em>The Color Purple</em> is about the survival of Black women in a male-dominated world. Author Alice Walker said that she just wrote what happens in the real world. At its core, this is a story of women loving and helping other women. Walker told NPR's Faith Fancher that "one of the reasons I wanted to have strong, beautiful, wonderful women loving each other is because I think that people can deal with that. [...] I think that the people who are uptight and bigoted and afraid in their own lives will have difficulty."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[For the first full week of Black History Month, we dove into our archives to bring you some older interviews by Black authors. The first is an interview from 2009 with writer Toni Morrison about a collection she edited from authors facing censorship called <em>Burn This Book</em>. This conversation is especially relevant today with many important books under scrutiny – and being pulled from library shelves and school curriculums. Morrison, whose books have also been banned in some places as recently as this year, told NPR's Liane Hansen that in some countries censorship can be far more serious.]]></description>

Reflecting on her time as a prosecutor, Krell told Morning Edition's Rachel Martin that this is the case she's proud of: "This was a case that shifted the national narrative and certainly sent a message to survivors that this shouldn't be normalized, that their experiences matter."]]></description>

      <title>Country star Merle Haggard is larger than life in 'The Hag'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Author Marc Eliot has written a new biography of country music icon, Merle Haggard. <em>The Hag</em> details Haggard's quite extraordinary life; from breaking into a restaurant (that turned out to be open) and subsequent jail time to his many broken marriages and everything in between. Haggard turned his past failures into songs, writing and singing about his inner turmoil. Eliot told NPR's Steve Inskeep that he thinks the Hag deserves a little more respect: "I think if he were played on the same radio stations that, say, play Frank Sinatra ... he'd be just as accepted. I think he was that good."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Today marks one year since Joe Biden was sworn in as president. It's no secret that politics have become — well...<em>messy</em> in the U.S. — so we thought today would be a good opportunity to take a deep dive into democracy. How much staying power does it have, and why has it started to crumble in countries around the world? Author Anne Applebaum looks at how the world has changed over the past 20 years in her book, <em>Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure Of Authoritarianism</em>.

His mother and those of two of his contemporaries take center stage in Anna Malaika Tubbs' book, <em>The Three Mothers: How the Mothers of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and James Baldwin Shaped A Nation</em>. Tubbs told <em>1A</em>'s Jenn White that history is often told by and about men, but knowing these women's stories - "taking their lives from the margins and putting them in the center" - is just as important.

      <title>Alexi Pappas and Glennon Doyle want you to know it's ok to not be ok</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Both our interviews today deal with the pressures we put on ourselves. First, Olympic runner Alexi Pappas on her memoir, <em>Bravey</em>.

But, she told NPR's Ari Shapiro, she was still deeply sad. Next, an interview from early in the pandemic when women were disproportionately feeling the burden of our new reality. Glennon Doyle, author of <em>Untamed</em>, told former NPR host Lulu Garcia-Navarro that "every woman on earth needs to lower her expectations for herself."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Poet and author Kwame Alexander was feeling the weight of being Black in America last summer and didn't know how to make sense of his feelings.

It's three poems on three historic events: the murder of George Floyd, Colin Kaepernick's protests, and Barack Obama being elected president.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>All That She Carried</em> is the history of a single bag. Historian and author Tiya Miles used what few historical records she could find to tell the stories of three generations of Black women with ties to that sack dating back to 1850. Miles' journey started because of a simple message embroidered on the bag by one of its owners, Ruth Middleton. She told <em>Here & Now</em>'s Scott Tong that people have emotional reactions to seeing the sack, because it means the families survived to pass it down to future generations.]]></content:encoded>

      <title>'Chouette' is part owl part human baby. Fine. But how to raise her?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Claire Oshetsky's new novel <em>Chouette</em> is... pretty strange, but also kind of wonderful? Oshetsky says the story is a parable about motherhood, in which a woman gives birth to an owl baby. The mother finds this strange not because the baby is an owl, but because she only had intercourse with the owl parent in a dream, and that owl was a woman. Still with us? Good. Oshetsky talked with NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben about how her own daughter consulted on writing the book, and what she learned from raising an autistic child.]]></description>

First, a conversation with NPR's Scott Simon and Sir Andrew Motion on <em>The Folio Book of War Poetry</em>, edited by Motion.

First, astronaut Chris Hadfield talked with former NPR host Lulu Garcia-Navarro about his novel <em>The Apollo Murders</em>, which is set in the 70's around, you guessed it, the Apollo missions. It's got Soviet spies and secret space stations with machine guns mounted to the top. What more could a book need?

      <description><![CDATA[The National Rifle Association is being sued. The nonprofit at the heart of the gun lobby is accused of diverting money from its charitable mission. NPR investigative journalist Tim Mak has been following the paper trail, much of it tracing back to Wayne LaPierre, longtime leader of the NRA. NPR's Steve Inskeep talked with Mak about his new book, <em>Misfire</em>, detailing congressional investigations, and what the New York state attorney general has identified as tens of millions of dollars of corrupt spending on private jets and six figure suits. ]]></description>

      <title>'Beautiful Country' looks back on a young Chinese girl's undocumented childhood</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Living as an undocumented immigrant means living in the shadows, says Qian Julie Wang. Her memoir <em>Beautiful Country</em> tells the story of her family's life in New York after fleeing China in 1994. Her mother worked menial jobs in terrible conditions. Her father struggled with his status as a man in a country that equated being Asian with weakness. They couldn't even seek out regular medical care for fear of being deported. Wang joins NPR's Scott Simon in today's episode to talk about how those experiences shaped and shamed her, even as she became a Yale Law graduate and successful attorney. ]]></description>

When Kalki is born with blue skin and black blood, he is believed to be the reincarnation of Vishnu. But when he fails to heal a girl brought to him in distress, he questions his divinity, which means questioning everything. In today's episode, SJ Sindu talks to NPR's Scott Simon about how her novel <em>Blue Skinned Gods</em> was an attempt to better understand her own family's urge to believe. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[You're probably at least a little familiar with the WNBA, and even if you never actually seen <em>A League of Their Own</em>, everyone knows there's no crying in baseball. But did you know there was a whole professional women's football league in the 1960's? NPR's A Martinez spoke with Britni de la Cretaz about their book <em>Hail Mary: The Rise and Fall of the National Women's Football League</em>, which they co-authored with fellow sports writer Lyndsey D'Arcangelo. And, disappointingly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, de la Cretaz says it was homophobia and sexism that undermined the league's success. ]]></description>

      <title>Amitav Ghosh turned to legends to write a story large enough for climate change</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Trying to decrease your carbon footprint can be complicated. You use metal straws, recycle your paper, and bring your own grocery bags to the store, but everything you buy is part of a supply chain that's simply way out of your control. That lack of control is central to Amitav Ghosh's retelling of an ancient Bengali myth of a nature goddess setting calamity after calamity on a merchant who's only concerned with money. In today's interview, Ghosh tells NPR's Ari Shapiro that writing his 2019 novel <em>Gun Island</em> based on old legends allowed for a full response to the scope of climate change. ]]></description>

      <title>Grady Hendrix reimagines the horror movie sequel in 'Final Girl Support Group'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Grady Hendrix LOVES horror movies, especially those old 80's slashers. And his new book is a tribute to that "final girl" at the end of so many of them. The one who doesn't necessarily survive by being smarter or stronger, but simply makes it to the end alive by not giving up. NPR's Audie Cornish interviewed him about his novel <em>Final Girl Support Group</em>, which is about exactly what it sounds like, a support group for women who survived psycho murderers — except it seems like someone's starting to hunt them down... again. As Hendrix says, what's the scariest thing for a "Final Girl?" A sequel. ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Grady Hendrix LOVES horror movies, especially those old 80's slashers. And his new book is a tribute to that "final girl" at the end of so many of them. The one who doesn't necessarily survive by being smarter or stronger, but simply makes it to the end alive by not giving up. NPR's Audie Cornish interviewed him about his novel <em>Final Girl Support Group</em>, which is about exactly what it sounds like, a support group for women who survived psycho murderers — except it seems like someone's starting to hunt them down... again. As Hendrix says, what's the scariest thing for a "Final Girl?" A sequel. ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Dr. Sanjay Gupta looks to a future living with COVID in 'World War C'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We've all heard talk about "the new normal," whatever that even is. CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has his own ideas, and despite the harsh realities of nearly two years living through a pandemic — quarantines, hospital staffing shortages, massive loss of life — he remains optimistic. In his new book <em>World War C</em>, he says, COVID is something we'll likely live with... forever. But that doesn't mean it has to control our lives. He sat down with NPR's Rachel Martin to talk about it in today's episode. ]]></description>

      <title>Tiphanie Yanique and Dawnie Walton on music, monsters, and family baggage</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There was a time when the kind of music you listened to could fully define the kind of lifestyle you led, says Dawnie Walton, author of <em>The Final Revival of Opal and Nev</em>. It's less restricting now, but your taste in music can still say quite a bit about who you are. In her book and in Tiphanie Yanique's novel <em>Monster in the Middle,</em> music plays at the center of its characters' stories, as they wrestle with figuring out who they are in their relationships, with significant others and their families.

      <title>In a powerful memoir, poet Joy Harjo talks about finding her voice and using it</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Poet Laureate Joy Harjo says she loved poetry as a kid, but didn't feel like it belonged to her. "It wasn't until I heard Native poets," she tells NPR's Michel Martin, "that I realized that, wow, this is a powerful tool of understanding and affirmation. And I don't know, I just started writing." Harjo had been studying medicine, she says, and she knew her people needed doctors — but what about poets? Her new memoir <em>Poet Warrior</em> is a chronicle of pain and injustice, of growing up poor with an abusive stepfather — but also of poetry and discovery, of taking that pain and using it to make art. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[It's almost Halloween, which means that we're in peak spooky season. So for today's episode, we bring you two books with two <em>very</em> different kinds of frights: a haunted house and...office politics. That's right: In <em>The Other Black Girl</em>, writer Zakiya Dalila Harris captures the all-too-real horror of being the only Black woman in her office. When another Black woman is hired, the tension gets dialed up even higher. And in <em>There's A Ghost In This House</em>, the author-illustrator Oliver Jeffers uses old photographs to create creepy illustrations that will give both children and adults goosebumps. ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[It's almost Halloween, which means that we're in peak spooky season. So for today's episode, we bring you two books with two <em>very</em> different kinds of frights: a haunted house and...office politics. That's right: In <em>The Other Black Girl</em>, writer Zakiya Dalila Harris captures the all-too-real horror of being the only Black woman in her office. When another Black woman is hired, the tension gets dialed up even higher. And in <em>There's A Ghost In This House</em>, the author-illustrator Oliver Jeffers uses old photographs to create creepy illustrations that will give both children and adults goosebumps. ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How Drew Magary rediscovered himself after 'The Night the Lights Went Out'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The humor writer Drew Magary was at a karaoke bar when his life changed in a flash: He collapsed and cracked his skull. By most accounts, the resulting traumatic brain injury should have been fatal, but he survived. As he recounts in his book <em>The Night the Lights Went Out</em>, recovering from that injury has been tough. Among other things, he permanently lost some of his senses. As Magary tells NPR's Lulu Garcia Navarro, recovery has required him to figure out who he is now, post injury — a challenge that makes for a good story, he says. ]]></description>

      <title>Why Hillary Clinton wanted to write a political thriller about her greatest nightmare</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The bestselling author Louise Penny is a prolific writer of mysteries and thrillers — but for her latest book, she decided to bring a partner into the fold, a novice to the world of mystery-writing: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Their book, <em>State of Terror</em>, brings readers into a world in which a president picks a former rival to be his secretary of state (sound familiar?) — and she must then contend with what Clinton calls one of her greatest fears: nuclear-armed terrorists. In this interview, Penny and Clinton discuss the messages they hope readers take away from the book. ]]></description>

      <title>In 'The Matter of Black Lives,' generations of Black thinkers probe American racism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Back in June 2020, during a summer of protests for racial justice, the <em>New Yorker </em>republished 'Letter from a Region in my Mind," a seminal James Baldwin essay calling out the ignorance of liberal white Americans. In the following months, writer Jelani Cobb put together a collection of essays from the magazine that fit a similar theme: Black writers, including Toni Morrison and Ta-Nehisi Coates, who wrote pieces for the <em>New Yorker</em> about race and racism that still ring true today. In this interview, Cobb reflects on the essays and what it took for those Black writers to break into the magazine. ]]></description>

      <title>The zoo that history nearly forgot in 'When Two Feathers Fell From The Sky'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ If you visited South Nashville today, you might not suspect that, over a century ago, it was home to a zoo and amusement park called the Glendale Zoo. Among other attractions, the zoo had a popular attraction called "horse diving," in which a performer rode a horse off a tall platform into a body of water. In her book, <em>When Two Feathers Fell From The Sky, </em>Verble imagines the life of a young Cherokee girl named Two Feathers, who horse dives for a living at the zoo in the year 1926 — set against the background of the Jim Crow South and widespread mistreatment of Native Americans. ]]></description>

What we eat can help us tap into something deeper, whether it brings up treasured memories or allows us to escape our own lives for just a few bites. That duality is captured by two different books in today's episode; while <em>Crying in H Mart </em>by Michelle Zauner explores how cooking Korean food helped the author grieve her mom's death, <em>Gastro Obscura</em> by Cecily Wong and Dylan Thuras takes readers to each continent to learn about its cuisine.

      <description><![CDATA[The Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgaard gained an international reputation thanks to his breakout autobiographical series <em>My Struggle </em>-- but he actually made his literary debut in the world of fiction. Now, he's returned to that world with his novel <em>The Morning Star</em>, a dark tale of the uncanny events that unfold after a new star appears in the sky. Unlike his previous series, the book features multiple perspectives and otherworldly incidents that seem ripped from the pages of the Bible. But as the author explains to NPR's Leila Fadel, those acts of God happen alongside the mundanity of everyday life, in true Knausgaardian fashion. ]]></description>

      <title>Stephanie Grisham is — yes, really — taking our questions now</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham famously held no press briefings during her time in the White House — but now, she's ready to talk. Her memoir, <em>I'll Take Your Questions Now,</em> is the latest tell-all from a former Trump staffer — and Tamara Keith, from NPR's Politics Podcast, hit her with some tough questions about whether the book is simply an image rehab project. "Too many books have been out there to help one person's reputation so they can be rehabilitated ... or to try to rewrite history," Grisham says. "I just want to tell my story and have people take what they want from it." ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham famously held no press briefings during her time in the White House — but now, she's ready to talk. Her memoir, <em>I'll Take Your Questions Now,</em> is the latest tell-all from a former Trump staffer — and Tamara Keith, from NPR's Politics Podcast, hit her with some tough questions about whether the book is simply an image rehab project. "Too many books have been out there to help one person's reputation so they can be rehabilitated ... or to try to rewrite history," Grisham says. "I just want to tell my story and have people take what they want from it." ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How Colin Powell Wanted The World To Remember Him</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When Colin Powell died on October 18 at the age of 84 from COVID-19 complications, he left behind a long, decorated career in Washington and the U.S. Army. He spent much of his life in the military, eventually rising to the rank of four-star general, and went on to become the first Black Secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs. But, as he discussed in a 2012 interview with NPR's Robert Siegel about his memoir <em>It Worked For Me</em>, Powell's reputation was tarnished when he used faulty evidence to push for the Iraq War: "I'll never leave it behind."]]></description>

      <title>Amor Towles' new book is about a road trip that takes more than a few U-turns </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Amor Towles' new book is quite the joyride — <em>The Lincoln Highway</em> follows four kids in a 1948 Studebaker who set out along the real-life Lincoln Highway, the first highway to cross the country. Two of them are trying to head for San Francisco to find their mother — the other two want to go the other way, looking for a promised inheritance. Needless to say, things don't go as planned. Towles talked to NPR's Scott Simon about the book — and also about the way the world moves so much faster now than it did in the 1950s, and how that affects the stories kids hear and see and create.  ]]></description>

This week we've got two books that might help you reckon with that reckoning, in two different ways: Traci Todd and illustrator Christian Robinson's bright and powerful picture book biography <em>Nina: A Story of Nina Simone</em> and poet Claudia Rankine's <em>Just Us: An American Conversation</em>, in which she puts together poetry, essays and images to bring readers into an uncomfortable but necessary conversation about race. ]]></description>

And while she might not dish as much dirt as other Trump-era memoirists, the former senior National Security official writes movingly about Trump and about polarization and other threats to American democracy. She points to Russian history to suggest that distrust in government and political systems can lead to collapse.

      <description><![CDATA[Percival Everett's page-turning new detective novel <em>The Trees</em> is at once gruesome and screamingly funny. A racial allegory rooted in southern history, the book features two big-city special detectives with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation who are sent to investigate a small-town crime. The murders are hideous in detail, the language is rough, there are racial epithets of all kinds, and somehow the politically incendiary humor is real.

First, in a conversation with Michel Martin, Prager talks through his book<em> The Family Roe: An American Story,</em> centered on the woman who was the baby at the center of the landmark Roe v. Wade trial. Then Leni Zumas and Scott Simon discuss Zumas' novel <em>Red Clocks</em>, set in a time where fetal personhood legislation has outlawed not only abortion, but also in-vitro fertilization. ]]></description>
