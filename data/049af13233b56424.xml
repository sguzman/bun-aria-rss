    <copyright>EFC LLC.</copyright>
    <description>Emma prefers to share her thoughts with a microphone rather than a physical human being, so thank god she has a podcast. Recorded from the comfort of her bed, Emma talks at length about whatever is on her mind every week. Anything really does go on this podcast. Sometimes philosophy, sometimes a random story from 10 years ago, sometimes advice, and sometimes nothing at all. You never know what you are going to get, but that’s what keeps it interesting. New episodes every Thursday.</description>

      <title>seasonal depression </title>
      <description>it's starting to feel like fall and a little bit like winter where i live. over the last few weeks, i've really felt the shift: summer's over, it's gone. it's starting to get cold and dark and i'm feeling it, as i do every year. the fall/winter season challenges me mentally every year. every year, i'm convinced i'll be strong and not be affected by the changing of the season, but every year i get hit by a little bit of seasonal depression. this year it's hitting me medium hard. it's affecting me in a lot of different ways from being extra tired, to having less motivation...i kind of feel like shit, honestly. since it happens to me every year, i have finally come to expect and prepare for it. so i have some tips, based on how i handle my seasonal depression, for how to get through it and maybe they can be helpful to you, too.

      <title>i changed my mind</title>
      <description>if you are a frequent listener of anything goes, you know i love talking about life, life philosophy, society as whole, etc... i like sharing my opinions, discussing those things broadly and openly. there's two things about that: 1) i don't know everything and 2) i'm 21 and i'm still learning a lot and so naturally, i'm not always going to get it right. sometimes i will get it right, but i'm not always going to get it right and i am open to that. so in today's episode, i'm going to address some of the times when people disagreed with me heavily and i'm going to talk about it. i'm going to talk about whether i still stand by what i said, or if maybe my opinion has changed. i wanted to do this, because i feel like a lot of people are afraid of the natural and healthy evolution of the human mind over the course of your life where your ideas and your moral compass change over time. it can be humbling because you have to admit that you were wrong or didn't know enough about a topic at the time, but it's so so important. let's get into it.

      <title>cheating </title>
      <description>we're talking about something serious today...anyone who has been on the internet recently has been seeing this conversation about people who cheat on their significant others in a relationship. it seems a lot of people have gotten caught cheating recently and because of that, it feels like cheating has been a big topic of discussion on the internet. so i wanted to talk about cheating today because it's a complicated subject. when i was younger, i used to think it was just always wrong and anyone who did it was terrible, but as i get older, i'm starting to realize that topics like cheating are much more complex than i originally thought when i was a child. so that's what i want to talk about the nuances of cheating- why people do it, whether it can ever be forgiven and whether once a cheater, always a cheater is actually true. here we go.

      <title>celebrity privacy </title>
      <description>i feel like every day at least once, i catch myself reading an article about celebrity drama. and every once in a while, i'll look in the comments section...and i've noticed a theme: there are two types of comments. some comments are just about the situation being reported on, you know, people putting in their two cents, sharing their opinion, etc. the other comments are people saying, ‘take this down and stop talking about this person's private life.’ no matter what the situation is, there are these two types of comments. and this just really got me thinking about this argument...how much privacy do celebrities deserve? and it is a complicated, complicated dilemma. so i wanted to deep dive into the dilemma today, share my thoughts, opinions, have an open conversation and see what conclusion we come to, if any. we probably won't come to a conclusion, but it's just something really interesting to dissect.

      <description>i've noticed that a lot of gen z and millennial people seem to be choosing their career over love. there seems to be this sort of belief within young people that you can't have both and need to choose one or the other. i've kind of seen this narrative float around a bit on the internet and in person and it really got me thinking: is this true? do you have to choose one? do you have to choose being in love and being in a relationship or building a successful career? or can you have both? upon reflecting upon my own life, and thinking for a while, i realized i disagree with this idea. i think that relationships don't have to prevent success at all, in fact, i think being in a good relationship can nurture success. so that's what we're talking about today. we’re going to go over why i think this is true and why it could be true for you, too.

      <title> is anyone actually cool?</title>
      <description>something i (and probably you) have struggled with our whole lives is thinking other people are cooler than us. seeing someone on social media or at a party and thinking, 'god, why are they so much cooler than me?' it's just a part of life. but recently, i have come to the conclusion that i don't think anyone is that cool. i think some people are just better than others at creating an illusion that they're cool. i actually might argue that the concept of coolness that we've all been living by our whole lives is a lie. the idea of coolness we have is completely fake. i would argue this. and that's what we're going to talk about today.

      <title>temptation </title>
      <description>today we're going to be talking about temptation. which, in my opinion, is one of the most challenging things we deal with as human beings. it's something we deal with whether we're 2 years old or 102 years old. the temptations can change as we get older, but some form of it is always there. the reason i think it's so hard to deal with, is because in the short term, it's often easier and more fun- there's instant gratification. the problem is, usually things that are tempting, that you know are wrong, will end up leaving you miserable down the line. no one gets away with it - the universe doesn't work like that. i feel like it's the fighting of a temptation that helps you grow into a more morally solid person. it's so important for your self-development, self-esteem and more...recently i had my own sort of awakening with resisting temptation that really clicked for me and that's what i want to talk about today.

      <title>balance in relationships </title>
      <description>well, my cats woke me up at 3am and i couldn't fall back asleep, so i am coming to you at 5:30am and the thing on my mind is relationships...i haven't talked about relationships in a long time and i wanted to bring them up again because they are fascinating to me. it's just so interesting when two people get together...like, why did those two people choose each other? i analyze this constantly. so today i want to talk about two relationship dilemmas that i think are not talked about enough: 1) finding balance when it comes to dealing with your own issues in a relationship, and 2) having independence in a relationship. i am going to share what i've learned about these two dilemmas and we will have a conversation about it.

      <description>today we're doing something fun. today we're going to take a look at some of the fashion trends that are happening right now, and we're going to discuss them. then i am going to decide whether i think the trend is trendy and it will dissipate at some point...or whether it's timeless and it's something that will stick around for years to come. that's today's episode. i actually did this type of episode before, honestly maybe a year ago, but i think there's new trends happening now, so it's time to do it again. let's get started!

      <description>welcome back for part two of my series on failure. the first episode in this series was about failing as a human being. this episode is a little bit different because it's actually about failing in your endeavors. maybe that's job-related, something creative, school-related, a new hobby...failing in our endeavors in life. right now in our society, it's hard to fail...it kind of feels like there's no room for it. so i want to share some tools i've found that makes trying something new easier or a little more enjoyable and decreases the fear of failure. here we go.

      <title>failure (part one: failing as a human being)</title>
      <description>hi. for the next two episodes i'm going to be doing a little two part series about failure. i wanted to do this because i think it's really easy to forget that failing in anything in life doesn't define you. it doesn't make you a permanently evil person, it doesn't make you a permanent loser or a permanent idiot. failing actually has a crucial role in becoming a better you in all areas of life. i think a lot of us know that, but it's easy to forget. so today i want to remind you, and talk about failing as a human being...about personal failure to yourself and others. we'll go over types of personal failure, the lessons we learn from failure, how to handle it and move on from it, failure in relationships and more.

      <title>stuff i've been loving</title>
      <description>hello. i feel like lately i've been doing topics that are challenging to talk about. the last few episodes have been heavy and thought-provoking, and that's great...but today, i want to be not-so-deep. i think it's important to do that sometimes. in your 20s, you're questioning and deeply analyzing everything, i know i am. but today, i don't want to do that. i want to talk about the things i've been loving lately: what products i've been loving, the activities i've been loving, the snacks i've been loving--just the stuff i'm enjoying right now. i think that this could be helpful because maybe you might hear something i talk about today and think, 'i want to try that.' or maybe you have a recommendation for me that you'll dm me after the podcast. either way, it's going to be fun.

      <title>plastic surgery</title>
      <description>hello. so i got to go to fancy event recently…and that’s great, but unfortunately that day, i was just not feeling myself…i was feeling a little insecure and not too cute. and the thing about fancy events is people always take a lot of photos and that happened there…there were some pictures taken of me at the event that i was not a fan of that kept getting reposted and honestly, i had a little freak out. i was really struggling with my self-image. and that got me thinking about plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures…what are the negatives, positives and should you tell someone about them? so i am talking all about that, including how i feel about them and whether i would ever get one. honestly, it’s kind of a layered topic, but i love talking this stuff out with you.

      <title>criticism </title>
      <description>hello- today we’re talking about criticism. i think criticism is so important in all of its forms. i experience criticism a lot, and have actually learned to appreciate it. it’s possible to benefit rather than suffer from criticism. i share what i see as the distinction between helpful criticism and hurtful criticism, how i think criticism is best given, how i think criticism is best received, and more of my thoughts on the topic. how do you handle criticism?

      <title>parties</title>
      <description>hi guys. so a few months ago i read the great gatsby, which is a really good book- highly recommend. well, without spoiling the storyline for you, i will tell you that in this book, there are some extravagant parties. i mean, just gorgeous parties. at the end of reading the book i found myself craving a party. in the book parties seem perfect…but i’ve found that in reality, parties are less than perfect. in fact, they can sometimes be straight up not fun. so today, i want to talk about parties. i want to talk about my experiences, what could make parties better, and ways to make them more fun. let me know what you think and if you agree.

      <title>health and wellness products, are they worth it?</title>
      <description>okay guys, here’s something you may not know about me: i have a tendency to be a bit of a sucker for health and wellness products that are kind of hyped up…and there’s a reason you may not know this about me…it’s because i kind of hate to admit it. i’m a little embarrassed that i feel the need to try every new vitamin, hair mask, face roller, moisturizer, what-have-you. so since i'm kind of an unintentional health and wellness product connoisseur, and out of guilt for purchasing all of these hyped up products, i wanted to share my thoughts about them. today i will go down the list of some of the most popular health and wellness rituals and products and share my true and honest thoughts on them. hopefully this will help so you don’t waste your time and money doing things that aren’t worth your time and money. maybe it will give you some ideas about the products that are worth it, too. let’s get into it.

      <title>female friendships </title>
      <description>i really can only think about two things right now: number one, how good spicy dill pickle almonds are and number two, today’s topic, which is female friendships. i have done episodes about friendship, in general, on the show but recently i’ve been really thinking specifically about friendships between women. i think there’s a very special dynamic between two women who are friends- between anyone, really- but especially between women. so today i am going to share my personal experiences…why sometimes these friendships were harder for me as a kid and how they have gotten better as i’ve gotten older. i share my opinion on some of the tough parts of female friendships and also ways to overcome them so that you have a better relationship with your friends and yourself.

      <title>making a comfortable space</title>
      <description>hi. i’ve been moving over the course of the past few months and i finally feel like i’m settled in a place i’ll be in for a while. in the past, i never really cared about the space i lived it- i just figured i’d be in and out in a year and there was no point. but with my new home, i really made an effort to make my space work for me and it has made me so much happier. so i have some tips i’m going to share, that you can use to make your space your own, too. it’s all about knowing yourself - it’s these little elements of personalization that make your day-to-day life easier and more streamlined…it’s kind of fun in a way. it’s enjoyable. hope these tips help…let me know if any of this stuff works for you. maybe i’m losing my marbles a bit, but i don’t know, i think it makes a big difference. love ya.

      <title>weed</title>
      <description>well, my cats woke me up at 5 in the morning, so i am coming to you early in the am to tell you my weed story. in the last episode, we talked about alcohol. i briefly mentioned that i do not smoke weed. today i’m going to tell you why and share my stories about my experiences with weed…why I don’t smoke weed, why i will never do it again and how it affects my anxiety. actually, i will not make any promises, because i don’t really trust myself, i might try it again, but it’s very unlikely and i really shouldn’t…anyway, now that i’m 21 i’m finally getting to tell you guys all the stories i always wanted to share. it’s honestly been so fun.

      <title>alcohol </title>
      <description>guess who just turned 21 years old? me. and you know what that means. i can legally drink in the usa. it’s nice…i mean, it has some pros, for sure, but it also has some cons. it’s also a little overwhelming to figure out your relationship with alcohol, especially in social situations and with your mental health. so i wanted to share some things with you that i wish i’d known before i started drinking…my thoughts on the positives and negatives of alcohol and even a few drinking tips. if you guys are also new to drinking, or even if you’ve been drinking for a while, maybe this will help.

      <title>there is a culture shift coming (part three: trends)</title>
      <description>hey guys, i have two things to tell you: i have a swollen eyeball, and also, this is the last episode of our three part series on culture. today we’re talking about trends and trend cycles- and how they’re changing. once again, i don’t know, you guys, i don’t know if anything i am saying today makes sense, but hopefully one thing did. anyway, i think that the trend cycle is no longer working in the way that it once did and i think that it actually might be a good thing. we’ll see. love you.

      <title>the truth about being self-employed</title>
      <description>HAPPY TO BE BACK! i've seen a lot of talk on the internet about how amazing it is to be self-employed and how we should all strive for it, and turning your dream into a job is the key measure of success. as someone who is self-employed, i can definitely say it's not all it's glorified to be, so i'm talking through all the pros and cons of being self-employed, and why sometimes having a regular 9-5 isn't a bad thing at all.

      <title>competition is the thief of creativity</title>
      <description>this podcast was nominated for another people’s choice award which is AMAZING and i cannot thank you guys enough. so it’s only fitting that i do an episode about how much i hate award shows lol. kidding, kinda, but i don’t think someone’s creativity should be judged based on someone else’s opinions. sports and competitions, sure, but judging someone’s art as “good” or “bad” doesn’t make sense so i talk about it in this ep. and i finally share my story about what happened at the streamys a few years back.

      <title>the feminine mold</title>
      <description>As we grow up we’re told there are certain molds and stereotypes that we need to fit into: the “ideal” woman, the “ideal” guy, etc. But that image in our minds can leave us feeling that we’re not good enough unless we achieve it. Emma talks through her struggles with this growing up, and the issues it caused with her self-esteem and how she was treated by others. Once we learn to accept who we are, and forget who we think we should be, then we can truly be happy.

      <title>the met gala</title>
      <description>Emma is back from one of the craziest few weeks of her life, filled with a rollercoaster of emotions. She talks all about all the details of her time at the Met Gala, and the entire process leading up to it: from getting the call she was going, to preparing and designing the dress with Louis Vuitton (and inspirations behind it), what actually happens at the event itself and after, and all of the feelings she’s had throughout. It's been a wild ride she's excited to share with everyone.

From not wearing masks indoors, feeling super drained in social situations, not having the energy to make plans, feeling awkward when reconnecting with people we haven’t seen in so long, and difficulties making new friends.

      <title>success kills creativity</title>
      <description>We’ve seen it before… we find a band and their first album is amazing, they blow up, then their second album just doesn’t cut it. Or a TV show… we’re glued to the first season, then can’t even get through the second. Why does success kill creativity? Emma has experienced it herself, and this week she’s diving into why sometimes when we find success, it can be detrimental to continuing to be creative. She’ll talk about ways we can avoid it, and find the balance between creativity and success.

      <title>the illusion of money</title>
      <description>Money can be a very tricky subject. When we don’t have it, it can seem like it will solve all of our problems. But when we get it, is it really all worth it?

Plus, questions on saving, supporting others, and she clears the air on an article written about her when it came to money struggles.

      <title>the word "irrelevant" on the internet</title>
      <description>Emma goes deep this week on the notion of becoming “irrelevant” on the internet. Navigating “cancel culture”, challenges of growing up in front of millions, a lack of privacy and extra scrutiny, and less wiggle room to make normal teenage mistakes. Why clickbait content is less important than creating something you’re passionate about, and how living life based off views and likes can really be a strain on mental health.

      <title>living alone</title>
      <description>Moving out is a big step in anyone’s life, but those responsibilities are such a drag. Emma dishes on the expectations vs. the realities of moving out and living on your own.

      <title>pet peeves</title>
      <description>It’s a rant session. Emma is fired up about all of her pet peeves in this episode. From food chewing and getting it caught in the corner of your mouth (gross), to lying, judging and humble brags. Plus, maybe it’s time to get rid of that v-neck shirt, and she’s definitely judging that coffee order. And it’s finally been settled: which side of the roll should the toilet paper fall?

      <title>emotions</title>
      <description>Emotions, we all have them, and they can be a really tricky thing to navigate. Emma gets sensitive sometimes, as we all do, and she talks through it on this episode like a therapy session. From getting over people who wrong you, to worrying about relationships, letting yourself be vulnerable and opening up, why crying is actually good for us, and a lot more. Plus, Frankie the cat makes a (very short) cameo appearance on the podcast.
