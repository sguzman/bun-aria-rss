But she’s uncovered common misconceptions about boundaries and learned that boundaries are one of the most powerful, God-honoring tools we can use to protect our relationships.</p><p>In this teaching, Lysa walks through the first mention of boundaries in the Bible, three crucial words we need to embrace in order to understand God’s intent for boundaries and more.

        <![CDATA[<p>Sometimes God's protection comes in packages that don't feel like protection.<br> <br> The Bible says Jesus has overcome the world. But what about when it doesn't feel like it right now, in this situation? On this episode of the podcast, Lysa TerKeurst and Dr. Joel Muddamalle will walk through places in Scripture that show us the unlikely places where Jesus' protection is actually present. We'll learn that just because we can't see what God is doing, does not mean He is not working. Just because we feel afraid, does not mean we have to live afraid. We just have to train our eyes and ears to where Jesus is present in our lives today so we can find comfort in Him no matter the circumstances.</p><p>Related Resources:</p><p><strong>All donations made from November 29-December 8 will be doubled!</strong> For the days when everything feels like too much … <strong>Proverbs 31 Ministries meets you with biblical Truth and encouragement in the moments you feel most overwhelmed.</strong> When you donate to Proverbs 31 Ministries you are helping us continue to offer the biblical resources you need to help you through your hard moments. <a href="https://donate.proverbs31.org/give?utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=show-notes&amp;utm_campaign=YE21"><strong>Donate today!</strong></a><strong><br></strong><br> Our next ministry-wide Bible study is starting January 10!

        <![CDATA[<p>Do you doubt if you can really handle it all?<br> <br> The headlines are disheartening; routines we just set seem like they'll be disrupted (again) at any moment and life seems so very unpredictable.<br> <br> When your world seems to be spinning out of control, fear will tell you it's easier to hide from it all rather than face it. On this episode of the podcast, our dear friend — pastor Max Lucado — walks us through the book of Esther to show us that despite how we feel, we were made for this moment.

        <![CDATA[<p>Do you doubt if you can really handle it all?<br> <br> The headlines are disheartening; routines we just set seem like they'll be disrupted (again) at any moment and life seems so very unpredictable.<br> <br> When your world seems to be spinning out of control, fear will tell you it's easier to hide from it all rather than face it. On this episode of the podcast, our dear friend — pastor Max Lucado — walks us through the book of Esther to show us that despite how we feel, we were made for this moment. Made to parent our children, reach our communities and be a light in the midst of darkness. In the moments when we feel like it's all too much, Max reminds us to bend our knees in prayer, open our Bibles to fill our hearts with Truth and look up to remind ourselves God hasn't left us.<br> </p><p><strong>Related Resources:</strong></p><p>If this podcast ministered to you today, would you <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-proverbs-31-ministries-podcast/id757953988&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1633111363298000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pUqaKfagP5feaZkjQ1Ndg">leave us a review</a> on Apple Podcasts?

        <![CDATA[<p>When life's seasons change or we are walking through a time of transition, it's easy for our relationship with God to feel dry — or maybe just plain hard. But what if our time with God actually has less to do with quieting everything around us, and instead has everything to do with making an appointment to quiet things within us? On this episode of the podcast, Shae Tate, special projects content manager for Lysa TerKeurst, walks through scriptures throughout the Bible that show us what pursuing God looks like in different seasons. We hope this episode gives you a new perspective to help you walk through that dry place and meet with the Lord in a fresh, new way.</p><p>Related Resources:</p><p><br> Let's face it: This year has felt a little out of control.

        <![CDATA[<p>Question to consider: Do I have to honor my parents when it seems impossible?<br> <br> One of the Ten Commandments is <em>“honor your father and mother”</em> (Exodus 20:12). But sometimes, obeying that commandment feels exhausting and impossible. During this episode of the podcast, we learn from Lysa TerKeurst and Joel Muddamalle about the difference between obeying and honoring your parents. We’ll tackle expectations and boundaries during different seasons of parent/child relationships and how to navigate those seasons as they change. Whether you are the child or parent in the relationship (or both), this episode will help answer the question: How do I honor my parents when it feels impossible? </p><p>Related Resources:</p><p>- When we hear or read a teaching or sermon that challenges us, it's natural to ask, "Now what?"

        <![CDATA[<p>In times of uncertainty, our tendency is to hold tightly to everything we have. We want to feel safe and in control of the things we can control. But what if instead, we choose to let go, open our hands and pray prayers of surrender? What if God is calling us to trust Him more with everything?<br> <br> In this episode of the Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast, author and pastor Craig Groeschel sits down with Kendra Schwarz and discusses a two-word prayer that can change everything: <em>Send me</em>. You'll find that praying "send me" might not mean you'll be sent to another physical location, but it always means you'll be nudged out of your comfort zone. <br> <br> You'll learn why when you pray dangerously, you can't live life the same.

        <![CDATA[<p>The older we get, the easier it is to recognize that life is a combination of suffering and joy. While we look forward to the joyful times, our suffering has the potential to draw us closer to the Lord … if we choose to steward that season well. <br> <br> So, how do we do that?<br> <br> Today on the Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast, First 5 writer Lyli Dunbar draws from her own life experiences and the book of Daniel to show us four ways to steward our season of suffering well. And guess what? They all start with the letter “P” to make note-taking easy. <br> <br> With this episode, you will…</p><ul>
<li>Learn the importance of establishing a routine of getting into God’s Word daily in order to build a strong foundation to stand on when your world gets shaky.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Discover scriptures in the Psalms you can run to that will help you practice trading the tendency to panic with the power of prayer.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Understand how worshipping during hard times helps you trust that God is working even when you can’t see it.<p></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Related Resources:</p><ul>
<li>Establish a consistent, weekday quiet time with our <a href="https://first5.org/about/#downloadcta">First 5 mobile app</a>. It’s free (yes, free!) — all you need to do is go to your app store on your mobile device to download the app and join us in our current study. </li>
<li>Take your daily study of God’s Word a little deeper with our First 5 Experience Guides. These guides are meant to be a companion to a study you can find within our First 5 mobile app, or stand-alone as an individual study.

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you ever opened your Bible to the books of 1 &amp; 2 Kings and wondered how you could possibly have anything in common with a bunch of men who ruled hundreds of years ago? For starters, they were real kings with crowns that fought in battles and ruled nations, and we’re just normal people trying to get through the day. No wonder we have a hard time applying their stories and struggles to what we’re facing today.<br> <br> But you know what? We don’t want those thoughts to stop you from diving into the Old Testament because we believe that <em>all</em> of God’s Word is living, active and applicable to what we face today. The books of 1 &amp; 2 Kings are exciting and give us an account of how much God wants us to trust in Him —not in ourselves or others. <br> <br> Lysa TerKeurst recently released a brand-new Bible study based on 1 &amp; 2 Kings called <em>Trustworthy: Overcoming Our Greatest Struggles to Trust God</em>. In this week’s episode of the Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast, you’ll get an inside peek into a conversation we had with Lysa during our <em>Trustworthy</em> Online Bible Study. <br> <br> With this episode, you will…</p><ul>
<li>Gain a basic understanding of the lives of Jeroboam and Rehoboam in 1 &amp; 2 Kings, and learn about their trust issues within the context of their own stories.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Recognize that even though you’re not a king, you’re responsible for stewarding your influence  — whether that be social media, work, parenting or friends — we have the opportunity to point them all back to God. </li>
<li>Find relief from trying to do things in your own way or your own timing by taking small steps to trust God more today.</li>
</ul><p>Related resources:</p><ul>

      <itunes:summary>Have you ever opened your Bible to the books of 1 &amp; 2 Kings and wondered how you could possibly have anything in common with a bunch of men who ruled hundreds of years ago? For starters, they were real kings with crowns that fought in battles and ruled nations, and we're just normal people trying to get through the day. No wonder we have a hard time applying their stories and struggles to what we're facing today.</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>When you think about what affects your own happiness, you might think about how your mood changes after you’ve spent too much time on social media or when someone says something rude to you.<br> <br> Did you know that if you’re holding on to unforgiveness, it might be affecting you more than you realize?<br> <br> Today on <em>The Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast</em>, we’re joined by Max Lucado, a bestselling author of multiple books and pastor of Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas. Through a lot of research, Max found that 1 in 3 Americans admits they’re unhappy which inspired him to write <em>How Happiness Happens</em>, where he tackles this issue from a biblical perspective. Today, he’s giving us a sneak peek into this really powerful message. <br> <br> When you listen to today’s episode, you will…</p><ul>
<li>Discover the secret to being happy is to release forgiveness you’ve been holding back. <p></p>
</li>
<li>Learn how Jesus modeled what it looks like to be unoffendable by extending grace before your offender needs it.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Understand that forgiveness does not mean you’re endorsing or forgetting what happened to you; it means clearing your heart of offenses daily as you go before the Lord.</li>

Or maybe you think you’re resting, but you fill your time with TV, reading or shopping and at the end of the day, you’re still tired? Take a second and think of your own reasons.<br> <br> Whatever your answer, it’s easy to look at the word “rest” in our culture and think it’s never possible because we’re too busy, or that we don’t know how to truly unplug. In this week’s episode, Kristen White, Proverbs 31 staff member and wife of Pastor Kaleb White, will tackle the true reason why we should rest, and what God’s Word says about it. <br> <br> In this episode, you will...</p><ul>
<li>Evaluate your priority of working versus resting by looking at the story of creation in Genesis and how it teaches us about how God prioritized rest.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Understand the difference of working from rest instead of resting from work, and get a few ideas for how to creatively or mentally recharge when you need a break.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Remember that the Sabbath isn’t a rule that keeps us from getting more work done, but a day set aside by God for us to rest and grow in our relationship with Him. <p></p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Depending on your church background, you might participate in Advent every year, or you might stay away from it because it seems like a mysterious, age-old tradition that’s reserved for only certain denominations. You might even associate Advent with a candy calendar you see displayed in stores close to the holiday season.<br> <br> At Proverbs 31 Ministries, our goal is to help you know the Truth of God’s Word by shedding light on things that might be a little unclear … even things like the Advent season. While Advent is not a biblical command, it is an activity we can choose to participate in to turn our hearts from the hustle and bustle as we focus on biblical truths. <br> <br> In this episode, you’ll hear from Proverbs 31 Ministries' director of theology, Joel Muddamalle. You will…</p><ul>
<li>Discover what Advent is, what it isn’t and how it can help align your heart with God’s Word as we celebrate Christmas and Jesus’ second coming.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Stop rushing through the holiday season and refocus your mind on adoration for Jesus through patience, expectations for what He’s doing and contemplation on His goodness.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Understand the importance of setting aside time to share with your family about who Jesus is and what He has done, and what He has promised to come back and do. <p></p>
</li>
</ul><p>No matter your views on Advent, we pray this episode will serve as a resource and a reason to slow down and focus on Jesus this season. </p><p>Related Resources:</p><ul>
<li>If you’re reading this, maybe God has used Proverbs 31 Ministries to point you back to Him in your deepest moment of need. Will you consider giving back so we can continue giving you our resources and reach even more women who desperately need Him? <a href="https://proverbs31.org/donate">Click here to make a donation today!</a><p></p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Why is it so enticing to choose lesser things over lasting things? <br> <br> Do you ever pick up your phone or watch a mindless show without thinking anything of it, but end up wondering where the day went when you lay down at night? Sometimes even the things that are entertaining and good can leave us feeling empty, lesser and lacking. So, how do we set healthy boundaries and train our minds to choose what’s best over what seems right in the moment?<br> <br> Today on The Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast, we’re tackling distractions head-on with our friends Amanda Bacon and Anne-Renee Gumley of The Masterpiece Mom. Amanda and Anne-Renee will give a teaching based on their latest book, Shiny Things: Mothering on Purpose in a World of Distractions (and we promise it isn’t just for moms). <br> <br> In this episode of the podcast, you will…</p><ul>
<li>Identify the areas where you’re most distracted by “shiny things” and create a priority list that you’re determined to live out, not just write out. <p></p>
</li>
<li>Stop being distracted by comparing your life to someone else’s as you start focusing on the assignment that only you can do.</li>
<li>Grow your desire to have a strong relationship with the Lord in order to develop the persistence you need to stick to your “lasting” list instead of the “lesser” things in life. </li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Today is a very special day on <em>The Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast</em> because … (drum roll please) we’re celebrating our first birthday!<br> <br> Over the past year, we’ve released 31 episodes — how fitting for Proverbs 31, right? But there’s more to celebrate than just the number of episodes we released. With every episode, we reached hearts and homes around the globe (literally!) with biblical truth for any girl in any season. We’re so thankful for the way the Lord has used this podcast above and beyond what we could have imagined!<br> <br> So to help us celebrate, we invited Proverbs 31 Ministries' President, Lysa TerKeurst, to the show because there’s just no one who can share God’s Word quite like Lysa. In today’s episode of the podcast, you’ll hear a teaching called “3 Things to Consider Before Making that Decision.” We’re so thankful for Lysa’s wisdom and expertise on decision-making. <br> <br> In this episode, Lysa will teach you:</p><ul>
<li>The “daily-ness” of decisions can make them seem small, but over time, even small decisions add up and make an impact.<p></p>
</li>
<li>When you look at the big picture of where you are and where you want to be, the path can seem complicated and scary! But the way you get there is one day at a time, through choosing wisely every day.</li>
<li>Wisdom is earned through the combination of gaining knowledge, access to the Holy Spirit and living out what you know to be true. </li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Do you ever find yourself fighting the temptation to focus on what you don’t have instead of what you’ve already been given? When we are actively pursuing God’s calling on our lives, I think we’ve all been tempted to focus on what someone else has or is experiencing, and feel disqualified because of what we lack. It’s so easy to think,<em> I’m not as talented, bold, smart or outgoing as she is. I can’t write, speak or lead. I don’t know how to do _______. I just can’t.<br> </em><br> Sweet friend, we don’t know what your calling looks like, but we do know that we serve a God who’s still in charge and doesn’t leave everything up to us! Today on<em> The Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast,</em> you’ll hear a special message from Suzie Eller that will inspire you and empower you to trust God with your calling. <br> <br> In this episode, Suzie will teach you…</p><ul>
<li>Being called out of your comfort zone and called into a new assignment is never easy, but it’s also never about you, and that's a good thing! <p></p>
</li>
<li>Consistently coming before the Lord with what’s on your mind will help you know what you need to keep saying yes to, and what you may need to stop doing.</li>
<li>Embracing God’s anointing on your life IS the confidence you need to step into the assignment He’s asked you to do!</li>
</ul><p>Related Resources:</p><ul>
<li>Do you feel called to write, speak or lead? It’s time to step into your assignment! At Proverbs 31 Ministries, we have an annual conference called She Speaks where we equip writers, speakers and leaders with the practical tools and biblical training they need to take the next right step in their calling. <strong>This year for the first time ever, you can join us online from the comfort of your home!</strong> <a href="https://gotothehub.com/pages/she-speaks">Click here</a> to check out our She Speaks livestream packages.</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>It seems like every opportunity that comes our way is often followed by opposition. So ... how do you really know if it’s God who is really telling you to keep pursuing that opportunity when you face a giant roadblock? What do you do when you’ve lost all confidence to do what you think He’s called you to do?<br> <br> In today’s podcast episode, Katy McCown, one of our First 5 mobile app writers, will give a teaching from our First 5 study titled <em>Opposition and Opportunity</em>, based on the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. You’ll learn that if you’re only looking for opportunities and not expecting opposition with them, it’s easy to get confused about what you thought you were supposed to do. Or worse, you might even think you’ve misheard God or taken a wrong step, because if God really wanted you to make a move … <em>why would something get in the way?</em><br> <br> In this episode, you’ll…</p><ul>
<li>Gain clarity on the calling you believe God is asking you to follow by understanding the difference between an opportunity from God and opposition from the enemy. <p></p>
</li>
<li>Identify common tactics of the enemy — confusion, doubt and fear — and how to train your eyes to look away from the opposition you see and focus on the opportunity in front of you.</li>
<li>Claim your identity in Christ and speak Truth to combat the enemy’s lies while trusting God to go before you in every battle you face.</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Pause for a moment and think about your relationships … your spouse, children, friends, co-workers, neighbors. You can probably name some highs and lows of each relationship because, well, humans are <em>human</em>. And humans mess up! <br> <br> Our relationship with the church is no different. When a body of believers (who are by nature sinners) come together, things aren’t always a beautiful picture of a happy community without conflict. Whether or not you’re new to the Christian community, a phrase that you’ll likely hear is “church hurt.” At Proverbs 31 Ministries, we don’t want to just talk about church hurt; we want to dig into God’s Word and understand what He says about the Church (the body of believers). Using the first church in the book of Acts as an example, Whitney Capps will lead us through a Scripture-based conversation on church hurt and how to navigate it in our own lives. <br> <br> In this episode, it’s our hope that you’ll …</p><ul>
<li>Understand the relationship between the church and its members as outlined in Scripture and find your place in a community of believers.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Acknowledge the hurt you’re facing and find a way to forgive those who’ve hurt you through the lens of Scripture.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Develop empathy for those who have been hurt by the church and discover ways you can reach out to help someone close to you take the next step toward healing. <p></p>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>“Why should I fast?”</em> … is a real question that often goes unanswered.

After all, why fast when you could simply pray, right?</p><p>Throughout Scripture, you’ll discover fasting mentioned from Daniel to Elisha to Paul, and most commonly known, Jesus’ 40-day fast in the wilderness. In today’s teaching, you’ll hear Proverbs 31 Ministries' Director of Theology, Joel Muddamalle, discuss the real reason we should fast and answer the question you might’ve always wanted to understand.<br> <br> In this episode, you will …</p><ul>
<li>Learn about fasting in context of Scripture and understand how it can apply to your life today.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Understand how fasting is part of many spiritual disciplines that are outlined in Scripture to help us look more like Christ.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Discover how going “without” can help you reposition your heart and mind toward God through your ultimate need for Him.</li>

<li>Although we want to ensure fasting is a private event between you and God, we do want to encourage you to anonymously share how we can pray for you on our prayer wall.

        <![CDATA[<p><br> How do we embrace what seems so glaringly imperfect in the process of becoming more like Jesus? In Lysa TerKeurst’s new book, <em>It’s Not Supposed to Be This Way</em>, she says “Anytime we feel not good enough we deny the powerful truth that we are a glorious work of God in progress.” <br> <br> In this episode of the Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast, you’ll have the opportunity to listen to one of our favorite chapters, "Paintings and People," from Lysa’s newest book. In this chapter Lysa takes us through her own experience of feeling not good enough, and teaches us how to trust God with our imperfections on this side of eternity. <br> <br> You’ll discover…</p><ul>
<li>Sometimes you might be expecting a perfection from yourself or others that even God Himself doesn’t expect.<p></p>
</li>

        <![CDATA[<p><br> How do we embrace what seems so glaringly imperfect in the process of becoming more like Jesus? In Lysa TerKeurst’s new book, <em>It’s Not Supposed to Be This Way</em>, she says “Anytime we feel not good enough we deny the powerful truth that we are a glorious work of God in progress.” <br> <br> In this episode of the Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast, you’ll have the opportunity to listen to one of our favorite chapters, "Paintings and People," from Lysa’s newest book. In this chapter Lysa takes us through her own experience of feeling not good enough, and teaches us how to trust God with our imperfections on this side of eternity. <br> <br> You’ll discover…</p><ul>
<li>Sometimes you might be expecting a perfection from yourself or others that even God Himself doesn’t expect.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Time spent showing up and bringing compassion to a friend is never wasted time.<p></p>
</li>
<li>Being honest with yourself and your friends (rather than trying to cover up your imperfections) will strengthen the way you see yourself and your relationships.</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>When things don’t go the way we want and life doesn’t turn out the way we thought it should, it’s easy to wonder why. In Mark 14, Jesus prays “Yet not what I will, but what you will.” Those words read well, but they’re hard to live out. <br> <br> In this episode, Lysa TerKeurst will teach us what it really means to exchange our will for God’s will and builds off her last episode titled, “The Birthplace of Disappointment.” We already learned that the human heart was created in the context of the perfection of the Garden of Eden. Today, we’ll discover that there’s a physical reality we see, and at the same time, there’s the miraculous God is working. <br> <br> You’ll learn…</p><ul>
<li>Because God is working in the midst of your hurt, you can trust that your hurt will someday be made right. <p></p>
</li>
<li>When God leads you to something hard, He will also lead you through something hard because He won’t leave you.<p></p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The hymn, “It Is Well With My Soul” was first published almost 150 years ago. Those words are often sung in church or hung on the walls in our homes ... but if we were really honest with ourselves, could we say they’re absolutely true? <br> <br> Every day we get to decide what we let in our minds and what we keep out, how we spend our time, and what we give our attention to. In today’s episode of the Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast, author and First 5 writer Nicki Koziarz tackles the topic of dealing with comparison and what we can do to be able to respond, “Yes ... my soul is well.”<br> <br> In this episode you’ll learn…</p><ul>
<li>When you’re trying to please someone, the end goal will always be hard to reach.  <p></p>
</li>
<li>Your human heart ultimately desires a relationship with God, and to fill that desire with lesser things will make your soul unwell. <p></p>
</li>
<li>The temptation to compare yourself to someone else on this side of eternity may never go away, but you can take practical steps to avoid falling into the temptation today!</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>If you were to have a conversation with a friend right now, would you be able to say that everything in your life has turned out the way you expected it would? Probably not.

And why, as God’s children, do we wonder if our God really is a good God with good plans for our life?<br> <br> In this episode of the Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast, Lysa TerKeurst gives a message on this hard topic based on her newest book,<em> It’s Not Supposed to Be This Way: Finding Unexpected Strength When Disappointments Leave You Shattered</em>. <br> <br> Whether you’re in the middle of a disappointment, or fearing one is lurking right around the corner, you’ll discover…</p><ul>
<li>Trusting God with the outcome of your story is a crucial lesson to learn in order to navigate disappointments.</li>
<li>When you keep your eyes on Him, your joy doesn’t have to depend on a person, place or circumstances being made right. <p></p>

        <![CDATA[<p>When you read about Solomon’s life in 1 Kings 3:3 it says, “Solomon showed his love for the Lord by walking according to the instructions given him by his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.” <br> <br> Except.<br> <br> The word “except” means that Solomon’s affections weren’t fully placed on the Lord. Instead, some of his affections were placed on things of this world that were idols.

<li>When our needs are met somewhere else other than within our relationship with the Lord, there are consequences.</li>
<li>Waiting on the Lord to heal your wounds or provide for you in your time of need will be hard, but His timing and provision are better than any quick fix.</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you had a recent disagreement in a relationship, which you can’t quite find the cause of? It might be because of your expectations! One of the quickest ways to frustrate and fracture a relationship is to try and hold someone accountable for expectations that are either unrealistic or uncommunicated. </p><p>In today’s episode of the Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast, Lysa TerKeurst shares practical ways to navigate the conversation on expectations that will help you and your spouse, friend, or even co-worker, have a better relationship. You’re going to want to take notes for this one as Lysa helps you...</p><ul>
<li>Determine the difference between realistic and unrealistic expectations, and how to make peace with those that aren’t realistic.</li>
<li>Understand that putting off the conversation about any kind of unmet expectation will create a wedge between you and the other person. </li>
<li>Make the choice to choose the relationship over the uncertainty of uncommunicated expectations today.</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you had a recent disagreement in a relationship, which you can’t quite find the cause of? It might be because of your expectations!

He might even ask you to not move forward when you could so easily take matters into your own hands.</p><p>But what do you do when others are looking?

<li>The choice to be obedient to God will last far longer than the approval of others.</li>
<li>The feeling of peace doesn’t always immediately follow the decision to be obedient.</li>
