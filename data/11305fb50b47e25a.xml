<p>Reuters <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/brothers-odds-ruling-family-still-holds-key-sri-lankas-future-2022-06-08/?elqTrackId=EAB7DC03DDA397FC42104CE980F27639&amp;elqTrack=true" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that when a crowd of ruling party supporters marched toward activists protesting against a crippling economic crisis in Sir Lanka, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa ordered police to stop the pro-government mob, fearing violence. Despite the president&#8217;s order, the demonstrations against inflation, power blackouts and shortages of essentials turned deadly. Gotabaya&#8217;s older brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, announced his resignation as prime minister that day, making a public rift in Sri Lanka&#8217;s ruling dynasty. But the Rajapaksas are not done yet. A third brother, Basil, wields considerable influence over the country via his hold over the ruling party that dominates parliament.</p>

<p>Philippines presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr., along with his mother Imelda, has long tried to thwart efforts to recover billions of dollars plundered during his father&#8217;s autocratic rule. If Marcos becomes president in elections on May 9, he will have the authority to appoint the head of the agency set up to recover the family&#8217;s riches.
