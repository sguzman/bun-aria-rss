 <item> <title><![CDATA[Are Robots and AI Really Going to Displace All Workers? Probably Not]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60748</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Among the components of the World Economic Forum’s <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/">Great Reset</a> are a drastically reduced population and the replacement of human labor with robots and artificial intelligence (AI). The question immediately comes to mind: can robots and AI really make all the stuff for the elites after they have gotten rid of the people?</p>
<p>Because a plan has been formulated and described does not mean that it is possible to realize. The plan may contradict laws of logic or reality, or assume the existence of resources that do not exist.</p>
<p>Podcaster and journalist James Delingpole, <a href="HYPERLINK%20%22https:/delingpole.podbean.com/e/whitney-webb/%22">speaking</a> to investigative journalist Whitney Webb on October 23, 2021, discussed this topic with his guest. I have transcribed several minutes from their conversation, edited for concision:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Webb</strong>: The fourth industrial revolution. One of the main pillars of that is automation and artificial intelligence. We’ve already seen that with corporate behemoths, like Amazon’s efforts to replace human workers with robots. Starbucks is piloting their AI barista with plans to have at least one in most if not all locations…. How long until humans are gone entirely? That’s in a retail setting.</p>
<p>In the UK Tesco recently joined the cashier less checkout. It’s all done on your phone. You scan when you enter the store. Everything is tied to you, your unique digital identifier with the corporation. You can just walk out of the store. How convenient that you didn’t have to walk by a cashier at all.</p>
<p>We’re going to see this happen in big ways in manufacturing. Chile is one of the biggest producers of copper in the world. In the northern part of Chile, the economy is driven by mining…. They are automating the mining here [in Chile]. Most of Chile’s middle class in the north work in the mining industry. They are about to all be cut out….</p>
<p>It’s infinitely more profitable for a corporation to make an initial investment in a robot or an AI algorithm than to continuously pay a worker. Not have to deal with sick pay. There are efforts all over the world to demand better worker benefits. Better hours. Robots are the ultimate worker for a lot of these people because they are not interested in the human equation of things. There is a move to a human-free future coupled with anti-human rhetoric.</p></blockquote>
<p>The substitution of machines for human labor is a process that has been going on since the first industrial revolution. A considerable amount of manufacturing is already done by robots. But does it matter if a machine is a robot or not? Telecommunications switches connect calls that used to be done by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Girls">telephone operators</a>. We do not identify these machines as robots (perhaps because <a href="https://www.spectrumvoip.com/network-switch-pbx/">they do not have a recognizable torso and limbs</a> or perhaps because they perform their work on data rather than physical objects) but the impact on the demand for labor to perform those tasks is the same.</p>
<p>Contrary to Webb, it is not “infinitely more profitable” for a corporation to use an AI-powered robot in place of a person. Profitability is a calculation that depends on the price of the robot, the productivity of the robot, the wages of the person and the productivity of the human worker.</p>
<p>The substitution of capital for labor makes economic sense when the cost of the capital goods per unit value of output—including paying for the entire supply chain—is less than the wages of the person that is replaced.</p>
<p>Yes, workers are paid wages. However, robots and other machines are themselves not free goods. They must be designed, tested, and maintained. They are made of many parts which must be manufactured and transported. The manufacturing process is performed by some combination of people and other machines. The parts are ultimately made from materials that are mostly mined or extracted from the earth, also by men and machines.</p>
<p>Workers prefer better working conditions over worse. And for machines as well there are optimal working conditions. A truck that is driven on poor roads in bad weather will wear out or break down more quickly. Computers need a carefully tuned environment that is temperature and humidity controlled. Computer servers are housed in a complex capital good known as a “data center.”</p>
<p>The wages that are required to hire the workers are determined on the labor market, by the various competing uses for each person’s skills. If the cost of the robot is less than the worker, that is only because their labor is more urgently demanded doing something else. There is a greater need for human labor somewhere else in the world.</p>
<p>AI itself is not inexpensive. Building and running AI requires engineering effort and computing resources such as networks, servers, and storage. AI models are trained by data that must originate with the same human intelligence that the AI is trying to reproduce. If you want to train AI to recognize photographs of cats, someone must have taken the photographs and classified them as cats or “not cats” so that the AI can be validated. If the photos come from security cameras, someone must have installed the cameras.</p>
<p>After the model is built it must be maintained. AI models do not run perfectly forever. They must be monitored for drift, and it requires a human to determine if the drift is due to an error in the ingestion of data, such as a change in units, or a true change in the customer preferences that the model is trying to extract. In the latter case, the model must be retrained on a new data set.</p>
<p>Modern computer systems are built with some degree of self-diagnosing and self-repairing abilities. But the automation must punt all but the most straightforward cases into a call for help that brings a human into the process. Humans are necessary to diagnose problems and restore service when something has gone wrong.</p>
<p>The manufacture of machines such as robots requires a complex structure of production with perhaps tens of thousands of individual parts. Each part must be designed—by a person—manufactured and integrated with the other parts. The integrations, including isolating manufacturing defects, must be tested, and debugged.</p>
<p>Parts are transported by industries such as shipping and trucking. All of these steps involve combinations of labor and capital goods. It is true that people take sick days, however, machines break, wear out, and, and require repairs. The humans who repair the machines also have kids and take sick days. If you need to send the robot out for service, a mover will pack it up and load it on a truck. Self-driving cars? Maybe someday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-10-06/even-after-100-billion-self-driving-cars-are-going-nowhere">but not any day soon</a>.</p>
<p>Robots and made out of metals, which are mined out of the ground. Mineral deposits are not straightforward to find, to delineate and to mine. The discovery and extraction of mineral resources is a tremendously high-intellect activity. A small number of exploration geologists—many with doctoral degrees in fields such as geology and geophysics—have discovered a disproportionate fraction of mineable mineral deposits. Without labor, where would the metals come from to build the robots?</p>
<p>Someone like Webb might respond that robots will replace all of these functions as well. And some day, they might. However, the replacement of humans by machines for one task creates a need for labor—with different skills—to operate the machines. That is why we now have jobs for truckers, power plant operators, and machinists instead of wood cutters.</p>
<p>If miners were replaced with robots—how much labor would be required to build the robots including the entire supply chain, transportation, and the energy used to run them? It’s hard to say but a fraction of the impact would be shifts in the type of employment.</p>
<p>Has the substitution of capital for human labor over the centuries since the industrial revolution has reduced overall employment? Not so much. We have far more need for labor now because we have accumulated so much capital and require more labor to operate it. The human population has increased—in lockstep with the demand for human labor—because we are so much more productive with our enormous legacy of capital goods that we can support much more population.</p>
<p>Replacing the most routine and repeatable human labor with machines creates demand for the currently irreplaceable types of labor: creativity and problem-solving skills. It is true that boundaries of what machines can do expands over time. For example, voice recognition, which used to be quite poor, now handles a range of accents much better. However, AI is still at a point where it can at best replicate human learning by observing many samples created by humans. But for anyone who has tried to change their airline ticket by talking to a chat bot, it is clear that AI is at present limited to a standardized set of tasks.</p>
<p>As we can afford it, out of our accumulated savings, capitalists will continue to invest in robots and other forms of automation to replace workers. When this results in cost savings, that means more output at a lower cost, and a rising standard of living. As certain goods become cheaper to manufacture, workers can demand other, new and different goods and services, which feeds the indirect demand for labor in those industries.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Multinational Agrichemical Corporations and the Great Food Transformation]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60747</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>In July 2022, the Canadian government announced its intention to reduce “<a href="https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/about-our-department/transparency-and-corporate-reporting/public-opinion-research-and-consultations/share-ideas-fertilizer-emissions-reduction-target">emissions from the application of fertilizers by 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030</a>.” In the previous month, the government of the Netherlands publicly stated that it would implement measures designed to lower “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/dutch-govt-sets-targets-cut-nitrogen-pollution-farmers-protest-2022-06-10/">nitrogen pollution some areas by up to 70 percent by 2030</a>,” in order to meet the stipulations of the European “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/european-green-deal_en">Green Deal</a>,” which aims to “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en">make the EU’s climate, energy, transport and taxation policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels</a>.”</p>
<p>In response, Dutch “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/dutch-govt-sets-targets-cut-nitrogen-pollution-farmers-protest-2022-06-10/">farm and agriculture organizations said the targets were not realistic and called for a protest</a>,” which led farmers and their supporters to rise up across the country. The artificially designed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/agenda-2030.html">Green Deal</a> is one of the goals of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/agenda-2030.html">Agenda 2030</a>, which was adopted by 193 member states of the United Nations (UN) in 2015.</p>
<p>In addition to the UN, Agenda 2030 is also supported by a number of other international organizations and institutions, including the European Union, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and the Bretton Woods Institutions, which consist of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). It is also endorsed by some of the most powerful agrichemical multinational corporations in the world, such as BASF, Bayer, Dow Chemical, DuPont, and Syngenta, which, together, control more than 75 percent of the global market for farm inputs. <a href="https://european-seed.com/2019/02/from-big-six-to-big-four-new-oecd-study-sheds-light-on-concentration-and-competition-in-seed-markets/">In recent years</a>, “the acquisition of Syngenta by ChemChina, and the merger of Bayer and Monsanto” have “reshaped the global seed industry.” Additionally, “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/organizations/dupont">DuPont de Nemours was formed by the merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont in 2017</a>.” However, “within 18 months of the merger the company was split into three publicly traded companies with focuses on the following: agriculture with <a href="https://www.weforum.org/organizations/dupont">Corteva, materials science with Dow and specialty products with DuPont</a>.”</p>
<p>In recent years, all of these corporations have issued statements suggesting that the agriculture sector will undergo major changes over the upcoming three decades, and that they are committed to doing their parts to accelerate the transition to so called green policies. Accordingly, they advocate for governments to redirect public finance away from conventional farming and toward regenerative agriculture and alternative protein sources, including insect farming and lab-grown meats.</p>
<p>Moreover, BASF, Syngenta and Bayer are members of “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/forum_networks/100-million-farmers/projects/eu-carbon-farming-coalition">the European Carbon+ Farming Coalition</a>,” which includes a number of “organizations and stakeholders along the food value chain,” such as “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/projects/100m-farmers-transitioning-towards-net-zero-nature-positive-food-systems">COPA-COGECA, Crop In, European Conservation Agriculture Federation (ECAF), European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) Food, HERO, Planet Labs,” “Swiss Re, University of Glasgow, Yara, Zurich and the World Economic Forum</a>.” Originally, this “coalition emerged as a partnership between the World Economic Forum’s <a href="https://www.weforum.org/communities/100-million-farmers">100 Million Farmers platform</a> and its <a href="https://www.weforum.org/communities/ceo-action-group-for-a-european-green-deal">CEO Action Group for the European Green Deal</a>.”</p>
<p>Its objective is to “decarbonise the European food system” by accelerating the transformation of farming and agricultural practices. More specifically, the European Carbon+ Farming Coalition seeks to attain “<a href="https://www.foodandlandusecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Critical-Transitions-1-Promoting-Healthy-Diets.pdf">zero gross expansion in the area of land under cultivation for food production by 2025, reduction in total territories used for livestock of about one-third by 2030, and a consequent freeing up of nearly 500 million hectares of land for natural ecosystem restoration by the same date</a>.” According to the WEF, in addition to benefitting the environment, such changes will also be economically advantageous, as “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/projects/100m-farmers-transitioning-towards-net-zero-nature-positive-food-systems">changing the way we produce and consume food</a> could create <a href="https://www.foodandlandusecoalition.org/global-report/">USD 4.5 trillion a year</a> in new business opportunities.”</p>
<p>In order to accelerate the transformation of farming over the coming decades, BASF calls for requiring “<a href="https://agriculture.basf.com/global/en/sustainable-agriculture/climate-smart-farming.html">farmers to decrease their environmental impact</a>” by reducing “<a href="https://www.basf.com/global/en/media/news-releases/2020/11/p-20-365.html">CO2 emissions per ton of crop by 30 percent</a>,” and applying “<a href="https://www.basf.com/global/en/media/news-releases/2020/11/p-20-365.html">digital technologies to more than 400 million hectares of farmland</a>.” BASF also supports the wide use of a number of new products, including “nitrogen management products,” herbicides, “new crop varieties,” “biological inoculants and innovative digital solutions,” so as to make farmers “<a href="https://www.basf.com/global/en/media/news-releases/2020/11/p-20-365.html">more carbon efficient and resilient to volatile weather conditions</a>.” It is estimated that such changes would “<a href="https://www.basf.com/global/en/media/news-releases/2020/11/p-20-365.html">contribute significantly to the BASF Group target of €22 billion in sales by 2025</a>.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.syngenta.com/sites/syngenta/files/presentation-and-publication/updated/public%20policy%20positions/Syngenta-policy-position-soil.pdf">Syngenta</a>, the world’s second-largest agrochemical enterprise (after Bayer), which is owned by a Chinese state-owned company called ChemChina, focuses on “carbon neutral agriculture” under the pretense of “combatting climate change.” More precisely, it supports “<a href="https://www.syngenta.com/en/sustainability/good-growth-plan">providing technologies, services, and training to farmers</a>,” as well as the further development of new gene-edited seeds that would lower the emission of CO2. According to Syngenta, “gene-edited crops” will be widely used and cultivated across the globe “<a href="https://www.syngenta-us.com/thrive/research/future-of-farming.html">by 2050</a>.”</p>
<p>This company also promotes “<a href="https://www.syngentagroup.com/en/our-stories/tackling-food-and-climate-crises-regenerative-agriculture">a transformation toward regenerative agriculture</a>,” which is claimed to “<a href="https://www.syngentagroup.com/en/our-stories/tackling-food-and-climate-crises-regenerative-agriculture">lead to more food grown on less land; reduced agricultural greenhouse gas emissions; increased biodiversity; and enhanced soil health</a>,” though there is scant scientific evidence or long-term data to back up these assertions. Nonetheless, Syngenta argues that the world needs “<a href="https://www.syngentagroup.com/en/our-stories/tackling-food-and-climate-crises-regenerative-agriculture">governments and media … to encourage widespread adoption</a>” of regenerative practices by as many farmers as possible.</p>
<p>Bayer also advocates for regenerative agriculture to help “<a href="https://www.bayer.com/en/agriculture/climate-change">farmers significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gas their operations emit, while also removing carbon from the atmosphere</a>.” It further claims that it is necessary “<a href="https://www.bayer.com/en/innovation/breakthrough-innovation-forum">to shift to a regenerative approach and make crops more resilient to climate impacts</a>.” Additionally, much like Syngenta, Bayer supports the development of “<a href="https://www.bayer.com/en/investors/agriculture-megatrends">new gene editing technologies</a>” in order to reduce “the environmental footprint of global agriculture.” Looking ahead, Bayer foresees that, “<a href="https://www.bayer.com/en/innovation/breakthrough-innovation-forum">in agriculture, biotechnology will be a critical enabler</a>” that will be used to “<a href="https://www.bayer.com/en/innovation/breakthrough-innovation-forum">feed the 10 billion people that will be on the planet by 2050 while at the same time fighting the impact of climate change</a>.”</p>
<p>Similar to Bayer, BASF, and Syngenta, DuPont also seeks to contribute to decreasing “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/organizations/dupont">dependence on fossil fuels, and protecting life and the environment</a>.” Its response primarily focuses on facilitating the production and consumption of alternative protein sources that can reproduce “<a href="https://www.dupontnutritionandbiosciences.com/product-range/protein/soy-protein-applications/meat-applications.html">the texture and appearance of meat fibers, and can be used to extend or replace meat or fish</a>.” <a href="https://www.dupont.com/about/sustainability/acting-on-climate/low-carbon-food-alternatives.html">DuPont pointed out that</a> “in 2016, Americans consumed about 26 kg of beef per capita, at least half of which was eaten in the form of a hamburger. Replacing just half of America’s burger meat with SUPRO® MAX protein,” which has <a href="https://www.dupontnutritionandbiosciences.com/product-range/protein/soy-protein-applications/meat-alternatives.html">a carbon footprint that is up to eighty times lower than dairy and meat proteins</a>, is equivalent removing “<a href="https://www.dupontnutritionandbiosciences.com/product-range/protein/soy-protein-applications/meat-alternatives.html">more than 15 million mid-sized cars from the road</a>.”</p>
<p>Some of the world’s most powerful multinational agrichemical corporations have benefitted immensely from international trade agreements that put their interests ahead of those of small- and medium-size farms, as well as the masses, when it comes to transforming the food and agriculture sectors. In particular, the World Trade Organization’s agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS), which was adopted in 1994, played a major role in destroying the livelihoods of many farmers, while proving lucrative to agrichemical giants like BASF, Bayer, Dow Chemical, DuPont, and Syngenta. This is mainly because TRIPS has allowed for the patenting of seeds and plants.</p>
<p>As a result, native herbs and plants in a number of different countries, many of which had previously been farmed for generations, became the sole properties of powerful agrichemical multinational corporations. After plants and herbs have been patented, local farmers are forbidden from engaging in the traditional and longstanding practices of saving and replanting their own seeds. Instead, they are required to pay the patent holding corporations for the same seeds that they had previously produced, saved, replanted, and exchanged at no cost.</p>
<p>Powerful agrichemical multinational corporations have also furthered their own interests and agendas by exerting unprecedented influence over research and development in the food industry, while ignoring any findings demonstrating that their business practices were harmful to the natural environment. In particular, some of these major agrichemical corporations have <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=TlQMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Rise+of+Neo-liberalism+and+the+Decline+of+Freedom&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx7riD5Y37AhUGKlkFHRayDC0QuwV6BAgNEAc">focused</a> their efforts and resources on studying “genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the creation of stronger pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, and defending the performance of these products.”</p>
<p>They have also <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=TlQMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Rise+of+Neo-liberalism+and+the+Decline+of+Freedom&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx7riD5Y37AhUGKlkFHRayDC0QuwV6BAgNEAc">supported</a> the expansion of GMO crops with the knowledge that their cultivation involves “the application of larger quantities” of “synthetic fertilizers and pesticides,” which has led to large amounts of toxic chemicals contaminating soil and water sources. Basically, these agrichemical corporations have been largely responsible for creating many of same environmental problems that they now claim need to be urgently solved through Agenda 2030.</p>
<p>There is a real possibility that the radical and large-scale transformations of the entire food industry and human eating habits being pushed by the social engineers of Agenda 2030 are leading the masses toward a dramatic decrease in living standards. Lessons from the totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century revealed that it is very difficult to fix big mistakes attributed to the large-scale central planning of social engineers, because doing so often requires “major social transformation” or the “remodelling the whole of society,” which can result in widespread unforeseen consequences or events, major destructive outcomes, and “inconvenience to many people,” in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Fc03vC5k7BgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Poverty+of+Historicism&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi21d705Y37AhUmEFkFHaciAe4QuwV6BAgQEAc">words</a> of Karl R. Popper.</p>
<p>The intense and coordinated international effort to facilitate an artificially designed transformation of the global food industry, based on Agenda 2030, is a testimony to the fact that we are witnessing the pendulum of civilization swinging back in many advanced societies, where striving to achieve a comfortable life could rapidly be replaced by a struggle for bare necessities in a lower level of existence, which is not supposed to occur in advanced societies.</p>
<p>The masses need to be made to realize that the social engineers of Agenda 2030 are “false prophets,” who are misguiding them to the point where they will be “haunted by the specter of death from starvation.” This may well lead to the emergence of “irreconcilable dissensions within society,” whereby food riots, conflicts, and violence could inevitably “result in a complete disintegration of all societal bonds,” as Ludwig von Mises <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Human%20Action_3.pdf">put it</a>.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[The Number of Employed Workers Fell in October and Price Inflation Continues to Outpace Wages]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60886</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>In another sign of weakness for the job market, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CE16OV#0">total number of employed persons in the United States fell</a>, month over month, in October. That's the third time in the last seven months this total has fallen, dropping to approximately 158 million.</p>
<p>According to new employment data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday, the current population survey shows 328,000 fewer people were employed in October than in September, seasonally adjusted. </p>
<div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption"><a href="https://cdn.mises.org/household1_0.jpg" title="household" class="colorbox" data-colorbox-gallery="gallery-all-ecAHZko3P2E" data-cbox-img-attrs="{"title": "", "alt": "household"}"><img class="media-element file-image-no-caption" data-delta="2" alt="household" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://cdn.mises.org/styles/max_1160/s3/household1_0.jpg?itok=HXUc37ni" width="1160" height="621" title="" /></a></div>
<p>This continues a seven-month trend in which the total number of employed persons has moved sideways. From March 2022 to October, total employed persons has only increased by 150,000 people, rising from about 158.45 million to 158.6 million. With October's drop, this also puts total employment in October below the peak of 158.8 million in February 2020. In other words, the household survey shows there are fewer employed people now than before the Covid Panic. </p>
<p>Moreover, the household survey also showed that the total number of<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNEMPLOY"> unemployed workers increased</a> by approximately 250,000 people from September to October. That's an 8-month high. </p>
<p>The decline in total employed was driven by a fall in <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12500000#0">full-time workers</a>. The survey shows that in October full-time workers dropped by 433,000 while <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12600000#0">part-time workers</a> increased by 164,000. </p>
<p>Yet, the headlines in the business press today told us that "U.S. payrolls grew by 261,000 October" and that "total employment" is now 800,000 jobs above the February 2020 peak. </p>
<p>Those numbers come from the "establishment survey" which differs from the household survey in that the establishment survey measures jobs. The household survey measures workers. Historically, the two numbers often track together, but there is a sizable gap between the two numbers in recent months. That is, since January, total jobs has grown considerably—showing an increase of 3.5 million jobs. Yet over that same time, the household survey has shown an increase of only 1.4 million employed persons. In other words, the two surveys together suggest much more growth in jobs than actual workers <em>with</em> jobs. </p>
<div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption"><a href="https://cdn.mises.org/household2.png" title="household" class="colorbox" data-colorbox-gallery="gallery-all-ecAHZko3P2E" data-cbox-img-attrs="{"title": "", "alt": "household"}"><img class="media-element file-image-no-caption" data-delta="3" alt="household" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://cdn.mises.org/styles/max_1160/s3/household2.png?itok=7OkhGUBm" width="1160" height="596" title="" /></a></div>
<p>One conclusion we can draw here is that more people are working second jobs to make ends meet. This would make sense given what other information we have about the state of household finances at the moment. </p>
<p>For example, according to the bureau of economic analysis, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DSPIC96">disposable income</a> is lower now than it was before the Covid Panic, coming in at $15,130. That sum was $15,232 during February of 2020. Meanwhile, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT">the personal savings rate</a> in September fell to 3.1 percent. That's the second-lowest level since 2007. Credit card debt, in contrast,<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CCLACBW027SBOG"> reached new highs</a> in September, and is now well above its previous 2020 peak. </p>
<p>Workers and consumers are likely spending down whatever savings they have because wages, in spite of what the allegedly "robust" establishment-survey jobs numbers say, are not keeping up with price inflation. Since April 2021, CPI inflation has repeatedly outpaced growth in average hourly earnings, year-over-year. In September, wages grew by 5.12 percent, but the CPI grew by 8.2 percent (year over year). The latest jobs numbers show these hourly earnings are up by 4.86, but price inflation is going to have to come down a very long way for real wage growth to materialize again. </p>
<div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption"><a href="https://cdn.mises.org/household3.jpg" title="household" class="colorbox" data-colorbox-gallery="gallery-all-ecAHZko3P2E" data-cbox-img-attrs="{"title": "", "alt": "household"}"><img class="media-element file-image-no-caption" data-delta="4" alt="household" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://cdn.mises.org/styles/max_1160/s3/household3.jpg?itok=5Eem6Biw" width="1160" height="593" title="" /></a></div>
<p>All of this combines to suggest that households are facing some real struggles in terms of dealing with rising expenses, and the need for more income. For example, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/more-americans-live-paycheck-to-paycheck-as-inflation-outpaces-income.html">reported</a> last month that more Americans are living paycheck to paycheck:</p>
<blockquote><p>As rising prices continue to outpace wage gains, families are finding less cushion in their monthly budget.</p>
<p>As of September, 63% of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, according to a recent <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/reality-check-paycheck-to-paycheck-inflation-consumer-spend-expenses/" target="_blank">LendingClub report</a> — near the 64% historic high hit in March. A year ago, the number of adults who felt strained was closer to 57%. ...</p>
<p>“Being employed is no longer enough for the everyday American,” [Anuj] Nayar said. “Wage growth has been inadequate, leaving more consumers than ever with little to nothing left over after managing monthly expenses.</p></blockquote>
<p>A recent <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/20/inflation-costing-americans-445-more-in-expenses-per-month/">study from Moody's analytics</a> also concludes that the average American household paid $445 more for basic goods and services in September, compared to September of last year. </p>
<p>Nor is the news likely to get much better. There is growing evidence that the United States—if not already in recession—is headed toward one. For one, the first two quarters of 2022 showed negative growth. The third quarter showed some growth, but that was largely driven by a one-time narrowing in the trade deficit and by government spending. Even with reports of third-quarter growth, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/us-gdp-accelerated-at-2point6percent-pace-in-q3-better-than-expected-as-growth-turns-positive.html">CNBC admits</a> that a recession is coming with economist Paul Ashworth concluding “Exports will soon fade and domestic demand is getting crushed under the weight of higher interest rates."</p>
<p>The other big factor pointing toward recession is the yield curve, which has now inverted, pointing to a coming recession. In fact, inversions in the yield curve have a perfect record of predicting recessions in recent decades. As of last week, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M#0">the spread between the 10-year and the 3-month Treasurys is now negative</a>. The same thing happened in May of 2019, July of 2006, and July of 2000. There can be a lag of six months or more in these cases, but the result has been the same: recession. </p>
<p>The Biden Administration and the Federal Reserve both continue to cling to jobs data as evidence that the economy is "strong." As we've seen, though, most of the employment data actually points to stagnation or even losses in terms of employed persons. So, the the-economy-is-great crowd clings to the small slice of the employment data that is the establishment survey suggesting that all is well. If there is an upside to this, it's that the job-growth-is-strong narrative has provided some cover to the Federal Reserve which is far, far behind the curve on ending its inflationary easy-money policies. Thanks to the Fed's refusal to reverse course on its ultra-low interest rate policy until the economy was already clearly headed toward 40-year highs in price inflation, the Fed now faces a stagflationary crisis if it cannot get price inflation down before a recession becomes obvious. After all, as the jobs data becomes worse, this will increasingly trigger an avalanche of political pressure to "pivot" and start "stimulating" the economy once again. </p>
<p>There's no telling at this point if the Fed has the stomach for actually bringing price inflation down and truly abandoning its 13-year long era of ultra-easy money and so-called unconventional monetary policy. It's far more likely that the Fed will return to suppressing interest rates just as soon as it can claim any sort of "victory" over price inflation, no matter how minor. This aborted retreat from the Fed's ongoing inflationary experiments would likely send the US toward something at least as bad as 1970's-style stagflation.  </p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Facts and Data Have No Meaning without a Theory to Explain Them]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60746</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Many economists, including Milton Friedman, have believed that since it is impossible to establish “how things really work,” the underlying assumptions of a model are unimportant. Anything goes provided the model can yield good predictions. Friedman <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Fv8846OSbvwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Essays+in+Positive+Economics&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1y9zUro37AhWHFVkFHX87ACkQuwV6BAgNEAc">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ultimate goal of a positive science is the development of a theory or hypothesis that yields valid and meaningful (i.e., not truistic) predictions about phenomena not yet observed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Fv8846OSbvwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Essays+in+Positive+Economics&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1y9zUro37AhWHFVkFHX87ACkQuwV6BAgNEAc">according to</a> Friedman:</p>
<blockquote><p>The relevant question to ask about the assumptions of a theory is not whether they are descriptively realistic, for they never are, but whether they are sufficiently good approximation for the purpose in hand. And this question can be answered only by seeing whether the theory works, which means whether it yields sufficiently accurate predictions.</p></blockquote>
<p>For Friedman, since reality is likely to be elusive our knowledge of it is tentative—one cannot know true nature. Also, Friedman and most mainstream economists believe the state of the economy is derived from the data. By inspecting the data, such as the gross domestic product or the consumer price index, the analyst forms a view regarding the likely state of economic conditions.</p>
<p>Ludwig von Mises held a different view, <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Human%20Action_3.pdf">writing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The arrangement of various price data in groups and the computation of averages are guided by theoretical deliberations, which are logically and temporally antecedent.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Human%20Action_3.pdf">Moreover</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is vain to search for coefficients of correlation if one does not start from a theoretical insight acquired beforehand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mises believed that data is a historical display and by itself cannot provide the analyst with an explanation of the real world. He <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Human%20Action_3.pdf">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Experience of economic history is always the experience of complex phenomena. It can never convey knowledge of the kind the experimenter abstracts from a laboratory experiment.</p></blockquote>
<p>To make sense of the data an economist must have a theory which stands on its own feet and does not originate from the data itself. The key point is that it must originate from something real that cannot be refuted. A theory that rests on the foundation that human beings act consciously and purposefully fulfils this, since human beings act consciously and purposefully (anyone that tries to refute this point <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Economic%20Science%20and%20the%20Austrian%20Method_3.pdf">consciously and purposefully contradicts himself</a>).</p>
<p>Ludwig von Mises labelled this framework as praxeology. By means of praxeology, Mises was able to derive the entire body of economics. The <a href="HYPERLINK%20%22https:/mises.org/library/theory-and-history-interpretation-social-and-economic-evolution%22">knowledge</a> that human actions are conscious and purposeful allows an analyst to make sense of historical data.</p>
<h4>The Importance of Defining the Subject of Investigation</h4>
<p>The key to understanding data is to establish the subject of analysis. Once the subject is established, the next step is to define the subject. The purpose of the definition is to determine the key factors determining the subject of the investigation.</p>
<p>To establish a definition, one should go back to the point of time when a particular thing has emerged. For example, when analyzing money supply, we would go back to when a particular commodity <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7syA3yAPsNkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Ayn+Rand+Lexicon&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjh1M-tr437AhXvKlkFHZdEAS8QuwV6BAgFEAc">began to assume the role of money</a>. In this case, one would ascertain that individuals originally used money to promote the trade of goods for goods.</p>
<p>A commodity that was selected as money enabled the most efficient exchange. By ascertaining the medium of the exchange, we establish that individuals are paying for one good with another good, aided by money.</p>
<p>We can also establish that increases in the quantity of money—i.e., inflation of money generates a decrease in the purchasing power of money, all other things being equal. This is because increases in the money supply result in a greater amount of money per unit of a good than in the previous situation, all other things being equal, since the price of a good is the amount of money per unit of a good. Hence, from an increase in the money supply, one can infer that, all other things being equal, more money will be spent per good—i.e., prices of goods are going to increase—and a decline in the money’s purchasing power will emerge.</p>
<p>Without defining what price is, it will not be possible to say anything meaningful about the key cause of the increase in the prices of goods, which is the increase in money supply. The definition that money is the medium of exchange enables us to establish that once money is injected there are always early and late recipients of money. This. In turn, enables us to infer that a change in the money supply is likely to have a lagged effect on the prices of goods in various markets.</p>
<p>Now, without a theoretical framework the data by itself cannot tell us the conditions of the economy so to speak. It cannot tell us whether the strong GDP data is because of wealth expansion or because of the erosion of the wealth generation process.</p>
<p>Once it is established that loose monetary policies of the central bank are behind the so-called strong economic conditions, then by means of a theory, we can establish that this is going to weaken the wealth generation process. In the modern world of the paper money standard, we can ascertain that an increase in money supply results in an exchange of nothing for something. It leads to a diversion of wealth from wealth generators to non-wealth-generating activities.</p>
<p>According to the founder of the Austrian school of economics, Carl Menger, to maintain their lives and well-being, individuals <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Principles%20of%20Economics_5.pdf">will prefer present consumption to future consumption</a>. We suggest that as individual’s wealth expands, the premium assigned to present consumption over future consumption is likely to decline. The premium of present consumption over future consumption is what interest is all about.</p>
<p>A higher time preference—i.e., preferring present consumption to future consumption, implies that to stay alive individuals have to assign a higher premium to present consumer goods versus the future consumer goods. From this, we can also establish that only individuals’ time preferences determine interest rates, as opposed to central bank policies. Central bank policies can only distort interest rates thus setting in motion boom-bust cycles and economic impoverishment. Also, note that the positive time preference implies that interest rates must be positive.</p>
<p>The fact that an individual pursues purposeful actions implies that causes in the world of economics emanate from human beings and not from outside factors. This means that mathematical methods will not be helpful.</p>
<p>For instance, contrary to popular thinking, individual outlays on goods are not caused by real income as such. In his own unique context, every individual decides how much of a given income will be used for consumption and how much for investments.</p>
<p>While it is true that individuals will respond to changes in their incomes, the response is not automatic. Every individual assesses the increase in income against the particular set of goals he wants to achieve. He might decide that it is more beneficial to him to raise his investment in financial assets rather than to raise consumption.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Reliance on statistical data as a foundation for evaluating the economy is questionable. Statistical data cannot produce much information about the facts of reality without a theory that “stands on its own feet” and is not derived from the data. Once the theory passed the logical test it becomes the tool for the establishing the facts of reality through the assessment of the data.</p>
<p>Theory also permits us to ascertain the reasons for discrepancies between the data and what the theory supposes. For instance, according to the economic theory, individuals assign a greater importance to consumption at present versus consumption in the future, something we established earlier.</p>
<p>According to theory, interest rates cannot be negative. If, however, we do observe negative rates, this does not contradict the theory but rather forces the analyst to ponder how this could have happened. Most likely, he will discover that central bank monetary policies have forced this on the economy.</p>
<p>Various mathematical and statistical methods cannot assist an analyst in establishing causes in the world of economics. All that these methods can do is to describe things. To ascertain the underlying causes, one requires a logically worked out theory.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[You Don’t Know What’s Good for You]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60839</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>In last week’s column, I mentioned that regulation of drugs was among the important subjects Andrew Koppelman discusses in his thoughtful book <em>Burning Down the House</em>, and this week I’d like to look at what he has to say on this topic.</p>
<p>To understand his arguments, though, what he says needs to be put in a wider philosophical framework. As he sees it, both libertarians and nonlibertarians like him share a goal. Both have as an ideal the notion of human autonomy. As he puts it,</p>
<blockquote><p>People need all-purpose means to pursue their own aspirations. If they have those means, then they don’t need to justify themselves to anyone else. They are free to develop what they regard as best in themselves. This ideal of authenticity is common ground between large parts of both the political left and right. Our disagreements turn on how to realize it. That insistence on personal autonomy translates easily into rights talk. (pp. 108–09; Koppelman takes “authenticity” and “autonomy” to be in this context synonymous)</p></blockquote>
<p>Koppelman is right that many people wish to promote autonomy in this sense, but Rothbard and his followers are not among them. It is not that they deem autonomy a bad idea, but rather one that stands apart from political philosophy. The aim of politics is, in the Rothbardian view, to promote liberty, meaning securing the lives and property of people against force and the threat of force, rather than enabling people to live a certain kind of life. Thus, if you are content to live your life in lassitude, drifting from one thing to another, or if you live unreflectively following customs that Koppelman and his colleagues deem narrow and bigoted, Rothbardian political philosophy has nothing to say against you.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to show how this difference between Koppelman and Rothbard leads to divergent views on drug regulation, I will digress to note a poor argument having to do with autonomy that Koppelman advances. He says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Moreover, if the value of property is that it gives individuals independence and autonomy, then this function is nicely performed by streams of government-generated income, such as Social Security and Medicare. Abolishing those, as many libertarians propose, would be a disaster not only for liberty but for property as well, depriving millions of what they had worked for. Libertarian philosophy perversely threatens to destroy what it most cares about. (p. 18)</p></blockquote>
<p>But it does not follow that if Social Security has the same value, or the same function, as property, then it <em>is</em> property. My security blanket may, like my service dog, relieve my anxiety, but it would be rash to conclude that my blanket is a dog.</p>
<p>Once you understand what Koppelman means by autonomy, his position on drug regulation is easy to understand. He remarks,</p>
<blockquote><p>Libertarianism aims for a society of rational, self-governing agents. But we know that, a lot of the time, people do not and cannot measure up to this ideal. People are imperfectly rational. They are subject to systemic emotional and cognitive biases: overconfidence, poor risk assessment, inertia. A lot of decisions are the product not of rational deliberation but of default rules, framing effects, and other ways in which the human mind arrives at decisions unconsciously. (p. 160)</p></blockquote>
<p>This may well be true, but Rothbardians think that the individual ought to be free to make his own decisions on taking drugs, so long as he violates no one’s rights. Koppelman acknowledges that the libertarian view has some weight, but in doing so, he shows that he hasn’t fully grasped what is at stake. He says,</p>
<blockquote><p>All liberals, libertarians and Rawlsians alike, think that we each have the right to direct our own lives, and that we have a duty to respect one another by not interfering in others’ choices about what ends to pursue. The ideal is powerful and attractive. Its possibility depends, however, on the existence of selves of the right kind: self-governing agents who really do make choices about what ends to pursue. When a person is incapable of making such choices, such non-manipulative relations are impossible. That is why it is appropriate to paternalize children. Since the purpose of liberal rights is to allow persons to exercise their moral and rational powers, liberalism requires that persons develop those powers to some minimum degree. (pp. 158–59)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s understandable that Koppelman is attached to his conception of autonomous choice, but one would hope him capable of realizing that some people do not accept it.</p>
<p>Given his emphasis on autonomy, Koppelman responds to a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=615562">proposal</a> about drug regulation by the legal academic Gregory Mitchell in a strange way. Mitchell suggests that people should be encouraged to engage in greater self-reflection about their choices. Koppelman objects:</p>
<blockquote><p>With respect to a great many decisions that affect our lives, we do not <em>want</em> to engage in greater reflection. That demands time that we can’t spare. We want to pursue the projects that matter most to us, and delegate other decisions to someone else. Forcing us to deliberate about everything (or more precisely, attempting to force the impossible) is its own form of officious paternalism. It is in fact totalitarian: rather than block a single option, which would be bad enough, it dictates how we are to spend our time and direct our attention. (p. 161, emphasis in original)</p></blockquote>
<p>Koppelman is correct that people shouldn’t be forced to engage in deliberation, but it’s odd for someone who says, “You shouldn’t be free to take dangerous drugs whenever you choose, because you’re not an autonomous chooser” to say also, “You should be free to let the state make choices for you about which drugs to take, because thinking about this is too much trouble for you.”</p>
<p>As Koppelman notes, one argument against drug restriction is that this leads to other measures that restrict liberty. Koppelman answers that this need not happen. “It is possible to restrict substances without today’s orgy of mass incarceration. If the aim is reducing consumption, diminishing returns set in very quickly. During Prohibition, alcohol consumption dropped by between 33 and 50 percent, even though nearly nothing was spent on enforcement” (p. 158). Koppelman appears unaware that Prohibition led to grave violations of civil liberties, such as the use of wiretapping and the destruction of property, ably analyzed by the historian and sociologist Harry Elmer Barnes in <em>Prohibition versus Civilization</em> (1932) and in the contemporary classic by Mark Thornton, <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Economics%20of%20Prohibition_2.pdf"><em>The Economics of Prohibition</em></a> (1991).</p>
<p>Patrick Henry said, “Give me liberty or give me death,” not “Give me autonomy or give me death,” and he was wise in his choice of words.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[In Government-Regulated Healthcare, There Is No Competition Like No Competition]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60745</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine you are a young, idealistic doctor. After some years in clinical practice at a private hospital you tire of the fact that more of your time is spent filling out forms and attending staff meeting than with your patients. You went to medical school all bright eyed with the dream of making a good living making a difference. You ran the gauntlet during your residency, sometimes working ninety-hour weeks, skipping meals and even showers so you would have more free time to study, because you believed in the end it would all be worth it.</p>
<p>In some ways it is, there are times you love your job—but you are also disillusioned by the fact that you barely get time to really know your patients and give them the quality of care you think could really help them thrive. Speaking to some of your former classmates you notice you’re not the only one feeling the way. You meet a few other idealists at continuing medical education conferences and together, you decide you want to branch out together and create your own little hospital, employing staff that agree with your ethos and want to offer the quality of care that patients deserve. You dream that perhaps your little project with serve as a model to the world of how healthcare can be done, and people will start copying it.</p>
<p>After taking some months off work to plan your little benevolent social enterprise, you and your cofounders discover that opening a new hospital is harder than you thought it would be. For one thing, you find out that in your state (as in most states) if you want to open a hospital you are obligated to obtain a “certificate of need” from the government to open a hospital. You have to present yourself before an official board and <em>prove</em> that your community “needs” another hospital, and that you are willing and able to fund it all by yourself.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t bad enough—the people on the board include senior administrators from already existing hospitals in the area, and they want the competition from you about as much as a gunshot to the head! You think to yourself: “Imagine I wanted to open up a café, but I needed permission from the local Starbucks and Tim Horton’s!”</p>
<p>In addition to that, <em>Obamacare</em><em>,</em> passed in 2010, prevents government payments to any hospitals owned by doctors! This puts you at another unfair advantage compared to the existing commercial hospitals in your area who are taking Medicare and Medicaid patients. You are willing to persist though, because you’re an idealist, and you’re starting to think it might not be too great taking government money anyway as this often leads to overtreatment, corruption, and strings attached.</p>
<p>You had the great idea of training your own assistant-technicians on the site to take runaway tasks off the hands of your physicians and save patients money. You soon discovered that you weren’t allowed to train anyone to do anything unless they were fully licensed and qualified to do it at college already—even if these little tasks would only really take a few weeks or months of training.</p>
<p>So there goes your idea of avoiding excessive staff meetings and form filling. You and your specialized colleagues (who also must run the damn hospital) want to tend to severe cases that you were highly trained for. But you are forced to spend lots of time attending to patients with relatively trivial complaints, because no one else is allowed to do it. (See the chapter <em>Getting Schooled </em>for full details.)</p>
<p>You dreamed of offering mentorship programs to college graduates, thinking employing young doctors would keep staff costs down for patients and help graduates get a good start, but because there are so few medical schools due to government restrictions on building them, you found it extremely hard to compete with more commercial hospitals when it came to recruiting new talent. And because medical education is so expensive, and all these graduates were six figures in debt, they expected to be paid handsomely from the off so they could get their finances back in the black as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>You thought you could attract custom by charging patients and private insurance companies more fairly, but you just never counted on how much money would have to go to administrators, lawyers, actuaries, and other bureaucrats just to make sure that you were fully in compliance with all the reams and reams of government regulations your hospital had to conform to. From what you could tell, the vast majority of these did less than nothing to protect patients or improve the quality of care they received.</p>
<p>But they did mean you had to charge their insurance companies more to cover the cost of extra cost of staff, plus you had to dictate endless numbers of letters and reports to stenographers to keep records so you couldn’t be sued for anything. On that point, you were paying out huge sums of money to insuring yourself, your practice, your hospital, and all your colleagues against malpractice suits. The cost of all that also had to be passed on to patients. All this was clearly pushing the price of provision through the roof.</p>
<p>Sometimes patients without insurance simply did not pay, and you had to absorb the cost of uncompensated care. There was nothing the state could (or were willing) to do about it—you just had to suck it up and charge other patients more to recoup the costs.</p>
<p>The government <em>forced </em>you to keep open arms of the hospital that were unprofitable, and you ended up having to compensate for the losses by overcharging in other areas. You ended up investing in unnecessary imaging equipment because running patients through tests always prove to be very profitable. You sometimes suspected that patients were being ran through some of these tests because your colleagues just liked your fancy new gadgets, but the insurance was happy to pay, so you never bothered to ask about it or set a policy to prevent these tests being used unnecessarily.</p>
<p>You also found yourself forced to open a cancer care department, orthopedic surgery center, and neurosurgery center because those always made a profit, but in order to staff them you had to find specialists that didn’t fully understand the ethos of your original project, and—frankly—by this point, it was pretty hard impressing that ethos upon anyone, because your hospital was starting to look rather like all the other commercial hospital did.</p>
<p>These are only some of the ways that the government limits competition in the medical sphere, driving the price of healthcare through the roof in the United States.</p>
<p>They could be remedied with some embarrassingly simple policy changes:</p>
<p>1) Abolish certificate of need restrictions on the building of private hospitals.</p>
<p>2) Abolish restrictions on the opening of new medical schools including removing laws which limit some states to only having one.</p>
<p>3) Allow doctors, clinics, and hospitals to train and certify their own assistants to allow lower-wage trainees to take responsibilities off the hands of highly specialized staff.</p>
<p>4) Relax liability standards on professionals particularly when they are acting in a voluntary capacity.</p>
<p>5) Reduce red tape so fewer resources have to be spent on administrators and bureaucrats rather than medical staff, and so that physicians need to spend less time on paperwork, electronic record keeping, and desk work.</p>
<p>6) Tackle the five major causes of waste in American medical expenditure, as identified by former Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Dr. Donald Berwick: overtreatment, failure to coordinate care, the administrative complexity of the system, burdensome rules, and fraud.</p>
<p>7) Tackle the problem of governments and insurance companies paying for unnecessary and wasteful tests, treatments, and procedures.</p>
<p>8) Remove the legal requirement for hospitals to keep unprofitable departments open.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[How the Soviets "Fixed" Inflation, but Ruined the Economy]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60844</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Price inflation and the resulting business cycles are monetary phenomena, and without increases in the money supply—i.e., monetary inflation—<a href="https://mises.org/wire/shortages-arent-causing-inflation-money-creation">there is no price inflation</a>. If the world were a very simple place, we would see this relationship clearly displayed: when the money supply increased, we would also see a general increase in prices soon thereafter. The world, however, is not a very simple place and an economy can include countless factors that can mask, delay, and otherwise obscure the connection between monetary inflation and price inflation. </p>
<p>For example, monetary policymakers in the US have long benefited from the disinflationary effects of global trade and increasing worker productivity. This means that, for decades, consumers <em>should</em> have seen prices of most goods and services falling. Instead, relentless monetary inflation over the past three decades has resulted in <em>positive</em> price growth that is seemingly mild, and policymakers can claim victory over inflation. Moreover, new money can enter the economy in a variety of ways, often manifesting as asset-price inflation rather than as noticeably high price increases in food or household goods. </p>
<p>Governments also have many tools at their disposal to delay or hide the effects of monetary inflation, sometimes for many years. Price controls and subsidies, for example, can obscure the true costs of goods and services for the end consumer. These tactics cause shortages, bubbles, and other problems, but these can often be blamed on "greed" or "capitalism." </p>
<p>One particularly interesting case of how governments can hide price inflation for <em>decades</em> is the Soviet Union. Under the Soviet regime, the money supply—denominated in unbacked fiat money, of course—was continually expanded to increase wages and create the impression of prosperity. This <em>would </em>have led to price inflation quickly, but for the shortage economy and demand-killing government policies endured by the average Soviet citizen. As is so often the case, the regime was able to cover up the effects of inflation for a time, but the policies ultimately proved to be disastrous. </p>
<h4>Preventing Inflation through State Control of the Economy</h4>
<p>As a regime increases the money supply, demand will generally rise. But rising prices will become acute only if there are actually products and services on which consumers and enterprises can spend their new money. Thus, a regime wishing to avoid price inflation can keep increasing the money supply so long as it also reduces demand by limiting the availability of goods. This prevents improvements in the standard of living, but it can indeed keep down price inflation. </p>
<p>This cannot be easily done in a country where the population expects to live under a relatively free economy. In an unhampered or partially interventionist economy, a lack of widespread price controls often means a large number of goods and services will continue to be supplied, albeit at higher prices, in an inflationary environment. But, because the USSR oversees a heavily controlled, command economy, the regime could more easily dictate prices, limit imports, and force consumers to save rather than spend.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, by the late 1980s, the regime was forced to "open up" its economy to market forces as a restive population increasingly demanded a standard of living more in line with what existed in the West. However, once the regime ceased controlling prices and savings, prices exploded, government revenues cratered, and the Soviet regime ended its days in an orgy of money printing and hyperinflation. </p>
<h4>How the Soviet Regime Manipulated Price Inflation</h4>
<p>The fact that the Soviet regime preferred shortages to inflation has its roots in the hyperinflationary history of the Soviet economy. By the middle of the twentieth century, Soviet planners were already well aware of the dangers of hyperinflation. With the end of the czarist regime, and the cessation of the First World War, the new socialist regime took over a country that was already broke and highly dysfunctional. Hyperinflation soon followed. The Bolsheviks attempted to do away with money altogether, but this naturally failed, and a number of monetary reforms followed. By the late 1920s, however, the regime was engaging in widespread price control efforts, including the highly unusual tactic of peacetime rationing. This limited price inflation for many goods and set the stage for the "repressed inflation" that would become a mainstay of the Soviet system for decades. Prices nevertheless began to rise rapidly in many areas, and the Second World War brought on a new wave of price inflation and prices spiraled upward. This was followed by another currency reform—i.e., devaluation—of the Soviet ruble in 1947. Efforts at price controls were redoubled and overall prices actually declined during the 1950s. </p>
<p>Throughout much of the 1950s and early sixties, the regime was perennially concerned about price inflation. In fact, Soviet ideology stipulated that inflation did not actually exist in the USSR. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/rfd/1962/386/rfd386.pdf">As claimed by</a> Vasily Garbuzov, the Soviet Minister of Finance in 1960:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the Soviet Union there is not and cannot be any inflation; the possibility of inflation is fully precluded by the very system of planned socialist economy. In our country both wholesale and retail prices are established by the government and, therefore, the purchasing power of the ruble is controlled on a planned basis. ...The stability of Soviet currency is guaranteed by the monopoly of currency and the monopoly of foreign trade which is one of the most important advantages of the socialist economic system.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is propaganda, of course, but in a sense, Garbuzov was right. A socialist state really <em>could</em> moderate the price effects of monetary inflation by throttling back the standard of living and consumption options whenever it seemed prices were rising.</p>
<p>This was necessary because the money supply continually expanded as wages rose. In <a href="https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy2.library.colostate.edu/stable/151563#metadata_info_tab_contents">their 1985 study on the Soviet economy</a>, Igor Birman and Roger Clarke wrote: </p>
<blockquote><p>The reason for the excess supply of money is that the state has consistently 'over-paid' the population in the form of wages, pensions, stipends etc., which exceed production (plus net imports and minus net exports) of consumer goods at the currently ruling retail prices (fixed by the state). While there has indeed been a steady rise in retail prices (despite the stability of the official index) this has been very far from sufficient to equalise the real effective demand of the population with the available supply of goods. In other words, the state generates excessive purchasing power in the hands of the population.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an unhampered economy wages are closely tied to the productivity of workers, so wages would not grow out of proportion to the amount of goods and services available in the economy. In a socialist, economy, however, the price of labor—i.e., wages—were arbitrarily set like all other prices. Wages under socialism are also paid out of the public treasury and can be increased to the liking of the regime itself. This often meant rising wages because higher wages were politically popular. Rising wages potentially created the impression of prosperity, even when the economy wasn't actually more productive. Also, as Birman and Clarke note</p>
<blockquote><p>During the last two decades [i.e., 1965 to 1985] it has pursued the 'confidence trick' policy of trying to stimulate productivity by higher money wages without raising the supply of consumer goods by nearly sufficient to translate the increase in money wages into increased real incomes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Increasingly, after 1965, the Soviet money supply was out of proportion to the productive capability of the economy. In a relatively free economy, this would quickly lead to price inflation, but the Soviet regime had ways of shifting the economic burden elsewhere. </p>
<p>Thus, prices were kept under control not through fiscal disciple, but through price controls. This led to shortages because, if wages were rising while goods prices could not, demand quickly exceeded supply. Soviet citizens often found they had very little to spend their money <em>on</em>, with the result being the long queues and empty store shelves we now associate with the Soviet economy. </p>
<p>By this mechanism, the regime can continue to inject new money into the economy but also prevent ordinary people from spending "too much" money and thus ratcheting up consumer prices. The downside, of course, is that the standard of living goes down considerably, as <a href="https://dc.etsu.edu/etd/1474/">historian Steven Efremov notes</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The system of price controls had deleterious effects both for Soviet consumers and for the economy as a whole. ... Shortages of most foods led to lower quality diets, and many consumer products that were routinely available in the West, such as telephones, cars, and modern washing machines were amazingly rare in the Soviet Union. Living conditions were less comfortable in many ways, with less housing space per person, no central heating, no air conditioning, and often no sewer connections or hot water. </p></blockquote>
<p>The result was essentially forced savings. Efremov continues: </p>
<blockquote><p>When consumers could not find anything they wanted to buy, many chose to save a portion of their income every year. This effect was cumulative over the years, as unsatisfied demand from each year was carried over to the next and the population's savings continued to grow.</p></blockquote>
<p>In some respects, this was good for the regime because this unspendable savings could also be tapped for buying the government's debt. But this stored up money—known as the "monetary overhang" increased much more rapidly than did the production of goods and services, and Efremov concludes "the money supply had grown to become many times larger than what was needed for regular circulation." This would come back to haunt the regime when the economy began to open up and consumers could finally spend the money, causing prices to soar. </p>
<p>An additional method of pushing down official inflation numbers was to subsidize consumer goods. Retail price subsidies were introduced in in the Soviet Union in 1965 as part of a major economic reform package. Soviet authorities then began to implement price subsidies of "basic foods such as meat, milk, bread, sausages, sugar, and butter."<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref1_fy92e3f" title="Byung-Yeon Kim, "Causes of Repressed Inflation in the Soviet Consumer Market, 1965-1989: Retail Price Subsidies, the Siphoning Effect, and the Budget Deficit," The Economic History Review 55, no. 1 (Feb. 2002):108" href="#footnote1_fy92e3f">1</a> The purpose was to keep prices stable. These subsidies survived subsequent economic reform efforts and became a larger and larger part of the economy heading into the 1980s, with government spending rapidly increasing to push down prices through subsidies.</p>
<h4>Spending Rises and the Economy Stagnates </h4>
<p>None of this worked to actually help the Soviet standard of living. </p>
<p>To combat the effects of monetary expansion and falling standards of living, the Soviet regime perennially attempted to increase production to narrow the gap between money growth and productivity growth. Due to the impossibility of economic calculation under socialism, however, Soviet central planning could not coordinate goods and capital efficiently, and the productivity of workers stagnated. </p>
<p>Another result was further declines in government revenue. Although taxes were levied and some revenue could be collected on imports, government monopolies—i.e., government-owned enterprises—controlling a variety of goods and services produced much of the income the regime relied on. These enterprises could theoretically increase revenues with increased output, but output often stagnated as wages—i.e., production costs—rose.</p>
<p>Government budgets thus increased alongside falling revenue. Byung-Yeon Kim notes, for example, that "retail price subsidies ... rose from 4 per cent of state budget expenditure in 1965 to 20 per cent in the late 1980s."<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref2_r3wi31h" title="Ibid., p. 106" href="#footnote2_r3wi31h">2</a> </p>
<p>Yet, the availability of consumer goods certainly did not keep up. Rather, consumer had few places to spend their money and "the share of forced savings in total monetary savings increased from 9 per cent in 1965 to 42 per cent in 1989."<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref3_pcn5by4" title="Ibid." href="#footnote3_pcn5by4">3</a></p>
<p>Measured by the prevalence of shortages, it is clear the Soviet economy was in a state of stagnation by the late 70s. Shortages became even worse. Kim concludes: </p>
<blockquote><p>Consumer market conditions in the official retail network deteriorated rapidly in the years 1965-78. This is most likely to have been caused by stable consumer prices faced with rising consumer purchasing power. Even though the rapid deterioration halted during the period 1979-83, this was not sufficient to restore equilibrium. Further worsening of consumer market conditions occurred after 1984. In particular, shortages in the consumer market intensified significantly in 1989 because household money income increased much faster than the availability of consumer goods.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref4_gfc9637" title="Ibid., p. 115." href="#footnote4_gfc9637">4</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The wage increases continued with little positive effect. Throughout the 1980s, Soviet state-owned enterprises raised wages in an attempt to create a "wealth effect" and to placate dissatisfied workers. Yet, with few goods available to buy, rising wages ceased to be much of an inducement to harder work. Birman and Clarke <a href="https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy2.library.colostate.edu/stable/151563#metadata_info_tab_contents">note</a> that after a time, rising wages "become ineffective—additional unspendable money is no longer an incentive to work harder or more productively." Worker productivity suffered. This problem only accelerated as the decade wore on and, as Igor Filatochev and Roy Bradshaw <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09668139208412045">note</a>, "wages increas[ed] four times faster than labour productivity throughout 1989 and 1990."</p>
<h4>The 1980s: A Time of Growing Deficits and Money Printing </h4>
<p>All of this spending on wages and subsidies combined to create conditions under which government deficits rose, leading for even greater monetary expansion. Kim concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although the budget deficit was officially recorded only from 1985 onwards, many reliable Soviet and western sources have maintained that a sizable deficit already existed well before the 1980s.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref5_91s3c9l" title="Ibid., p. 115." href="#footnote5_91s3c9l">5</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Up until the 1970s, there had been a connection between revenues and spending to the point that deficits were manageable. As time went on, borrowing to address deficits became increasingly expensive for the regime, and printing money—above and beyond the need for wages—was increasingly viewed as a way out:</p>
<blockquote><p>[P]rinting of money began well before the late 1980s, that is, from 1977 onwards, and tended to increase during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Overall, the Soviet budget tended to destabilize the consumer market, at least after 1977, by putting money into circulation. In particular, a sharp increase in printing money in the late 1980s suggests that the Soviet economy was then on the verge of collapse.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref6_8hlwdt1" title="Ibid., p. 122." href="#footnote6_8hlwdt1">6</a></p></blockquote>

<h4>Hyperinflation Sets In </h4>
<p>By the late 1980s, the Soviet economy was already primed for price inflation, yet so-called repressed inflation continued to be a sizable factor pushing down official inflation rates until the mid 1980s. With the advent of perestroika and some limited promarket reforms, Soviet citizens were increasingly able to purchase more goods and import more goods. Decades of forced saving led to runaway inflation as shortages became less acute in many cases. That "monetary overhang" came out of savings accounts and drove price inflation to disastrous heights. </p>
<p>It took some time for the official numbers to catch up with reality. The regime's official numbers had long understated even the moderate levels of price inflation in earlier periods, but after the mid-80s, the gap between official inflation and estimated real inflation grew considerably. Efremov <a href="http://dc.etsu.edu/etd/1474/">summarizes</a> the divergence, noting that in 1988 official inflation was 0.6 percent but 6 percent in the <em>real </em>marketplace. By 1989, official inflation was 2 percent, but it was really 8 percent. In 1990, it was 5.3 percent, but really 20 percent. And then the wheels started to really come off in 1991, with 96.3 "official" inflation that was really 200 percent. </p>
<p>The Soviet Union collapsed shortly thereafter, and the new regime did not issue falsified inflation numbers anymore. Instead, the real inflation rate in 1992 was estimated to be more than 2,300 percent. Hyperinflation continued for three more years until the old Soviet ruble finally ceased to exist.</p>
<h4>A Socialist Guide to Lowering Price Inflation</h4>
<p>The Soviet experience provides an example of how expanding the money supply forces a choice. In response, an inflationist regime can commit to reining in monetary inflation to tackle rising prices. Or, a regime can "solve" an inflation problem by destroying demand via price controls and shortages.  The latter choice requires lowering the standard of living and gradually reducing consumer choices again and again. Yet, even this draconian option fails to prevent hyperinflation in the end.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Consumers, Workers, and Monopolies: Free Markets Serve All ]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60740</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Before beginning, I am highly grateful and impressed by the success and spread of my previous work “Consumers, Workers, and Monopolies: Free Markets Serves All.” The article aimed to give a brief explanation of the importance of consumers in Markets and it will be continued further</em>.</p>
<p>The market can be controlled either by consumers or the government. Any one of them getting greater power will reduce the power and freedom of others. The reason behind government getting more support and consumers being completely neglected is due to a fantasy called “equality.” In economics, understanding the market is very important that brings great significance to the role of consumers.</p>
<p>No mathematics or statistics can tell about consumers’ change in preferences and their source of satisfaction. The consumer himself can deal with his/her choices and hence manage their budget constraint accordingly. Mises was a critique of socialism and he disliked the fact that the consumers who pay their hard-earned money for scarce resources are completely ignored. According to Mises, no entrepreneurs, no farmers, and not even the capitalist decides what has to be produced, it is the consumers who do that.</p>
<h4>Consumers and Workers</h4>
<p>There’s a wide belief of some certain ideologists to consider themselves to be “moral” when their system failed to work in history. But how is it fair that the one spending money has to sacrifice their goods and services for someone who is charging for their work? Not giving freedom and choices to consumers in the market takes away their sovereignty and gives it to people at the top with power.</p>
<p>Without the profit motive, consumer sovereignty isn’t possible, that’s the complexity of markets which many don’t seem to understand. The entrepreneurs or businesses are going to produce as per consumers’ preference which they got to know through signals and without profit motive the consumer isn’t a priority but is replaced by workers. Workers might enjoy their good wages initially, but people forget that the same population of the working class is consuming too and hence it will eventually harm them. It is nowhere fair that consumers are not considered important for the sake of workers because consumers constitute the entire population unlike the latter.</p>
<h4>Monopolies</h4>
<p>Mises noted that even though the real boss is the consumers in the market, this case doesn’t apply in the case of monopolies. Public Monopolies that are very well supported for workers’ rights are the most dangerous to consumers. The control of the market shifts from all (consumers) to some (in power). Cronies might fall in this category too but are better as there isn’t generally one firm involved. The reason behind the failure of socialism/market socialism is that the monopoly cannot do better than consumers. Consumers decide for themselves rather than a few sets of planners doing it and this is what they missed, in their obsession with workers they forgot the role and importance of consumers.</p>
<p>The same can’t be applied to Private Monopolies in the free market, their existence as a monopoly in long run is difficult but even if they do, they still have to keep competition out by satisfying the consumers like no other new player could do and in this the consumers still benefits and the market in long run is in control of them. Google which isn’t purely a monopoly but considered one is succeeding because of its best service which is probably something nobody can deny and the reason why Microsoft dominated for very long was for their consumer-friendly services.</p>
<p>There is a knowledge problem as it is quite impossible to understand what the preferences of consumers will be in the future, what will be climatic situations, and others. Recently there is a widespread belief that AI and computers can do the job and in simple words control humans well. Mises’s Calculation problem is a work of such genius that people aren’t still able to grasp it well even after almost one hundred years. But, there will also remain a knowledge problem because Hayek clearly explained this “tacit” knowledge cannot to recorded in statistical form, so how much AI is possible without Statistics or Data?</p>
<h4>Price Signals</h4>
<p>In the debate of supply versus demand in economics, F.A. Hayek showed the importance of prices in a very different way and explained that prices transfer knowledge according to which the market players take decisions. Neither Demand nor to an extent supply can be controlled because of the limitation of resources but the prices are something that one can change and hence adjust themselves to the market conditions. Entrepreneurs with help of price signals can understand the preference of consumers and also the scope of entry and exit in the market field. Prices give signals to consumers too, as said by Hayek people don’t need to know the reason behind the price changes but just need signals to make decisions in their purchases.</p>
<p>Prices play an important role in Consumer Sovereignty just like Private Property as explained by Mises. Consumers don’t go to sellers telling them about their preferences, but the prices can do this work efficiently and also bring entrepreneurial development in the economy which is very important to the prosperity of any society. Prices are something in the control of humans, though the prices are changed by the seller the control of it is in hands of consumers. Inflation is a barrier to the price system as it leads to the spread of wrong signals to market players. Hence, they tend to make wrong decisions. Another problem is when the money supply is in the control of central authority, the prices are too and therefore the control gets shifted from consumers’ hands to the central bank.</p>
<h4>Education</h4>
<p>It seems that the role of education is more important to workers and consumers than entrepreneurs as it can motivate one to become an entrepreneur but can’t give them new ideas. Entrepreneurs require real-world experience and an understanding of the market. Good quality education can enhance one’s skills and general knowledge which can help them get a better job. But, most importantly education is what is required at the top-notch quality for consumers to make good choices as the market is dependent on that. If the Bollywood industry of India is not able to provide quality films, then the blame should primarily go to the viewers who are still ready to buy tickets. If fast foods are more in demand, then the education system that doesn’t properly teach the students to follow a healthy diet should be questioned. Not checking the bill, expiry date, instructions, and other information and lacking understanding of consumers’ rights are possible with low-quality education.</p>
<p>Hence, it is important to take the power of education from government. The control of education by the government will eventually give them control of consumers and hence the market! A free market gives liberty to consumers but as responsibility is always attached to Liberty, the responsibilities are learned through the medium of education.</p>
<p>It’s time to embrace the importance of consumers in society and not let their hard-earned money be taken for granted and exploited in the form of taxes, startup barriers, and regulations.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Inflation in Pakistan: Follow the Money]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60632</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Every theory must ultimately meet two tests: one, that of internal consistency, the other that of consistency with reality</em>.—Frank A. Fetter</p>
<p>The great economist Ludwig von Mises played a seminal role in bringing about a paradigm shift in monetary economics resulting in a revolutionary change in our understanding of what causes inflation over the long run. In his book <em><a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Theory%20of%20Money%20and%20Credit.pdf">The Theory of Money and Credit</a></em> published in 1912, he <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/148870-theorie-des-geldes-und-der-umlaufsmittel">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For hundreds, even thousands, of years, people completely failed to see that variations in the objective exchange-value of money could be induced by monetary factors. They tried to explain all variations of prices exclusively from the commodity side.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, once again, the specter of high inflation is haunting the world. Yet, despite its prevalence, most ordinary people, and even central bankers and economists are utterly confused about its underlying cause.</p>
<p>Among central bankers and financial institutions this was seen when inflation first became visible in 2021 when the<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-instant-idUSKBN2IF1S0"> Federal Reserve</a>, the<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ecb-sticks-with-transitory-description-inflation-2021-12-02/"> European Central Bank</a>, and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-imf-inflation-idUSKBN2BB1XR">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) declared inflation to be transitory. Even the world’s leading economists misjudged inflation as Nobel Prize Economist Paul Krugman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/21/opinion/paul-krugman-inflation.html">wrote </a>in a recent article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just about all the prominent players, from Larry Summers to Dean Baker, were Keynesian economists, with more or less center-left political leanings. And we all had similar views, at least in a qualitative sense, about how economic policy works.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trying to understand major economic events by looking only at data on changes in economic aggregates, such as gross domestic product, wage rates, interest rates, and tax rates, runs the risk of missing the underlying motivations for change. Doing so is like trying to understand a religious awakening by looking at the cost of printing religious tracts.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, it may indeed have been the cost of printing new money and increasing credit growth which have possibly contributed to a rise in monetary induced inflation today. Firstly, it is important to clarify what exactly is meant by the term inflation.</p>
<p>Originally, inflation referred to an increase in the amount of money and credit in the economy. In other words, inflation meant that the money stock had been inflated by the government or central bank through a policy of credit expansion, viz. Money printing. Moreover, rising prices were understood as a potential symptom of inflation, but not as inflation itself.</p>
<p>However, this traditional conceptualization of inflation fell out of fashion during the twentieth century and economists began to talk about inflation in terms of rising prices, not money creation. Thus, to avoid confusion and to be as precise as possible, I shall refer to inflation proper as monetary inflation and a general rise in prices as price inflation.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that this distinction is not mere semantics, it is vital to bear this distinction in mind if the true causes of generally rising prices are to be fully understood. Understanding the factors that drive inflation is fundamental to designing monetary policy.</p>
<p>For instance, in their review February 2022 for Pakistan, the IMF ignored the potential impact of monetary inflation despite acknowledging in the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2022/02/04/Pakistan-2021-Article-IV-Consultation-Sixth-Review-Under-the-Extended-Arrangement-Under-the-512715">report </a>broad money supply and increase to private sector credit had risen by 16.2 percent and 11.5 percent respectively over during the last financial year 2020–21 as well as a further 15.8 percent increase in broad money supply and 16 percent private sector credit during the currency financial year 2021–22.</p>
<p>Opting for the definition of inflation as merely price inflation, the IMF <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2022/02/04/Pakistan-2021-Article-IV-Consultation-Sixth-Review-Under-the-Extended-Arrangement-Under-the-512715">predicted </a>the economy of Pakistan to witness a</p>
<blockquote><p>temporar[y] increase in the coming months and average 9.4 percent in FY 2022 due to the recent terms of trade shock, continued energy price adjustments, and GST reforms. It is expected to be within the SBP’s 9–11 percent inflation range forecast in the next 12 months, before slowing to 6.5 percent over the medium term.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet today inflation in Pakistan was recorded at <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369084/inflation-rate-highest-since-great-recession">25 percent in July 2022</a>, which was the highest level since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 almost 14 years ago (see below).</p>

<p>What can explain this divergence? Certainly in the long run, inflation is considered to be—as <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/files/monetaryhistory_1.pdf">Milton Friedman (1963)</a> stated—always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon (monetary inflation). However, the State Bank of Pakistan has pointed to supply-side developments in explaining inflation. This structuralist school of thought holds that supply constraints that drive up prices of specific goods can have wider repercussions on the overall price level.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, former State Bank of Pakistan governor Reza Baqir <a href="https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2021/11/28/what-is-reza-baqir-thinking/">stated </a>that the “driver of inflation is a surge in domestic and international commodity prices such as food and oil and monetary policy does not have control to bring international commodity prices down..”</p>
<p>As such, the question of whether money or commodity prices drives inflation is not merely academic but has profound implications for economic policy. If inflation is a monetary phenomenon, it is the responsibility of the central bank and the fiscal authorities to achieve price stability.</p>
<h4>What Drives Inflation in Pakistan: Money or Commodity Prices?</h4>
<p>The argument I present is that the high rate of inflation Pakistan currently faces is as much a result of an increase in commodity prices as monetary policies followed by the State Bank of Pakistan since 2020. To show how this higher-than-expected rate of inflation that the Pakistan experiences today was indeed the result of monetary inflation—i.e., an increase in the broad money supply and increase in the supply of private sector credit, we turn to a paper authored by IMF economist Axel Schimmelpfennig and Mohsin Khan in 2006 titled “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41260752">Inflation in Pakistan</a>.”</p>
<p>This paper <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/Inflation-in-Pakistan-Money-or-Wheat-18793">examined </a>the relative importance of monetary factors and structuralist supply-side factors for inflation in Pakistan. A stylized inflation model was specified that includes standard monetary variables (money supply, credit to the private sector), exchange rate, as well as wheat support price as a supply-side factor. The model is estimated for the period January 1998 to June 2005 monthly.</p>
<p>The results indicated that monetary factors played a dominant role in inflation, affecting inflation with a lag of about one year. Changes in the wheat support price influence inflation in the short run, but not in the long run. The results of the analysis are visible in the diagram below.</p>

<p>Looking at inflation in Pakistan today we see a similar trend today. First, there is a rapid increase in the broad money supply of the country visible in the diagram below. We note that the total money supply in the country printed since January 2020 increased 44 percent, the largest such increase in history.</p>

<p>It must be noted that printing new money is not inflationary by itself. However, as I wrote in a <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2021/11/25/printing-money-can-be-a-hidden-form-of-taxation/">previous article</a>, when governments run massive fiscal deficits, policies of quantitative easing when combined with printing money can be highly inflationary if the funds go out into the broad money supply and further out into commercial bank deposits from the public—i.e., growth in private sector credit. We see this trend in Pakistan in the diagram below.</p>

<p>The empirical results presented in this blog show that monetary factors determine inflation in Pakistan. Broad money growth and private sector credit growth are the key variables that explain inflation developments with a lag of around twelve months. A long-run relationship exists between the Consumer Price Index and private sector credit. Commodity prices of oil and food prices affect inflation in the short run, but not in the long run. The answer to the question “money or commodity prices?” Is “money!”</p>
<h4>Summary and Conclusions</h4>
<p>Pakistan’s growth record since the 1970s underscores that high and persistent inflation is harmful to growth (see figure below). Periods of high inflation have coincided with low growth spells, while high growth episodes tend to be associated with a low inflation environment. Considering the empirical thresholds beyond which inflation harms growth and financial development, the State Bank of Pakistan’s overarching objective should first and foremost focus its attention on price stability.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Murray Rothbard versus the Progressives]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60823</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p><em>There has been a radical change in the social and political landscape in this country, and any person who desires the victory of liberty and the defeat of Leviathan must adjust his strategy accordingly. New times require a rethinking of old and possibly obsolete strategies. </em>—Murray N. Rothbard<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref1_au0s1yw" title="Murray N. Rothbard, “A New Strategy for Liberty,” October 1994, in The Irrepressible Rothbard: The Rothbard-Rockwell Report Essays of Murray N Rothbard, ed. Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr. (Burlingame, CA: Center for Libertarian Studies, 2000), p. 35." href="#footnote1_au0s1yw">1</a></p>
<p>Murray Rothbard wrote the above words in 1994, shortly before his untimely passing. They sum up the main theme of a series of brilliant articles that he published in the 1990s calling for a radical readjustment of libertarian strategy to the new political and social realities that had emerged in the aftermath of the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. In these articles, Rothbard identified both the abstract social philosophy and the concrete political movement that then had emerged as the greatest menace to liberty and society. He also proposed a radical reformulation of the political spectrum and a revised political vocabulary to express the new strategy called for in the altered ideological and political context. </p>
<p>Before proceeding further, I want to point out that Rothbard’s articles, despite their deep insight and radical implications for libertarian strategy, have been largely overlooked by friend and foe alike for a couple of reasons. First, when he wrote the articles, Rothbard was hard at work on his monumental two-volume treatise on economic thought. Understandably, he wrote the articles quickly as one-off responses to particular events, ideas, and political developments during a period of rapid change, from 1991 to 1994. Rothbard’s new views on strategy were therefore presented as fragments in different articles containing inevitable repetition and overlapping. This obscured the fact that taken together these articles presented a systematic and comprehensive strategy for radical social and political change. Second, the articles appeared in the <em>Rothbard-Rockwell Report</em> a journal of social, political, and cultural commentary. Unfortunately, <em>Triple R</em>’s scintillating polemics and its coverage of an incredibly broad range of topics sometimes diverted the reader from the deep theorizing that informed many of its articles. I confess that I did not appreciate the significance of Rothbard’s articles, and their unity and breadth of vision, until very recently. </p>
<h4><strong>Social Democracy: Identifying the Enemy</strong></h4>
<p>After the collapse of communism, and with Nazism and fascism “long dead and buried,”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref2_kuhqyre" title="Murray N. Rothbard, “Frank Meyer and Sidney Hook,” January 1991, in The Irrepressible Rothbard, p. 23." href="#footnote2_kuhqyre">2</a> Rothbard argued that social democracy was the only remaining statist program, and its advocates were hell bent on making the most of their ideological monopoly. In the “new post-communist world,” Rothbard wrote:</p>
<p>The Enemy of liberty and tradition is now revealed full-blown: social democracy. For social democracy in all of its guises is not only still with us ... but now that Stalin and his heirs are out of the way, social democrats are trying to reach for total power.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref3_y98pich" title="Ibid., p. 23." href="#footnote3_y98pich">3</a></p>
<p>Not only is social democracy still with us in its many variations, but it has managed to define “our entire respectable political spectrum, from advanced victimology and feminism on the left over to neoconservatism on the right.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref4_5u24g14" title="Murray N. Rothbard, “A Strategy for the Right,” January 1992, in The Irrepressible Rothbard, p. 19." href="#footnote4_5u24g14">4</a> Make no mistake about it, Rothbard warned, “on all crucial issues, social democrats however they label themselves, stand against liberty and tradition and in favor of statism and Big Government.” Furthermore, social democracy is far more insidious than other forms of statism because it claims “to combine socialism with the appealing virtues of ‘democracy’ and freedom of inquiry.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref5_4t5o8p1" title="Rothbard, “Frank Meyer and Sidney Hook,” p. 23." href="#footnote5_4t5o8p1">5</a> As shrewd observers of the political scene for a century and a half, social democrats—or left liberals in the American political lexicon—are indeed seriously committed to democracy. As Rothbard explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>The maintenance of some democratic choice, however illusory, is vital for all varieties of social democrats. They have long realized that a one-party dictatorship can and probably will become cordially hated … and will eventually be overthrown, possibly along with its entire power structure.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref6_wgzbeso" title="Murray N. Rothbard, “The November Revolution … and What to Do about It,” November 1994, in Murray N. Rothbard, Making Economic Sense (Auburn AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1995), p. 398." href="#footnote6_wgzbeso">6</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Picking up on the insight of the contemporary political theorist Paul Gottfried, Rothbard noted that the social democrats’ devotion to democracy also serves as a pretext for an attack on those who assert the “absolute” inviolability of the right to free speech and a free press. This assault on free speech, Rothbard presciently pointed out in 1991, </p>
<blockquote><p>constitutes an agenda for eventually using the power of the State to restrict or prohibit speech or expression that [neocons and social democrats] hold to be “undemocratic.” This category could and would be indefinitely expanded to include: real or alleged communists, leftists, fascists, neo-Nazis, secessionists, “hate thought” criminals, and eventually … paleo-conservatives and paleo and left-libertarians.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref7_if3n2cp" title="Rothbard, “Frank Meyer and Sidney Hook,” p. 25." href="#footnote7_if3n2cp">7</a></p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Progressivism: The Social Philosophy of Social Democracy</strong></h4>
<p>Rothbard probed deeper to expose the peculiar social philosophy that is at the root of all strains and variants of social democracy as well as communism. He identified this philosophy as progressivism, which is far more than a social and economic program for the here and now. It is a Utopian social philosophy that looks toward the establishment of a future heaven on earth. The core belief of progressives is based on the Enlightenment myth that history is an inexorable and ever upward march toward the perfection of mankind. In the case of social democrats, perfection is defined as a society ruled and engineered by a righteous, efficient, and egalitarian socialist state. Moreover, unlike traditional Marxists, social democratic progressives believe that history unfolds not through class struggle and bloody revolution but through the relentless forward march of democracy. In Rothbard’s words:</p>
<blockquote><p>The left are in their bones, “progressives,” that is, they believe in Whig or Marxoid fashion, that history consists of an inevitable March Upward into the light, toward and into the Socialist Utopia. They believe in the myth of inevitable progress: that History is on their side.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref8_lxumjwp" title="Murray N. Rothbard, “Liberal Hysteria: The Mystery Explained,” October 1992, in The Irrepressible Rothbard, p. 338." href="#footnote8_lxumjwp">8</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The ultimate goal of this progressive and inevitable transformation of society is not, as it is with traditional Marxists, the eradication of all class distinctions and the collective ownership of the means of production under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Rather it is, in Rothbard’s words, “a socialist, egalitarian State run by bureaucrats, intellectuals, technocrats, ‘therapists,’ and the New Class in general in collaboration with accredited victim pressure groups striving for equality.” The capitalist and entrepreneur class will not be liquidated, nor will their means of production be expropriated. Instead, the market economy will be kept but heavily taxed, regulated, and restricted. According to Rothbard:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Social Democrats realize that it is far better for the socialist State to retain the capitalists and a truncated market economy to be regulated, confined, controlled, and subject to the commands of the State. The Social Democrat goal is not “class war,” but a kind of “class harmony,” in which capitalists and the market work for the good of society and of the parasitic State apparatus.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref9_k7ejudo" title="Ibid." href="#footnote9_k7ejudo">9</a></p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Revising the Political Spectrum </strong></h4>
<p>With “neoconservative” progressives having hijacked the conservative movement and the so-called New Democrat Bill Clinton revealing his hard-left progressive inclinations, Rothbard realized that the urgent first step in combating progressivism was to completely revamp the prevailing conception of the US political spectrum and its vocabulary. On the left of his reconstructed spectrum, Rothbard arrayed all political factions inspired by the progressive-Marxist vision of social change. These groups were also fanatically devoted to democracy not merely as the surest means for instituting the progressive political and economic agenda but, in Rothbard’s words, “as a shibboleth, as an ultimate moral absolute, virtually replacing all other moral principles including the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref10_ijsl8xt" title="Rothbard, “The November Revolution,” p. 411." href="#footnote10_ijsl8xt">10</a> In Rothbard’s view the Left ranged from official conservatives and neoconservatives to left liberals and included their allied intellectual and media elites and official victim groups. </p>
<p>On the right, Rothbard grouped all those who cherished traditional American liberties and social institutions and who aimed to stop, rollback, and undo progressive encroachments on them. Rothbard initially puzzled over the label that best suited his proposed grand coalition or “fusion” of right-wing opposition groups, which included many (but not all) libertarians, and various paleo- and traditional conservative groups. He summarily rejected the name “conservative,” tentatively proposing the terms “radical reactionaries,” “radical rightists,” or “the Hard Right.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref11_ylxgbmq" title="Rothbard, “A Strategy for the Right,” 12." href="#footnote11_ylxgbmq">11</a> He finally settled on the name “politico-economic reactionaries,” or simply “reactionaries.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref12_xs9d6ne" title="Rothbard, “A New Strategy for Liberty,” p. 32; Rothbard, Rothbard, “Liberal Hysteria,” pp. 339–40." href="#footnote12_xs9d6ne">12</a></p>
<p>The term “reactionary” is particularly fitting for opponents of the progressive agenda. It is true that the word was coined during the French Revolution to designate those who sought a restoration of the ancien régime. But its modern usage can be traced to Marx, who used the term as a pejorative to describe many of his predecessors and opponents in the nineteenth-century socialist movement whose Utopian economic schemes involved “turning back the clock” to the precapitalist and preindustrial era of feudalism and medieval guilds. Taking a cue from their master, later communists and social democrats used “reactionary” as a smear word against the defenders of capitalism for opposing the allegedly inevitable march of history towards socialism. As Rothbard pointed out:</p>
<blockquote><p>They become hysterical at setbacks, at regressions in that march, regressions which have, of course, been dubbed “reactions.” In both the Communist and the Social Democratic worldview, the highest, if not the only morality, is to be “progressive,” to be ... on the side of the inevitable next phase of history. In the same way, the deepest, if not the only, immorality, is to be “reactionary,” to be devoted to opposing inevitable progress, or even and at its worst, working to roll back the tide, and restore the past, “to turn back the clock.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref13_d6dh2dh" title="Rothbard, “Liberal Hysteria,” p. 339." href="#footnote13_d6dh2dh">13</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The odium that attaches to the term “reaction” or “reactionary” today is, therefore, strictly due to its polemical use by Marxist ideologues. Outside of politics, the term has a positive connotation in many uses. In particular, the antigen-antibody reaction “is the fundamental reaction in the body by which the body is protected from complex foreign molecules, such as pathogens and their chemical toxins.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref14_dzhq6hj" title="Wikipedia, s.v. “Antigen-Antibody Interaction," last mdified March 14, 2022, 15:33, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-antibody_interaction#:~:text=Antigen%2Dantibody%20interaction%2C%20or%20antigen,by%20a%20process%20called%20agglutination. Also see J.A. Spiers, “"Goldberg's Theory of Antigen-Antibody Reactions in Vitro,” Immunology 1, no. 2 (April 1958): 89–102." href="#footnote14_dzhq6hj">14</a> In other words, the human immune system is reactionary. It <em>reacts </em>against and annihilates invaders and restores the human body to it healthy <em>status quo ante</em>. To be a politico-economic reactionary, then, is to seek to undo the ravages of our economic, social, and cultural institutions perpetrated by progressive policies; to turn back the clock by ousting the invaders from their positions of power and restoring the social body back to health.</p>
<p>Rothbard perceptively applied his analysis of progressivism to explain the mystery of the bitter and hysterical leftist hatred of Francisco Franco and Augusto Pinochet, of Spain and Chile, respectively. The loathing of left liberals for these men was even greater than it was for Hitler. For Franco and Pinochet had thwarted the march of history, had actually turned back the clock by leading successful counterrevolutions against <em>democratically elected</em> leftist governments. Today we witness the same frenzied and unhinged vituperation by progressives heaped upon Donald Trump, Viktor Orban of Hungary, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, and Giorgia Meloni of Italy because these men and this woman have committed an even graver sin against the progressive creed than Franco and Pinochet did. They have actually taken power in democratic elections while using explicitly antiprogressive, reactionary rhetoric. thereby exposing the myth that democracy is the guarantor of inevitable social progress toward an egalitarian socialist state. How deeply these elections shook up and disoriented progressives is demonstrated in the crazed tweet by Swedish economist Anders Åslund well in advance of the Hungarian election: “If Hungary really <em>votes overwhelmingly against democracy</em> and for corruption I cannot see why it should be accepted in the EU”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref15_7g2pl8j" title="Anders Åslund (@anders_aslund), “If Hungary really votes overwhelmingly against democracy and for corruption I cannot see why it should be accepted in the EU. Kick it out!,” Twitter, April 3, 2022, 4:25 p.m. https://twitter.com/anders_aslund/status/1510730232273195009." href="#footnote15_7g2pl8j">15</a> (emphasis added). Slightly less idiotic but more revealing is the resolution passed recently by the august European Parliament asserting that Hungary is no longer a full democracy but “a hybrid regime of electoral autocracy.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref16_6os93m2" title="Jorge Liboreiro and Sandor Zsiros, “Hungary Is No Longer A Full Democracy but an ‘Electoral Autocracy,’ MEPs Declare In New Report,” euronews, September 16, 2022, https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/09/15/hungary-is-no-longer-a-full-democracy-but-an-electoral-autocracy-meps-declare-in-new-repor." href="#footnote16_6os93m2">16</a> Rothbard was thus right on the money in his evaluation of the progressives response to the successful political reactions led by Franco and Pinochet: “Let reaction occur, let the phases be rolled back, and these people flip out, go into orbit, for then maybe their religion is a false one after all.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref17_lbzujrj" title="Rothbard, “Liberal Hysteria,” p. 339." href="#footnote17_lbzujrj">17</a></p>
<p>Whether or not the current populist politicians in the US and Europe believe their own rhetoric and are genuine reactionaries is beside the point. Their ascension to power in democratic elections despite the endless stream of ridicule, hatred, and contempt spewed at them by the Western political, media, and academic elites demonstrates that a genuine reaction would be possible with the right leader. As Rothbard recognized, a reactionary movement requires “a charismatic leader who has the ability to short-circuit the media elites, and to reach and rouse the masses directly.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref18_8yjwt5m" title="Rothbard, “A Strategy for the Right,” p. 11." href="#footnote18_8yjwt5m">18</a></p>
<p>In a piece written in 1954 but published posthumously in 2002, Rothbard explained that to be effective., the leader of a dissident political movement must be a “demagogue.” He or she must</p>
<blockquote><p>appeal to the masses over the heads of the State and its intellectual bodyguard. And this appeal can be made most effectively by the demagogue—the rough, unpolished man of the people, who can present the truth in simple, effective, yet emotional, language. The intellectuals see this clearly, and this is why they constantly attack every indication of libertarian demagoguery as part of a “rising tide of anti-intellectualism.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref19_czlzdxh" title="Murray N. Rothbard, “In Defense of Demagogues,” Mises Daily, April 23, 2002, https://mises.org/library/defense-demagogues." href="#footnote19_czlzdxh">19</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In defending demagogy as a political method, Rothbard, of course, understood that it could be used by the Left or the Right. Nevertheless, as he foretold in 1954, since socialism has become the “fashionable and respectable ideology … [any] demagogy, any disruption of the apple cart, would almost certainly come from the individualist opposition.” The Left instinctively know this, which is why “The respectable statist Left … fears and hates the demagogue, and more than ever before, he is the object of attack.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref20_sbcfola" title="Ibid." href="#footnote20_sbcfola">20</a></p>
<h4><strong>Redefining Politics as Warfare</strong></h4>
<p>After reconstructing the political spectrum to reflect the realities of the post-Communist world, Rothbard laid out the political strategy that reactionaries need to employ to roll back progressivism. He pointed out that reactionaries and progressives are both minorities and in polar opposition to one another. Between them are the majority of Americans who are confused and “torn between conflicting worldviews.” They constitute what Rothbard, following Vladimir Lenin, called “the Swamp,” the terrain over which ideological battles are fought. </p>
<p>Rothbard pithily sums up the problem facing the rightist opposition to the progressive power grab:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem is that the bad guys, the ruling classes, have gathered unto themselves the intellectual and media elites, who are able to bamboozle the masses into consenting to their rule, to indoctrinate them, as the Marxists would say, with “false consciousness.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref21_bx2f86s" title="Rothbard, “A Strategy for the Right,” p. 9" href="#footnote21_bx2f86s">21</a></p></blockquote>
<p> This state of affairs exists because, since the beginning of the twentieth century progressive and corporate liberal politicians and their business and financial cronies have induced increasing numbers of intellectuals to apologize for and legitimize their rule in exchange for subsidies from the Federal government or lucrative positions in its ever expanding regulatory, welfare, and warfare agencies and bureaus. What Rothbard calls a “monopoly of the opinion molding function” in society has thus been granted to a privileged and coddled class that today consists of “a swarm of intellectuals, academics, social scientists, technocrats, policy scientists, social workers, journalists and the media generally.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref22_kzzmf0q" title="Ibid." href="#footnote22_kzzmf0q">22</a></p>
<p>So, what is to be done to break this formidable monopoly and destroy the “unholy alliance” of the political establishment and its privileged intellectual apologists? Rothbard recommended “a strategy of boldness and confrontation, of dynamism and excitement, a strategy, in short, of rousing the masses from their slumber, and exposing the arrogant elites that are ruling them, controlling them, taxing them and ripping them off.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref23_h8d0o8d" title="Ibid., p. 10." href="#footnote23_h8d0o8d">23</a> For a rousing right-wing populism of this sort is precisely what the ruling elites fear. They prefer a judicious, bipartisan discussion of the “issues,” in measured and solemn tones and without acrimony. Progressive politicians especially fear and warn against the so-called politics of resentment—precisely because the resentment would be aimed at them by those whom they exploit. In contrast, Rothbard counsels rightists to return to the fiercely ideological, and highly partisan politics of nineteenth-century America which was marked by bitter and personal resentment of the opposition party and its members.</p>
<p> Not only must the strategy of the right be confrontational according to Rothbard, it also “must fuse the abstract and the concrete: must not only attack the elites in the abstract, but must focus on the existing statist system, on those who right now constitute the ruling classes.” This means, above all, that the rightist strategy must be personal, must aim at exposing the lies, corruption and scandals of specific members of the ruling coalition. Thus, Rothbard wrote of the anti-Clinton movement that rapidly coalesced during Clinton’s first term as president:</p>
<blockquote><p>The movement erupted in reaction to all the objectively loathsome attributes of the Clintons and their associates—the stream of lies, evasions, crookery, sex scandals, and frantic attempts to run all of our lives. But quickly the hatred of the personal attributes of Clinton spilled over to his program, to his ideology. Thus we had the most powerful “nuclear fusion” in all of politics: the intense blending of the personal and ideological. The growing realization of the socialist tyranny involved in all of Clinton’s programs … joined with and greatly multiplied by the loathing for Clinton the man.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref24_uk0yauz" title="Rothbard, “A New Strategy for Liberty,” p. 36." href="#footnote24_uk0yauz">24</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The final part of the Rothbardian strategy is, thus, to get those on the right to grasp a simple insight—long ago assimilated by the left—that politics is war. That is, in domestic politics no less than in interstate military conflict, in the words of the great German political theorist Carl Schmitt, “the adversary intends to negate his opponent’s way of life and therefore must be repulsed or fought in order to preserve one’s own form of existence.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref25_swedlzb" title="Carl Schmitt, The Concept of the Political, trans. George Schwab (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007), p. 27." href="#footnote25_swedlzb">25</a> Furthermore, politics inherently involves what Schmitt calls “enmity” or the distinction between “friend and enemy,” concepts “to be understood in their concrete and existential sense, not as metaphors or symbols.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref26_q9wq9lw" title="Ibid., pp. 27, 33." href="#footnote26_q9wq9lw">26</a> For, to quote Schmitt again: “War follows from enmity. War is the existential negation of the enemy.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref27_z5iptoi" title="Ibid., p. 33." href="#footnote27_z5iptoi">27</a> Although Schmitt focuses almost exclusively on interstate conflict, he emphasizes the “ever present possibility of conflict … of combat … the real possibility of physical killing” as an essential attribute of the political, whether in the context of “domestic [or] foreign friend-and-enemy groupings.”<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref28_rckg6xw" title="Ibid., pp. 32–33." href="#footnote28_rckg6xw">28</a> From the Rothbardian perspective, the conflict in domestic politics is certainly war in the existential sense. The ruling elites by virtue of their control of the State apparatus not only threaten physical violence and even death against the ruled for failure to submit to their taxes and edicts, they also actually practice violence and killing against dissenters or “insurrectionists” among the ruled.</p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p>Rothbard recognized that any serious political challenge to progressives by a united and self-conscious fusionist-rightist movement would be a war—and a religious war at that. I will conclude by quoting at some length a rousing clarion call to arms to the Right by Rothbard:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are engaged, in the deepest sense … in a “religious war” and not just a cultural one, religious because left-liberalism/social democracy is a passionately held worldview, religion in the deepest sense, held on faith: the view that the inevitable goal of history is a perfect world, an egalitarian socialist world, a Kingdom of God on Earth…. It is a religious worldview toward which there must be no quarter; it must be opposed and combated with every fiber of our being…. And the metaphor is properly military. The looming struggle is far wider and deeper than over indexing capital gains. It is a life-and-death struggle for our very souls, and for the future of America…. The war for reaction will require above all courage, the guts not to buckle at the all-to-predictable smear response of the media, the pollsters, and all the rest…. And above all we need what the left fears above all: An adherence to the military metaphor, to the concept of us vs. them, good guys vs. bad guys, to Taking America Back. We must aim, not only for rolling it all back, not only for saving us from the Leviathan State and nihilist culture, and not only for restoring the Old Republic. For eventually we must drive the wooden stake through the heart of the Enemy, to kill once and for all the monstrous dream of the Perfect Socialized World.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref29_rxcsro4" title="Rothbard, “Liberal Hysteria,” pp. 340–41." href="#footnote29_rxcsro4">29</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The lesson for libertarians is that there are only two sides in the current political struggle. There is no middle ground. You are either a progressive or a reactionary. You either join, or acquiesce in, the forced march into socialism or you join the reaction—the fight to turn back the progressive clock or, better yet, to smash it to smithereens.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[The Government, Race, and an Upcoming SCOTUS Decision]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60868</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, the Supreme Court of the United States is confronting yet again an issue that has bedeviled it for the past thirty years: the use of racial quotas by government-owned universities and private universities that accept government funding.</p>
<p>The last time the court looked at this issue, it punted. As is always the case when the court punts, the issue returned. This time around, the issue comes in an environment hot with racial anxiety and lack of constitutional fidelity.</p>
<p>Here is the backstory.</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Amendment was enacted after the conclusion of the War Between the States. The radical Republicans who controlled the Congress and most Northern state legislatures wanted to punish the Southern states severely. Yet, their debates on the floors of Congress and state legislatures are unilluminating, as they offer contradictory purposes.</p>
<p>But the language of the Amendment—in the Equal Protection Clause—makes it clear that by requiring the laws to be applied equally, the mandate of the amendment is to remove race from the armament of states’ tools of governance.</p>
<p>Yet, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> in 1896 that states could use race as a basis to govern, so long as they did so equally. This is the separate-but-equal jurisprudence. In 1954, in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, that jurisprudence was reversed when the court ruled that separate is inherently unequal.</p>
<p>Without saying so directly, the post-<em>Brown</em> federal jurisprudence has assumed as an underlying principle that the mandate of the amendment is to eradicate race from the states’ armaments of governance.</p>
<p>There is no federal Equal Protection Clause. Yet, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 purported to abolish all use of race in government, public accommodations, housing, and workplaces, on public and on private property; the latter, a massive assault on property rights, the former, a rational understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>Since 1964, most states have enacted their own laws against racial discrimination, which basically mimic the federal laws and continue to prohibit government from using race as a basis for any decisions and continuing the assault on private property rights.</p>
<p>Today, nearly all colleges and universities use race as an admissions factor. According to their own public statements, they believe that they are serving a societal good and advancing the public policy of the United States by assuring a racially diverse makeup of all incoming classes and by compensating for past egregious racial wrongs.</p>
<p>To their point, the Supreme Court, in an absurdly reasoned 2003 opinion, generally accepted these goals and employed them to trump the Fourteenth Amendment, but only until 2028. Why 2028? Because Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who wrote the opinion, opined that in the twenty-five years following her opinion, race relations in the United Stated will have so improved that racial quotas in college admissions will not be a public issue. How wrong she was!</p>
<p>In Supreme Court history, this is the only case in which the court put a time limit on the duration of its ruling. Yet, it is a basic principle of constitutional law that if something was unconstitutional yesterday, it will be unconstitutional tomorrow and thereafter.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this lamentable history and the contorted judicial lens through which it all comes to us, a group of libertarian-leaning college students and professors have challenged the use of racial quotas in university admission policies by suing Harvard University, the nation’s oldest private university, and the University of North Carolina, the nation’s oldest public university.</p>
<p>Harvard, though private, accepts federal aid directly and indirectly and thereby has agreed to comply with federal nondiscrimination standards. UNC is owned by the state of North Carolina and thus is directly bound by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>Earlier this past week, the Supreme Court devoted five hours to oral argument on these two cases, but not before the feds jumped in. Surprisingly, the Biden Department of Justice entered the case in behalf of the plaintiffs, arguing for the purest view of the Fourteenth Amendment—that it prohibits all state-owned or federally assisted institutions from racial discrimination.</p>
<p>One embarrassing moment emerged during the oral argument when the solicitor general, who had just attacked Harvard and UNC, tried to justify the use of racial quotas by West Point, Annapolis, the Air Force Academy and the Coast Guard Academy. She resorted to the feds’ favorite shibboleth and claimed that military racial quotas were a matter of national security. The court—even its liberal membership—was unimpressed.</p>
<p>After 150 years of slavery and 150 years of Jim Crow, America can’t shake its racial demons. All these problems were caused by governments that treated persons as chattel and enslaved and suppressed the African race. Then the problems were exacerbated when the feds thought they could regulate private property while failing to regulate their own. Throughout all this, countless folks of all races suffered at the hands of government trying to right past wrongs and socially engineer the future.</p>
<p>The government needs to stay chained down to the Constitution. That means it must be color-blind, stay off of private property and comply with the legal principles it imposes on the rest of us.</p>
<p>Harvard can do what it wants on its own lands, and the feds should stay off of them. It is richer than the federal government; it doesn’t need and shouldn’t receive a penny from taxpayers. Even if it were poor, there is simply no constitutional basis for taxpayer funding of private schools. UNC is directly bound by the Constitution, and it must be color-blind.</p>
<p>All this came about by government telling folks how to live, spend their money, use their private property and plan for the future. This is the same government that lies, cheats, steals, kills, can’t deliver the mail, stop robo calls or fill potholes. When will we learn that that government is best which governs least?</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Powell Admits the Fed Is Failing on Inflation, and Promises More Rate Hikes]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60854</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target federal funds rate 75 basis points on Wednesday, marking the fourth 75-basis-point hike in a row since June. </p>
<p>The federal funds rate is now the highest it's been since December of 2007 when the Fed was in the process of lowering the target rate as part of an effort to stimulate in the economy in the lead up to the 2008 financial crisis. The target rate still remains 1.25 percent below the peak rate of 5.25 percent reached during much of 2006 and 2007. </p>
<div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption"><a href="https://cdn.mises.org/ffr_6.jpg" title="ffr" class="colorbox" data-colorbox-gallery="gallery-all-CcXYu3mpLTA" data-cbox-img-attrs="{"title": "", "alt": "ffr"}"><img class="media-element file-image-no-caption" data-delta="1" alt="ffr" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://cdn.mises.org/styles/max_1160/s3/ffr_6.jpg?itok=MxVbYNNy" width="1160" height="806" title="" /></a></div>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20221102a.htm">the Fed's press release</a> for Wednesday's announcement, the FOMC at this time expects additional rate increases:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7TqBEgjIyE">Some observers</a> seized upon the language about taking into "account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation," as evidence that the FOMC is currently looking to reduce its pace of rate increases. For example, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-set-another-big-rate-hike-may-tamp-down-future-tightening-2022-11-02/">according to Reuters</a>, this section of the press release "signals possible smaller increases ahead." </p>
<p>Moreover, during Powell's Wednesday press conference, the Fed chairman noted that a re-assessment of the current rate of hikes "It may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that ... No decision has been made. It is likely we will have a discussion about this at the next meeting."</p>
<p>Yet, Powell also emphasized repeatedly that the FOMC does not anticipate a full reversal of its current tightening stance. Throughout the press conference, Powell repeatedly used phrases like "we will stay the course" and "we still have some ways to go" and "it is very premature to talk about pausing [interest rate hikes]."  </p>
<p>Interestingly, Powell also continued his habit—developed in recent months—of admitting that the Fed is essentially winging it when it comes to choosing the "correct" policy. For example, on the issue of how high to raise the policy rate, Powell stated "that level is very uncertain" and he suggested he remains agnostic on the issue of whether or not the policy rate needs to "to get above the [core PCE] inflation rate." Employing language used by Powell in the past to describe the sort of inflation that the Fed would absolutely prevent, one reporter asked Powell if inflation has become "entrenched." In response Powell stated "we don't have a scientitic understanding of at what point inflation becomes entrenched." </p>
<p>Another aspect of Powell's comments was to defend himself from constant—and tiresomely incorrect—criticism on Wall Street that Powell has "overtightened" on policy. On this, Powell simply declared "I don't think we've overtightened" and fell back yet again on strong employment data. </p>
<p>Yet, another reporter noted that with the yield-curve spread so small—<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/several-parts-us-yield-curve-are-inverted-what-does-it-tell-us-2022-11-01/">and in some cases inverted</a>—"why are you so confident you have not overtightened." This, of course, was a reference to the fact that a yield-curve inversion shows the economy is on its way to recession. On this, Powell offered no direct answer except for a jumbled response about how the Fed keeps track of it all. </p>
<p>Powell increasingly appears to be a man increasingly coming to the realization that an economic bust is inevitable, although Powell will never admit that the Fed's inflationary boom is what is behind the bust. </p>
<p>Finally, when asked about whether or not a "soft landing" was still possible, Powell claimed that it is "hard to say" and "the path [to a soft landing] has narrowed" and yet is still possible. The reason he gave for this is the fact that in spite of repeated rate hikes, "we haven't seen inflation coming down. ...that means we have to make policy more restrictive and that narrows the path to a soft landing." As Robert Aro <a href="https://mises.org/power-market/powells-soft-landing">points out</a>, however, the Fed has never actually defined what a "soft landing" actually is. </p>
<p>It is quite interesting to note the<a href="https://mises.org/wire/fed-making-it-it-goes-so-it-ditched-forward-guidance"> evolution of Powell's confidence since July</a>, and by "evolution," I mean decline. In late 2021, after all, Powell spoke with immense confidence about <a href="https://mises.org/power-market/entrenched-new-transitory">how the Fed had sufficient tools to "prevent inflation from becoming entrenched</a>." Now he says he says the Fed lacks the information to know if inflation is entrenched. Forward guidance—remember that?—is also long gone. </p>
<p>Instead what we have from the Fed and FOMC are increasingly vague statements about what the Fed may or may not do, and how it will re-evaluate its decisions at some point in the future. The Fed steadfastly refuses to provide any solid objectives, measures, or definitions for what will guide its policy, and instead relies on nonspecific statements about "financial considtions" and how the future is uncertain and "patience" is required. Notably, Powell did not say at this meeting—in contrast with other recent press conferences—that he does not see a recession on the horizon. </p>
<p>These are the same people, of course, who now claim to be "surprised" by the appearance of 40-year highs in price inflation rates over the past year—after printing trillions of dollars—and insist no one saw it coming. These are supposed to be America's most brilliant and insightful observers of the economy. Powell's promises of using Fed policy tools to head off trouble have been repeatedly exposed as empty promises, and it is clear the Fed is simply improvising in hopes of somehow bringing down inflation rates without a severe recession. If this does come to pass, it's safe to say it will not be due to any particular insight, prudence, or wisdom on the part of the Fed and its officials. </p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Private versus Government Health Insurance: They Are Not the Same]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60717</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Insurance is a market institution—i.e., it emerged through voluntary exchange aiming at satisfying the needs of the parties involved. Private health insurance should not be mistaken for public health insurance, which constitutes an element of a state’s social policy. They differ to such a great extent that one can even claim that the latter is a contradiction of the former. This essay will show the most notable differences between them.</p>
<h4><strong>The Main Differences</strong></h4>
<p>Firstly, insurance companies make use of advanced economic calculation which uses the calculus of probability to estimate the risk and establish appropriate premiums for particular at-risk groups. People of a lower health risk will pay lower premiums as opposed to the ones of a higher health risk. Moreover, not everybody can be insured. Differentiation of contributions and insurance coverage, as well as exclusions and limitations are to ensure that the costs incurred by the insurance companies are in an adequate relation to the premiums gained and invested. The cooperation between the actuarial<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref1_i3m9p27" title="Dealing with calculating the insured party’s health risk." href="#footnote1_i3m9p27">1</a> and underwriting<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref2_nh988pc" title="Responsible for assessing the insured party’s risk—e.g., based on an analysis of the applications for insurance filed by potential customers." href="#footnote2_nh988pc">2</a> departments enables such risk management, which in turn enables obtaining profits.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the case of the so-called public insurance there is no risk calculation, selection, or classification. All the insured pay an obligatory contribution which is not related to a real insurance risk. It can be uniform or dependent on one’s income. Public institutions responsible for financing access to the health system do not have to fear that the insured party might leave the company. As a result, the problem of moral hazard is much more visible in public health programs, especially if the authorities plead the so-called citizen’s right to healthcare.</p>
<p>Moral hazard is a situation in which an entity does not incur the costs of their activities despite obtaining additional benefits. In the case of public health insurance, it is a charging of a relatively lower contribution or the nonexistence of the possibility of refusal. Thus, the entity can get preferential conditions, and the additional costs are incurred by all the other people insured, which sooner or later leads to problems with medical services accessibility.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the case of private health insurance it is usually not known who is going to need medical services. The insurance company can establish that, e.g., out of one million people, 0.5 percent will contract a particular disease, but not who it will be. In turn, in the case of public insurance next to such cases there is also a known number of people who are already ill. Therefore, there is no risk but certainty.</p>
<p>Some believe that private insurance is only good for the young and the healthy. However, insurance companies are about adequate risk assessment for particular groups (classes). Thus, it is possible to calculate premiums corresponding to lower and higher health risk. It does not mean, though, that insurance companies will automatically accept everybody’s applications, but it should not be assumed that a person with health issues will not be insured at all. Accepting all applications might destabilize a given insurance program and lead to problems with financing access to medical services for other customers. Hence the importance of risk assessment for insurance companies.</p>
<p>Thirdly, apart from financing access to a range of medical services, insurance companies invest a part of the contributions. Thus, the supply of savings available in the market increases, making it easier for entrepreneurs to obtain capital indispensable for creating more effective production. Meanwhile, the contributions to public insurance are consumed by the insured immediately. Thus, the insurance market contributes to the increase of savings supply and their adequate allocation in the economy, while public insurance constitutes income redistribution. Mandatory transfer of funds between particular groups of the insured is not a source of investment and does not lead to the increase of the production efficiency.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the limitations imposed in the agreement enable a more rational consumption of medical services. They concern, among others, the time span or range of such insurance. Also, the insurance does not cover all possible occurrences due to lack of a possibility to assess the risk. It can result from a lack of sufficient data or medical knowledge. For instance, lack of sufficient information and knowledge on the development of a given illness makes it impossible to assess the costs of treatment, which translates into significant difficulties in assessing the contribution because it is now known whether it is adequate to the given risk.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that a rational consumption of such services should not be associated with their rationing, which is characteristic of public programs. Rationality of consumption means that before deciding to buy insurance a customer analyses its limitations, price, etc. They also compare it with competitive offers of other insurance companies or alternative solutions such as, e.g., medical subscription prices or the cost of direct medical services. Insurance companies also care about having conscious customers who do understand both the advantages and limitations of their products. It contributes to the development of appropriate customer attitudes. Lack of such limitations would quickly result in an increased demand for medical services available thanks to private insurance, which would result in different forms of their rationing by insurance companies wanting to avoid, e.g., an increase of contributions (prices).</p>
<p>Additionally, apart from the insurance, if the market is not subject to any strong regulations, there are many other alternative forms of financing access to medical services and the institutions which offer them (e.g., medical chains, charities, or direct payments). Therefore, lack of insurance does not mean a complete lack of possibilities to use medical services. Public insurance or state (nonmarket) solutions do not grant a person who needs medical services any choice between competing public providers. The person’s situation worsens significantly when they cannot use those services within public insurance. For such people, private insurance or other private financial institutions offering medical services are the only option.</p>
<p>Fifthly, private risk assessment in market insurance translates into a higher motivation to take care of one’s health. A potential insured party may be encouraged to lose weight or quit smoking by the prospect of paying lower contributions. People leading a healthy lifestyle may, in turn, be offered more favorable conditions, which can encourage others to change their diets as well. The insurance companies may also employ a range of incentives aimed at their customers, offering, e.g., a premium decrease if they score a sufficient number of points in a medical survey.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the motivation to take care of one’s health is lowered when it comes to public health insurance due to the lack of risk assessment. The assumption is that everybody should have equal access to the health system and that failure to lead a healthy lifestyle should not exclude or limit anybody.</p>
<p>Sixthly, in the market conditions there are mechanisms which contribute to cost reduction and increasing the quality of medical services, which in the case of public insurance does not have to be certain and often leads to the cost/expenditure increase and a decrease in the quality of service.</p>
<p>Insurance companies are interested in the best risk assessment possible, thanks to which they can offer premiums which would best correspond to the risk posed by a potential insured party. What is also significant is the quality of the services, which prompts insurance companies to search for appropriate providers of such services or create their own chains. Competitive processes effectively maintain costs on a low level, ensuring the profits assumed. In turn, in the case of public insurance the competitive processes are replaced with mandatory contributions and a range of regulations conditioning the operating rules of the public health system.</p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p>The differences described above show that the so-called public (state) insurance functions are based on extremely different assumptions than private insurances and besides the name they have no common characteristics. The former is inherently related to interventionism. The latter results from the bottom-up market processes. Because of those differences, it is not possible to connect those two types of insurance. Any additional interference in the health insurance market brings insurance firms closer and closer to fulfilling the redistributive function regarding financing the access to medical services. The so-called public (state) health insurances, being an element of the state’s policy, are not insurances in the word’s real meaning. They have never been and never will be. Insurance, just like money, is a market institution and only in market conditions may duly fulfil its function.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Misunderstanding Mises, Again]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60691</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>In a recent blog post on the <em>Marginal</em><em> Revolution</em> <a href="HYPERLINK%20%22https:/marginalrevolution.com/%22">blog</a>, Ludwig von Mises is categorized as an <em>underrated</em><em> thinker</em>. That’s undoubtedly true, especially when considering his many groundbreaking contributions to economics. Mises was also one of the first to be named a <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/honors-awards/distinguished-fellows">distinguished fellow</a> of the American Economic Association in 1969. His contributions to economic theory were many and significant and were largely recognized by his contemporaries. But while they are difficult to deny, Mises still gets very little recognition today.</p>
<p>Mises is frighteningly often dismissed as a “crank” or “ideologue” by present-day know-it-alls who are clearly ignorant of recent history of economic thought. The blog post at “MR,” which comments very briefly on Mises’s main works, is therefore an important reminder of Mises’s strong legacy. But it is also interesting because it provides insight into how a non-Austrian who is (or at least should be) well aware of Austrian economic theory sees Mises’s work.</p>
<p>The blog post is written by Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University who has recently gained online notoriety as a columnist, blogger, and podcast host. As a longtime colleague with Austrian economists, both faculty and graduate students, in the GMU economics department, many would assume Cowen to know much about this tradition and, especially, its main works.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is much to agree with Cowen on. He starts by pointing to <em>Socialism</em> and <em>Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth</em> as great contribution. He then moves on to state that he likes <em>Liberalism</em> and <em>Bureaucracy</em>. <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/10/overrated-or-underrated.html">Cowen thereafter writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Human</em> <em>Action</em> is big, cranky, and dogmatic, but for some people a useful tonic and alternative to the usual stuff. I can’t say I have ever really liked it, and in an odd way the whole emphasis on “Man acts” undoes at least one part of marginalism.</p></blockquote>
<p>I admit that I do not quite understand how starting one’s analysis with human action “undoes … part of marginalism.” A more reasonable conclusion, at least from my perspective, is that this part of marginalism, whichever it may be, might be wrong or, at least, ill founded. But it would be easier to tell if Cowen had given us a clue what part he might be talking about.</p>
<p>The much larger problem is to call Mises’s systematic treatise “cranky” and “dogmatic.” I have the feeling that Cowen is referring to praxeology rather than Mises’s conclusions, even though the conclusions of course are stated without exceptions. That’s expected from theory that is derived logically from a true axiom: either the logic is wrong, or they are true. There is no reason to discussion “exceptions” because there are none.</p>
<p>But, as is common nowadays, many mistakenly believe that opening for exceptions and not being dogmatic is a sign of wisdom or scholarship. Likewise, they seem to think that taking a middle position is automatically “nuanced.” It can be, of course, but not by virtue of simply being in the middle. There is no middle ground between food and poison, as Ayn Rand would say. There is also, to borrow from Aristotle, no “golden middle” between truth and falsity, between right and wrong, or between ethical and unethical.</p>
<p>Praxeology is dogmatic in the same sense as truth is either true or it is not. It is not “nuanced” in the sense that empirical analyses are, because they always leave room for interpretation. It doesn’t matter how large a database or how sophisticated statistical methods—you cannot ever be certain that your findings are accurate. When people force praxeology into this frame, it appears dogmatic. But it is so for a reason: it must be.</p>
<p>Praxeology claims to establish the truth. This means that, from a scholarly perspective, praxeology should be considered the gold standard: it makes very strong claims, which can then be properly assessed and, if wrong, rejected. “Nuance” here means allowing for and including error. After all, praxeology is of the same kind as mathematics. But few would reject mathematics because it “dogmatically” holds that 2 + 2 = 4 instead of being more “nuanced” (allowing for 2 + 2 <> 4 at least sometimes).</p>
<p>Cowen would know this if he understood praxeology, but there is no reason to assume that he does. His comment on Mises’s dogmatism suggests as much. So it appears reasonable to assume that he has the same type of <a href="https://perbylund.com/2011/01/a-spectacle-due-to-spectacles/">shallow understanding</a> of Austrian conclusions as his fellow non-Austrian GMU economics professor Bryan Caplan. The latter has written several essays on why he is not an Austrian, showing the world that he knows the terminology and conclusions but not the reasoning or rationale.</p>
<p>It is sad that Mises to this day is misunderstood. While Cowen indeed gives Mises well-deserved credit, doing so while dismissing his<em> magnum opus</em> as “dogmatic” and “cranky” is at best odd and bittersweet praise.</p>

 <description><![CDATA[<p>The ongoing war in Ukraine has forced many Westerners to consider the realism of Carl von Clausewitz’s classic <em>On War.</em> The Prussian military theorist famously <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2014/11/everything-you-know-about-clausewitz-is-wrong/">wrote</a> that: “War is nothing but a continuation of politics with the admixture of other means.” Though this observation may seem strange or even shocking to modern Western ears, it is the role war has mostly had throughout history.</p>
<p>Clausewitz served in the Russian army in 1812 and his influence in Russia is felt to this day. Indeed, Russia’s approach to the war in Ukraine has the <a href="https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/putin-clausewitz-and-ukraine">imprint of Clausewitz</a> in the sense that it sees military action <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/page/clausewitz-war-as-politics-by-other-means">as a political instrument</a>, along with other such instruments, such as diplomatic and economic ones.</p>
<p>This helps to explain why Russia has been somewhat misunderstood in Western political and intellectual circles as the current crisis has escalated. Since the end of the Cold War, Western elites have come to equate war with the particular military doctrine of the United States, for which war only starts where politics ends, or even worse: when war of aggression is the <em>preferred</em> means to reach political and commercial ends, often at the exclusion of any good faith diplomacy.</p>
<p>Washington’s wars in the Middle East are typical examples of this. The official objectives of these wars, such as “spreading democracy,” have never really been achieved. Instead, the Military-industrial complex has profited massively from these wars, which strongly suggests that the real military goals of the US government are not the official ones.</p>
<p>For Clausewitz, writing in a time when crony capitalism hardly existed, there is a fundamental interest in avoiding war, because war harms all parties directly involved. Thus, in this light, war should always be the last resort employed by states when trying to reach political goals, not only because of the loss of life and the destruction of property that war entails, but also because of the uncertainty of war for all involved. As the old saying goes, it is easy to start a war, but difficult to end it.</p>
<p>When war does erupt, it is thus often the result of one side’s error of judgment with regard to its own and its opponent’s capabilities and intentions. As the historian Carroll Quigley wrote in his magnum opus, <em>Tragedy and Hope</em>: “This is the chief function of war: to demonstrate as conclusively as possible to mistaken minds that they are mistaken in regard to power relationships.<em>”</em></p>
<p><strong>The Lack of Relevance of the UN</strong></p>
<p>Typically for a nineteenth-century thinker, Clausewitz accepted the possibility for war to solve political problems, in a way modern international law does not. However, his view of war seems more respectful of the United Nations Charter than the aggressive military doctrine practiced by some of its Western signatories. Indeed, the United Nation’s Security Council’s past decisions to allow military intervention have often not met even the Clausewitz rationale for war; namely, the exhaustion of all other means of issue resolution.</p>
<p>UN Security Council (UNSC) authorizations that since 1945 have allowed some member States to use force against other members often have had underlying interests other than the stated one of “restoring international peace.” Predictably, the results of many of these UN sanctioned military interventions have generally been disastrous; often exacerbating conflicts and leading to the dramatic suffering of the civilian populations. In North Korea 1950, in South Vietnam in 1966, in Kuwait in 1990, and in Libya in 2011, the US interventions made a mockery of the UN’s ideal of peace.</p>
<p>Even worse, the UN Charter and the legal legitimacy of the UNSC have simply been disregarded by the US government in Serbia in 1999 and Iraq in 2003, setting a dangerous precedent. Today, of the permanent five veto-wielding members of the UNSC, three of them are now adversaries of the other two, and this is preventing the UNSC from making any significant contribution toward restoring peace.</p>
<p>What kept the peace, at least in Europe, between the two geostrategic and ideological Cold War rivals was arguably more the nuclear deterrence than the existence of the UN Charter, even though the USA and the USSR did several times <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls">come close</a> to using nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The UN’s role in enforcing international law is therefore today almost nonexistent. The absence of the UN in helping solve the current conflict between Russia and NATO is glaring. The UN Charter is thus simply a legal framework that works—de facto, not de jure—only as long as all of its most powerful members adhere to it in both spirit and letter. In reality, international relations between nation-states are still to a large extent power relationship, as in the days of Clausewitz.</p>
<p><strong>Realism in War Complemented by Libertarianism</strong></p>
<p>The view of modern war presented above, however realist in its outlook, does not consider the cause of war in the first place. It seems inevitable that this requires a focus on the role of the modern state as the instigator of all wars. Therefore, however insightful Clausewitz’s commentary on war, it should be complemented by a theory of the modern state.</p>
<p>Libertarianism is perfectly placed for this task, since it identifies the state as the cause of most of society’s artificially created ills. As a political philosophy based on natural right, libertarianism cannot morally accept a war waged by the state, even if an entirely defensive one (if there is such a thing). The state, by its very definition, violates the nonaggression principle by its monopoly of violence on a given territory.</p>
<p>In practice, however, even a libertarian would have to prefer the case of a state’s noninterested protection of private property in a defensive war against an external enemy, to the alternative of an externally imposed tyranny. Yet, the real world rarely reoffers such clear choices.</p>
<p>Free trade, i.e., is trade completely unobstructed by national or supranational states, is the main driver for peace between nations. Open, trading nations have an interest in peaceful relations with other each other and are therefore naturally averse to war. Protectionism and the tendency toward autarky are both causes and consequences of fraught relations between states that can lead to military conflict. This is not surprising, since the stakes of the state in society, through its intervention in the economy, introduces a logic of competition against other nation-states.</p>
<p>Indeed, peace and prosperity in any society is inversely correlated to the size and strength of the state. In a world composed of nation-states, this leads to the conclusion that is in complete opposition to <a href="https://mises.org/wire/difference-between-good-globalism-and-bad-globalism">political globalism</a>; namely, that there should be as many of states as possible—why not down to the municipal level—so as to render each one as weak and limited as possible.</p>
<p>The concepts of <a href="https://mises.org/wire/secession-and-small-states">secession</a> and <a href="https://mises.org/library/self-determination-and-secession">self-determination</a> is therefore key for libertarians in order for the number of states to multiply. War becomes less likely the smaller and the less powerful states are, and the more similar to each other they are in size. The current times have shown the danger of states becoming so large as to have geopolitical interests; in the case of the USA, spanning the entire world.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it should be clear that is no contradiction between having a realist view of the world and at the same time one based on political principles. Having a realist view of international relations, as those presented here, does not preclude also recognizing the importance of the libertarian principles regarding war and the state. Indeed, only when the people start massively rejecting the interventions of their state abroad as well as domestically will the possibility for peace between states appear.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Hermann Morris: The Nail Hub as the Adaptive Entrepreneurial Method in Practice]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60843</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Breakthrough theory becomes effective practice when it is successful applied by real-life entrepreneurs. The E4B entrepreneurial method is actualized by Hermann and Elizabeth Morris in the very distinctive business model for their brand, The Nail Hub.</p>
<h3>Knowledge Capsule</h3>
<h4>The true purpose of a B2B business is to help your customers succeed.</h4>
<p>While outside observers focus on transactions — how much does this business sell, what are its revenues? — entrepreneurial business owners and operators focus on customers and customer relationships. Revenues follow from relationships. This insight is critical, since it guides business model development.</p>
<p>Business-to-business models are especially responsive to relationship strategies. When a customer feels that the relationship with a supplier makes their business performance better, they can become a customer for life. That’s a recipe for strong and sustainable growth.</p>
<h4>First, observe the ecosystem in which you operate, and identify gap opportunities.</h4>
<p>Systems thinking is an important component of the entrepreneurial method. A firm is a component or a node in a network of interconnected services we can call an ecosystem. Hermann’s and Elizabeth’s ecosystem is the Nail Fashion industry. Nodes include salons and salon owners, the nail technicians (sometimes employees, sometimes independent contractors) who provide service to consumers in the salons, equipment manufacturers and suppliers, product manufacturers and suppliers (for nail gel, etc.), and product distributors.</p>
<div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption media-wysiwyg-align-center"><a href="https://cdn.mises.org/evolving-the-nail-hub-business-model.png" title="E4B Graphic: Evolving The Nail Hub Business Model" class="colorbox" data-colorbox-gallery="gallery-all-yJGHKFChUkQ" data-cbox-img-attrs="{"title": "", "alt": "E4B Graphic: Evolving The Nail Hub Business Model"}"><img class="media-element file-image-no-caption" data-delta="1" alt="E4B Graphic: Evolving The Nail Hub Business Model" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://cdn.mises.org/styles/max_1160/s3/evolving-the-nail-hub-business-model.png?itok=r3by5r_s" width="1160" height="2068" title="" /></a></div>
<p>Hermann and Elizabeth were able to identify a number of gaps in the ecosystem. Many salon owners were enthusiastic about their industry but not well-trained or experienced in the basic economics of business. Many of the technicians were passionate about their trade, but not highly trained in the latest techniques and technologies and in product selection. There were aspects of marketing that were underdeveloped, such as audience segmentation. And there were inconsistencies between products in both quality and safety.</p>
<p>In the mind of the entrepreneur, these gaps are opportunities. The entrepreneurial question is: how best to fit in and contribute to the ecosystem. The business model response is determined by individual entrepreneurial orientation.</p>
<h4>The beginning orientation was that of an operator.</h4>
<p>Given their knowledge of both the high potential of the industry and the gaps to be addressed / problems to solve, the Morrises’ entry point was as an operator. They embarked upon the journey to design a differentiated salon experience with superior nail technique, better products, better trained technicians. They ran the salon with better business acumen (they both came from high-level corporate positions and were able to bring sophisticated operating and financial experience). They segmented with an unusual and especially comfortable in-salon appeal, and via location.</p>
<p>They were successful. There was a lot of learning, which Hermann identifies as overcoming pain points.</p>
<h4>The next growth step comes from re-orientation to larger scale.</h4>
<p>How could the Morrises scale their salon business? They thought through multiple openings (e.g., open and operate 20 salons), acquisition (acquire 20 salons), and franchising (sell franchises to multiple independent owners).</p>
<p>All of these alternatives would require new capability development: establishing standards and a repeatable business model, including a reliable financial model, designing a multi-unit system of supply chains, capital deployment, décor, training and location scouting, and a new kind of marketing to salon managers or franchisees.</p>
<p>The Morrises were reorienting to thinking as proprietors of a new kind of multi-division business. It’s a different orientation, seeing the same ecosystem from a different perspective.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Elizabeth had the idea for a podcast to share her expertise and knowledge and passion for the industry. It was free business advice, free guidance, free technical training, teaching different aspects of running a salon and technical aspects for nail technicians. Its purpose was a service to consumers (better salon experiences), to technicians (better craftsmanship) and owners (better business operations). The podcast was called The Nail Hub. It generated a great positive reputation in the ecosystem and a lot of positive feedback. The knowledge that The Nail Hub podcast shared was enthusiastically welcomed.</p>
<h4>The Nail Hub podcast feedback resulted in a further re-orientation.</h4>
<p>The Nail Hub podcast was helping salon owners and those technicians who were independent contractors renting positions in salons to improve the way they ran their businesses: better management, better understanding of customer needs and segmentation, better approaches to pricing, revenue and profits, better techniques, and better products.</p>
<p>What if a podcast can become a business model? Hermann and Elizabeth developed an entirely new B2B services business model which could be summarized as “educate the industry on how to operate a business, and supply them with the highest quality products to fit their business”.</p>
<p>Importantly, the education is free to consume. The Nail Hub YouTube channel is free to access, and offers over 140 videos on every aspect of business operations, finances, equipment, products, and techniques. The videos are expensive to produce. The model is that the investment in education will be repaid through loyal customers buying the products that The Nail Hub offers for purchase.</p>
<p>The curation of products itself is a service. The Nail Hub has identified a distinctive set of criteria for product selection (health, safety, non-toxic ingredients, cruelty-free) and does the research and validation so that purchasers can be confident in their choices and tin he integrity of their promises to the end-consumer.</p>
<p>The products are not the lowest price, they are the highest quality. Salon owners who have not fully absorbed The Nail Hub’s education on consumer segmentation, pricing, and customer experience will not be a good fit within The Nail Hub’s customer set. The Nail Hub business model has a high internal consistency and integrity.</p>
<p>The Nail Hub has re-oriented to B2B service provider educating an entire industry to provide superior consumer experiences, better product quality and profitable operations — i.e., re-orienting from facing those challenges to helping others to face and overcome them.</p>
<h4>One of the cornerstones of the B2B services model is authentic subject matter expertise.</h4>
<p>The Nail Hub can help salon owners and nail technicians thrive through their independent action because Hermann and Elizabeth developed a deep subject matter expertise. They’ve been salon owners and faced all the developmental issues that owners face. They’ve trained nail technicians. They’ve evaluated salon equipment and they’ve committed their resources and time to researching high quality, innovative products that meet their highest standards. Hermann stresses that the arduous development of subject matter expertise is the necessary foundation for a trusted service business.</p>
<h4>Another is to choose customers carefully.</h4>
<p>The Nail Hub is making a substantial investment in their customers via their free training and education. The business model that they enable is specific: the highest standards, with the best trained operators, providing a reliably superior consumer experience. The pricing model is premium, which supports the use of the highest quality products and the provision of the highest quality salon environment. Race-to-the-bottom operators who pursue the lowest prices as a competitive edge are not a good fit in The Nail Hub ecosystem, and Hermann makes this a clear element of The Nail Hub’s B2B communications. Choose your customers to match your positioning.</p>
<h4>The evaluation of the business model does not lie in conventional metrics.</h4>
<p>When the business model is to invest in the success of customers, the conventional metrics of revenue, margins and annual profits are not the primary measures of success (although, of course, they must be acknowledged). The evaluation of the model comes via the feedback loops. Is the educational service welcomed? Does it result in better operations on the part of salon owners? Do salon owners and independent technicians become customers for life? Do product manufacturers clamor for entry into The Nail Hub’s curated product set? Are product trends — safe, non-toxic, healthy, etc. — moving in the desired direction?</p>
<p>This is the entrepreneurial ethic: make customers more successful, make the world a better place.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[The Petrodollar-Saudi Axis Is Why Washington Hates Iran]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60662</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Kish, since you are wondering, is an Iranian island in the Persian Gulf famed for its tourist and shopping attractions. It is becoming a serious rival to other nearby vacation hubs in Doha and Dubai.</p>
<p>Along with pristine beaches and extensive malls, Kish is—or rather ought to be—known more widely for another feature and institution which the Iranian mullahs established there way back in 2003; namely, the Kish Bourse (i.e., Kish Stock Exchange). بورس کیش if you prefer the Farsi.</p>
<p>Think of it as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange of Iran, a country stacked with natural resources, a relatively well-educated and sophisticated population (the literacy rate is 97 percent among young adults, which, if you consider the deplorable state of secondary education in the United States, means that Iranian youth are most assuredly smarter than your average young American adult), and an economy burdened by mismanagement of their own Islamic theocracy and crippling, long-duration sanctions from the American secular theocracy.</p>
<p>That American secular theocracy has considered it a dogmatic rite of passage into the state and corporate media (their temples) that one must, at the very least, excuse the economic, cultural, and political warfare against Iran as necessary for a variety of spurious reasons. Who really has enough free time to investigate and then suggest otherwise? After all, Iran is plagued by terroristic Islamic fundamentalists who have pledged—like their former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad—“to wipe Israel off the face of the earth.”</p>
<p>That hero of American warfare and empire and regime change and nation building, George W. Bush, declared Iran to be one of the hinges of the “axis of evil”; so, since George W. Bush is so much better than Donald J. Trump, well, all Iranians must be malevolent thugs. Iran deserved to have the United States aid Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, to have the United States provide Hussein chemical weapons (mostly made in Germany and the United Kingdom), and then have those chemical weapons unleashed on them.</p>
<p>Never mind that Ahmadinejad never said that. Look away from the facts that one of the rare times in which Trump garnered any support from the deep state cathedral and corporate media cabal was when he tore up the Iran nuclear deal and when he assassinated Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/01/03/killing-of-top-iranian-leader-elicits-praise-worry-from-congress/">Orange man good when he’s killing brown peoples in distant lands—so conclude the <em>powers that have been</em> for way too long.</a></p>
<p>Why has Iran, then, incurred such wrath from the American military-industrial complex establishment? The regime’s Sturm und Drang regarding Iran—and, for that matter, any state that even intimates that it will conduct trade in oil without the dollar, cf. Russia—is all about the petrodollar system.</p>
<p>Let’s define it with some historical context: When Richard Nixon removed the dollar from its peg to gold in 1971, chaos followed. It was not just the Yom Kippur War (1973) and resultant OPEC embargo that led oil prices to skyrocket in the United States. The dollar, as the new, floating, purely fiat global reserve currency had lost its allure when compared to other sovereign currencies and precious metals.</p>
<p>In order to stave off runaway, hyperinflation, Nixon empowered then secretary of the Treasury, William Simon, to go hat in hand to the Saudi monarchy, with a proposal. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret">According to Andrea Wong in a Bloomberg article from 2016(!), Simon landed in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to get King Faisal to agree “to finance America’s widening deficit with it’s newfound [oil] wealth.”</a></p>
<p>Said another way, the Americans promised to buy oil from Saudi Arabia, and in return, the Saudis would promise to denominate global purchases only in dollars. Washington would also go so far as to provide military aid and materiel to the Kingdom, which made Raytheon, McDonnell Douglas, and Rand Corporation types happy. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret">The tit for that tat came in the form of guarantees that the Saudis would “plow billions of their <em>petrodollar</em> revenue back into Treasuries and finance [the inordinate, warfare-welfare] spending” of every US regime since.</a></p>
<p>It—incredibly—gets worse. King Faisal accepted the arrangement (one that was sure to make his desert-oil kleptocracy a major regional power and global player) on one condition: The rest of the world could not know the extent of the agreement. That is to say that Faisal knew that in the rest of the Islamic world, underwriting America’s drunken-sailor imperial spending, well, that would not play in Cairo, Damascus, and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Therefore, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret">Simon allowed for the Saudis to “bypass the normal competitive bidding process for buying Treasuries by creating ‘add-ons.’ Those sales, which were excluded from the official auction totals, hid all traces of Saudi Arabia’s presence in the U.S. government debt market.”</a></p>
<p>Within just four years of the agreement, Saudi Arabia held about one-fifth of all Treasuries held abroad. It is further asserted that that number represents the bare minimum of the Saudi share of US debt. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret">The Saudi regime launders and recycles its petrodollars though hedge funds and secretive arrangements with perhaps hundreds of quasi-private institutions, all done with the approval and oversight of the US regime.</a></p>
<p>Different parties. Different men. Different pronouncements. Different promises. But, the one thing they all have in common: They <em>all</em> bow low before the Saudis—one of them, literally!</p>
<p>The truth is that both American foreign policy and to a very large extent, American domestic policy, are both wrapped up in the petrodollar arrangement. For the past fifty years, the national government has attempted to do what a president not pictured above—Lyndon Baines Johnson—wanted to do in Vietnam; namely, apply the New Deal to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The subsequent regimes have doubled down on the insanity—they aspire to maintain American economic, imperial hegemony <em>over the rest of the world</em> while simultaneously engaging in domestic spending to infinity and beyond. Thus, the petrodollar system is the most grandiose of all monetary and money laundering schemes. The Fed and US Treasury create fiat out of thin air, the Saudis provide a semblance of supportive valuation for it, and then the Saudis conceal their ill-begotten gains by buying Treasuries and cleaning their dollars through ostensibly legitimate concerns.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080202025907/http:/www.energybulletin.net/7707.html">As economist William Clark pointed out in 2005, nations that even appear to not be on board with this sinister arrangement are the ones that incur the most wrath from the State Department, Pentagon, NATO, presidential administrations, and all of the other aligned interests.</a> In September 2000, Saddam Hussein announced that his Baathist government would no longer participate in the “Oil-for-Food” Program, and that, furthermore, oil deals would be denominated in euros.</p>
<p>From that point on, the writing (about Babylon this time) was on the walls of the state in DC Just months after US forces invaded Iraq, in June 2003, Iraqi oil sales were converted back to petrodollars, which, owing to the euro’s strength against the dollar at the time, cost Iraqis a net 13 percent on their oil revenues and invalidated previously approved contracts with other nations.</p>
<p>Kish is a much greater offense to Washington than anything Saddam Hussein was able to accomplish. There, Iranian oil is bought and sold using euros, yuan, and (get ready for it) rubles. The Iranians have their own oil “marker” or means of certifying the purity and quality of the oil. Turns out, while the Biden administration and greater “liberal” Europe have expressed their collective outrage by spending other citizens’ money to support an oligarchy in Ukraine and have concurrently cut off those evil, boorish Russians with sanctions; business is brisk in Kish and Tehran. Volumes have increased on the export and import side.</p>
<p>Over just a four-month period, they went up 4 percent and a whopping 32 percent respectively. The Iranian consumer is holding up in spite of those onerous sanctions. Meanwhile, China has increased its purchase of Iranian oil. At present, 13 percent of China’s oil originates in Iran.</p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=I3vWgRS_itIC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false">All of this is to say that, just like the Federal Reserve system, the petrodollar cabal has to reign at or near the top of operative institutions that the vast majority of Americans have “kinda, sorta heard about” and yet possess no idea of the extent to which said things suppress American prosperity and prospects for the future.</a> Most have no idea why or how the Saudis can fund everything from genocidal proxy wars against Iran to upstart professional golf tours.</p>
<p>Must be all of that oil money. Factual, but not exactly true.</p>
<p>End the petrodollar.</p>
<p> </p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Rothbard on Gold]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60836</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>What would people use for money in a genuine free market? A lot of people answer the question in this way. We really don’t know the answer for sure. It would be up to the people who live in that society. Because in a genuine free market, there would be no state at all, there would be no money mandated by the state. People would compete to establish the money they liked best. Maybe people would settle on a gold or silver standard, as they had done in the past. But maybe they wouldn’t. They might prefer electronic currency like bitcoin. Or maybe there would be all sorts of different monies, with no clear winner.</p>
<p>Murray Rothbard doesn’t agree with this. He was aware of competitive money, because F.A. Hayek had suggested it. People have the right to offer competing monies, as Hayek advocated. But Murray thought they would be unlikely to do this. The competition had already taken place, and precious metals were the winner. Why go through the same process again? As Murray explains in his great article, “<a href="https://mises.org/library/case-genuine-gold-dollar">The Case for a Genuine Gold Dollar</a>”:</p>
<p>“In recent years an increasing number of economists have understandably become disillusioned by the inflationary record of fiat currencies. They have therefore concluded that leaving the government and its central bank power to fine tune the money supply, but abjuring them to use that power wisely in accordance with various rules, is simply leaving the fox in charge of the proverbial henhouse. They have come to the conclusion that only radical measures can remedy the problem, in essence the problem of the inherent tendency of government to inflate a money supply that it monopolizes and creates. That remedy is no less than the strict separation of money and its supply from the state.</p>
<p>The best known proposal to separate money from the state is that of F.A. Hayek and his followers. Hayek’s ‘denationalization of money’ would eliminate legal tender laws, and allow every individual and organization to issue its own currency, as paper tickets with its own names and marks attached. The central government would retain its monopoly over the dollar, or franc, but other institutions would be allowed to compete in the money creation business by offering their own brand name currencies. Thus, Hayek would be able to print Hayeks, the present author to issue Rothbards, and so on. Mixed in with Hayek’s suggested legal change is an entrepreneurial scheme by which a Hayek-inspired bank would issue ‘ducats,’ which would be issued in such a way as to keep prices in terms’ of ducats constant. Hayek is confident that his ducat would easily out-compete the inflated dollar, pound, mark, or whatever.</p>
<p>Hayek’s plan would have merit if the thing—the commodity—we call ‘money’ were similar to all other goods and services. One way, for example, to get rid of the inefficient, backward, and sometimes despotic U.S. Postal Service is simply to abolish it; but other free market advocates propose the less radical plan of keeping the post office intact but allowing any and all organizations to compete with it. These economists are confident that private firms would soon be able to outcompete the post office. In the past decade, economists have become more sympathetic to deregulation and free competition, so that superficially denationalizing or allowing free competition in currencies would seem viable in analogy with postal services or fire-fighting or private schools.</p>
<p>There is a crucial difference, however, between money and all other goods and services. All other goods, whether they be postal service or candy bars or personal computers, are desired for their own sake, for the utility and value that they yield to consumers. Consumers are therefore able to weigh these utilities against one another on their own personal scales of value. Money, however, is desired not for its own sake, but precisely because it <em>already</em> functions as money, so that everyone is confident that the money commodity will be readily accepted by any and all in exchange. People eagerly accept paper tickets marked ‘dollars’ not for their aesthetic value, but because they are sure that they will be able to sell those tickets for the goods and services they desire. They can only be sure in that way when the particular name, ‘dollar,’ is <em>already</em> in use as money.</p>
<p>Hayek is surely correct that a free market economy and a devotion to the right of private property requires that everyone be permitted to issue whatever proposed currency names and tickets they wish. Hayek should be free to issue Hayeks or ducats, and I to issue Rothbards or whatever. But issuance and <em>acceptance</em> are two very different matters. No one will accept new currency tickets, as they well might new postal organizations or new computers. These names will not be chosen as currencies precisely because they have not been used as money, or for any other purpose, before.</p>
<p>Hayek and his followers have failed completely to absorb the lesson of Ludwig von Mises’ ‘regression theorem,’ one of the most important theorems in monetary economics. Mises showed, as far back as 1912, that since no one will accept any entity as money unless it had been demanded and exchanged earlier, we must therefore logically go back (regress) to the first day when a commodity became used as money, a medium of exchange. Since by definition the commodity could not have been used as money before that first day, it could only be demanded because it had been used as a nonmonetary commodity, and therefore had a preexisting price, even in the era before it began to be used as a medium. In other words, for any commodity to become used as money, it must have originated as a commodity valued for some nonmonetary purpose, so that it had a stable demand and price before it began to be used as a medium of exchange. In short, money cannot be created out of thin air, by social contract, or by issuing paper tickets with new names on them. Money has to originate as a valuable nonmonetary commodity. In practice, precious metals such as gold or silver, metals in stable and high demand per unit weight, have won out over all other commodities as moneys. Hence, Mises’ regression theorem demonstrates that money must originate as a useful nonmonetary commodity on the free market.</p>
<p>But one crucial problem with the Hayekian ducat is that no one will take it. New names on tickets cannot hope to compete with dollars or pounds which originated as units of weight of gold or silver and have now been used for centuries on the market as the currency unit, the medium of exchange, and the instrument of monetary calculation and reckoning.</p>
<p>Hayek’s plan for the denationalization of money is Utopian in the worst sense: not because it is radical, but because it would not and could not work. Print different names on paper all one wishes, and these new tickets still would not be accepted or function as money; the dollar (or pound or mark) would still reign unchecked. Even the removal of the legal tender privilege would not work, for the new names would not have emerged out of useful commodities on the free market, as the regression theorem demonstrates they must. And since the government’s own currency, the dollar and the like, would continue to reign unchallenged as money, money would not have been denationalized at all. Money would still be nationalized and a creature of the state; there would still be no separation of money and the state. In short, even though hopelessly Utopian, the Hayek plan would scarcely be radical enough, since the current inflationary and state-run system would be left intact.</p>
<p>Even the variant on Hayek whereby private citizens or firms issue gold coins denominated in grams or ounces would not work, and this is true even though the dollar and other fiat currencies originated centuries ago as names of units of weight of gold or silver. Americans have been used to using and reckoning in dollars for two centuries, and they will cling to the dollar for the foreseeable future. They will simply not shift away from the dollar to the gold ounce or gram as a currency unit. People will cling doggedly to their customary names for currency; even during runaway inflation and virtual destruction of the currency, the German people clung to the mark in 1923 and the Chinese to the ‘yen’ in the 1940s. Even drastic revaluations of the runaway currencies which helped end the inflation kept the original ‘mark’ or other currency name.</p>
<p>Hayek brings up historical examples where more than one currency circulated in the same geographic area at the same time, but none of the examples is relevant to his ‘ducat’ plan. Border regions may accept two <em>governmental</em> currencies. But each has legal tender power, and each had been in lengthy use within its own nation. Multicurrency circulation, then, is not relevant to the idea of one or more new private paper currencies. In addition, Hayek might have mentioned the fact that in the United States, until the practice was outlawed in 1857, foreign gold and silver coins as well as private gold coins, circulated as money side by side with official coins. The fact that the Spanish silver dollar had long circulated in America along with Austrian and English specie coins, permitted the new United States to change over easily from pound to dollar reckoning. But again, this situation is not relevant, because all these coins were different weights of gold and silver, and none was fiat government money. It was easy, then, for people to refer the various values of the coins back to their gold or silver weights. Gold and silver had of course long circulated as money, and the pound sterling or dollar were simply different weights of one or the other metals. Hayek’s plan is a very different one: the issue of private paper tickets marked by new names and in the hope that they are accepted as money.</p>
<p>If people love and will cling to their dollars or francs, then there is only one way to separate money from the state, to truly denationalize a nation’s money. And that is to denationalize the <em>dollar</em> (or the mark or franc) itself. Only privatization of the dollar can end the government’s inflationary dominance of the nation’s money supply.”</p>
<p>If competition in money isn’t the way to go, how do we get to free market money? As usual Murray has the answer:</p>
<p>“We conclude, then, that the dollar must be redefined in terms of a single commodity, rather than in terms of an artificial market basket of two or more commodities. Which commodity, then, should be chosen? In the first place, precious metals, gold and silver, have always been preferred to all other commodities as mediums of exchange where they have been available. It is no accident that this has been the invariable success story of precious metals, which can be partly explained by their superior stable nonmonetary demand, their high value per unit weight, durability, divisibility cognizability, and the other virtues described at length in the first chapter of all money and banking textbooks published before the U.S. government abandoned the gold standard in 1933. Which metal should be the standard, then, silver or gold? There is, indeed, a case for silver, but the weight of argument holds with a return to gold. Silver’s increasing relative abundance of supply has depreciated its value badly in terms of gold, and it has not been used as a general monetary metal since the nineteenth century. Gold was <em>the</em> monetary standard in most countries until 1914, or even until the 1930s. Furthermore, gold was the standard when the U.S. government in 1933 confiscated the gold of all American citizens and abandoned gold redeemability of the dollar, supposedly only for the duration of the depression emergency. Still further, gold and not silver is still considered a monetary metal everywhere, and governments and their central banks have managed to amass an enormous amount of gold not now in use, but which again could be used as a standard for the dollar, pound, or mark.</p>
<p>This brings up an important corollary. The United States, and other governments, have in effect nationalized gold. Even now, when private citizens are allowed to own gold, the great bulk of that metal continues to be sequestered in the vaults of the central banks. If the dollar is redefined in terms of gold, gold as well as the dollar can be jointly denationalized. But if the dollar is <em>not</em> defined as a weight of gold, then how can a denationalization of gold ever take place? Selling the gold stock would be unsatisfactory, since this (1) would imply that the government is entitled to the receipts from the sale and (2) would leave the dollar under the absolute fiat control of the government.</p>
<p>It is important to realize what a definition of the dollar in terms of gold would entail. The definition must be <em>real</em> and effective rather than nominal. Thus, the U.S. statutes define the dollar as 1/42.22 gold ounce, but this definition is a mere formalistic accounting device. To be real, the definition of the dollar as a unit of weight of gold must imply that the dollar is interchangeable and therefore redeemable by its issuer in that weight, that the dollar is a demand claim for that weight in gold.</p>
<p>Furthermore, once selected, the definition, whatever it is, must be fixed permanently. Once chosen, there is no more excuse for changing definitions than there is for altering the length of a standard yard or the weight of a standard pound.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to investigate what the new definition or weight of the dollar should be, let us consider some objections to the very idea of the government setting a new definition. One criticism holds it to be fundamentally statist and a violation of the free market for the government, rather than the market, to be responsible for fixing a new definition of the dollar in terms of gold. The problem, however, is that we are now tackling the problem in midstream, <em>after</em> the government has taken the dollar off gold, virtually nationalized the stock of gold, and issued dollars for decades as arbitrary and fiat money. Since government has monopolized issue of the dollar, and confiscated the public’s gold, only government can solve the problem by jointly denationalizing gold and the dollar. Objection to government’s redefining and privatizing gold is equivalent to complaining about the government’s repealing its own price controls because repeal would constitute a governmental rather than private action. A similar charge could be leveled at government’s denationalizing any product or operation. It is not advocating statism to call for the government’s repeal of its own interventions.</p>
<p>A corollary criticism, and a favorite of monetarists, asks why gold standard advocates would have the government ‘fix the (dollar) price of gold’ when they are generally opposed to fixing any other prices. Why leave the market free to determine all prices <em>except</em> the price of gold?</p>
<p>But this criticism totally misconceives the meaning of the concept of price. A ‘price’ is the quantity exchanged of one commodity on the market in terms of another. Thus, in barter, if a package of six light bulbs is exchanged on the market for one pound of butter, then the price per light bulb is one-sixth of a pound of butter. Or, if there is monetary exchange, the price of each light bulb will be a certain weight of gold, or, these days, numbers of cents or dollars. The important point is that price is the ratio of quantities of <em>two commodities</em> being exchanged. But if money is on a gold standard, the dollar and gold will no longer be two independent commodities, whose price should be free to fluctuate on the market. They will be <em>one</em> commodity, one a unit of weight of the other. To call for a ‘free market’ in the ‘price of gold’ is as ludicrous as calling for a free market of ounces in terms of pounds, or inches in terms of yards. How many inches equal a yard is not something subject to daily fluctuations on the free or any other market. The answer is fixed eternally by definition, and what a gold standard entails is a fixed, absolute, unchanging definition as in the case of any other measure or unit of weight. The market necessarily exchanges two different commodities rather than one commodity for itself. To call for a free market in the price of gold would, in short, be as absurd as calling for a fluctuating market price for dollars in terms of cents. How many cents constitute a dollar is no more subject to daily fluctuation and uncertainty than inches in terms of yards. On the contrary, a truly free market in money will exist only when the dollar is once again strictly defined and therefore redeemable in terms of weights of gold. After that, gold will be exchangeable, at freely fluctuating prices, for the weights of all other goods and services on the market.</p>
<p>In short, the very description of a gold standard as ‘fixing the price of gold’ is a grave misinterpretation. In a gold standard, the ‘price of gold’ is not unaccountably fixed by government intervention. Rather, the ‘dollar,’ for the past half-century a mere paper ticket issued by the government, will become defined once again as a unit of weight of gold.”</p>
<p>As usual, Murray is right. We should for a return to the gold standard, not waste time with space cadet fantasies about new kinds of money.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[The Economy Is a Mess: What Lessons Will We Learn?]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60645</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>It is relatively common that what should be recognized as a warning flag of major trouble is often ignored until things get so bad that it is almost impossible not to notice (unless one is mightily determined not to see them). Leonard Read channeled such thoughts about the damage public policy has caused Americans. He even went so far as to say “Thank God for the Mess We’re In,” (<em>The Freeman</em>, March 1975), because our mess is so great we might finally start thinking about how to undo the causes:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a reason for our mess. We are now reaping the bitter harvest of the poisonous seed sowed intermittently during the past … bad effects whose causation can be traced to the employment of wrong means. We suffer the natural consequences of our folly.</p>
<p>As it is, we need only take our heads out of the sand to see clearly that interventionism not only has failed to provide the promised something for nothing but has led to all sorts of undesirable consequences.</p>
<p>[Many] fail to get the message the mess is meant to convey. Indeed, many are just beginning to realize that we are moving toward disaster, even though we have been on a wrong heading for decades.</p>
<p>Why then do I thank God for the mess we’re in? Simply because the mess is sending up signals—messages loud and clear—that our past is filled with errors which inexorably produced their evil results. The consequences we suffer now were caused by past mistakes, and we need to know what wrong actions are responsible for these bad effects. The fact is, we are being graced with warnings which, when and if read aright, can lead to our salvation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read then turns to the issue of how to “see” both the blessings of liberty and how government violations of liberty have gotten us into the mess we’re in:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our past is filled not only with moral but politico-economic errors, and our present likewise. How are we to identify these wrong actions and find the right ones, that is, how expose the fallacies of state interventionism and reveal the merits of human liberty as related to the interest and benefit of every one of us?</p>
<p>When liberty prevails, every individual … is free to bring persons and other scarce resources into complementary and workable combinations … millions who can and do bring individuals and other resources into association that render a fantastic service of all sorts to King Consumer. And, when liberty prevails so does competition, a constructive force that assures that the efficient servants rise to serve all of us better.</p>
<p>The aggregate of these energies—the bringing into combination of things and persons—is beyond the power of anyone to even imagine.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem: government interventions supposedly to advance the general welfare commonly do the opposite, by undermining the liberty that is truly essential to our well-being:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let us now observe what happens to these sources of creative energy when the state regulates and controls them. What are the consequences when organized physical force—government—controls our creativity, our varied and unique potentialities? To accurately observe and appraise these consequences is to discover the errors—moral and economic—which account for the mess we are in. And the task is to free ourselves from these malpractices.</p>
<p>We have [many] governments—federal, state, and local … commanding millions of us as to what to produce, what and with whom to exchange, what our money is worth; they dictate hours of labor, wages, what our children must study; on and on and on … they have frustrated, to a marked extent, the morals and the creativity of the citizenry.</p>
<p>As a result of this governmental intervention, the varied talents and the uniqueness of each citizen are more or less imprisoned.</p>
<p>To repeat, when liberty prevails, all are free to bring things and people into workable combinations to the betterment of all … But when the police and their subsidized minions regulate and control, a do-as-­I-say-or-else action replaces, to a great extent, the bringing together actions of free and creative people, and to the detriment of all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read concludes with a call to finally heed the red flags that have been flying for so long, along with a reference to inflation that seems quite prescient for our situation today:</p>
<blockquote><p>The signals are loud and clear—far too numerous to recount. The messages are that every one of these evils we now experience are but consequences of past and present errors … we must work on the causes … if we would repair our ways!</p>
<p>Let me conclude by calling attention to but one signal, a warning that is fretting millions … the rapid decline in the purchasing power of the dollar. The cause? Inflation! Its causes? Excessive governmental expenditures which in turn are caused by people from all walks of life running to government for every conceivable kind of succor—people feathering their own nests at the expense of others. The remedy? Remove the causes.</p>
<p>In any event, I thank God for the mess we’re in and its timely warning that we must change our course to avert disaster.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have heard many people in recent years echo Leonard Read’s recognition that we are in a real mess. Such recognition is an important and necessary first step. But it is far from sufficient to undo the mess. What Read was thankful for was the heightened potential it offered for careful thinking, to be followed by action to undo the causes. It is that last step that offers a payoff for society. But our near-at-hand midterm election campaigns don’t seem to deliver on Read’s hope, but instead promise a doubling down on every policy ever conceived to violate citizens’ persons and property to give power to government and favors to those whose votes are thought to be most effectively buyable.</p>
<p>And it is profoundly depressing to see us creating still bigger red flags, while continuing to avert our eyes from virtually anything they have to teach us. It seems that rather than having a problem with a boy who cried wolf, we have a problem of many crying that there is no wolf, even when we see him at the door.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Can a Free Market Economy Be Trusted to Recover on Its Own?]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60660</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Following in the footsteps of John Maynard Keynes, most economists hold that one cannot have complete trust in a market economy, which is seen as inherently unstable. If left free, the market economy could lead to self-destruction, hence the need for the government and the central bank to manage the economy. Successful management in the Keynesian framework is done by influencing overall spending.</p>
<p>According to this framework, spending generates income, with spending by one individual becoming income of another. The more that is spent, the greater the income will be. Spending drives the economy, and if consumers fail to spend during a recession, it is the role of the government to step in and boost overall spending.</p>
<h4>Funding and Economic Growth</h4>
<p>What is missing in the Keynesian story is the matter of funding. For instance, a baker produces ten loaves of bread out of which he consumes two loaves. The saved eight loaves of bread he exchanges for a pair of shoes with a shoemaker. Note the baker funds the purchase of shoes by means of the saved eight loaves of bread.</p>
<p>The bread maintains the shoemakers’ life and well-being. Likewise, the shoemaker has funded the purchase of bread by means of the saved shoes.</p>
<p>Assume the baker decides to build another oven to increase production of bread. To implement his plan, the baker hires the services of the oven maker, paying the oven maker with some of the bread he has produced. The building of the oven is supported by the production of bread. If for whatever reasons the flow of the bread production is disrupted the baker would not be able to pay the oven maker. As a result, the making of the oven would have to be abandoned.</p>
<p>We can infer that what matters for economic growth is not just tools, machinery, and the pool of labor, but an adequate flow of consumer goods that maintains individuals’ life and well-being. By means of a saved consumer good—the bread—the baker can fund the expansion of his production structure. Similarly, other producers must have saved consumer goods—real savings—to fund the purchase of the goods and services they require.</p>
<p>The introduction of money does not alter the essence of funding. The baker exchanges the saved bread for money and then exchange the money for the shoes. (Money is just the medium of exchange. It is only employed to facilitate the flow of goods; money cannot replace consumer goods.)</p>
<p>According to popular thinking, the demand for goods grows when the money supply increases. We believe that the demand for goods is constrained by the production of goods. The greater the production of goods, the more goods can one demand, with money simply facilitating the exchange of goods.</p>
<h4>Government Is Not a Wealth Generator</h4>
<p>The government as such does not produce real wealth. How, then, can an increase in government outlays grow an economy? People employed by the government expect compensation for their work, but the only way government can pay these workers is by taxing others who generate real wealth. By doing this, the government weakens the wealth-generating process and undermines real economic growth. (We ignore here borrowings from overseas).</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Human%20Action_3.pdf">According to</a> Ludwig von Mises:</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">There is need to emphasize the truism that a government can spend or invest only what it takes away from its citizens and that its additional spending and investment curtails the citizens’ spending and investment to the full extent of its quantity.</p>
<p>The fiscal and monetary stimulus appears to “work” if the flow of real savings is large enough to support—i.e., fund—government sponsored activities while still permitting an increase in the activities of real wealth generators. However, if the flow of real savings is decreasing, then overall real economic activity will follow suit. The more government spends and the more the central bank pumps new money into the economy, the more will be taken from wealth generators, thereby <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Human%20Action_3.pdf">undermining prospects</a> for real economic growth.</p>
<p>When loose monetary and fiscal policies divert bread from the baker, he will have less bread at his disposal, all other things being equal. Consequently, the baker will not be able to secure the services of the oven maker. As a result, it will not be possible to boost the production of bread.</p>
<p>As the pace of loose monetary policies intensifies, the baker will not have enough bread left to even sustain the workability of the existing oven. (The baker will not have enough bread to pay for the services of a technician to maintain the existing oven in a good shape). Consequently, the production of bread will actually decline.</p>
<p>Similarly, other wealth generators, because of the increase in government outlays and monetary pumping, will have less real savings at their disposal. This, in turn, hampers the production of their goods and services and slows overall real economic growth.<img border="0" height="1" src="file:///C:/Users/danie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif" width="1" /></p>
<h4>Why Economic Cleansing Promotes Economic Growth</h4>
<p>The conventional thinking presents economic adjustment—also labeled as “economic recession”—as something that must be avoided. In fact, economic adjustment is nothing more than the reallocation of scarce resources in accordance with consumers’ priorities. Allowing the market to do the allocation always leads to better results. Even the founder of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin, understood this when he introduced the market mechanism for a brief period in March 1921 to restore the supply of goods and prevent economic catastrophe. Yet most experts these days cling to the view that the market cannot be trusted in difficult times.</p>
<p>Economic problems are better fixed by allowing entrepreneurs the freedom to allocate resources in accordance with individuals’ priorities. Thus, the best stimulus plan is to allow the market mechanism to operate freely, as permitting the market to operate freely results in some economic activities disappearing while some other activities will be expanded.</p>
<p>Loose fiscal and monetary policies do not rescue the economy, but, instead, rescue activities that are generating products that are on the low priority list of consumers. Policies based on loose money creation and spending sustain waste and promote inefficiency, draining resources from activities that generate wealth.</p>
<h4>Why Doing Nothing Is the Best Policy to Revive the Economy</h4>
<p>Decades of reckless monetary and fiscal policies have severely damaged the process of real wealth generation. More loose policies cannot make the current situation better. On the contrary, such policies only further delay the economic recovery.</p>
<p>The best economic policy is for the Fed and the government to immediately stop their economic interventions. By doing nothing the Fed and the government will enable wealth generators to accumulate real savings. (The policy of doing nothing will force various activities that add nothing to the pool of real savings disappear. This will make the life of wealth generators much easier).</p>
<p>Over time, the expanding pool of real savings will set a platform for the further expansion of various wealth generating activities. So the sooner the Fed and the government remove themselves from the economy, the sooner a genuine economic recovery is going to emerge.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Contrary to pundits, neither the Fed nor the government’s loose monetary and fiscal policies can cause an expansion in the pool of real savings. On the contrary, loose policies only weaken the process of real savings formation thereby weakening prospects for a sustained economic expansion.</p>
<p>If loose monetary and fiscal policies could set in motion economic growth, then by now all the poverty in the world would have been eradicated. The only reason why in the past loose monetary and fiscal policies appeared to have been effective is because the pool of real savings was expanding.</p>
<p>Once this pool becomes stagnant, declining the illusion of the effectiveness of these policies is shattered. The more aggressive the fiscal and monetary policies stance is the worse the economic conditions become. If the pool of real savings is still intact, then there is no need for the Keynesian policies to revive the economy—the pool will do it. If the pool is in trouble, the Keynesian policies will only make things much worse could cause a prolonged economic depression. Hence the best policy is to do nothing.</p>

 <description><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/elon-musk-completes-44-bln-acquisition-twitter-2022-10-28/">takeover</a> of Twitter and his immediate firing of top brass represents a potential weakening of the Big Digital woke cartel that controls information, censors content, censures and bans users, and serves as a propaganda arm of leftist totalitarian statists. Given their cooperation with and promotion of leftist statism, it is more than evident that Twitter, Facebook, Google, and others have served as state apparatuses, as what I <a href="https://mises.org/wire/google-election">have called</a> “governmentalities.” Musk’s takeover not only represents a potential blow to the woke cartel but also to the globalist statists whom it so assiduously serves.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://mises.org/wire/elon-musks-twitter-gambit-and-what-it-means-clique-power">argued</a> that Musk’s Twitter gambit represents an important test case for the woke cartel because it pits “the world’s richest man” against these agents of the state. Musk’s takeover will now demonstrate just how much this cartel and the statists they support can manage to infringe property rights by controlling what Musk can do with his own property.</p>
<p>Already the European Union [EU] is threatening Musk with control of Twitter’s content. After Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585841080431321088">tweeted</a> “the bird is freed,” EU industry chief Thierry Breton <a href="https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1585902196864045056">tweeted</a> “[i]n Europe, the bird will fly by our EU rules." Breton was indirectly referring to the EU’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2545">Digital Services Act</a>, which aims to ban “illegal and harmful content” across Europe.</p>
<p>But the Digital Services Act threatens to universalize content moderation by social media and search engines, subjecting them to the EU’s stringent and anti-free-speech laws against “disinformation” and “hate speech,” which are not (yet) recognized legal categories in the United States. Given that Twitter will be forced to abide by EU-enforced content moderation for its EU users, it is possible that it will simply apply the Digital Services Act’s rules to all content—unless Twitter builds algorithms that allow it to distinguish between EU-originated posts and those deriving from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Shortly after Musk moved to buy Twitter, several dozen countries and international governance bodies—including the U.S. and EU—announced the <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Declaration-for-the-Future-for-the-Internet.pdf">ratification of the “Declaration for the Future of the Internet,</a>” which, among other things, aims to “bolster resilience to disinformation and misinformation, and increase participation in democratic processes [sic].” Two days after Musk announced that he was buying Twitter, the Biden administration <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-biden-administration-creates-disinformation-governance-board-under-dhs-to-fight-misinformation">announced</a> the formation of a “Disinformation Governance Board,” which has since been scrapped, at least for now.</p>
<p>It’s not as if the woke cartel and the leftist totalitarian statism that it supports are going to simply take Musk’s incursion into major social media ownership laying down. This fight will show how important information control is to “<a href="https://mises.org/library/road-totalitarianism">the clique in power</a>.”</p>
<p>Musk is by no means a model for free market libertarians, but his takeover and remodeling of Twitter is no less a significant eventuality in the struggle for liberty against the woke cartel and the state that it supports. What happens on Twitter will not only be a test of Musk’s sincerity and resolve but also of the power of the woke cartel’s regime for enforcing state dictates and narratives.</p>
<p>I am one of the <a href="https://www.legitgov.org/michael-rectenwalds-appeal-twitter-after-musk-takeover">recent victims</a> of Twitter’s cancellation of dissident voices. I believe I was cancelled because I argued that the transgender movement is part of a neo-Malthusian depopulation regime (while also a means for dismantling the family). Now that Musk is at the helm, I am hoping for reinstatement (and verification). But I’m not holding my breath.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Charles Dunoyer and French Classical Liberalism]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60504</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>(Barthelemy) Charles (Pierre Joseph) Dunoyer (1786–1862) was born on May 20, 1786 at Carennac in ancient Turenne (Quercy, Cahorsin), the present-day Lot. His father, Jean-Jacques- Philippe Dunoyer, was seigneur de Segonzac. Destined at an early age for the order of St. Jean de Malte, he began his education in the order's near-by house at Martel. With the confiscation of the order's houses in 1792, his aunt, formerly of the Visitation order, and, then, the former Benedictine prior of Carennac, continued his education at home. His secondary education was completed at Cahors in the <em>école centrale</em>, one of the newly established schools under the Directory in which the ideas of the 18th century philosophes, and especially, the Ideologues, predominated. In 1803, Dunoyer went to Paris to study law at the newly founded Université de Jurisprudence.</p>
<p>Dunoyer arrived in Paris as a major intellectual and political era was ending and a new one—the Empire—was beginning. Dunoyer's education at the <em>école centrale</em> had introduced him to the major thinkers of the Enlightenment and their followers during the Revolution and Directory. Beginning in 1800 a strong campaign against the Enlightenment was initiated in Paris, but was countered with lessening impact by the major organ of the philosophe tradition, <em>La Décade Philosophique</em>, of which the principal editor had been Jean-Baptiste Say (1767–1832). Say was general editor of the <em>Décade</em> from its founding (An II, April 29, 1794) until his entry into the Tribunat in 1800.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref1_7xznxub" title="The Décade was suspended in 1807." href="#footnote1_7xznxub">1</a> The education with which Dunoyer came to Paris was the product of the work of a number of men who contributed to the <em>Décade</em>.</p>
<p>Pierre Claude Franpis Daunou (1761–1840). who was to be closely associated with Charles Dunoyer during the Restoration, was the major force in the development of the <em>écoles centrales</em> as he had been for the creation of the <em>Institut de France</em>. During 1791–1792 Talleyrand had proposed a secondary education based on languages, literature, history and ethics; and Condorcet had countered with an emphasis on mathematics, sciences, and the political and moral sciences. In 1795, after a proposal by Lakanal for a more scientific program, a less scientific one of Daunou was adopted. Earlier, Daunou, along with Lakanal and Sieyès, desired that education be freed to be supplied by private initiative. Daunou emphasized that liberty was a necessary condition for scientific progress. This concept formed an important part of the educational and economic thought of Destutt de Tracy, who was active in educational policy under the Directory as well as a leading Ideologue. François Guillaume Andrieux, president of the Tribunat and contributor to the <em>Décade Traité d'économie politique</em> (1803), for which he was not renewed in the Tribunat.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref2_kgwkeek" title="Joanna Kitchin, La Décade (1794–1807), Un Journal "Philosophique", (Paris: Lettres Modernes, 1965), pp. 3–10, 179–184, 200. The success of the école centrale of the departrnent of Lot, from the Ideologue point of view, was noted in an article on education in La Décade (October 22, 1801, p. 161) by one of its co-editors, Pierre-Louis Ginguené. Charles Hunter Van Duza, Contribution of the Ideologues to French Revolutionary Thought (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1935, ), pp. 141–142." href="#footnote2_kgwkeek">2</a></p>
<p>The <em>Décade</em> was particularly significant in the history of economic thought. It contributed strongly to the development of Say's thinking, and Say was the most important economist in France during the Restoration. What would become even more accentuated in Say's <em>Traité</em>, the <em>Décade</em> was a major means of introducing the economic ideas of Adam Smith in a France where the concepts of the Physiocrats had been dominant. While Condorcet represented the beginning of a transition from the exclusive agrarianism of the Physiocrats, his initiatives toward industrialism remained limited. But, the impact of the industrial revolution in France (it had reached the point of inaugurating the standardization of manufactured elements by 1785) upon Condorcet, had more far-reaching repercussions on the thinking of Say and Destutt de Tracy. However, the frame of reference of the Physiocrats remained significant. For them, natural society existed before the state. Natural society was absolute, necessary and permanent; the state was relative, accidental and provisional. The Physiocrats' anarchism looked forward to the disappearance of the State. Condorcet strongly articulated this individualism, and his thought was accorded more attention than anyone else's in the <em>Décade</em>.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref3_b5ar472" title="Kitchin, La Décade, pp. 110–136, 198; Georges Gurvitch, Industrialisation et Technocratie (Paris: Librarie Armand Colin, 1949), p. 10; Gurvitch, L'Idée du Droit Social Notion et Système du Droit Social, Histoire de dectrine dupuis le XVII sieclé jusqu à la fin du XIX, sieclé. (Paris: Librairie du Recueil, Sirey, 1931), pp. 236–260, 272." href="#footnote3_b5ar472">3</a></p>
<p>For Say, industrialism and anarchism found their model in the United States, just as Chinese agrarian despotism was the model for most Physiocrats. The Physiocrats' preference for a "refined", communal, agricultural, old, tired, bureaucratic society had been opposed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's "common", individualist, non-agricultural craftsman, young, fresh, non-bureaucratic society. "In passing simply from the refinement of an old society tightly formed around agriculture to the industrial activity of a new society, we again go forward from the Physiocrats to Rousseau. It is always the romanticism of the noble savage under a different form". Say held that only man in a state of advanced personal well-being could achieve the natural perfection of which Rousseau spoke. Only where the society is natural can natural and social perfection be achieved; economic society for Say is natural, but political society is not natural and thus inhibits man's perfection. "J.-B. Say is in agreement with Rousseau in proclaiming that political society is assuredly not natural".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref4_llb4wr5" title="Ernest Teilhac, L'Oeuvre économique de Jean Baptist Say (Paris: Librairie Felix Alcan, 1927), pp. 176, 164.

<p>Dunoyer's interest in the United States in his own writings and in articles (especially about Franklin) in his periodicals, reflected a similar interest on the part of the Ideologues and especially Say in the <em>Décade</em>. Say was critical of the Federalists and of the speculators in government business and securities who might introduce materialism and large fortunes destructive of capitalism in America. For Say, as for many French radicals, Rousseau was associated with Franklin (and Jefferson). The second part of Franklin's <em>Autobiography</em> was first printed by the <em>Décade</em> in 1798 under Say's editorship; he also printed various letters and essays of Franklin. Robert Fulton represented an ideal American in Paris with his book on improvement of canal navigation, which Say reviewed, and his successful steamship sailing on the Seine. Say, in 1803, sent Jefferson a copy of his <em>Traité</em> accompanied by a letter:</p>
<p class="indent2">It is likewise your task to demonstrate to the friends of liberty throughout Europe how great an extent of personal liberty is compatible with the maintenance of the social body. It will then no longer be possible to defile by excesses the noblest of causes; and it will perhaps finally be perceived that civil liberty is the true goal of social organization, and that we must consider political liberty only as a means of attaining this end. The United States are the children of Europe; but the children are greater than the parents. We are old parents raised in foolish prejudices, chained by a mass of ancient fetters, and bound by a quantity of puerile considerations. You will show us the true ways to free ourselves from them. For you have done more than win your liberty; you have established it.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref5_r6t4dd0" title="Durnad Echeverria, Mirage in the West, A history of the French Image of American Society to 1815 (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1957), pp. 275, 215, 222–224, 232; Kitcin, La Décade, pp. 194–195." href="#footnote5_r6t4dd0">5</a></p>
<p>For Say, America was the model of the young, fresh, active, unrefined society whose industrialism and anarchism would contribute to human perfection. He said in the <em>Traité</em>:</p>
<p class="indent2">Here we indicate the point of contact between political economy and pure politics. Everyone is convinced that the sacrifices that the state of society imposes on us are especially the least where the government is best . . . In which country is one best governed, that is to say least governed at the cheapest cost than in the United States?<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref6_qxt3k7l" title="Teilhac, Say, p. 176; Say, Traité d'economie politique (Paris, 1803), I, 393." href="#footnote6_qxt3k7l">6</a></p>
<p>Say's optimism and naturalism was fundamental to the economic thought which he introduced. These premises were basic to many of the Physiocrats as well as to Rousseau. The Physiocrats placed the age of gold in the future, in contrast to Rousseau; they posited an individual naturalism <em>a posteriori</em> to Rousseau's individual naturalism <em>apriori</em>. The influence of Rousseau's individualism along with that of Adam Smith caused Say to negate the political means which many Physiocrats had favored. The individualism of Say's thought led his economic naturalism to obviate the political system. With reference to Rousseau,</p>
<p class="indent2">The economic utilitarianism is extended to the individual. Individual naturalism is extended to the economy. It is from this conjunction that the new naturalism is born. And here is how, while for Rousseau social utilitarianism was the means of individual naturalism, Say, after having strictly separated in his heart political society and economy, posited simply that political utilitarianism is the superfluous and temporary means of a naturalism not only individual but economic, of that natural coincidence of individual utilitarianism and economic utilitarianism.</p>
<p class="indent2">If one goes to the foundation of things one would conclude finally that Say continues Rousseau much more than he contradicts him.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref7_a67jb8y" title="Teilhac, Say, pp. 176–177, 193, 68, 79." href="#footnote7_a67jb8y">7</a></p>
<p>Adam Smith differed from the Physiocrats in putting aside their acceptance of a political system which they hoped to rationalize. His contribution was rooted in a utilitarian naturalism in which economic and social relations flourished in the absence of political action, however rational the intention. Say derived his basic concepts directly and indirectly from Smith. It was upon Smith's optimism and naturalism that much of the controversial literature was based among the English radicals following the French Revolution. Just as Say and the French school of economists were favorable to the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution in line with Smith's followers, Malthus and the English school opposed them or saw them as evils however necessary.</p>
<p>To a major degree, the English radicals moved from the Rousseauan Declaration of Rights, which they recognized as an insufficient guarantee of natural rights, to the necessity of abolition of the political system.</p>
<p class="indent2">Amongst these democrats, who were opposed to Burke, Mackintosh, Paine, Godwin submitted so strongly to the influence of Smith that they ended by showing themselves the insufficiency of the Declaration of Rights. Nothing catches this more than to see Mackintosh subordinate natural rights to utility, Paine simply juxtaposed the two doctrines, and Godwin, finally, sensing the necessity of choosing, perfected the ideas of Paine in disassociating government and society, in showing that, far from relaxing the social bond, the abolition of government binds it tighter. . . Godwin in accord with the tradition of utilitarian naturalism of Smith, had sacrificed politics to economics. It was economics that the artificial utilitarianism of Bentham sacrificed to politics.</p>
<p class="indent2">Is that to say that it is Godwin who founded political economy? No! For it is perhaps more against him than against Bentham that Malthus and Ricardo established theirs . . . Godwin developed optimistic utilitarian naturalism, Malthus pessimistic utilitarian naturalism. It is in this way that one is able to say to the <em>Essays on the Principle of Population</em> that it is a rejoinder against the <em>Wealth of Nations</em> . . . According to Malthus, evil will not be able to be destroyed either by political action, contrary to what Bentham thought, nor by the abolition of government, contrary to what Godwin thought. If government can achieve nothing against economic reality, it becomes an integral part of that reality.</p>
<p class="indent2">. . ., is it not Adam Smith's optimistic utilitarianism that J.B. Say begins anew? In such a manner that definitely will his political economy be founded actually less against Godwin than against Bentham, and less against the utilitarian rationalism of Bentham than against the pessimistic utilitarian naturalism of Malthus and Ricard?<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref8_lf3ped7" title="Ibid., 231–233." href="#footnote8_lf3ped7">8</a></p>
<p>The pessimistic utilitarianism of Malthus and Ricardo in opposition to Godwin and his Smithian optimism was rooted in the crises of overproduction occurring during the period of the wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon. The crises of overproduction confronted economists with a profound challenge to the conception of economic science. Say demonstrated against Malthus the economic impossibility of overproduction. In his analysis of the extra-economic, the anti-economic or political, causes of overproduction, against Malthus' incorporation of government into economic reality, Say affirmed his renowned Law of Markets.</p>
<p>The division between optimism and pessimism had important roots in the respective attitudes toward industrialization. Just as Malthus' work was a response to Smith through Godwin. Say's <em>industrialisme</em> was a reaffirmation of Smith and Godwin. Smith's positive economic attitude toward industry distinguished him from the Physiocrats. "If from the <em>Wealth of Nations</em>, the <em>Traité</em> of Say derived in one part only his germs of industrialism, he derived in another part only the single optimistic branch of his utilitarian naturalism; and he made this double part coincide. If he industrialized nature, he naturalized industry".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref9_n1c3xxr" title="Ibid., 228." href="#footnote9_n1c3xxr">9</a> The application of industrialization in absolute freedom would result in general well-being. The <em>Décade</em> perceived an indefinitely increasing prosperity due to economic freedom or capitalism, and to the use of machinery applying new technology and scientific discoveries. For Say, the facility of amassing capital was one of the causes of indefinite human perfectibility.</p>
<p class="indent2">For the <em>Décade</em>, one of the great advantages of the system of laissez-faire is that it prevents excessive enrichment due to monopolies and tariffs of a small number of privileged families, and that it diffuses very widely the profits of industry . . . But these measures of general utility (the liberalism of Smith and Say, for example) would they have a noticeable effect on the poor? The <em>Décade</em> believed it would, at least in what concerned economic freedom. The liberation of work by the abolition of feudal rights and of corporations seemed to it already an immense social progress. Its hopes for future progress of the people was founded on the anticipated effects of the system of laissez-faire joined to the mechanization of industry: national prosperity without precedent, work for all, lower prices due to competition, and to standardized manufacturing production. It is an industrial revolution similar to the manufacturing movement in England that Jean-Baptiste Say emphasized.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref10_roa8ngd" title="Kitchin, La Décade, pp. 197–198, 146." href="#footnote10_roa8ngd">10</a></p>
<p>Say credited his friend the abbe Henri Grégoire, the founder of the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers, with recognizing the human progress which machinery was providing. The <em>Décade </em>called for concentration on production of articles of wide use, and "occupied itself constantly in inventions and new technology".</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>La Décade</em> insisted on the importance of machinery and kept its readers current with the most recent developments in this field. It presented regular accounts of the sessions of the Lycée des Arts (the society founded in 1792 for the propagation of useful discoveries) and occupied itself with the industrial expositions which took place in Paris every year from 1797 of the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry (founded in 1801) and of the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers (decreed in 1794).<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref11_2ciwfb3" title="Ibid., pp. 197–145–146." href="#footnote11_2ciwfb3">11</a></p>
<p>Industrialization had an important practical effect on capital, leading to one of Say's major contributions to economics. The revolution had reduced the importance of the privileged "capital" of the old regime, and had freed men to acquire capital outside the role of the state and thus to improve the general interest. The industrial revolution represented the great increase of this capital and the reduction of privileged "capital". Income on capital represented a reward to the capitalist for saving and for foregoing the use of savings rather than merely an insurance for risk. The rise in the price of capital in industrial society no longer reflected the scarcity of capital, but the increase in productive use of capital. This contrasts with the conception of Malthus and Ricardo and placed Say in radical opposition to the pessimistic English school.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref12_0n1fzeb" title="Teilhac, Say, pp. 112–120." href="#footnote12_0n1fzeb">12</a></p>
<p class="indent2">The development of the industrial revolution had held the attention of Say less on the already old phenomenon of the division of labor than on the entirely new phenomenon of mechanization which had caused the <em>industrialisme</em> of Say, passing beyond Smith, to return to naturalism."<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref13_e47os3s" title="Ibid., pp. 102, 137." href="#footnote13_e47os3s">13</a></p>
<p class="indent2">From its birth, this harmonious conception wits destined to be broken; and, if the progress which the economics of J.-B. Say realized was more distinct in relation to his contemporaries than in relation to his predecessors, it was perhaps still more distinct in relation to his immediate successors . . . the industrialist idea passed in turn to the <em>Censeur</em> and to its editors: Charles Comte, Dunoyer and Augustin Thierry, in order to reach in the end to Saint-Simon and to Karl Marx ...</p>
<p>"Political Economy", said the <em>Censeur Européen</em> at the end of a review of Say's <em>Traité</em>, "in making seen how peoples prosper and decline, has posed the true foundations of political thought". Even as there was no longer economic science strictly speaking, there ought no longer to be a pure political science. There is political economy.</p>
<p class="indent2">. . . And the progressive effacement that they marked of the warrior spirit before the industrial spirit was a veritable theory of historical materialism. As remarkable as their internal political conception was their international relations. The system of European equilibrium was only "an old used machine", a perpetual menace of war. The <em>Censeur</em> opposed to it the theory of markets and the real international entente that it engenders. There are no more than two great nations: the European nation of the producers, the industrials; as to the other, it is the old Europe battling against the new. But, if the relationship of the economic liberalism of J.-B. Say and the political liberalism of the <em>Censeur</em> is tight, it does not cover one difference. The sole criticism that Dunoyer addressed to his master is of not having seen that his doctrine was in itself a system of political thought and of having reduced the system of political thought to mere constitutional forms.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref14_9fsfgf4" title="Ibid., pp. 241, 243–244," href="#footnote14_9fsfgf4">14</a></p>
<p>However, the flowering of Say's impact on Dunoyer was to occur only after a postponement of a dozen years. For when Dunoyer came to Paris in 1803 under the impact of the philosophical and literary views for which the <em>Décade </em> was the spokesman, the intellectual affinity was broken due to Say's leaving Paris in that year. The very publication of the <em>Traité</em> was the cause of Say's removal from Paris as a result of his elimination from the Tribunat. Refusing an offer from Napoleon of a position in the financial department, Say undertook to apply the recent developments in machinery to industrial production. He established a cotton spinnery which eventually employed almost 400 persons at Aulchy in Pas-de-Calais. When he sold his business a decade later and returned to the intellectual life of Paris as the Empire was coming to its conclusion, Say brought with him a complete knowledge of the role and the effects of industrialization on modern society.</p>
<p class="indent2">J.-B. Say was intimately involved in the emergence of large scale industry. He was, in effect, one of the most remarkable types of these manufacturers of the Consulate and of the Empire, of these first great" entrepreneurs who sought to place in operation the new technological processes.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref15_lw2jlx6" title="Ibid., pp. 24–26; Charles Comte, "Notice historique sur la vie et les ouvrages de J.-B. Say", Mélanges...de J.-B. Say (Paris: Chamerot, 1833), p. xi." href="#footnote15_lw2jlx6">15</a></p>
<p>Equally important, during that decade Say was able to clarify the social thought which he had expressed in the <em>Traité</em> and to publish in 1814 the second edition which was to have a central importance on the development of the thought of Charles Dunoyer and Charles Comte and through them on many others. When Say had launched his <em>industrialisme</em> in 1803, he faced the strong opposition of the writers who were tied to the economic patterns and thought of the 18th century. By 1814 the industrial revolution on the continent, alongside that of England, clearly indicated that new ways of thinking about reality were necessary. The material conditions as well as the intellectual conditions were ready for <em>industrialisme</em> after 1814.</p>
<p class="indent2">But since 1789 industry had tripled the <em>Censeur</em> <em>Européen</em> and Saint-Simon triumphed. If Stendhal remained curiously hostile to industrialism, Benjamin Constant in 1818, and especially in 1829, allowed himself to approach it probably under the influence of the success of J.-B.Say.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref16_pmq8o9g" title="Teilhac, Say, p. 220." href="#footnote16_pmq8o9g">16</a></p>
<p>Dunoyer's lively interest in philosophy and literature remained guarded after his arrival in Paris in 1803, under the chilling impact of the emerging imperial regime. Dunoyer pursued his law studies and translated the Novelles of the Emperor Leo III. In 1807 he met (François) Charles (Louis) Comte (1782–1837) who came from Sainte-Enimie, Lozére. Comte had arrived in Paris alone without entrée or fortune, but with a rude aspect and energetic character. Later, he would occupy a special place among the friends of Odilon Barrot (1791–1873), who was a compatriot from Villefort, Lozére, and who said of Comte: "His conversations and his examples fortified and purified in me the sentiment of liberalism of which my education and my origins had given me the germ."<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref17_g3nerpw" title="Charles Almeras, Odilon Barrot (Paris: Éditions Xavier Mappus, 1950), pp. 22–24." href="#footnote17_g3nerpw">17</a> Charles Comte was working on a study of the jurisprudence of Sirey when he and Dunoyer became friends. At his parents' insistence, the reluctant Dunoyer left his scholarly pursuits in Paris and entered government service under the Empire. He became the secretary of a family friend, Baron Bertrand Bessières (1773–1855) of Prayssac (Lot), who was sent as intendant to northern Spain (1810–1811). Bessières, who had been a Napoleonic general de cavalerie and later defended Marechal Ney, was the younger brother of Marechal Jean Baptiste Bessières, duc d'Istria, who was the commander of French armies in northern Spain. Dunoyer's experience in Spain and his respect for the Spanish Liberals opposed by the traditionalists and the Anglophile constitutionalists, was to manifest itself in his discussion of Spanish events in his articles during the Restoration. Following his service in Spain, Dunoyer acted as the secretary to another family friend who was an official in the administration of Holland. There the police methods of the imperial government caused him to become completely opposed to the Empire and to return to Paris.</p>
<p>Dunoyer welcomed the actions of the Senate deposing Napoleon, appointing a provisional government and preparing a constitution, especially with the leadership of such liberal senators as Garat, Grégoire, Lanjuinais, Destutt de Tracy and Lambrechts. A new constitution was issued by the Senate on April 6, 1814, and the Comte de Provence was called to the throne of a constitutional monarchy. Dunoyer was one of the gentlemen of the National Guard cavalry formed as a guard of honor for the Comte d'Artois on his entry into Paris in April. But, Dunoyer withdrew from the guard of honor when the Senate's constitution was set aside by the new king, Louis XVIII, in his declaration of Saint-Ouen on May 2–3. Dunoyer published a pamphlet regarding the constitution: <em>Réponse à quelques pamphlets contre la constitution</em>. Dunoyer was critical of the <em>Charte</em> issued by the royal government on June 4, in response to the pressure of the Coalition Allies occupying Paris, following the treaty of Paris (May 30, 1814) which ended the war.</p>
<p>Dunoyer was then invited by Charles Comte to join him in the publication of a weekly journal, <em>Le Censeur</em>. The first volume (June 12– September 30, 1814) was published as a weekly until a strong censorship law was established. The <em>Censeur</em> declared in an advertisement:</p>
<p class="indent2">Strangers to all the governments which have succeeded each other in France during the mace of twenty years. We have, in writing, only the interest which ought to animate all Frenchmen, that of seeing our fellow citizens obey the law, respect public morals and resist oppression. What men of such and such a Party, or such and such a sect, should not look for, then, in this work, is what will feed their passions, for they will find here nothing which will be able to please them.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref18_ixlr9cs" title="Le Censeur, volume I; the advertisement is bound at the beginning of the first volume." href="#footnote18_ixlr9cs">18</a></p>
<p>Despite their disappointments regarding the <em>Charte</em>, Dunoyer and Comte believed it capable of forming the basis for increased freedom and thus ending the successive revolutions which the French had experienced, but which had not in turn increased freedom. Dunoyer and Comte hoped that the royalists would be satisfied to find the Bourbons on the throne, and accept limited monarchy and cabinet government. They believed that constitutionalists would see the <em>Charte</em> as a major accomplishment in which most of their principles were clearly established. While the Bonapartists, as the most recent government, were least easily reconciled, they were seekers of office and power, and could become important if the government were to fail. Republicans were advised that the forms were less important than the content and that, with the <em>Charte</em>, France like England was a true republic in all but name. England was a contradiction to Dunoyer and Comte. In the midst of liberal and radical French opinion for which England represented an ideal, the <em>Censeur</em> became increasingly skeptical and finally abandoned its mild anglophilia for anglophobia. Since this evolution accompanied their increasing discouragement with the failures of the Restoration government and its violations of the <em>Charte</em>, it is possible that opened eyes saw wider than France and gained a depth of insight regarding England as well. With regard to <em>Le Mythe Anglais</em>, "the influence of the <em>Censeur</em> was not negligible"; "it was the most important of the secondary reviews".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref19_d6cbnty" title="Pierre Roboul, Le Mythe Anglais dans la littérature française sous la Restauration (Lille: Bibliothèque Universitaire, 1962), p. 377." href="#footnote19_d6cbnty">19</a></p>
<p>Dunoyer felt that France had only a pale reflection of the English constitution because English society had strong foundations for liberty. Like other French radicals, he saw the defeat of Napoleon as a vindication of their ideas. The <em>Censeur</em> (September, 1914) wrote: "the English have presented themselves mainly as liberators". Yet, Dunoyer's memories of the role of the English and their allies in Spain, a theme of his writings over these years, as well as England's war against the United States, raised doubts as to England's disinterested diplomacy. Despite its belief that England's intention was hegemony, the <em>Censeur</em> could prefer an alliance with England over one with Russia. The <em>Censeur</em>'s Anglophobia was much deeper and analytic than the conceptions of "Perfidious Albion" of an Etienne de Jouy or of the "Noble England" of a Mme. de Stael. The depth of Dunoyer's analyses of England is evidenced in the impact that the <em>Censeur</em> had on Benjamin Constant's thinking. In this as in other areas the <em>Censeur</em> was part of the dialogue of attraction and criticism which they carried on to the end of Constant's life. Constant's conception of a free England was modified increasingly to a criticism of England. "Without doubt, in his portrayal of the economic and social evolution of England, Constant was inspired by the brochures and articles of J.-B. Say as by the <em>Censeur</em>, taking account of the sentiments of his public and of the disquiet which had provoked the social and political troubles of Great Britain".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref20_qpr7j5q" title="Ibid., pp. 101, 14–20, 60–65, 77–102." href="#footnote20_qpr7j5q">20</a> This development of ideas regarding England occurred throughout the Left in France with the <em>Censeur</em> in the forefront.</p>
<p class="indent2"><em>On the Left</em>, one discovers with a certain astonishment that the banner of liberty covers henceforth an aristocratic merchandise. They begin to envisage that England may cease being the forerunner of civilization. Have not its ministers made themselves the recognized protectors of continental <em>reaction</em>? Moreover, one would wish to be a <em>patriote</em>! Many former officers of the <em>Grande Armée</em> still resented the humiliation of the defeat; many former prisoners or former soldiers recalled the essential themes of revolutionary and imperial propaganda. The <em>Left </em>had hardly more unity than the <em>Right</em>: less still perhaps. Some hated, some admired, others exploited, some desired to imitate. C.A. Scheffer and, in a lesser measure, the staff of the <em>Censeur </em>began to critize the very idea of country.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref21_6pbpza4" title="Ibid., p. 115." href="#footnote21_6pbpza4">21</a></p>
<p>This development did not include all those associated with the <em>Censeur</em>. Henri de Saint- Simon and his secretary Augustin Thierry expressed a deep Anglophilism in the <em>Censeur</em>, especially on the English parliamentary system. (Saint-Simon's "De Réorganisation de la Société Européene", <em>Le Censeur</em>, III): "In his articles in the <em>Censeur</em>, he gave the same England as an example to the French: she had known how to resolve the problem of relations between the ministers and the opposition".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref22_66aziug" title="Ibid., 320–321." href="#footnote22_66aziug">22</a> Furthermore, the shift to an anti-English position resulted from the increasingly central importance for Comte and Dunoyer of economic thought. "For the readers of the <em>Censeur</em> . . . political economy eclipsed philosophy. In a certain measure, it replaced it."<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref23_u85ffnt" title="Ibid., p. 320." href="#footnote23_u85ffnt">23</a> It was ironic that at first this economic thought was English; Charles Comte had an acquaintance with Jeremy Bentham's writings. Dunoyer and Comte were interested in the less traditional writing which was being published in England and found that writing to be congenial to the cosmopolitan attitudes they inherited from the philosophes, the Ideologues and the <em>Décade</em>.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref24_h5k3s1f" title="Ibid., p. 38; it is likely that Comte became acquainted with Bentham's works through the French translations by the Genevan, Pierre Etienne Dumont, who acted as Bentham's literary secretary. Dumont had made Bentham known to French-speaking readers by the translation and publication of the strictly laissez-faire Manual of Political Economy in the Bibliothèque britannique (Geneva, 1797–1798). Published in French through Dumont's editing were Bentham's Traité de législation civile et penal (1802) and Théorie des peines el des récompenses (1811), published in English only in 1825." href="#footnote24_h5k3s1f">24</a></p>
<p>Thus, the first volume of the <em>Censeur</em> was launched in June, 1814 with certain significant political attitudes and concepts but with sufficient open-endedness to encourage and experience growth. This was in addition to the spirit of independence and criticism for which the <em>Censeur</em> was particularly famous. Eugène Hatin, in his discussion of the press under the Restoration, has noted:</p>
<p class="indent2">The only truly independent journal of the epoch was <em>Le Censeur</em>. <em>Le Censeur</em> had been created by two of those young men for whom the imperial despotism contradicted all their ideas, revolted all their sentiments, and who despite their patriotism, had seen in the day of March 31 the signal of universal deliverance. Admitted to the intimacy of the most distinguished members of the liberal minority of the Senate and of the philosophic party, the Tracys, the Lanjuinais', the Lenoir-Laroches, the Lambrechts', the Volneys, and the Cahanis', Comte and Dunoyer had imbibed a horror of tyranny, and it was to prevent its return that they had taken their stand . . . the ideas which, in its first numbers, <em>Le Censeur</em> expressed and developed in a firm and grave tone, contrasted singularly with most of the writings currently published. In sum, it was a support rather than a danger to the constitutional government of June 4, if that government would march directly along its path; but it would encounter in the new paper an inflexible censor every time that it deviated.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref25_qwqhhb4" title="Eugène Hatin, Histoire politique et littéraire de la presse en France. La presse moderne, 1789–1860. La presses sous la Restauration (Genèva: Slatkine Reprints, 1967, Paris, 1859–1861), VIII, 82–86." href="#footnote25_qwqhhb4">25</a></p>
<p>But, the ministry did deviate rather quickly from the principles which Dunoyer believed were consecrated in the <em>Charte</em>. This was especially true concerning freedom of the press, which to Comte and Dunoyer was the basis of all other freedoms. Respect for freedom of the press had been accepted in the royal declaration of Saint-Ouen on May 2, 1814. The <em>Charte</em> of June 4 provided in article eight: "The French have the right to publish and to print their opinions, in conformity to the laws which ought to punish abuses of this freedom". An alternative interpretation of this article was supplied by the ministry almost immediately. The concept of punishment following the commission of an act was accepted by Dunoyer all his life as the basis of law; the concept of prevention by the government was rejected by Dunoyer to the end of his career. The minister of the interior, the abbé de Montesquiou, declared that "punish" and "prevent" were synonymous, and presented to the chamber of deputies on July 5, 1814 a proposed law interpreting punish as the same as prevent. The proposed law was the work of Royer-Collard, <em>directeur de la librairie</em>, and Guizot, secretary general of the ministry of interior, who were the leading figures in the Restoration party known as the Doctrinaires. That law was ultimately passed by the legislature, and became effective on October 21, 1814. According to Hatin: "The press did not remain mute. A newly founded journal, which had come to enjoy a major role and to exercise a decisive influence in these years of crisis, <em>Le Censeur</em>, of which we will speak below, burst forth above all with a great force and great hardiness against that law, 'as despotic in its base as it was liberal in its form'. . . It was not only that unique liberal journal of the epoch which attacked the proposed law".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref26_bfh214l" title="Ibid., pp. 41–46, 49–52, 71–75." href="#footnote26_bfh214l">26</a> Moderate royalist journals such as the <em>Journal de Paris</em> and <em>Journal des Débats</em>, attacked the law, but the brunt of the counter-attack by the ultra-royalists was aimed at the <em>Censeur</em>. The <em>Quotidienne</em> "described the liberals as Jacobins on half-pay, and compared <em>le Censeur</em> to Marat's paper", <em>L'Ami du Peuple</em>.</p>
<p>Politics during the succeeding months of the first Restoration did not give Dunoyer and Comte confidence in the way that the ministry would apply the new law on journalistic writings. The new censorship applied to publications of less than 320 pages; the second through the seventh volumes of the <em>Censeur</em> (November 10, 1814–September 6, 1815) were therefore published in the form of books. As Benjamin Constant touchingly described the situation in his <em>De M. Dunoyer et de Quelques-uns de ses ouvrages</em>:</p>
<p class="indent2">. . . Nevertheless, the laws on writings, however absurd they are, have this advantage, that in order to study, one will try to elude them. The law on the press submitted to the censorship works of less than twenty printed sheets. Thus books of twenty and a half printed sheets were publishable: and writers who, having only one truth to develop, would express it in four pages, would look for others who together would form a volume.</p>
<p class="indent2">Such was the origin of the <em>Censeur européen</em>, to which the authors, MM. Comte and Dunoyer, devoted themselves with good faith and with courage, to the study, which one could call experimental, of the solidity of the guarnatees which the new pact promised to the nation. The laws contrary to these guarantees having been proposed by a timid and crafty ministry, and voted by the ignorant and docile Chambers, M. Dunoyer combatted them. Having raised persecutions against himself, this audacious patriot showed himself, in his defense, more occupied with the public interest than with his own.</p>
<p class="indent2">At his risk and peril, he seized that occasion to expose the vices of our legislation, the insufficiency of the protection that citizens may expect, and the arbitrariness of authority made possible by the administrative and judicial disposition bequested by the empire to the monarchy.</p>
<p class="indent2">He conquered in that way, for us and our heirs, a part of our liberties. For, although he did not came to obtain for them the institutions which render them inviolable, his example and his writings had popularized the notions which, while not consecrated in theory, became victorious in practice, when the general assent encompassed them. . . . The germs deposited, in 1814, in the <em>Censeur européen</em>, have developed and born fruit.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref27_7jcau3c" title="Benjamin Constant, Mélanges (Paris, 1829)." href="#footnote27_7jcau3c">27</a></p>
<p>Thus, the <em>Censeur</em> was published as a volume of more than 320 pages without any announced date. Publication dates in the future were arbitrarily chosen once each volume was printed, in order to avoid being considered a regular periodical. Volume II was dated November 15, 1814; volume III, December 20, 1814; volume IV, March 1, 1815; volume V, April 18, 1815; volume VI, June 1, 1815; and volume VII, September 6, 1815, but most of the copies were seized by the ministry of police of the second Restoration on September 4, 1815. As a pattern, the <em>Censeur</em>'s second volume was issued at an interval of a month and a half. The more than two months elapsing between the third volume, December 20, 1814 and the fourth volume, March 1, 1815, is explained by Charles Comte's involvement as the lawyer for General René Joseph Excelmans (1775–1852). General Excelmans took a leading role in the defense of France during the Allied invasion of 1814. He was prosecuted by the Restoration government's minister of war, Marshall Soult, in 1814. Comte prepared Excelmans' case in December, 1814, and appeared before the council of war at Lille, on January 23, 1815, where Excelmans was acquitted. The delay between the publication of volume six and volume seven 3 months later occurred during the transition from the Hundred Days to the second Restoration.</p>
<p>During the Hundred Days, Dunoyer and Comte had refused to leave Paris, for which they were condemned by royalists, and refused to support the new imperial regime, for which they were criticized by Bonapartists. Their strong criticisms of the Hundred Days brought a brief delay in volume five's distribution due to a temporary confiscation. Constant and Carnot intervened in the matter, and Baron Legoux, <em>procureur général</em>, suspended any action to prosecute the <em>Censeur</em>. The role of Fouché in initiating the action was suspected, as Dunoyer and Comte rejected his requests that they work with him in his interest. Hatin has commented:</p>
<p class="indent2"><em>Le Censeur</em> was heard every hour to reprimand so vigorously the newspapers on their pusillanimity, and without doubt proved to them how far one was able to be bold. It is said that Fauché, wishing to attach to himself the editors of that paper, had offered to them the editorship of the <em>Moniteur</em>; then, on their refusal, had given them the choice of places which would be agreeable to them. But Comte and Dunoyer had rebuffed these offers, and they had remained inflexible in their opposition to the imperial government, an opposition which, it is very necessary to say, was not under the circumstances, very intelligent or very patriotic.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref28_1dn3m97" title="Hatin, La Presse, p. 127." href="#footnote28_1dn3m97">28</a></p>
<p>Hatin, among others, has attacked the liberal opposition under the Hundred Days as non-patriots; he objected to the <em>Censeur</em>'s criticism of the imperial regime while French troops moved to the frontier to meet the Allied armies before Waterloo. The <em>Censeur</em> made quips about "<em>De l'influence de la moustache sur le raisonnement, et de la nécessiée du sabre dans I'administration</em>". However, the Hundred Days made a deep intellectual impact upon Dunoyer and Comte. The beginning of the major philosophic change leading to the important contributions to political, economic and social thought for which they become renowned can be dated from then. That impact went far beyond the quips about military men in government or the legitimacy of the imperial regime, although Hatin notes the importance of their attitude on that question during the Hundred Days.</p>
<p class="indent2">April 20, one month after the return from Elbe, <em>Le Censeur</em> said: "The government is only a provisional government. It is of little importance that Napoleon has been proclaimed emperor by the army and by the inhabitants of the country through which he passed; of little importance that the coalition powers had or had not held to the conventions that they had made with him. France does not belong to the soldiers, nor to the inhabitants found on the route from Cannes to Paris.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref29_8jmiphu" title="Ibid., p. 127." href="#footnote29_8jmiphu">29</a></p>
<p>In the intense atmosphere of repression at the beginning of the second Restoration, Dunoyer and Comte encountered hostility from the ultraroyalists. But the seizure of the seventh volume of the <em>Censeur</em> occurred while Fouché was still minister of police, and appeared to be on his instigation. Dunoyer and Comte did not continue the periodical while the seizure of the seventh volume was in the courts, and they pursued the matter through the courts for over a year. They hoped that the decision of the courts would be in their favor, and when they planned to renew publication following September 5, 1816, which they considered the beginning of a third Restoration, they wished to reissue the seventh volume of the <em>Censeur</em> as the first volume of the <em>Censeur européen</em>, their new periodical. After further delay, they recognized that their appeals would be denied, and launched the <em>Censeur européen</em> without the seventh volume.</p>
<p>Concerning the suspension of the <em>Censeur</em> after the seizure of the seventh volume in September, 1815, Dunoyer and Comte later declared:</p>
<p class="indent2">The chamber of deputies of 1815 was convoked and the majority of members showed so much violence that all discussion became impossible. Not able to place itself in a party which, in its resolutions, seemed to take for its guide only furors, and not wishing to support a ministry which showed itself much too weak when it would defend justice, and much too strong when it attacked constitutional principles, men who did not hold to any faction and did not aspire to any favor could only condemn themselves to silence. This was the part which the authors of the <em>Censeur</em> took.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref30_itc9lb4" title="Ibid., p. 281." href="#footnote30_itc9lb4">30</a></p>
<p>However, Dunoyer and Comte put their enforced leisure to good advantage. It was during 1815–1816 that they thought deeply about the ideas and concepts that had been raised for them during the Hundred Days by the actual political events and debates, and by the insights that these events gave to the social and economic thought which they were reading at that time. From that reading, beginning in the spring of 1815, came the new direction of their thinking, <em>industrialisme</em>, which first received expression in the periodical which they launched in the autumn of 1816, the <em>Censeur européen</em>, and which had both an immediate and long-lasting impact on the social thought of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Contemporary Restoration commentators indicate the high regard in which Dunoyer's and Comte's journalism was held. Restoration writers were ranked according to conscience and talents by Lebrun-Tossa, in his <em>Consciences littéraires d'a présent, avec un tableau de leurs valeurs comparées, indiquent de plus, les degrés de talent et d'esprit par un jury de vrais libéraux:</em><a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref31_xt4axug" title="Ephraim Harpaz, "Sur un Ecrit de Jeunesse d'Augustine Thierry", Revue d'historie littéraire de la France, LIX, No. 3, p. 344.

<p>The accession of the Decazes ministry had encouraged Dunoyer and Comte to launch the<em> <em>Censeur européen</em> </em>late in 1816 (it was published in twelve volumes until April 17, 1819). But, in June, 1817, the third volume was seized in a complicated case secretly pressed by important government officials and carried through under the charge against Dunoyer and Comte of Bonapartism. Comte fled arrest and went into hiding; Dunoyer was apprehended; and the editorship of the <em><em>Censeur européen</em> </em>was placed in the hands of their principal assistant, Augustin Thierry, who took the occasion to place in the<em> <em>Censeur européen</em> </em>over 300 pages of his<em> <em>Vue des revolutions d'Angleterre</em>. Dunoyer </em>was held for a month in the Force prison, and then transferred to Rennes, where the government's case had been initiated. The liberal notables supported Dunoyer as sureties and organized a society to support the legal costs of this and other press trials. Dunoyer, defended at Rennes by Mérilhou, was convicted; but the case contributed to the development of liberal consciousness in France, and particularly in western France. The<em> <em>Journal général</em> </em>was suspended because it described one of the serenades presented to Dunoyer in front of the prison by the youth of Rennes. Appeals reduced the severity of the sentences but not the conviction.</p>
<p class="indent2">This process against the<em> <em>Censeur</em> </em>caused for the first time to appear major manifestos of political doctrine signed by the most considerable members of the legal profession. M. Mérilhou, defender of MM. Comte and Dunoyer, produced in support of his plea a consultation of twenty-one lawyers among which one notes MM. Dupin, Persil. Parquin, Hennequin, Mauguin, Berryer fils, and some other names which ought to find celebrity in these press battles. The consultation bore principally on principles. The publisher, M. Dupin, established the famous distinction "Between the attacks which are directed against the person or constitutional authority of the king, and the criticisms directly only against his<em> <em>ministers</em></em> or the acts of his governments."<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref32_q1gog4z" title="Ibid., pp. 287–289. Perhaps as a result of his prosecutions, Dunoyer became increasingly active in behind-the-scenes radical political activity such as the election campaign for deputy by Lafayette in the fall of 1818: "The successful candidate arrived in Paris at the beginning of November, 1818, accompanied by his friends Dunoyer and Victor de Broglie." Maurice de la Fuye and Emile Bameau, "The Phase of Abortive Conspiracies", The Apostle of Liberty, a Life of La Fayette (London: Thames & Hudson, 1956). pp. 243-245." href="#footnote32_q1gog4z">32</a></p>
<p>With the increasingly liberal press laws, Dunoyer and Comte decided to publish the <em><em>Censeur européen</em> </em>as a daily newspaper. It was issued in two volumes from June 15, 1819 to June 23, 1820. It was suspended as a separate publication amidst the reaction to the assassination of the duc de Berry in February, 1820; the<em> <em>Censeur européen</em> </em>was merged with the<em> <em>Courrier français</em>. </em>However, Hatin has indicated the origin of the reaction in the moves by Decages against the<em> <em>Socété des amis de Iiberté de la presse</em></em>, which had been established by liberal notables in 1817 in defense of Dunoyer and continued to defend the<em> <em>Censeur européen</em> </em>and other periodicals in press cases. The Society was the center for radical political activity leading to the Left's electoral victories in 1817, 1818, and 1819. The Society's leaders were condemned and it was dissolved. The Society had had a <em>comité directeur</em> drawn from its most resolute members such as members of the <em>Union Libérale</em> of Paris. The<em> Union Libérale</em> appears to have been a vague, loose revolutionary coalition involving Paris notables, Paris youth, and provincial people, centering around Lafayette's salon in Paris and his château at Lagrange. Members were said to include legislators such as Lafayette, Voyer d'Argenson, Dupont de I'Eure, De Corcelles pere, General J.-J. Tarayre, General M.-J. Demarchy, journalists such as Dunoyer, Comte, Chatelain of the <em>Courrier français</em>, and Desloges of the <em>Journal du Commerce</em>, lawyers such as Joseph Mérilhou and Odilon Barrot, and a younger group including Paul Dubois, Theodore Jouffroy, Victor Cousin, Francois de Corcelle fils, Felix Barthe, Augustin Thierry, and the Scheffer brothers, Ary, Henri and Arnold who was Lafayette's secretary. J.-B. Say, whose daughter, Adrienne, married Charles Comte in 1818, has been mentioned as a participant.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref33_x8s84tg" title="Hatin, La Presse, pp. 307–313; Alan B. Spitzer, Old Hatreds and Young Hopes, The French Carbonari against the Bourbon Restoration (Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 1971), pp. 33–35, 38, 212–215, 242." href="#footnote33_x8s84tg">33</a></p>
<p>Say's role, like that of Dunoyer and Comte, in revolutionary political activity in 1820, while unexpected is not unnatural. Teilhac has said:</p>
<p class="indent2">If we see then in J.-B. Say the man of the French political revolution and of the Anglo-French industrial revolution, the man of political Ideology and of economic Utilitarianism, he joined not only formal classical rationalism to a fundamental economic naturalism but to this economic naturalism a political rationalism.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref34_n0puhel" title="Teilhac, Say, p. 50." href="#footnote34_n0puhel">34</a></p>
<p>John Stuart Mill visited Say in Paris in 1820 and observed: "He belonged to the last generation of men of the French Revolution; he was the ideal type of true French republican". Similarly, Auguste Blanqui recalled: "I had had in my youth the honor of knowing the most eminent of French economists: J.-B. Say . . . J.-B. Say had very revolutionary ideas for the times. He detested at the same time the Bourbons and Bonaparte, an apparent contradiction which filled me with astonishment".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref35_9gm4r50" title="Ibid., pp. 49–50." href="#footnote35_9gm4r50">35</a> In 1824, Frederic Jean Witt was interrogated by Bavarian police on revolutionary activities. Witt had been in Paris in 1818 and 1820, where he declared himself to have been in political contact with Lafayette, Comte and Dunoyer, and made himself their means of communication with radical elements in Germany.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref36_i6iztdh" title="Spitzer, Old Hatreds, pp. 203–204." href="#footnote36_i6iztdh">36</a></p>
<p>The reaction of 1820 introduced a press law of March 31 which required submission of all periodicals to censorship before publication, and granted to the government the power to suspend any publication accused of infraction of the law even before a judicial decision. Lafayette in March, 1820, said of the press law that it was a violation of the <em><em>Charte</em>: "</em>to violate it is to annul it, to dissolve the mutual guarantees of the nation and the throne, to restore us to ourselves in all the primitive independence of our rights and our duties". General Tarayer, in June, declared to the deputies: "the<em> <em>Charte</em> </em>is violated, and there remains to France no legal and regular means of defense against an ill-intentioned government". The ministry altered the electoral system, presenting in May, 1820 a law of the double vote, weighing the electoral system in favor of wealthy landholders. Liberals withdrew from the chamber of deputies for the remainder of the session, and the Right accused the Left of preparing to turn to illegal actions. There were protests in Paris leading to a riot on June 5. It was in this atmosphere that the <em>Censeur européen</em>'s publication was suspended on June 23, 1820. There followed an attempt at a military conspiracy in which Lafayette's circle, especially Arnold Scheffer, were implicated: the plot of August 19, 1819. Charles Comte went into exile in Switzerland; Dunoyer remained in Paris where he was involved in the government's prosecutions against the <em>Censeur européen</em>.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref37_kuro39x" title="Ibid., pp. 37–50; members of a committee indicted before the Cours d'Assies, on June 29, 1820, included Lafayette, Comte, and Barrot.

<p>Charles Comte settled in the Vaud which, in 1821, named him professor of natural law at the University of Lausanne. Either in Switzerland or Paris, Witt introduced him to Karl Follen, who had been a political refugee from the Prussian University of Jena, following the assassination of Kotzebue in March, 1819; Follen was forced to move from France to Switzerland in 1820. Follen became professor of law at the University of Basel. Following Witt's revelations to the Bavarian police in April, 1824, the Prussian government demanded the surrender of Follen, who was given refuge in the United States and appointed to the faculty of Harvard University (1825–1835) where he became a leading abolitionist. Comte similarly was forced to leave Switzerland on May 15, 1824 when, on the basis of Witt's statements, the French government intervened against Comte with the government of Vaud. Comte and his wife spent eighteen months in England in the company of James and John Stuart Mill and other philosophical radicals.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref38_c35dhqf" title="Spitzer, Old Hatreds, p. 205." href="#footnote38_c35dhqf">38</a></p>
<p>Comte returned to France following his five years' exile,<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref39_j6zb9mh" title="Auguste Comte commented on Charles Comte's arrival in Paris: "Comte of the Censeur has returned a little while ago to Paris, where he will establish himself permanently.

Other editors were Voyer d'Argenson, Arnold Scheffer, and Armand Carrel, with Augustin Thierry as secretary. Comte wrote an important treatise on property, and published on similar topics. He was active in the opposition which led to the July Revolution of 1830. While Barrot became the prefect of the Seine, Comte was appointed a <em>procureur du roi.</em> But he resigned in 1831 and was elected a deputy by Mamers (Sarthe) and was reelected in 1834. During 1832 Comte and Barrot were active in defending newspapers against increasing prosecutions by the government. In 1832, Comte was appointed perpetual secretary of the newly reestablished Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. Charles Comte died on April 13, 1837.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref40_a15pcrn" title="Harpaz . "Jeunesse d'Augustin Thierry", p. 349; Almeras, Barrot, p. 98. On November 6. 1830 Comte Charles de Lameth denounced abuses of freedom of the press; Comte, procureur du roi, on November 9 asked Lameth to make known such works to the courts as were open to any citizen. Lameth claimed that Comte was seeking judicial control over legislative statements. The chamber named a committee headed by Antoine Vatimesnil, who as a prosecutor during the Restoration had never supported parliamentary privileges, but had been a major force in the prosecution of Dunoyer and Comte. While declaring that Comte's action had threatened the rights of the chamber and approving Lameth's refusal to accept Comte's request, Comte was excused on the basis of the circumstances and the declarations he had made. In opposition to the committee's conclusions, Benjamin Constant made his last speech in the chamber on November 19, 1830. Constant held that Comte had the right to request Lameth to submit any fact; Lameth had the right to refuse according to his conscience; and the chamber had not any right to judge Comte because it was not a power of the legislature.

<p>The suspension of the<em> <em>Censeur européen</em> </em>in June, 1820 found Dunoyer with the highest reputation as a political publicist, a reputation which was to be long-lasting. Hatin has said:</p>
<p class="indent2">We have seen what reproaches had been made against the authors of<em> <em>Le Censeur</em></em>, and which as to basics and which as to form; but they have the incontestable merit of having dared first, since the Restoration, to profess with freedom the constitutional principles in all their integrity, and of having constantly sustained them, without ever making any concession to the military spirit or to bonapartism; they have yet the rare merit of having devoted themselves to proving by experience the vices of the legislation which then regulated the press.</p>
<p class="indent2">Among the collaborators of MM. Comte and Dunoyer, we will name Scheffer, J.-B. Say and Daunou, of which the articles <em><em>sur ler garanties</em> </em>were very remarkable. Paul-Louis Courier published there, between April 1819 and July 1820, the letters where one finds the ideal of his politics, and where he begins to design the original form of his style . . .<em>Le Censeur</em>, said M. Nettement, was the banner of the stoic school, which wished the complete and immediate application of the principle of political perfectibility, of nearly absolute liberty, without taking enough account of the political difficulties that the Restoration encountered. It was, to tell the truth, a renaissance of the movement of 1789, with that theoretical optimism which took its source in the best intentions, but which did not create in the least any grave perils.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref41_y6ck7dl" title="Hatin, La Presse, pp. 290–291." href="#footnote41_y6ck7dl">41</a></p>
<p>During the remaining decade of the Restoration, Dunoyer remained active in the political opposition associated with the Lafayettes, de Broglies and de Staels. In 1822, Dunoyer wrote a pamphlet, <em>Lettre à un électeur de departement</em>, and another in 1824, <em>Du droit de petition à I'occasion des élections</em>. Dunoyer and Comte became members (February, 1826) of the forerunner of the "Adie-toi et le Ciel t'aidera" (which was instrumental in the July Revolution); this was "La Société des Sciences morales et politiques", which was under the aegis of Benjamin Constant and included Barrot, Mérilhou, Mauguin, duc de Broglie, Auguste de Stael and Guizot.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref42_35fe7e7" title="Almeras, Barrot, pp. 37–38." href="#footnote42_35fe7e7">42</a> Dunoyer's public contribution to the July Days was an open letter in <em>Le National</em> (July 26, 1830) declaring his refusal to pay taxes until the ordinances of Charles X were revoked.</p>
<p>Dunoyer's political role during the Restoration can best be described as that of ideological leadership and of strategist and adviser, rather than political leadership<em> per se</em>, despite the prominence he achieved from his several political trials in the courts and his well-publicized political imprisonments. Guillaume de Bertier de Sauvigny has well recognized the uniqueness of the political role occupied by Dunoyer:</p>
<p class="indent2"><em><em>Le Censeur</em></em>, despite its powerful interest for the history of ideas, represented a relatively isolated voice; its editors, Comte and Dunoyer, were too concerned to raise themselves above the partisan passions of their epoch, too oriented toward the future of the nascent industrial society, to consider them representatives of a notable section of opinion.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref43_4b0khbc" title="G. de Bertier de Sauvigny, "Preface", in Ephraim Harpaz, L'École Liberale sous la Restauration, Travaux à l'Ethico-Politique (Genèva: Librairie Droz, 1969), XVI, ix; M. Girard, "Les Liberaux des Gauche ou Independents de 1814 à 1824", Le Libéralisme en France de 1814 à 1848: Doctrine et mouvement (Paris: Centre de Documentation Universitaire, 1966), I, 148–168; II, 151–158." href="#footnote43_4b0khbc">43</a></p>
<p>Dunoyer's political role of ideologist and councillor was indistinguishable from the intellectual importance which Bertier de Sauvigny justly attributed to him. This activity continued to be manifest in the periodical press of the later Restoration, in the<em> <em>Revue encyclopedique</em></em>, in the<em> <em>Journal de debats</em></em>, and in the <em><em>Revue française</em></em>. But, the center of Dunoyer's intellectual contribution was the continuity and organization of the ideas, especially<em> <em>industrialisme</em></em>, which had been conceived and developed in the <em><em>Censeur</em> </em>and the<em> <em>Censeur européen</em>. </em>On the suspension of the<em> <em>Censeur européen</em></em>, Dunoyer embarked upon a course of lectures at the Athénée Saint-Germain, at which J.-B. Say had been presenting his lectures on economics for several years and Benjamin Constant had initiated his course on political thought. These lectures of Dunoyer formed the basis of his book, published in 1825,<em> <em>L'industrie et la morale considérées dans leur rapport aver liberté</em>. </em>A revised version was published in 1830,<em><em> Nouveau traité d'économie sociale, ou simple exposition des causes sous l'influence des quelles les hommes parviennent à uses de leur forces avec le plus de liberté, c'est-à-dire aver le plus de facilité et de puissance</em> </em>(the bulk of this publication was destroyed by fire before distribution in 1830).<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref44_2rus0ws" title="Albert Schatz, "Ch. Dunoyer et la Définition de la Liberté", L'lndividualisme économique et social (Paris: Librairie Armand Colin, 1907), pp. 196–215; Gaston Richard, "Le philosophie et L'individualisme économique: l'école positiviste.

<p>Dunoyer has been viewed as part of the broad society of intellectuals considered as the later Ideologues or the disciples of the Ideologues. Dunoyer was intermediate between Ideologue economists, Destutt de Tracy and Say, historians, C.F. Volney and P.C.F. Daunou, and the Younger disciples such as Augustin Thierry and Victor Jacquemont, whose friends, in addition to Dunoyer, encompassed Fauriel, Mérimée, Monzoni and Stendhal.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref45_mlo02wg" title="Fr. Picavet, Les Ideologues (Paris: Felix Alcan, 1891), pp. 334–409, 419–422,479–489" href="#footnote45_mlo02wg">45</a> However, in contrast to the generally literary approach of the later Ideologues, Dunoyer carried the precision of the scientific attitudes of de Tracy and Say to their logical conclusions. The radical optimisim of their naturalist philosophy was such that, according to Roger Soltau, "Jean-Baptiste Say proclaims his belief in 'the natural march of things', Dunoyer 'anticipated Spencer' (according to Taine) in his championship of the absolute 'freedom of labour', Garnier even denied the right of the State to issue currency, Bastiat [Soltau quoting Guido de Ruggiero] is an echo of eighteenth-century optimism with its identification of private and public interests, and the hostility towards the State which marks the earlier Liberalism".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref46_67t69o2" title="Roger Henry Soltau, French Political Thought in the 19th Century (New York: Russell & Russell, 1959), p. 130; Guido de Ruggiero, The History of European Liberalism (trans. R.G. Collingwood) (Boston: Beacon Press, 1959), p. 187; on Dunoyer and Censeur, ibid., pp. 172–173, 453." href="#footnote46_67t69o2">46</a></p>
<p>Dunoyer opposed legislation as attempts to prevent voluntary relations by words or actions between individuals. If at all, there should be only the application of judicial decision when a crime is committed; for example, it should be immoral to establish any regulation of the practice of medicine. Anyone undertaking its practice would accept the risk of judicial punishment should an injury be criminal. Relations would be defined by processes of contract, sureties and insurance. The production of security and justice would be a result of market functions and transactions. As Albert Schatz notes with reference to Dunoyer's ideas:</p>
<p class="indent2">So understood, the governmental function needs a small number of agents, the mass of workers remaining available to increase the sum of social utilities other than security. It is proper then to diminish the number of public offices and officers, and to employ to this end the single efficacious means, which is to reduce the rewards or salaries. It is of little importance, moreover, whether the signboard of the company charged with ordinary security be monarchy or republic, provided that it cost little and disturb no one at all, that it realize progressively this ideal in a society so perfectly developed that government disappears, leaving to the inhabitants the full enjoyment of their time, their wealth and their liberty.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref47_l4xrgmy" title="Schatz, L'Individualisme, pp. 210–211." href="#footnote47_l4xrgmy">47</a></p>
<p>Dunoyer's precision of thought, following de Tracy and Say, and derived from scientific attitudes, contributed to the impact and the close relations which he had with Auguste Comte. Henri Michel has called Dunoyer the "positivist before positivism".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref48_z6e707d" title="Henri Michel, L'Ideé de l'État, Essai critique sur l'histoire des théories sociales et politiques dupuis la révolution (Paris: Hachette, 1895), p. 345." href="#footnote48_z6e707d">48</a> Dunoyer became acquainted with Auguste Comte when he became Saint-Simon's secretary in mid-1817 following Augustin Thierry's break with Saint-Simon and his full association with Dunoyer on the <em>Censeur européen</em>. After Comte's resignation in a couple of years as Saint-Simon's secretary, he, too, wrote for the <em>Censeur européen</em> and remained in intellectual contact (even when all other contact was excluded) with Dunoyer throughout his life. (Comte died in 1857.) Henri Gouhier in <em>La Jeunesse d'Auguste Comte et la formation dupositivisme</em>, tome III, <em>Auguste Comte et Saint-Simon</em>, emphasizes the role of Dunoyer in Comte's life. In <em>Appendice I, Le Censeur européen</em>, Gouhier says:</p>
<p class="indent2">The liberal and antifeudal thought expressed discreetly in the constitutional journals, the <em>Journal de Paris</em> and the <em>Journal général</em>, was expressed more freely in <em>Le Censeur</em> of Charles Comte and Charles Dunoyer, "of which each edition was an event" (Houssaye, 1815, <em>La première Restauration</em> . . . p. 67).</p>
<p class="indent2">This publication enjoyed a certain role in the formation of positivism . . . Auguste Comte became part of the staff during 1819 . . . Finally, around this review there was an intellectual and political milieu: "l'école positive de MM. Comte et Dunoyer", wrote Saint-Beuve (<em>Causeries du lundi</em>, t. II, 6e edition, Garnier, M.de Broglie, p. 381). These youth had a spirit which must be acknowledged. The founder of sociology has never forgotten it; in 1857, he called <em>Le Censeur</em> "the only periodical publication which posterity will honor in French journalism: (<em>System</em>, 5. IV, Preface de l'appendice general, p. 11). Comte's personal relations with Dunoyer have always been clear; the economist sent him his works and Comte never ceased to feel for him a profound esteem; in 1845, at the time when his reading was reduced practically to a few inquiries, he permitted himself "one special exception to his severe <em>hygène cérébrate</em>" (A Mill 28 fevrier, 1845, p. 410) in opening <em>La liberté du travail</em>. "In sum", he said to John Stuart Mill, "M. Dunoyer whom I have known more than twenty-five years, has always seemed to me one of my immediate predecessors who merits the entirety of my sympathies" (A Mill, p. 409). On diverse occasions, Comte noted what he owed to his work. It is Dunoyer and not J.-B. Say who figured as the associate of Adam Smith in the positivist calendar.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref49_ksxru45" title="Gouhier, La Jeunesse, pp. 408–409." href="#footnote49_ksxru45">49</a></p>
<p>It is in the emergence of the concept of social science that Auguste Comte found common ground with Dunoyer. The <em>Censeur europée</em>n, which spoke of a "laic breviary for liberals" in strongly recommending Daunou's <em>Essai historique sur la puissance temporelle des papes</em> (4th ed., 1818; 1st ed., 1810) was a far cry from Joseph de Maistre's <em>Du Pape</em> (1821) which Comte claimed was the source of more of his ideas than any other book. Dunoyer's anarchism, individualism and tolerance was in opposition to Comte's concern for the decay of traditional morals and hostility to intellectual divergences.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref50_htms709" title="Soltau, "The Authority of Science, I. August Comte", French Political Thought, pp. 203–215." href="#footnote50_htms709">50</a> The infallability and dominance of society posited by de Maistre was totally appealing to Comte in the early 1820s. The programs of the rulers were acceptable in contrast to the radical criticism of the opposition.</p>
<p>Dunoyer's criticism of the concept of indefinite perfectibility, however, while praised by Comte, would involve him in a major debate with Benjamin Constant, but the immediate consequence was a temporary break between Dunoyer and Stendhal. Fernand Rude, in "La Querelle des Industriels (1825)", <em>Stendhal et</em> <em>La Pensée sociale de Son Temps</em>, describes the circumstances, beginning with the publication of Dunoyer's book.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref51_hn9x2fh" title="Fernand Rude, Stendhal et La Pensée sociale de Son Temps (Paris: Plon, 1967), pp. 101–180." href="#footnote51_hn9x2fh">51</a></p>
<p class="indent2">In a letter to the <em>London Magazine</em>, dated October 11, 1825, he [Stendhal announced that Charles Barthelemy Dunoyer, who in collaboration with Charles Comte. had published <em>Le Censeur européen</em> and who is "one of the most powerful intellectuals of France", is on the point of publishing "a profound treatise" entitled "la morale et l'industrie considerées dans leurs rapports avec liberté". Except for the inversion of <em>industrie</em> and <em>morale</em> it is in fact the exact title. "This book of Dunoyer is too true to be sermonized . . . His work is a faithful table of the state of our society during the last thirty-five years. And in a word, his work is a very good supplement to Mignet's <em>Histoire de la Revolution</em>".</p>
<p class="indent2">In another letter of November 18, 1825, the "small nephew of Grimm" characterized this work as "admirable" and felicitated him on his success which, said he, "to my great surprise . . . goes to a crescendo". All the gentlemen who wish to think read M. Dunoyer. Six years ago, no one had understood him.</p>
<p class="indent2">Dunoyer had presented a course in the winter of 1825 at the Athénée which constituted a veritable plea for <em>industrialisme</em>. It was in fact the rough draft of his major book . . . The epigraph of this work gives the resume of it: "We become free only in becoming industrious and moral . . ." Here is what Dunoyer wished to demonstrate. And for this, said he, it is necessary to consider, not the governments but the masses; the state of their industry and of their morals. Throughout that book, this author never separates in effect the progress of industry from the progress of morals and of liberty . . . "Under the name of administration, I know not what monstrous, immense corpus, extending to all its innumerable hands, putting its shackles on everything, levying enormous taxes, bending by fraud, corruption, violence, all the political powers to its designs, exhaling chiefly the spirit of ambition which produced it, and the spirit of servility which conserves it". More even than of Saint-Simon, this indictment makes us think of Proudhon . . . [the <em>industriel</em> people are] . . . "those where it is no longer the passion for power that reigns, but the passion to work". . . . "In the beginning, the dominating classes are all, and the laboring classes nothing; in the end, the dominating classes will be nothing, at least so far as dominating, and the laboring classes will be all; society will be constituted for work".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref52_7nnprt9" title="Ibid., pp. 105–109, 113–114." href="#footnote52_7nnprt9">52</a></p>
<p>For Dunoyer, <em>industrialisme</em> was the exact opposite of theft. Any action which was not the result of a freely chosen choice was a theft. That is why he admired the American state constitutions of the Revolution, especially that of Pennsylvania; that was a model because the government appeared to have the character of an industrial enterprise in which everyone was a voluntary associate. Similarly, he admired America's decentralism which he believed was the result of America's <em>industrialisme</em>. <em>Industrialisme</em> would dissolve states as the universality of mankind was rooted in free labor.</p>
<p class="indent2">It is the spirit of domination which has formed these monstrous aggregations or which has rendered them necessary; it is the spirit of industry which will dissolve them: one of its ends, one of its greatest and most salutary effects must be to municipalize the world. . . . The centers of action will be multiplied; and finally the vastest countries will end by presenting only a single people, composed of an infinite number of uniform aggregates, aggregates between which will be established without confusion and without violence, the most complex and at the same time the most easy, the most peaceful and the most profitable relations.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref53_397g4um" title="Charles-Barthélemy Dunoyer, L'lndustrie el La Morale (Paris: Sautelet, 1825), pp. 336–367, Cf. Odilon Barrot, De la centralization et des ser Effets (Paris: Dumineray, 1861)." href="#footnote53_397g4um">53</a></p>
<p>Rude notes that in his letter of November 18, 1825, Stendhal singles out a noteworthy aspect of Dunoyer's book.</p>
<p class="indent2">There is a passage which had particularly struck Stendhal. "M. Dunoyer, equally intrepid to blame the people of France, as to attack its tyrants, in place of flattering them basely in the fashion of the <em>Constitutionnel</em>, tells them courageously the truth. . . M. Dunoyer is the Sole liberal writer who does not flatter the nation and is bold to tell them: 'You make yourselves slaves, that is why you have tyrants. Each people has never more liberty than it forces its sovereign to accord to them'."<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref54_nhrq990" title="Rude, Stendhal, p. 113." href="#footnote54_nhrq990">54</a></p>
<p>The contacts between Dunoyer and Stendhal were based upon more than common friends, such as the young Victor Jacquemont or the elderly Destutt de Tracy. For two decades Stendhal had been a student of economics; he considered himself a disciple of Smith, Say and de Tracy.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref55_189ue79" title="Rude, "Les 'Apprentissages' de Stendhal, 2, L'économie politique", ibid., pp. 57–98." href="#footnote55_189ue79">55</a> Since Dunoyer was the major writer and lecturer continuing Say's contributions, it was natural that Stendhal would know Dunoyer, as well as take a direct interest in the development of <em>industrialisme</em>. Along with Condorcet's <em>Equisse</em> and Volney's <em>Ruines</em>, the young Stendhal had been strongly influenced by the writings of William Godwin, and was praising Godwin's work in the early 1820s. Godwin's heroes, who were "at open war with their oppressors", were one of the inspirations for Stendhal's <em>The Red and the Black</em> (1830).<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref56_3rk68xs" title="Rude, "Les 'Apprentissages' de Stendhal, 1, L'Idéologue", ibid., pp. 17–56." href="#footnote56_3rk68xs">56</a> <em>The Red and the Black</em> was inspired by a number of sources during the 1820s and included material which Stendhal took from the manuscripts of his late fellow citizen of Grenoble, Barnave.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref57_mj8hfb5" title="Emanuel Chill, "Introductory Essay", Power, Property, and History, Barnave's Introduction to the French Revolution and Other Writings (New York: Harper & Row, 1971), p. 70." href="#footnote57_mj8hfb5">57</a> Barnave's then unpublished <em>Introduction to the French Revolution</em> presented one of the earliest statements of elements of the analysis characterized as <em>industrialisme</em>. Stendhal is a potential source for Dunoyer's being informed of Barnave's thought before the publication of Barnave's works in 1843 by Alphonse Marie Bérenger de la Drôme (1785–1855). Rude writes:</p>
<p class="indent2">We know the veneration which from his most youthful years Stendhal had for Barnave, "that great spirit". He speaks of him repeatedly in his <em>Mémoirs d'un touriste</em> and he notes even: "If I had the space, I would cite a curious manuscript of his". In effect Stendhal knew the sister of Barnave, Mme. Saint Germain, as well as Bérenger de la Drôrne, who in 1843 published the <em>Oeuvres de Barnave</em>.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref58_t03rzqf" title="Rude, Stendhal, p. 235; Fernand Rude, ed., Barnave: Introduction à la Révolution Française (Paris: Librairie Arman Colin, 1960)." href="#footnote58_t03rzqf">58</a></p>
<p>Dunoyer's disagreement with Stendhal arose from the printing in late November 1825 of Stendhal's booklet, <em>D'un nouveau complot contre les industriels</em>, issued by their common publisher, Sautelet. Dunoyer was unhappy over the publication of an attack on <em>industrialisme</em> since his book was the principal and most widely known treatise on the subject. Stendhal had been prompted to write his pamphlet by Saint-Simon's <em>Catéchisme des industriels</em> (issued in four <em>cahiers</em> between December, 1823 and June, 1824). Rude believes that the <em>nouveau complot</em> was written in early 1825 but that the publication was postponed by Saint-Simon's death on May 19, 1825, and resumed by Stendhal with the launching by Saint-Simon's disciples of the magazine <em>Le Producteur</em> at the time of a speculative coup by Saint-Simonian bankers.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref59_2e6okog" title="Rude, Stendhal, p. 40." href="#footnote59_2e6okog">59</a></p>
<p>In the <em>Catéchisme</em>, Saint-Simon had attacked the "bourgeois", the lawyers, military officers and government bondholders (to which group Stendhal felt an affinity) and described banking as a new, higher form of industry which would lead to the reign of the bankers. Saint-Simon called for a union of the center-left with the center-right, the industrialists and the royalist ministerials, against the liberals. Saint-Simon expressed pleasure at the liberal party's destruction at the hands of the royalist ministry and wished the industrialists to repudiate liberalism because its critical and anti-organizational attitudes were revolutionary. Stendhal saw this project for a union of the bankers with the government as the <em>complot</em> against the liberals and the industrialists. Stendhal declared his faith in economics and in industrialization. Industry was one of the "great strengths of civilization", and he looked forward to its progress as it would lead the French to "put into practice the <em>Charte</em>": As a supporter of the producing majority against the governors, Stendhal opposed the substitution of "the most important industrials" as governors in place of the existing governors. Stendhal feared that Saint-Simonianism was a diversion from the struggle for liberty, was a weapon against liberalism, and was aimed at enshrining the rule of Baron de Rothschild and the other half dozen major bankers.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref60_exjn43s" title="Rude, Stendhal, pp. 131–137." href="#footnote60_exjn43s">60</a></p>
<p><em>Le Producteur</em>, which was published by Saint-Simon's disciples with the support of a number of bankers headed by Jacques Laffitte, appeared on October 1, 1825; Cerclet was editor and Enfantin and Bazard were the publishers. In the early issues was a reprint of a chapter from Dunoyer's new book, a review by Say and articles by Auguste Comte, in which he declared that out of the scientific class, the engineers were forming a separate corporate class to act as intermediaries between the industrialists and the scientists (Comte also emphasized spiritual power as the new approach which Saint-Simon was initiating before his death). Stendhal wrote an article for the <em>London Magazine</em> (October 11, 1825) which was mostly favorable but which for the first time publicly linked the editors of <em>Le Producteur</em> with Saint-Simon. For they had attempted to present the whole spectrum of <em>industrialiste </em>authors rather than the narrow Saint-Simonian publication it would become. Indeed, there was a clear presentation of the diversity of <em>industrialiste</em> analyses. Say, in a review of McCulloch's <em>Political Economy</em> (<em>Le Producteur</em>, No. 5, October 29, 1825), attacked the Ricardian theory of value based solely on the quantity of labor in the product. Prosper Enfantin (No. 6, November 5, 1825) supported Ricardo and McCulloch against Say's economic analysis. Enfantin's article carried Ricardian classical economics, long before Marx, to the logical conclusion that Marx was to reach. In addition, there were articles on positivist literature against which Stendhal rebelled.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref61_4oux8o6" title="Ibid., pp. 115–124; Georges Weill, L'École Saint-Simonienne (Paris, 1899), pp. 9–10." href="#footnote61_4oux8o6">61</a></p>
<p>However, the matter which triggered Stendhal's booklet was a speculative coup which received the support of <em>Le Producteur</em>. Its first issue had proposed a company of the bankers of Europe with Laffitte at its head to become a Holy Alliance of the Bankers. French bankers had made loans to King Ferdinand VII at the same time as the martyrdom of the Spanish liberal Riégo; Laffitte in July 1824 had aided the Villele ministry in its financial difficulty with the government debt. Finally, the bankers associated with the Saint-Simonians had been engaged in making loans to the Pasha of Egypt to purchase ships and arms to fight against the Greek revolution. The last straw for Stendhal was a loan to Haiti to be negotiated by Ternaux which was much discussed in the early issues of <em>Le Producteur</em>. On November 3, 1825 two sets of equal bids were submitted by Pillet-Will, and by André Delessert and Casimir Périer. The next day the loan was granted to Laffitte and the Rothschild brothers.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref62_a49bugq" title="Rude, Stendhal, pp. 97, 101, 124–127." href="#footnote62_a49bugq">62</a></p>
<p>Stendhal expressed his earliest criticism of the position of <em>Le Producteur</em> in conjunction with his distress over the Haitian loan (November 10) and added that issue to the manuscript he had written on Saint-Simon's <em>Catéchisme</em> and the earlier activities of the bankers. Stendhal's <em>D'un nouveau complot contre les industriels</em> viewed the conspiracy of the bankers and the government against the liberals and industrialists as a major aspect of the Saint-Simonian doctrine. Instead of the Rothschilds, Laffitte <em>et al</em>., Stendhal proposed as disinterested heroes, Lafayette, Washington, Carnot, Dupont de l'Eure, Daunou and general Bertrand.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref63_bpqcogc" title="Ibid., p. 133." href="#footnote63_bpqcogc">63</a></p>
<p>Cerclet wrote a letter of criticism to Stendhal. The <em>Journal du Commerce</em> responded (December 3, 1825) that Stendhal examined only a narrow segment of <em>industrialisme</em>, and neglected the major stream of <em>industrialisme</em> which centered on the ending of exploitation of man by man through privileges, and on society administering itself without an external agency. "Man will then work upon nature, live from things and leave his fellow men in peace". Armand Carrel reviewed Stendhal's booklet in <em>Le Producteur</em> (December 3, 1825). Stendhal in <em>Le Globe</em> (December 6, 1925) criticized the lack of clear writing and growth of charlatanism, of which an example was "a new polish for the boots, a new system of <em>industrialisme</em>, of a new <em>vegetable rouge</em>". <em>Le Globe</em> (December 17) reprinted long extracts from Stendhal's booklet.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref64_559ci1h" title="Ibid., pp. 141–149, 153–155." href="#footnote64_559ci1h">64</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Leon Haltvy, one of the leading Saint-Simonians, had written an article in <em>L'Opinion</em> (December 5) on Benjamin Constant's lecture on December 3; Halevy's article "Athénée Royal de Paris, Seance d'ouverture. Discours de M. Benjamin Constant", sought to answer Constant's criticism of Saint-Simonianism and recalled the friendship between Constant and Saint-Simon. Constant responded with a letter to <em>L'Opinion</em> (December 6), which, was reprinted in the <em>Journal du Commerce</em> (December 7). He emphasized the need of constitutional guarantees against the pursuit of purely material interest. He was especially fearful of Saint-Simonian intolerance and he- supported freedom of conscience against the implicit despotism of the Saint-Simonians. Constant's interpretation regarding intolerance was confirmed in a reply to Constant's letter by Cerclet's article in <em>Le Producteur</em> (December 10), which followed an earlier response by Saint-Amand Bazard in the issue of December 3 but obviously published several days later.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref65_1ew25ka" title="Ibid., pp. 148–152, 291." href="#footnote65_1ew25ka">65</a></p>
<p>The <em>Revue encyclopédique</em>, for which Say and Dunoyer wrote, contained a review (December, 1825) of Stendhal's booklet by Comte Paul-Eugène Lanjuinais, son of the Liberal peer. He emphasized Stendhal's criticism of the Saint-Simonian banker's loans to the Turks and agreed with Constant's lecture that industry was very important but that it is necessary to develop the moral faculties as well. Victor Jacquemont, who was a friend of Dunoyer's, was favorable to <em>industrialisme</em> and was acquainted with the Saint-Simonians, had found Stendhal's booklet worthwhile. Jacquemont wrote Stendhal on December 22, 1825: "Barthélemy Dunoyer is furious against you. He said that you understand nothing on that question". So for Stendhal, "lourd" Dunoyer became "that most ignorant of liberal writers", because "it is too much to contemplate that they could believe that of me, who was of their party". However, Dunoyer and Say could not long maintain their fragile association with the editors of a <em>Le Producteur</em> which continued to espouse Ricardian economics. Against the absolute opposition of Say and Dunoyer to paper money and the system of credit based upon it, Enfantin (January 1, 1826) praised Ricardo's preference for paper money, and emphasized the role of banks in creating credit for major undertakings such as transportation development. So also the split between Dunoyer and Stendhal was not continued; Rude writes:</p>
<p class="indent2">Stendhal acknowledges always his [Dunoyer's] science in political economy. And I believe we recognize him in the M.D. that the <em>touriste </em>encountered at Chalon-sur-Saône and whom he presents as "one of the leading economists of France".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref66_hzeauuj" title="Ibid., pp. 115, 155–164." href="#footnote66_hzeauuj">66</a></p>
<p>Dunoyer signaled his break with the Saint-Simonians in an article in the <em>Revue encyclopédique</em> (t. XXXIII, février, 1827). In this lengthy "Historical Notice on <em>Industrialisme</em>", Dunoyer presented an analysis and criticism of the writing of the Saint-Simonians in<em> <em>Le Producteur</em>.</em></p>
<p class="indent2">As disciples of M. Saint-Simon, the authors have undertaken the work with the intention of propagating his doctrines. They seem to adopt these doctrines without restriction. First, they claim for him the honor of having founded<em> <em>industrialisme</em></em>; they attribute to him even the glory of having invented the word<em> <em>industriel</em></em>. Hence, like him, from the fact that the theological and feudal powers are constantly declining, and that the arts, the sciences, and industry do not cease to acquire strength, they conclude that the direction of affairs must pass from the hands of eccelesiastical and lay lords into those of the savants, the artists and the industrialists. Following their master, they reproach these latter classes for only having worked to free themselves. Because they have long made war, of wishing to make war always; of rendering eternal what ought only to be transitory; of making an end of what was only a means; of wishing to replace the old system by criticism; . . . of reducing criticism to a system, of making an aim of criticism, without any other object than to criticize. They beseech those classes to abandon this<em> <em>critical tendency</em></em>, which places, they say, very great obstacles to the progress of civilization, and to adopt the organic tendency, to proceed without loss of time to the organization of the industrial system. What they desire also, after the example of Saint-Simon, is a state composed solely of savants, artists and artisans, where the most distinguished savants and artists will form the spiritual power, and the most preponderant industrialists the temporal power of society; where the first will be charged with the formation of ideas, the second with the formation of sentiments, and the last with the administration of material interests. This system took no account of individuals; it only occupied itself <em><em>with the entire human species</em></em>. It assigned for the destiny of the species <em><em>the more and more perfect exploitation of the globe which we inhabit</em></em>. It proclaimed <em><em>the organizational principle of a productive association between all peoples</em>. </em>The law of this association is not liberty. <em><em>Laissez faire et laissez passer</em></em> is an insufficient counsel.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref67_oijgslj" title="Revue encyclopédique, pp. 190–191." href="#footnote67_oijgslj">67</a></p>
<p>Dunoyer strongly attacked the Saint-Simonian decision that human imperfection required man's social activities to be under the direction of other men. For the Saint-Simonians there is no reason for creative men to seek answers and desire to apply them, if there is no force compelling individuals who escape its direction to return to its benefits and to show "continually to workers the route that they must follow and not permit anyone to escape from it". Dunoyer was appalled by the Saint-Simonian claim that the masses required a system of general directors and a negation of competition. For the Saint-Simonians, competition was a principal enemy and "order would result only from the exceptions made to the principle of competition". For Dunoyer, only competition can yield proper value and put in their correct place the means of order such as the police. The Saint-Simonians' desire to eliminate economic competition was shown by their wish to centralize the control of credit in the hands of bankers selected for this purpose. Dunoyer described this in terms taken from<em> <em>Le Producteur</em></em>:</p>
<p class="indent2">We seek constantly to combat this principle [competition] . . . It is necessary that in each branch of industry there be associations of captialists who will make advances only to the entrepreneurs and to the enterprises which merit it . . . it is necessary to establish a credit center in each industrial class . . . There need to be disciplinary councils for lawyers, doctors, bakers, butchers, stockbrokers, notaries, etc. The disciplinary councils are no more an evil than particular directors in each branch of industry are an evil, than the general directors of society, than governments in general are an evil. Such councils must guide the science and the morality of all men examined by them . . . But they must be composed of evidently superior men. Such is that system. It is all directed against what the authors call the<em> <em>critical tendency</em></em>, and towards what they call the<em> <em>organic tendency</em>.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref68_4qfz527" title="Ibid., pp. 192." href="#footnote68_4qfz527">68</a></em></p>
<p>The Saint-Simonian system of organizing, directing and ordering society through government was in direct opposition to the contributions made by Say and Dunoyer. For the Saint-Simonians, an industrial society was one in which the leading industrialists exercised governmental power, in collaboration with the scientists and artists, over the rest of society. For Dunoyer, <em><em>industrialisme</em> </em>was the negation of government of men by men, "a manner of life" where all social relations are characterized by free, competitive activities in absolute freedom.</p>
<p class="indent2">The<em> <em>industrial system</em></em>, the<em><em> industrial society</em></em>, is truly one where all men are producers of usefulness, where the men of all classes, forced finally to renounce all violence, are only able to live from useful things that they create by peaceful work, and from what they obtain by voluntary gift or regular exchanges; but there is not much use in speaking of the social<em> <em>industrial state</em></em>, when, by the word <em>industriel</em>, one only intends, as do M. Saint-Simon and the writers of his school, one of several classes of individuals or of professions . . . It is then the fault of these writers to wish to choose only from among the savants, the industrialists and the artists. But they fall into an error yet more serious, concerning the regime mast convenient to the industrial system. Their complaints against what they call the<em> <em>critical system</em></em>, that is to say, against a general and permanent state of examination, of debate, of competition, attacks society in its most active principle of life, in its most efficacious means of development. First, these writers mistake all the facts, when they accuse a critical philosophy of tending only to destroy and of and of proposing only a negative goal. In working to remove the obstacles which oppose the free and legitimate exercise of the humane faculties, it tends, on the contrary, to a very positive goal, which is to place humanity in a situation where its faculties are able to grow easily. Hence, it demands the abolition of all privilege, of all monopoly, of all evil and violent restriction, and wishes that each be able to use his powers freely within the limits of justice and equity. . .</p>
<p class="indent2">The disciples of the school which claims to be organic see the greatest inconveniences in leaving society to itself and in looking forward to its development by the free competition of individual efforts. This state of competition, they say, only leads to the anarchy of sentiments and ideas. However, by a singular contradiction, they admit, at the same time, that free discussion is necessary at certain epochs, when society tends to pass from one doctrine to another, from an imperfect state to a better state. But, if discussion often has the power to produce enlightenment, if it is able to really spirits to truth, if it is in the nature of things what common ideas emerge from a conflict of divergent opinions, what is the significance of the reproach made against freedom, and when does it begin to be anarchic? Is there, in the course of centuries, a single instant where society does not tend, in a multitude of ways, to modify its ideas, to change its manner of existence? To accuse liberty of what remains of confusion in moral and social doctrines, is to see evil in the remedy, and to complain precisely of what tends to make the confusion cease. The error of the organic school is the belief that liberty is only a provisional utility. A time will come, they say, where all the sciences will be positive; and we will no longer have need of liberty when all the sciences are positive: one cannot dispute demonstrated truths. One disputes no longer what is demonstrated, no doubt; but will it ever all be demonstrated? What appears to be demonstrated, will it always appear so? Will not the inductions which seem well established, in the experimental sciences, be modified some day by new experiences? In place of saying that our knowledge will become complete and certain, we are able to affirm strongly that they always will leave something to be discovered or to be rectified. It is then in the nature of things that liberty of examination will be perpetually necessary. Society which lives chiefly by action, acts, at each instant, according to the notions that it possesses, but to act better and better, it needs to work constantly to perfect its knowledge, and it only is able to succeed by means of liberty: research, inquiry, examination, discussion, controversy, such is its natural state, and such it will always be, even when its knowledge has acquired the greatest certainty and understanding.</p>
<p class="indent2">This is not the advice of the organic school. It believes, on the contrary, that this state is only transitory, and that there will come a time when our knowledge will have attained such a degree of extension and of certitude, that there will be no matter for discussion. In consequence, and as if human knowledge had already arrived at that state of ideal perfection, it wishes to give from this moment official directors to society who will conduct its works in conformity with the infallible and complete knowledge that it is destined to acquire. It commences with a vain supposition in order to arrive at a disastrous conclusion. It is puerile to wish to decide in advance what will be in the future the progress of human knowledge; we do not have any means to know it; it will never become as perfect as one supposes; at least it is certain that it is yet far from being perfect, and it is insane to think as if it were perfect already. Finally, were it perfected, if we could know fully the aim of society and all the means we would every have to attain it, were there nothing more to discover in the sciences; it we could know the best means to follow in the arts; if we could acquire the infallible means to discern, in all cases, the good and bad undertakings, it would yet be very pernicious to give to the best instructed men in all things the right to submit others to their direction. We do not hasten the progress of truth by constraints. The best means, on the contrary, to hinder it so that it does not spread, is to give to men who know it the power to impose it on those who are ignorant. Far from increasing its influence, one destroys it. . . No one understands why he must <em>a priori</em> submit his reason to that of another; no one consents to receive a truth imposed by force. It is surely desirable that society be guided by the knowledge of its most enlightened members, but it is more desirable that they possess power only by their knowledge. The true savants have not need to exercise any magistracy in order to be consulted. The natural disposition of whoever has need of a service is to address himself to whomever is best able to serve him. It is only coercive directors that people refuse to fallow; and nothing will be less favorable to the progress of society, then to give to men of knowledge the power of constraint. Society wishes to be constrained only by whom it may select for the service; no more by savants than by priests; what its interest requires before anything, on the contrary, is that all unjust constraint should be repressed.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref69_zgsyb2a" title="Ibid., pp. 194–198." href="#footnote69_zgsyb2a">69</a></p>
<p>Dunoyer's "critical" approach toward any attempt to eliminate absolute freedom of choice was the basis of his conflict with the Saint-Simonians. The introduction of any compulsion or direction by one person over another, including intellectual direction, was precisely the fundamental disagreement which Dunoyer had had with Rousseau's concepts. The possibility that legislation could have any role in the education, development or improvement of any person was contrary to Dunoyer's conception of law. All law was negative or destructive, except insofar as law expressed the exact relations which it sought to regulate, in which case it was at best superfluous. Dunoyer drew this attitude from the "very judicious reflections" of an "old, little-known work",<em> <em>L'Homme et la Société</em> </em>by J. B. Salaville, whom Rude notes had been influenced by the principles of William Godwin.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref70_qp1t6o0" title="Dunoyer, L'Industrie el la morale, pp. 430–431: J.B. Salaville, L'Homme et las Société; ou nouvelle théorie de la nature humaine et de l'état social (Paris: Carteret-Dentu, An VII, 1798), chapter XXXIV, pp. 355–372, 391–392; Rude, Stendhal, p. 114." href="#footnote70_qp1t6o0">70</a></p>
<p>In conflict with Dunoyer's insistence that the voluntary acceptance of truth by each person was the sole means of gaining acceptance, in which case legislation was either evil or needless, the Saint-Simonians held that on the discovery of a truth, the compulsion to observe it had to be imposed on each person. For the Saint-Simonians the position advocated by Dunoyer was anarchism. In response to the "critical" approach and its rejection of his scientism, Saint-Simon had declared: "you, gentlemen, are nothing but anarchists". Dunoyer clearly identified himself with the anarchism of "critical" philosophy as well as the anarchism in politics which Saint-Simon and his disciples had felt to be the major opposition to his scientistic despotism. As J. L. Talmon notes in his "Totalitarian Technocracy: Saint-Simon", of Saint-Simon's criticism of the radical liberalism of such contemporaries as Dunoyer:</p>
<p class="indent2">Among themselves the" would settle matters byway of contract, warranted by their own corporations and their laws and customs. Since the feudal-military-clerical State was in no position to render real assistance, but only to do harm, or worse—to extort ransom, the industrial classes developed almost a religion of non-interference by the State. Liberty became identified with the absence of government, individual freedom with isolationism. The experience of feudal-clerical rule was universalized into a philosophy teaching that government as such is a natural enemy, and not<em> "<em>chef de la société, destiné à unir en faisceau et à diriger vers un but commun toutes les activités individuelles</em></em>".<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref71_ah3pgcy" title="J.L. Talmon, Political Messianism, The Romantic Phase (London: Secker & Warburg, 1960), pp. 35–124, esp., pp. 46 and 49–50; on 18th century advocates of the beneficial role of legislation, especially Rousseau, see Talmon, The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy (New York: Praeger, 1960), pp. 34–49." href="#footnote71_ah3pgcy">71</a></p>
<p>Say and Dunoyer had been major spokesmen for the analysis which defined liberty in the terms which Saint-Simon and the Saint-Simonians condemned. This is of special interest in view of the criticism which Benjamin Constant made of this article by Dunoyer.</p>
<p>Constant's response,<em> <em>De M. Dunoyer et de quelques-uns de ses ouvroges</em></em>,<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref72_ih8yk81" title="Benjamin Constant, "De M. Dunoyer et de quelques-uns de ses ouvrages", in De la Perfectibilité de l'Espèce humaine (Lausanne: Éditions L'Age D'Homme, 1967), pp. 66–95; Benjamin Constant, Mélanges de littérature et de politique (Paris: Pichon et Didier, 1829), pp. 128–162." href="#footnote72_ih8yk81">72</a> was included in the collection of essays,<em> <em>Mélanges</em></em>, which Constant had published in 1829 in preparation for his unsuccessful candidacy for the <em><em>Académie</em>. </em>Pierre Deguise has commented on Constant's criticism of Dunoyer:<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref73_jckbp3u" title="Pierre Deguise, "Introduction", Benjamin Constant, De La Perfectibilité de l'Espèce humaine (Lausanne: Éditions L'Age D'Homme, 1967), pp. 9–34." href="#footnote73_jckbp3u">73</a></p>
<p class="indent2">With <em>De M. Dunoyer et de quelques-uns de ses ouvrages</em>, Constant undertook to defend his ideas against those of others. In truth, Charles Dunoyer was not at all an enemy. A man of the liberal Left, as was himself, he had been motivated by an order to defend the freedom of the press equal to that of Constant. . .</p>
<p class="indent2">When he was obliged to renounce the publication of his review after the reaction which followed the assassination of the duc de Berry, he had turned more of his attention to political economy. He taught at the Athénée, where Constant had lectured on constitutional theory as well as on religion . . .</p>
<p class="indent2">Why then this criticism? Why, despite his eulogies on detail, this hostility of Constant who recognized in Dunoyer a companion in his battles? First he had been personally caught as one side in the work and he had to respond. Dunoyer saw in the industrial society the milieu most favorable to liberty. . . He then reproached Constant, along with Rousseau, Chateaubriand and also some ultra-royalists, for their mistrust and even their contempt for the development of civilization which they accused of depraving mankind. He noted a passage of the first volume of<em> <em>De la Religion</em> </em>where Constant wrote: "Once before the human species seemed plunged into the abyss. Then also a long civilization had enervated it. Each time that mankind arrived ai an excessive civilization, it appeared degraded for several generations" (Rel. I, 236). Constant was so much the more sensitive to this accusation, as he had felt himself placed in contradiction with himself. How is it possible to think that civilization is able to corrupt, when one believes with all one's strength in perfectibility?</p>
<p class="indent2">Adroit in defending himself, he protests that he had never believed in intellectual degradation by material progress. It would only be a temporary retreat from perfecting when an excess of civilization is able to enervate spirits and soften energies. Degradation can only be transitory.</p>
<p class="indent2">Nevertheless, why had he placed so much effort in this refutation . . . if Dunoyer had not hit the nail on the head? . . . Is it not strange that in this eternal conflict . . . which, in the midst of the eighteenth century, came to oppose Voltaire against Rousseau, a common nostalgia for simplicity, for patriarchal morals, is found among two writers, both from the shores of Lake Léman? . . . Constant felt for people furthest from the state of industrial wealth a sympathy nearly equal to that of Tacitus in another age for the Germans. Are these peoples not those who know best how to defend their freedom? The Russians and the Spanish against Napoleon, the Greeks against the Turks? Does one not divine behind these rude peasants, inheritors of ancient virtues, who rise up in arms to defend their independence, the shadow of William Tell?</p>
<p class="indent2">. . . Dunoyer never goes as far as Bentham, but Constant is unable to accept a theory which does not make liberty and right a first given of human nature, as he had made it likewise for religious sentiment. And then, fundamentally, the economist collides with the habits of political thought. "Politics as a science of government has been transcended", wrote Dunoyer; and he intended to substitute for it a study, according to him more scientific, which we call today "political economy". He did not seek the best form of government, but "the mode of existence most natural to our species, more favorable to its progress"; in place of presenting liberty "as a dogma", he studies it "as a result". It was insufficient to say as did the dogmatic publicists that "it is necessary that peoples should be free"; it is necessary to seek "how they will be free". In summation, from the point of view of political theorist and moralist who starts from principles, Dunoyer wished to substitute a purely experimental approach that he judged more scientific. The foundation of things appeared to him not political institutions, but the social mechanism . . . Constant is then very naturally brought to enter the campaign against the Saint-Simonians, He did it at the end of his essay in complimenting Dunoyer on distinguishing himself from a "new sea", the disciples of Saint-Simon whom he did not name. He took out with vigor against those who "preached servility to authority", wishing "to found a new industrial papism"; seeing "anarchy in all difference of opinion", and invoking a new spiritual power.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref74_h8h5247" title="Ibid., pp. 15–20." href="#footnote74_h8h5247">74</a></p>
<p>Constant expressed the highest praise for Dunoyer's writings in the <em>Censeur europ<em>é</em>en </em>as well as his conflicts with the government to vindicate civil liberties: "The germs deposited, in 1814, in the<em> <em>Censeur européen</em></em>, have developed and fructified". While displeased by Dunoyer's criticism of him in<em> <em>L'Industrie et la Morale</em></em>, on which his essay concentrated, Constant made reference to Dunoyer's article in the <em><em>Revue encyclopédique</em></em> on the origins of <em>industrialisme</em>. Before confronting the Saint-Simonians, Constant contributed his observations briefly on the originality of Dunoyer in the development of<em> industrialisme</em>. Constant's failure even to mention Saint-Simon and his deprecatory references to the Saint-Simonians stemmed from Constant's not taking Saint-Simon seriously as a thinker. Dunoyer he took seriously as a fellow radical theorist and philosophical opponent. As the precursor of Dunoyer's elaboration of<em> <em>industrialisme</em></em>, Constant sought to mute and blur the differences by making his own ideas part of the general intellectual milieu. Dunoyer had stated the differences with clarity and in detail; Constant's vague reflections and his introduction of Sismondi, whose book was published too late to be relevant, obscured the particular issues.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref75_4lwho6z" title="Constant, "'De M. Dunoyer": ibid., pp. 66–68, 90. Fourteen years before, Constant had published his De L'Ésprit de Conquète, in which he discussed the differences between the political freedom of the ancients and the individual freedom of the moderns. Constant repeated this in his brochure De la liberté des Anciens comparée à celle des modernes in 1819 Dunoyer's association in L'lndustrie et la morale, pp. 93–44, of Constant with Rousseau and Chateaubriand as a critic of civilization and proponent of primitive levels of civilization, is highlighted by their diverse views of the meaning of the Greek struggle for independence from the Turks. For Constant, "it was in the barbarity of the Klephtes that Greece found a safeguard against the barbarity of the Turks", "De M. Dunoyer", ibid., p. 75. The Klephtes were the Greek brigands, who from their refuge in the northern mountains, maintained the independence of Greek political movement and culture during the Turkish occupation, and who were active in the revolution. Dunoyer had been impressed that the Greeks were more industrious than the Turks, through their activity in commerce, crafts and especially seafaring, and thus, by the revolt of the Greek sailors who formed the vast majority of the Turks' navy, decisively shifted control in the Aegean to the Greek revolution. L'lndustrie et la morale, pp. 101–102. Constant was also distressed by Dunoyer's emphasis that it was the fault of the people that they suffered the government's oppression; if people had a stronger sense of morality and self-interest they would not have experienced government's oppression or would long since have overthrown it. The Revue encylopédique in January, 1825 had raised as a criticism of Dunoyer's lectures on industrialisme at the Athénée that industrial life makes ruling easier for the governors. Rude, Stendhal, p. 114. Constant disagreed with Dunoyer's view that governments were the reflection of the people's situation, and that governments will be overturned when the people achieve a sufficiently high state of development. Constant emphasized that governments were the result of conquest, of elements of the past, and of stagnation; and that the opposition between peoples and governments was the significant thing. Dunoyer's severity upon the people seemed to relieve the governments of criticism: "This new principle is necessary to examine: all which discredits peoples is avidly gathered by government, and against the intention of M. Dunoyer, the oppressive authorities will seize possession easily of that part of his system", "De M. Dunoyer", ibid., p. 68." href="#footnote75_4lwho6z">75</a></p>
<p>Specifically, in his "<em>Historical notice on <em>industrialisme</em></em>", Dunoyer said of Constant:</p>
<p class="indent2">I must say, to the glory of M. Benjamin Constant, that he is the first writer, at least to my knowledge, who had indicated the goal of the peoples of our time, and who also recognized the true object of politics. In his work on <em>I'esprit de conquête considéré dans ses rapports avec la civilisation européenne</em>, which had been published abroad in I813 . . . Constant wrote: "While each people formerly formed an isolated family, a born enemy of other families, a mass of peoples now exists under different names and under various kinds of social organization, but homogeneous by its nature. It is sufficiently strong to have nothing to fear from the hordes that are still barbarian: it is sufficiently civilized that war will be a burden to it. The uniform tendency is towards peace . . . We have arrived at the epoch of commerce, the epoch which ought necessarily to replace what preceded . . .War was the savage impulse; commerce is the civilized calculation. It is clear that the more the commercial tendency dominates, the more the warrior tendency becomes weak. <em>The unique aim of modern nations is tranquility, with tranquility comfort, and as the source of comfort, INDUSTRY.</em> War each day becomes a less efficacious means to attain this aim. It does not offer to individuals and to nations benefits which equal the results of peaceful work and regular exchange" (Chapter II). These statements are not absolutely irreproachable. M. Benjamin Constant, in saying that comfort is the unique aim of modern nations, seems to indicate that men have only physical needs to satisfy. The aim of modern nations is comfort; with comfort, dignity, consideration, glory, renown: and, as the source of all these goods, the moral and intellectual practice of all useful professions, or, as expressed by M. Benjamin Constant, <em>industry</em>, which embraces in effect all the useful professions of society. But, although the proposition of the able writer perhaps lacks exactitude in form, it was nonetheless very important as a foundation. It was the first time that anyone showed briefly the difference which exists between the ancients and the moderns; it was, the first time that anyone indicated to the modern peoples that they direct their activity towards industry. This observation, which now seems trivial, was than entirely novel, and I believe that I remember that people were very much struck by it.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref76_b00a360" title="Dunoyer, "Historical notice on industrialisme", pp. 175–176." href="#footnote76_b00a360">76</a></p>
<p>Dunoyer emphasized the undeveloped nature of Constant's attitudes on industry and the impact of its growth on civilization. Constant had not made any detailed analysis of the positive aspects of industrial progress, and Dunoyer had particularly noted Constant's belief that the improvement of material conditions would cause the retrogression of mankind and interfere with human perfectibility. Dunoyer discussed the failure of Constant to develop his attitudes on the role of industry into a philosophy such as <enm><em>industrialisme</em>. Constant, like the two other authors whose works contributed to Dunoyer's and Comte's development of <em>industrialisme</em>, Montlosier, the historian, and Say, the political economist, did not see the deeper implications of their ideas. According to Dunoyer,</enm></p>
<p class="indent2">No writing of M. Benjamin Constant following the <em>Esprit de conquête</em>, has shown that he appreciated the political consequences of his observation that the peoples of our day direct their activity towards industry; he had not occupied himself with industrial society; he has not investigated how that society lives, fallowing by what laws it prospers and how it ought to be constituted in order to develop itself.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref77_3qkoj2m" title="Ibid., pp. 178–179." href="#footnote77_3qkoj2m">77</a></p>
<p>The <em>Esprit de conquête</em> was drawn, even to its exact words, from the studies written during the intellectually creative end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century period in the life of Constant, which are contained in the notebooks known as the <em>Oeuvres Manuscrites de 1810</em>. These unpublished manuscripts, in seven volumes of three to four hundred pages each, were a source for some of Constant's later articles as well as abbreviated and more acceptable (less radical) versions of the original essay.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref78_lisjzkn" title="O. Pozzo de Borgo, in Constant, Écrits, I, 204–206. Constant's Oeuvres Manuscrites de 1810 were acquired by the Bibliothèque nationale in 1961." href="#footnote78_lisjzkn">78</a></p>
<p>Constant's <em>De la Perfectibilitié de l'Espèce humaine</em>, of which the <em> De M. Dunoyer et de quelques-urn de ses ouvrages</em> was a continuation, besides influencing other of his writings was partially reproduced in his <em>Mélanges</em>. The original essay had been composed about 1803–1804 as Constant's introduction to an extract from Herder's <em>Ideas on the Philosophy of History</em>. Perfectability had been treated in Mme. de Stael's <em>La Littérature considérée dans ses rapports avec les institution sociales</em> (1800). Constant was a friend of a number of the Ideologues who were concerned with this topic. Georges Cabanis (1757–1808) had published a "lettre sur la Perfectibilite de I'esprit humain". Claude Charles Fauriel (1772–1844), who was a friend both of Constant and Dunoyer, had reviewed Mme. de Stael's book for <em>La Décade</em>, which led to his friendship with her and Constant. Fauriel was a close friend to Mme. de Condorcet (1764–1822), who with Cabanis, who was married to her sister, had published the complete works of Condorcet in 1801–1804. The Marquis de Condorcet (1743–1794), through his <em>Equisse d'un tableau historique des progrés de l'esprit humain</em>, had a major impact on the thinking of the Ideologues on this topic.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref79_7k695m1" title="Constant, Mélanges, pp. 387–415; Pierre Deguise, "Introduction", in Constant De la Perfectibilité, pp. 11–14; O.

<p>The immediate source for Constant and through him, for Dunoyer, was William Godwin. Constant had been in close contact with intellectual developments in England from the friendships he had made during his eighteen months at the University of Edinburgh in 1783–1784. One of his continuing friendships was with James Mackintosh (1765–1832), who wrote in 1791 the <em>Vindiciae Gallicae</em>, in reply to Burke's <em>Reflections on the French Revolution</em>; Mackintosh's 1799 Lincoln's Inn lectures on the law of nature and nations, and his defense in 1803 of a French political refugee tried at Bonaparte's insistence for libel of the First Consul, increased his fame. Godwin's <em>Inquiry concerning Political Justice, and its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness</em> (1793) was read widely by political theorists in France. Godwin had dispatched a copy to the Convention by the hand of John Fenwick in a letter of February 15, 1793, but the outbreak of war soon afterward may have contributed to the fact that there was no French translation of the work. There did not seem to be any reviews of <em>Political Justice</em> in France, although the many reviews and comments in English publications were read in France. There was a detailed review of Godwin's 1794 novel, <em>Caleb Williams</em> (Paris, 1796) in <em>La Décade</em> (January 30, 1796, volume 8, pp. 413–420), which emphasized Godwin's discussion of prisons and his principles of justice. In 1795, Constant's uncle, Samuel Constant, had published a French translation of <em>Caleb Williams</em> in Geneva. Constant corresponded with Godwin in 1795–1796 concerning the former's desire to translate <em>Political Justice</em>. Constant, in 1799, announced the forthcoming publication of his translation of Godwin's <em>Political Justice</em>, but political events then and in the future caused the indefinite postponement of its publication. But the impact of Godwin's ideas was evident in the writings of Constant in that period and in his speeches at the Tribunate before his exclusion in 1802.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref80_303lmps" title="Burton R. Pollin, Godwin Criticism: A Synoptic Bibliography (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1967), pp. 54–55, numbers 360R–363R, including La Décade reviews of Godwin's Fleetwood and St. Leon, and p. 656, for editions of Political Justice (London, 1793, 1796, 1798; Dublin, 1793, 1796; Philadelphia, 1796; and Wurzburg, 1803); Pollin, "Godwin's 'Letters of Verax'", Journal of the History of Ideas, XXV, 1964, pp. 260–270." href="#footnote80_303lmps">80</a></p>
<p>Constant himself had taken up the challenge to Burke's attacks on the French Revolution in <em>Des Réactions Politiques</em> (An V). In July, 1799 Constant published <em>Des suites de la contrerévolution de 1660 en Angleterre</em>, at the conclusion of which he announced his translation of Political Justice, which would be accompanied by a "profound examination" of the principles "suitable to consolidate liberty". Constant wished to publish the translation of <em>Political Justice</em> to counter the dictatorial and arbitrary government of the post-Fructidor Directory as well as the similar measures of those looking to return to the Terror of 1793, because Godwin showed that the true liberty to which these men claim to be dedicated is based on absolute liberty—the absence of all violence. The <em>Oeuvres Manuscrites de 1810</em> contains three notebooks with 576 pages of translation of <em>Political Justice</em>. In addition, the seventh notebook contains Constant's "De Godwin, de ses principes et de son ouvrages sur la Justice politique", which was partially published as an essay in April 1817. Godwin's absolute reliance on the voluntary element in all relations, and his basing of the absolute autonomy of the individual on intellectual independence, was much admired by Constant and was their "kernel of anarchism". Constant's individualist anarchism led him to oppose Rousseau's <em>Social Contract</em> as a surrender of individual rights, since it opened the way to arbitrary actions by the nation against a single individual. Constant, !ike Godwin, was influenced by Adam Smith's concept of "natural order", and he sought the replacement of public, feudal property by private, commercial and industrial property, and the destruction of public institutions which he viewed as liberation.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref81_ds1jdmu" title="O. Pozzo di Borgo, I. 121–133, 234–235, 239–241; Pollin, Godwin Criticism, pp. 104-105, 199; Pollin, Education and Enlightenment in the Works of William Godwin (New York: Las Americas, 1962), pp. 1, 17–18. Harold Nicolson, Benjamin Constant (Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Co., 1949), pp. 285–289. The influence of Godwin on Constant has been noted by: Elizabeth W.

Charlotte T. Muret, French Royalist Doctrines since the Revolution (New York: Columbia University Press, 1933), p. 72, notes only the parallels between Godwin and Constant's individualist anarchism." href="#footnote81_ds1jdmu">81</a></p>
<p>Godwin avoided Turgot's concept of the "perfect man", since the idea of the ability to become perfect was in opposition to the idea of perfectibility, of continual improvement. Condorcet stressed progress based on the "improvement of instruments which increase the power and direct the exercise of these facilities". Condorcet's emphasis on the role in progress of education, invention and the applied arts and sciences, appears in his <em>Life of Voltaire</em> which Godwin used (<em>Political Justice</em> was published before the <em>Equisse</em>). A clear influence was the Ideologue historian, Constantin François Volney's <em>The Ruins, or Survey of the Revolutions of Empires</em> (1791) which was translated into English by James Marshal, Godwin's amanuensis. Volney (1757–1820) posited that public happiness could be only the sum of individual happinesses, and he viewed natural rights as basic to mankind's progress. Godwin shared Volney's utilitarianism and viewed technological progress and the rise in living standards due to increase in knowledge as the progress of civilization. Godwin's favorable view of labor-saving machinery which increases comfort and material goods paralleled the views of Dunoyer and Herbert Spencer on the essence of the progress of civilization.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref82_u7hye94" title="Crocker, Nature and Culture, pp. 453; Pollin, Education and Enlightenment, pp. 4, 62–64, 95–98; C.F. Volney, The Ruins (Exeter: Joseph Mann, 1823), pp. 38–39, 93–104." href="#footnote82_u7hye94">82</a></p>
<p>Unlike Rousseau, but like the Physiocrats earlier and Say and Dunoyer later, Godwin considered the golden age or stateless society to be in the future and not in the past of mankind. For Godwin, as man's knowledge increases and more complex relationships develop, the less need is there for the role of government, thereby requiring the "dissolution of government". Godwin advocated extreme decentralization, which like Dunoyer's, could be called Rousseauist or primitivist if they had viewed government as having any legitimate role. But, Godwin and Dunoyer saw the progress of society in inverse proportion to the powers of government. The dissolution of government is the perfection of the complex and developed society.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref83_4t5pt5m" title="Cf. above p. 5 for the Physiocrats' and Say's view of the golden age being in the future, and p. 31 for Dunoyer's extreme decentralism; Pollin, Education and Enlightenment, pp. 76–78, 83–89." href="#footnote83_4t5pt5m">83</a></p>
<p>Albert Schatz's <em>L'lndividualisme</em>, in introducing Dunoyer's definition of liberty, underlines the principle that the government and individuals in society progress in inverse proportion to each other; the dissolution of government is the necessary goal of morals and industry, of civilization.</p>
<p class="indent2">Liberalism tends then to create between the State and the individual a radical antagonism which is not in the classical doctrine and which makes the State and the individual two forces inversely proportional to each other. In consequence, there is in liberalism a tendency rather potential than achieved, to retire the State from the totality of economic role: we will see this born in the fulfillment that Dunoyer supplied to the classical doctrine, ending finally in a form of anarchism more or less disguised.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref84_y1azids" title="Schatz, L'Individualisme, p. 197." href="#footnote84_y1azids">84</a></p>
<p>Schatz notes that Dunoyer's thinking influenced the development of Proudhon's social theory. Dunoyer's analyses of liberty led him to an emphasis upon the roles of competition and voluntary association in the progress of civilized society. Dunoyer completed his analysis through applying these roles to the production of security and to the development of the concept of competing voluntary associations providing for the production of security. Insurance societies and companies competing in the production of security for their members or subscribers was the culmination of this completion of the dissolution of government.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref85_u3ybxsg" title="Ibid., pp. 490, 500." href="#footnote85_u3ybxsg">85</a></p>
<p>Schatz, in his chapter "De l'individualisme anti-étatiste à l'individualisme anarchiste",<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref86_w7jh6fp" title="Ibid., pp. 472–576." href="#footnote86_w7jh6fp">86</a> discussed the expression by Gustav de Molinari, Dunoyer's principal disciple, of civilized society's production of security:</p>
<p class="indent2">that limited function. M. de Molinari removed from the government. In a study <em>De la production de la Sécurité</em> (<em>Journal des Économistes</em>, 15 fevrier 1849, p. 277), he asked why this industry had made room only for a monopoly. Had one not seen in Spain the Sainte-Hermandad. In Flanders and Italy the societies of artisans or others charging for furnishing security? Do there not exist in England and America private constables and in the Far West lynchers without official mandate? Regression, one asks? Not at all. On the contrary, progress, and more in conformity to liberal orthodoxy.</p>
<p class="indent2">. . . In the social state, the satisfaction of needs exists due to the division of labor and to exchange. The need of security, the effect of the insufficiency of justice, is one of those. From which there appear certain establishments destined to guarantee to each the peaceable possession of his person and of his goods, and that one calls "governments".</p>
<p class="indent2">But, if all needs are satisfied better by free competition, would Dunoyer be able to set aside this need of security? <em>A priori</em>, such a derogation contrary to the liberal faith is to be considered evil. Also, if the industry of security has been organized as a monopoly, it is easy to discover the reason. Respondant to a need which is after that of food the most essential, it puts face to face weak consumers and strong producers, by very definition. The latter imposes the monopoly of security on the former. What are the results of that? One saw in England a governing company, a feudality having an hereditary council of administration, the House of Lords, fix as it was convenient to them, under the name of taxation, the price of security.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref87_4jugtfb" title="Ibid., pp. 488–489. Dunoyer through de Molinari had an influence on American industrialist anarchists; Schatz notes that Benjamin R. Tucker used some of their concepts. Ibid., p. 514." href="#footnote87_4jugtfb">87</a></p>
<p>But Dunoyer's concern for the analysis of the absolutely free market was interrupted by the events of the July Days of the 1830 Revolution. With the establishment of the July Monarchy (1830–1848), Dunoyer embarked on his seven year tenure as prefect, first at Allier (1830), and then at Somme (1833–1837). On his retirement, which coincided with the death of Charles Comte, he became a <em>conseiller d'état en service ordinaire</em> in 1838. In 1835, he had published a <em>Mémoire à consulter sur quelques unes des principales questions que la Révolution de juillet à fait naître</em>. In 1840 was published a study he had undertaken of the English railways with reference to railway construction in France: <em>Esprit et méthodes comparés de I'Angleterre et de la France dans les enterprises de travaux publics et en particular de chemins de fer; conséquences practiques tirées pour notre pays de ce rapprochement</em>.</p>
<p>Dunoyer was appointed <em>administrateur général</em> at the Bibliothèque Nationale (Bibiothèque rovale. February–June, (1839) by the minister of. . . . public instruction in the Molé cabinet, the comte de Salvandy, who had been an associate of Decazes in 1819–1820. However, this was a period of cabinet crises due to the increasing conservatism of the government, which may have contributed to Dunoyer's retirement from active administration. Dunoyer's appointment to any position of ideological importance such as the Bibliothèque Nationale occasioned strong opposition from the conservatives; the mounting protests of his conservative subordinates forced Dunoyer to resign his office of <em>administrateur général</em> after a few months. He did publish <em>La bibliothèque du roi</em> (Paris, 1839). Thereafter, he returned to his analyses of the free market, and concentrated on social and economic theory. From the reestablishment of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences Dunoyer was an active member, and in 1842 he was instrumental in the founding of the Société d'économie politique. He contributed to its <em>Journal des économistes</em>, as well as to the <em>Journal des debats</em>. In 1845 he published a completely revised and enlarged edition of his earlier major studies under the title: <em>De la liberté du travail, ou simple exposé des conditions dans lesquelles les forces humaines s'exercent avec le plus puissance.</em></p>
<p>The Revolution of 1848 was a grave disappointment to Dunoyer. He strongly denounced the policies of Lamartine and published <em>La révolution du fevrier, 1848</em> (Paris, 1849). But, he continued to sit on the <em>conseil d'état</em>, and took satisfaction from the free trade campaign that Frederic Bastiat conducted from his seat on the Left of the chamber of deputies. Bastiat in 1825 had written that he had studied only four works on economics: Smith, Say, Destutt de Tracy and the <em>Censeur</em>. The coup d'état of December 2, 1851 caused Dunoyer to resign his position on the <em>conseil d'état</em> in protest. He continued to write for the <em>Journal des économistes</em> and to participate actively in the sessions of the <em>Academie des sciences morales et politiques</em>. There he engaged in debates, such as against Victor Cousin on the role of social economy and morals, in 1852.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref88_wa8uxlh" title="Charles Turgeon, "Des prétendues richesses immatérielles", Revue d'économies politique (1889), III, pp. 230–231, and Turgeon, "La conception matérialiste de l'histoire d'aprés Marx et Engels", ibid., (1911), XXV, pp. 307–310" href="#footnote88_wa8uxlh">88</a> Finally, he wrote a two-volume work, <em>Le second empire et une nouvelle restauration</em> (London, 1864 and 1871) which was published posthumously by his son, Anatole, who was professor of political economy at Berne during the second empire, and who returned to France in 1873 to become a master of requests of the <em>conseil d'état</em>. Charles Dunoyer had died on December 4, 1862.</p>

He has returned from his exile more prejudiced than ever in the bastard direction of political economy. He will undertake soon a book totally of the order of the day, to prove that all the theories which are not immediately applicable to industrial practice ought to be quickly abandoned and scorned. Here is a rational man to cause fear! It Is he who had written in his time that if astronomy was truly useful, individuals would know well how to pay for it and hence that it is necessary to suppress the Observatory".

On November 6. 1830 Comte Charles de Lameth denounced abuses of freedom of the press; Comte, <em>procureur du roi</em>, on November 9 asked Lameth to make known such works to the courts as were open to any citizen. Lameth claimed that Comte was seeking judicial control over legislative statements. The chamber named a committee headed by Antoine Vatimesnil, who as a prosecutor during the Restoration had never supported parliamentary privileges, but had been a major force in the prosecution of Dunoyer and Comte. While declaring that Comte's action had threatened the rights of the chamber and approving Lameth's refusal to accept Comte's request, Comte was excused on the basis of the circumstances and the declarations he had made. In opposition to the committee's conclusions, Benjamin Constant made his last speech in the chamber on November 19, 1830. Constant held that Comte had the right to request Lameth to submit any fact; Lameth had the right to refuse according to his conscience; and the chamber had not any right to judge Comte because it was not a power of the legislature.

Fourteen years before, Constant had published his <em>De L'Ésprit de Conquète</em>, in which he discussed the differences between the political freedom of the ancients and the individual freedom of the moderns. Constant repeated this in his brochure <em>De la liberté des Anciens comparée à celle des moderne</em>s in 1819 Dunoyer's association in <em>L'lndustrie et la morale</em>, pp. 93–44, of Constant with Rousseau and Chateaubriand as a critic of civilization and proponent of primitive levels of civilization, is highlighted by their diverse views of the meaning of the Greek struggle for independence from the Turks. For Constant, "it was in the barbarity of the Klephtes that Greece found a safeguard against the barbarity of the Turks", "De M. Dunoyer", <em>ibid</em>., p. 75. The Klephtes were the Greek brigands, who from their refuge in the northern mountains, maintained the independence of Greek political movement and culture during the Turkish occupation, and who were active in the revolution. Dunoyer had been impressed that the Greeks were more industrious than the Turks, through their activity in commerce, crafts and especially seafaring, and thus, by the revolt of the Greek sailors who formed the vast majority of the Turks' navy, decisively shifted control in the Aegean to the Greek revolution. <em>L'lndustrie et la morale</em>, pp. 101–102. Constant was also distressed by Dunoyer's emphasis that it was the fault of the people that they suffered the government's oppression; if people had a stronger sense of morality and self-interest they would not have experienced government's oppression or would long since have overthrown it. The <em>Revue encylopédique</em> in January, 1825 had raised as a criticism of Dunoyer's lectures on <em>industrialisme </em>at the Athénée that industrial life makes ruling easier for the governors. Rude, <em>Stendhal</em>, p. 114. Constant disagreed with Dunoyer's view that governments were the reflection of the people's situation, and that governments will be overturned when the people achieve a sufficiently high state of development. Constant emphasized that governments were the result of conquest, of elements of the past, and of stagnation; and that the opposition between peoples and governments was the significant thing. Dunoyer's severity upon the people seemed to relieve the governments of criticism: "This new principle is necessary to examine: all which discredits peoples is avidly gathered by government, and against the intention of M. Dunoyer, the oppressive authorities will seize possession easily of that part of his system", "De M. Dunoyer", <em>ibid</em>., p. 68.</li>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Black Hole or Shock Absorber: How Does a Free-Market Economy Respond to Crises?]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60742</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Mainstream economists view the economy as fickle, unstable, and always in danger of utter collapse. They see the outlook as very bleak if not for the enormous existing superstructure of government intervention, including constant stimulus of “aggregate demand.” In their minds, this essential stabilization would also include the existing intricate arrangement of regulation and restriction, the army of technocratic bureaucrats overlording every market, and the rollout of massive interventions and macro stabilization schemes, whenever necessary.</p>
<p>This bureaucratic view is predicated on the assumption of the superiority of technocratic ability, “scientific” knowledge, and centralized resources. It is a view that is only plausible when combined with the supposed inability of individual actors to foresee such events or to respond to events, especially those deemed beyond their control. In addition to ignoring government intervention as the cause of crises, this top-down view is incorrect and is directly at odds with reality.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref1_c7arsk6" title="A minority of economists, often associated with the Chicago school, believes in “price theory,” but feels that both the gold standard and the Fed are the source of crises that can “pluck” the economy off its long-run growth trajectory and into the economic abyss. As such, they feel that the Fed should follow some kind of nondiscretionary bureaucratic monetary rule such as a 3 percent monetary growth target, the Taylor rule, or nominal gross domestic product targeting." href="#footnote1_c7arsk6">1</a></p>
<p>In contrast, Austrian economists see the free market as highly stable and quick to adapt to changing circumstances, including huge macro destabilizing events such as hurricanes, wars, famines, and pandemics. Here, the crisis is the inevitable result of government intervention, although natural disasters are not ignored.</p>
<p>This bottom-up view is based on an understanding of the interests and ability of entrepreneurs to respond to events, minor and major, to improve their situation and indirectly to “stabilize” the economy. Individuals can respond to even dramatic changes in supply and demand conditions. They respond to crises as consumers, laborers, managers, and entrepreneurs, as well as communities, churches, civic groups, family members, friends, and neighbors, but all can be paralyzed or incapacitated by the top-down policy approach.</p>
<p>Without describing the process of how the free-market system works and without the benefit of any real-world experience, the decision of what approach to choose is a coin toss. In a world in which education, the media, and the government all side with the top-down government approach, it will win the public opinion coin toss by default—after all, <em>something</em> must be done! The purpose of this article is to explain how the anarchy of individual actions works to buffer the economy like a shock absorber.</p>
<h4>The Black Hole of Economics</h4>
<p>It is hard to explain and understand how mainstream economists think about economic crises, because they have written so little about how the economics of the crisis works, per se. Their bogeyman is deflation. They see deflation, in the form of falling prices, to be like a black hole. If the economy gets near deflation, it will be sucked into the black hole and never be able to emerge again. I have coined the term <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Apoplithorismosphobia">apoplithorismosphobia</a> to describe their psychological problem and <a href="https://mises.org/library/apoplithorismosphobia-1">my article</a> on the same subject should be sufficient to describe the manifestations of the phobia and its tragic results. Ben <a href="https://mises.org/library/bernankes-apoplithorismosphobia">Bernanke</a> has deflation-phobia and so does Paul <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/24/opinion/fear-of-a-quagmire.html">Krugman</a> so it is safe to assume the fear is widely spread.</p>
<p>Their credibility is unmasked by the fact that the biggest direct losers from deflation are the wealthy political elites and crony capitalists. Everyone will get some kind of “haircut” during the process, but the big losers are mostly the same people who benefitted from the corrupt system that caused the crisis in the first place!</p>
<p>The enormous unmentioned benefit of this deflationary/crisis process is that we might be able to break free from paper fiat-money inflation, the “regulated” fractional reserve banking system, exploding government debt, and the Fed itself! Obviously, the rank-and-file citizen would benefit from the completion of this process.</p>
<h4>Free-Market Shock Absorbers</h4>
<p>The traditional vehicle suspension system contains many mechanical parts with the most famous being the shock absorber. It is designed to absorb much of the energy that results from the change in the road surface. It dissipates much of the absorbed energy from bumps in the road to smooth out the ride for motorists. Indeed, much of the automobile involves absorbing shocks, from the tires to the padded seats and steering wheel, making vehicle transport more desirable than otherwise.</p>
<p>The economic analogy to micro and macroeconomic shocks also involves a similar set of “parts” including prices, markets, warehousing, transportation, etc. That are designed to reduce (minimization subject to cost) shocks. Most of these parts function to economize on the natural uncertainty of change for entrepreneurs that result from unexpected changes in prices, the normal imperfections of the road, so to speak. This process is governed or regulated by the natural system of <a href="https://mises.org/library/profit-and-loss-0">profit and loss</a>.</p>
<p>These same parts also function in irregular occurrences of macroeconomic shocks, as when the brakes, tires, steering, shock absorbers, etc. Are engaged prior to an accident. The market economy also has analogs to the car’s bumpers, air bags, and other emergency features. These secondary parts include untapped resources, such as savings, land, mines, unused factories, facilities, and residences, and a multitude of unemployed labor at “full employment.” In addition, there is always untapped technology, or “advanced” technology that is unprofitable prior to a shock. The tertiary level of shock absorption are global, financial, and sophisticated institutions that are capable of absorbing macroeconomic shocks, such as multinational corporations and financial institutions, hedge funds, and sovereign funds, although this is not necessarily their primary purpose.</p>
<p>The primary component in all these shock absorbing parts is entrepreneurship. The free market provides the widest possible latitude for individuals to seek their most rewarding course of action and to achieve their goals. This is true, not just for entrepreneur/business owners, but also for capitalists, property owners, and labor, all of whom are constrained by self-interest, if not by direct profit and loss.</p>
<p>We can view the free market as a shock absorber for all events large and small. The smallest purchase creates an immediate reaction regarding inventory information that moves backward through the structure of production from retail to wholesale to production facilities to input suppliers and labor markets, and all the way back to raw materials and resource extraction. This system has a built-in, profit driven, feedback mechanism of signals regarding changes in supply or demand, and thus signals to entrepreneurs to either cutback, redouble, or redirect their efforts.</p>
<p>The failsafe mechanism, beyond adjustments for profit and loss, is related to the legal system. Entire firms can shut down production, downsize, or go out of business. This frees up the company’s resources for alternative uses in other companies. Weak companies can combine with stronger companies through mergers and acquisitions to take advantage of cost savings and economies of scale. Adjacent to this is the process of bankruptcy for insolvent companies, where distressed companies can be reconfigured to continue operating. All these processes create efficiency and frees up resources for alternative uses. So, the basic legal and judicial systems play an important role in this economic process.</p>
<h4>Nuts and Bolts</h4>
<p>What happens in an economic crisis is based on the knowledge of how the market works. This in turn explains how the market softens the blow from the crisis. Furthermore, the process is self-contained and self-regulated. It does not need acts of government intervention. This failure to understand the market process is why mainstream economists believe in black hole economics.</p>
<p>The most salient feature of a crisis is a sharp fall in the value of most capital assets. The most evident aspect of this feature is a strong decline in stock markets. In general, the value of stocks is estimated by the market with the discounted value of its estimated revenues over time and this value is “shocked” by the revelation of a crisis, whether its war, business cycle, or something else. For example, the NASDAQ Composite stock index, which is heavily weighted to technology and capital investment, fell by roughly two-thirds in the tech bust of the early 2000s, by one-half after the housing bubble, and has already fallen by about one-third its value in the current crisis.</p>
<p>Secondarily, the prices of raw materials also tend to collapse. For example, the price of lumber declined significantly after the Tech Bubble, the Housing Bubble, and the Lockdown Bubble. As a master ingredient in production and consumption, the price of oil ebbs and flows with the Boom Bust cycle as well. The graph below shows the price of oil since the mid-1980s with the National Bureau of Economic Research recessions shaded in gray.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>A third noteworthy impact of an economic crisis is its negative impact on labor markets. Unemployment in the capital goods related industries is significant and the impact is pervasive on employment, new hirings, and wage rates. We have recently experienced a significant decline in the labor force participation rate, a record number of job openings (60 percent higher than the prelockdown records!), and a very large number of new hirings in the aftermath of government lockdowns, but average real wages have already declined by 10 percent since the recent peak.</p>
<p>Economic crises also negatively impact the price of consumer goods. With the capital-intensive sectors smashed and fewer job opportunities and lower real wages for workers, it is not surprising that the prices of consumer goods weaken. However, consumers adjust to crises by cutting back on investments, luxury goods, consumer durable purchases, such as homes, cars, clothes, and appliances, and focus on primary goods such as food and energy. This typically means that the prices of such goods do not decline nearly as much as capital and labor.</p>
<p>This all sounds bad as everything is in decline, but alert individuals realize this situation is pivotal for making profits. If capital and raw material prices have crashed and wage rates have collapsed, but consumer good prices have not, then entrepreneurs will sense and investigate profit opportunities.</p>
<p>These opportunities cluster around the low prices of capital goods (e.g., office space, real estate, technology, and production facilities), raw materials, and labor (skilled and technology workers and recent college graduates, especially), combined with the relatively elevated prices of final consumer goods. Entrepreneurs exploit these profit opportunities by reorganizing unemployed capital, labor, and materials to sell consumer goods as well as brand new products. This also applies to previously advanced technologies, a silver lining to the otherwise unfortunate boom-bust process.</p>
<p>For example, imagine a large economic crisis where major airlines go bankrupt, flights are cancelled en masse, planes, pilots, and flight attendants are unemployed, airports are nearly empty, and the price of jet fuel drops considerably. Might airline entrepreneurs not enter the market and offer cheap flights at a profit? Or might former Boeing engineers not develop and test a prototype pilotless plane in their spare time?</p>
<p>This deflationary process is a primary aspect of the free market’s role as an automatic shock absorber. The best discussion of this is still probably Rothbard’s (1963) <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/cdn.mises.org/Americas%20Great%20Depression_3.pdf"><em>America’s Great Depression</em></a> chapter on the theory of the business cycle and his discussion on the “general economic ‘return to normal,’” although the last few pages of <a href="https://mises.org/library/lessons-young-economist">Murphy’s text</a> is also good. This process is generally not taught in economics courses and is not depicted in textbooks, which are typically limited to the topics of the government’s “automatic stabilizers” and fiscal and monetary stabilization policies. William Anderson <a href="https://mises.org/library/murray-rothbard-and-deflation-bogey">summarizes Rothbard’s view on deflation</a>, as well.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the people making decisions concerning an economic crisis—politicians, bureaucrats, and Fed officials—have no skills to make the right decisions. As a result, they are likely to panic and to act in the <a href="https://mises.org/wire/feds-real-mandate">interests of the political elites</a>. This means the <a href="https://mises.org/wire/feds-full-employment-mandate-mandate-inflation">wrong solution of more monetary inflation</a> and other interventions to protect those interests.</p>
<p>In contrast, the best political solutions are straightforward from a proper understanding of how markets work. I will present them in a future article but in general the idea is to maintain and expand the free-market economy and reduce and restrict government intervention from the economy.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Can the Dollar Once Again Be Anchored by Gold? One Congressman Believes It Can]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60643</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>On October 7, 2022, US congressman Alex Mooney (a Republican from West Virginia) introduced a bill (the <a href="https://www.moneymetals.com/uploads/content/HR-9157-Gold-Standard-Restoration-Act----Alex-Mooney.pdf">Gold Standard Restoration Act</a>, H.R. 9157) that stipulates that the US dollar must be backed by physical gold owned by the US Treasury. The initiative clearly indicates that the increasingly inflationary US dollar is triggering efforts to get better money.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there have already been many legislative changes to make precious metals more attractive as a means of payment in recent years: in many US states, the value-added and capital gains taxes on gold and silver, but also on platinum and palladium, have been <a href="https://www.degussa-goldhandel.de/pdf/marktreport/Degussa-Marktreport-14-09-2018.pdf">abolished</a>. Mr. Mooney’s proposal is divided into three sections.</p>
<p>The <em>first section</em> of the bill establishes the need for a return to a gold-backed US dollar. For example, it is said that the US dollar—or more precisely, the bill refers to “Federal Reserve Notes”—that is, banknotes issued by the US Federal Reserve (Fed)—has lost its purchasing power on a massive scale in the past: Since 2000, it has dropped by 30 percent, and since 1913 by 97 percent. The bill also argues that with an inflation target of 2 percent, the Fed will not preserve the purchasing power of the US dollar but will have it halved after just thirty-five years. Moreover, the bill points out that it is in the interest of US citizens and firms to have a “stable US dollar.” The bill highlights that the inflationary US dollar has been eroding the industrial base of the US economy, enriching the owners of financial assets, while endangering workers’ jobs, wages, and savings.</p>
<p>The <em>second section</em> of the bill describes in more detail the technical process for reanchoring the US dollar to the US official gold stock. It states that (1) the US secretary of the Treasury must define the US dollar banknotes using a fixed fine gold weight thirty days after the law goes into effect, based on the closing price of the gold on that day. The Fed must (2) ensure that the US banknotes are redeemable for physical gold at the designated rate at the Fed. (3) If the banks of the Fed system fail to comply with peoples’ exchange requests, the exchange must be made by the US Treasury, and in return, the Treasury takes the Fed’s bank assets as collateral.</p>
<p>The <em>third section</em> specifies how a “fair” gold price in US dollar can develop in an orderly manner within thirty days after the bill has taken effect. To this end, (1) the US Treasury and the Fed must publish all of their gold holdings, disclosing all purchases, sales, swaps, leases, and all other gold transactions that have taken place since the “temporary” suspension of the redeemability of the US dollar into gold on August 15, 1971, under the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944. In addition, (2) the US Treasury and the Fed must publicly disclose all gold redemptions and transfers in the 10 years preceding the “temporary” suspension of the US dollar’s gold redemption obligation on August 15, 1971.</p>
<h4><strong>What to Make of This?</strong></h4>
<p>The bill’s core is the idea of reanchoring the US dollar to physical gold based on a fair gold price freely determined in the market. (By the way, this is an idea <a href="https://mises.org/library/theory-money-and-credit">put forward</a> by the economist Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973) in the early 1950s.<img border="0" height="1" src="file:///C:/Users/danie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif" width="1" />) In this context, the bill refers to US banknotes. However, banknotes only comprise a (fractional) part of the total US dollar money supply. But since US bank deposits can be redeemed (at least in principle) in US banknotes, not only US dollar cash (coins and notes) could be exchanged for gold, but also the money supply M1 or M2 as fixed and savings deposits could be exchanged for sight deposits, and sight deposits, in turn, could be withdrawn in cash by customers, and the banknotes could then be exchanged for gold at the Fed.</p>
<p>As of August 2022, the stock of US cash (“currency in circulation”) amounted to $2,276.3 billion. Assuming that the official physical gold holdings of the US Treasury amount to 261.5 million troy ounces, and the market expected US cash to be backed by the official US gold stock, a gold price of about $8,700 per troy ounce would result. This would correspond to a 418 percent increase compared to the current gold price of $1,680. If, however, the market were to expect the entire US money supply M2 to be covered by the official US gold stock, then the price of gold would move toward $83,000 per troy ounce—an increase of 4.840 percent compared to the current gold price. Needless to say, such an appreciation of gold has far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p>All goods prices in US dollars can be expected to rise (perhaps to the extent that the price of gold has risen). After all, the purchasing power of the owners of gold has increased significantly. Therefore, they can be expected to use their increased purchasing power to buy other goods (such as consumer goods, but also stocks, houses, etc.). If this happens, the prices of these goods in US dollar terms will be pushed up—and thus, the initial purchasing power gain that the gold dollar holders have enjoyed by being tied to the increased gold price will melt away again. Moreover, if US banks were willing to accept additional gold from the public in exchange for issuing new US dollar, reanchoring the US dollar in gold would increase the upward price effect.</p>
<p>A reanchoring of the US dollar in the US official gold stock will result in a far-reaching redistribution of income and wealth. In fact, it would be fatal for the outstanding US dollar debt: US dollar goods prices would rise, caused by a rise in the US dollar gold price at which the US dollar is redeemable for physical gold, thereby eroding the US dollar’s purchasing power. In the foreign exchange markets, the US dollar would probably appreciate drastically against those currencies that are not backed by gold and against currencies which are backed by gold not as fine compared to the fineness of the gold backing of the US dollar. The purchasing power of the US dollar abroad would increase sharply, while the US export economy would suffer. US goods would become correspondingly expensive abroad, while foreign companies gain high price competitiveness in the US market.</p>
<p>Once the US dollar is reanchored in gold, today’s chronic inflation will end; monetary policy–induced boom-and-bust cycles will come to an end; the world will become more peaceful because financing a war in a gold-backed monetary system will be very expensive, and the general public will most likely not want to bear its costs. However, there is still room for improvement. A “Gold Standard Restoration Act” will deserve unconditional support if and when it paves the way toward a truly “free market for money.” A free market in money means that you and I have the freedom to choose the kind of money we believe serves our purposes best; and that people are free to offer their fellow human beings a good that they voluntarily choose to use as money.</p>
<p>In a truly free market, people will choose the good they want to use as money. Most importantly, in a truly free market in money, the state (as we know it today) loses its influence on money and money production altogether. In fact, the state (and the special interest groups that exploit the state) no longer determine which kind of gold (coins and bars, cast or minted) can be used as money; the state is no longer active in the minting business and cannot monopolize it anymore; there is no longer a state-controlled central bank to intervene in the credit and money markets and influence market interest rates. That said, let us hope that the Gold Standard Restoration Act proposed by Mr. Mooney will pave the way to reforming the US dollar currency system—and that it will eventually move us toward a truly free market in money.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[About That Nobel: Deconstructing Banking Theories of Diamond and Dybvig ]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60799</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Since the awarding of the Nobel Prize in economics to Ben S. Bernanke, Douglas W. Diamond, and Philip H. Dybvig, most of the media interest has, understandably, concentrated on Bernanke. <a href="https://mises.org/wire/ben-bernankes-nobel-prize-committee-rewards-arsonist-claiming-fight-fire-he-started">Mark Thornton wrote a scathing takedown of bailout Ben</a>, while <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/10/the-economic-contributions-of-ben-bernanke.html">Tyler Cowen inexplicably praised him to the skies</a> (Cowen at least provides a good overview of some of Bernanke’s contributions, such as they are).</p>
<p>This has allowed Diamond and Dybvig (DD) to escape much scrutiny, which is a shame, since their work is even more symptomatic of the state of modern economics and mainstream analyses of money and banking than that of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/29/pimco-recruits-ex-federal-reserve-chairman-ben-bernanke">bankster darling Bernanke</a>. DD have arguably also had much more influence on how economists analyze banking. Their seminal <a href="https://www.bu.edu/econ/files/2012/01/DD83jpe.pdf">1983 paper in the <em>Journal of Political Economy</em>, “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity,”</a> has over thirteen thousand citations on Google Scholar, a number that’s now bound to grow even higher. It has also been described as “<a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2010/q1/cavalcanti">a significant conceptual and methodological advance in studying banking arrangements.</a>” So let’s take a critical look at the paper that has been so influential and which is now crowned with Nobel laurels.</p>
<h4>The DD “Bank</h4>
<p>DD wanted to study banking and, in particular, to see what kinds of stable equilibria a banking system would produce and which government interventions could possibly improve the market outcome. In order to do this, they constructed a model—and a rather peculiar one at that.</p>
<p>In the DD model, there is only one economic good and the economy runs for three periods, T = 0, 1, 2. In period 0, each person receives a unit of the good. The good can only be consumed in periods 1 or 2: if it’s invested in production until period 2, it will yield double the good and the person can consume two units.</p>
<p>In period 0, everyone will invest, since the good can be withdrawn from production and consumed in period 1. In the next period, something magical happens: everyone wakes up and realizes his personality type. Type 1 persons have very high time preference and want to consume immediately, despite the high returns from investment; type 2 persons have low time preference and are willing to wait until period 2 before they consume. As a result, type 1 persons now consume their goods, while type 2 persons wait.</p>
<p>Before going on to discuss the DD bank, a peculiarity of the model is worth noting: there is no money here—indeed, DD explicitly state that there is no exchange at all. The problems of banking are, as Ludwig von Mises taught, a subset of monetary theory—a point that mainstream economists also accept, since they agree that banks provide liquidity. Yet the model that forms the basis for a major part of modern banking theory explicitly excludes money from consideration—most peculiar, one would think.</p>
<p>DD now introduces a “bank”: instead of investing, persons turn over their assets to the bank in return for a liquid claim, i.e., they can cash in at any time (meaning in period 1 or 2). Thus, the bank provides liquidity—although again, it is hard to see the point in an economy where exchange, and therefore the need for money and liquidity, has been explicitly excluded.</p>
<p>Having set up a bank, DD then proceed to show how multiple equilibria are possible—an equilibrium in which all claims are satisfied and a “bank run” equilibrium, where everyone withdraws his asset in period 1, leading to zero production in period 2. While banking thus provides a useful service of liquidity transformation, DD conclude that it is also inherently unstable and that outside help—government-sponsored deposit insurance or a central bank—is required to avoid bank runs.</p>
<h4>The Key Problems of DD Banking Theory</h4>
<p>Since there is no money in the DD model, it follows that there also cannot be any banking in a conventional sense. In the classic English definition, a banker is a man who lends other people’s money: he intermediates between different people, savers and borrowers. The DD “bank” does no such thing. It is simply a production manager—it is not a financial intermediary. It takes in assets, manages the production process, and returns assets to the depositors on demand. It can only get into trouble insofar as it pays out assets before the end of production—and then only if it pays out more than the depositors could naturally claim in period 1. In short, to make any sense of the model, we have to conceive of it as a pyramid scheme of sorts.</p>
<p>That being said, DD are believed to model how banks engage in maturity transformation—indeed, the Nobel Committee focused on this aspect in <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2022/popular-information/">their depiction of the DD model</a>. Maturity transformation means that savers prefer to lend short term to reduce their risks, and borrowers prefer to borrow long term to be able to invest long term without having to pay back loans before the production processes are complete. Banks then step in as intermediaries: they borrow short term from savers and lend long term to businessmen. The short-term loans are then continuously rolled over: some savers quit and others take their place, but in aggregate the sum of savings available for investment is not volatile. DD see maturity transformation as the cause of unstable banking: to avoid or mitigate bank runs, which here means depositors withdrawing their funds at a greater rate than foreseen, government intervention is necessary.</p>
<p>The problem for DD and modern banking theorists is that there is nothing new in all this. The problem of maturity transformation was well known centuries ago and led to the formulation of the “golden rule of banking”: as Ludwig von Mises, quoting Karl Knies, <a href="https://d.docs.live.net/2106a0a91e11ef4f/AppData/Local/Temp/pid-11664/%20HYPERLINK%20/%22https:/mises.org/library/theory-money-and-credit/html/pp/1273/">explained</a>: “the date on which the bank’s obligations fall due must not precede the date on which its corresponding claims can be realized.” In other words, far from what the Nobel-winning DD would lead us to believe, banking theorists considered maturity transformation long ago, and they had a clear answer to how bankers should handle it: don’t do it.</p>
<p>Modern economists have also engaged the question of maturity transformation in a more thoughtful way: Austrian economists <a href="http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-009-0050-z">Philipp Bagus and David Howden</a> have analyzed the practice of maturity mismatching—i.e., of not obeying the golden rule of banking—and debated its legitimacy and economic consequences with <a href="http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-010-0677-9">Randy Barnett and Walter Block</a>. Most importantly, these economists, unlike Diamond and Dybvig, have not confused the question of maturity transformation with the basic questions of banking theory.</p>
<p>The most fundamental problem with banking theory à la DD is that it ignores the basic problem of banking and the reason for its crucial importance in economic theory. This has nothing to do with maturity transformation, which is simply a question of sound banking management. Banks are important economically because they can increase the money supply by issuing unbacked money substitutes—i.e., fiduciary media. A theory of banking, if it is to address economic reality, must investigate the causes and consequences of this phenomenon. Needless to say, DD don’t do this, and theorists following their lead only do so tangentially. Whatever value DD’s models have, it is close to nil for economic theory.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The Swedish central bank is thus celebrating not only modern central banking with the 2022 Nobel, but also essentially mistaken theories of banking. Mainstream monetary theory has become increasingly detached from reality over the years, and Diamond and Dybvig’s work is a key example of this: in the pursuit of elegant models, they close their eyes to the real problems of banking—credit expansion and money creation—and at best focus on tangential issues of banking technique.</p>
<p>This is symptomatic of the general trend of economics, and nowhere is the distinction and superiority of the Austrian school more evident than in the case of monetary theory. From <a href="https://mises.org/library/theory-money-and-credit">Mises’s 1912 <em>Theory of Money and Credit</em></a> on, Austrians have emphasized that the key question of banking theory is the creation of money <em>ex nihilo</em> in the process of credit expansion. <a href="https://www.mises.at/static/literatur/Buch/hayek-the-counter-revolution-of-science.pdf">To paraphrase F.A. Hayek</a>, every important advance in monetary theory during the last hundred years was a further step in the consistent application of Misesian—i.e., marginal and praxeological—principles. Unfortunately, neither the Swedes, nor Diamond and Dybvig, nor Bernanke realize this.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[The Realistic Market for Private Governance]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60821</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Excerpted from remarks delivered at the Free Private Cities "Liberty in our Lifetime" Conference in Prague on 22 October, 2022]</strong></p>
<p>At this conference and others like it, dealing with alternative legal and monetary structures, I’ve noticed in recent years a strong bias in favor of action over argument, for building over persuading, for practice over theory. This is laudable and understandable for all of us frustrated by statism and all its terrible offspring: war, bad money, division, along with economic, social, and cultural degradation. We understandably want out, and not one hundred years from now but within our lifetimes.</p>
<p>I saw a response to a tweet promoting this gathering to this effect: you have some great thinkers and theorists scheduled to speak, but what you really need is urban planners! Or, we might think, architects and engineers. This is certainly a fair point! But I must confess to representing the theorists today, and Rothbardians in particular.</p>
<p>In my defense, the theory underpinning any new model for private governance or free cities is as important as the blueprints for a building. Carpenters have a saying, “Measure twice and cut once.” Another version of this is found in the Zen koan “Slow down to speed up.” Maybe this is a good time to rethink our approach to what private governance could mean, and how better to align this movement with current political, economic, and cultural realities. Remember, “parallel” implies peaceful coexistence with existing political structures. It is nonthreatening and voluntary.</p>
<p>To promote the idea of private governance, we should understand it fully ourselves. We should make sure our vision comports with human nature, which is another way of saying it aligns with the marketplace. As entrepreneurs, we should take the world as it is rather than how we wish it were. Otherwise, we risk creating a product that nobody is buying.</p>
<p>And as an aside, speaking of creating, let’s not forget the earliest and most enduring form of private governance is the family! Maybe the fastest way to build your own “parallel structure” is to start having kids. We heard a lot yesterday about living as a digital nomad, seeking multiple passports, and seasteading, but we should not forget that the whole point of building better governance structures is so humans can live better. This requires new humans!</p>
<p>I also suggest an appeal to the better angels among the many nationalist and breakaway movements happening across the world. These are real, they hunger for independence, and we should not ignore them. And of course we should sell community: clean and safe streets, nice parks, good schools, and competent local services from competent local providers. I mean the basic building blocks of a nice community. A good place to raise a family, as the saying goes. The market for start-up or private communities is not only expats or perpetual travelers or bitcoin aficionados, but also soccer moms and religious people and retirees.</p>
<p>We can use the term “private” in more than one sense: the first is personal, relating to private matters in our personal lives, matters which are not public. And we use it as a bright-line distinction between state and civil society, between government action and private action—though, as we’ve seen, that distinction is increasingly blurred by what Robert Higgs calls “participatory fascism.” But when discussing private cities or regions or services or governance, we use “private” as a synonym for “commercial,” like any private business. In this sense, we simply mean “not governmental.” But beyond that the possible models are wide open, so we should focus on consumer sovereignty just as the seller of any new product should.</p>
<p>The marketplace—capital and entrepreneurship, as opposed to politics—is the way forward.</p>
<h4><strong>I. The Dystopian Vision</strong></h4>
<p>When we consider the market for new parallel private structures, we should take a moment to play devil’s advocate and consider the typical strawman arguments presented by people who reflexively abhor the notion of private government. These are the people who go on and on about our “sacred democracy” but cannot conceive of the truly democratizing elements of the marketplace, what Mises called a “daily plebiscite.” It’s uncanny: people have no objection whatsoever to private governance when it comes to vast companies like Google or the British National Trust (the biggest private landowner in the UK) or the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church or the management of Real Madrid football club. But suggest privatizing police or trash pickup in their town of thirty thousand, and they overwhelmingly object. Why?</p>
<p>In large part, “privatization” has become a boogieman for progressives, who treat the concept as a sinister plot for big corporations to run our lives. This is the mentality we must overcome.</p>
<p>In 1992, the sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson published a really enjoyable and groundbreaking book titled <em>Snow Crash</em>, which essentially presents a cheeky anarcho-capitalist future—fully privatized, but very messy. The reader senses Stephenson is one of us, but also a bit of a provocateur and contrarian.</p>
<p><em>Snow Crash </em>takes place in the old territory of California, over which both the US federal government and the state government lost control following a terrible economic crisis (so, unlike our models, the new “startup” territories were born of necessity, not choice).</p>
<p>Government still controls minor aspects of this new world, but authority is mostly now ceded to a complex patchwork of private sovereign agencies, franchises, and mercenaries—some of whom received their training from and work for the now privatized CIA (after a merger with the Library of Congress).</p>
<p>Mafia gangs have achieved the status of quasi-private governments, and rule a network of semiautonomous corporate neighborhoods (“burbclaves”). These regions are linked by privatized roads and protected by de facto mercenaries. Major intersections in Los Angeles now fall under the control of defense contractors and private security (following gunfire battles to determine who would win control of them).</p>
<p>So the new private territories were not born without violence, and the old “Won’t warlords take over?” critique of privatization is always lurking behind the story. The protagonist, Hiro, is a delivery driver for Cosa Nostra Pizza, a gang run by Uncle Enzo. But the warlords are at least efficient: when Hiro is late with a delivery, he gets an ominous call from Don Enzo himself implying that the next time he fails the thirty-minute guarantee will be the last time.</p>
<p>Only in the metaverse (a term credited to Stephenson) does Hiro have more status, as a successful denizen of the upper echelons of society unavailable to him in the meat space of his real life delivering pizzas. But even here he is no happier; in the virtual world, every last space is commercialized, monetized, and motivated only by rank status or money. It is a caricature of anarcho-capitalism which ignores the full spectrum of human experience beyond commerce. Stephenson’s metaverse is a hellscape, every human interaction is mercenary and transactional and ugly. This is clearly not the way to sell private governance!</p>
<h4><strong>II. Rothbard’s Vision</strong></h4>
<p>What if the parallel communities we seek to build already exist in some form and our task is to identify and coalesce around those existing “nations within nations”? Surely this would be a leap forward.</p>
<p>Natural communities exist everywhere; they may not be libertarian in outlook, but neither are many private entities which don’t aggress against anyone. The idea is not only to start up such communities, but also to recognize them. Religious groups like the Amish and the Mennonites in America; ethnic, cultural, and linguistic identifications like the Catalans in Spain or the Welsh in the United Kingdom; corporations; fraternal associations—even country clubs and gated housing developments—all form natural communities which may well increasingly seek to unyoke from their centralized and failing political rulers. They may be socialist or capitalist, right wing or woke, provincial or cosmopolitan, provided they have no desire or incentive to aggress against other private communities.</p>
<p>To sell parallel structures, we should identify them in nascent form here and now.</p>
<p>Murray Rothbard’s article “<a href="https://mises.org/library/nations-consent">Nations by Consent</a>,” written just before he died, in 1994, is an excellent guidepost here:</p>
<p align="left">The “nation,” of course, is not the same thing as the state, a difference that earlier libertarians and classical liberals such as Ludwig von Mises and Albert Jay Nock understood full well. Contemporary libertarians often assume, mistakenly, that individuals are bound to each other only by the nexus of market exchange. They forget that everyone is necessarily born into a family, a language, and a culture.</p>
<p align="left">Every person is born into one or several overlapping communities, usually including an ethnic group, with specific values, cultures, religious beliefs, and traditions. He is generally born into a “country.” He is always born into a specific historical context of time and place, meaning neighborhood and land area.</p>
<p>Rothbard provides several key takeaways which can benefit the marketing of private governance:</p>
<ul><li>Nation is not state. Nation stands between individual and state.</li><li>Contractual consent and the right to exit distinguish truly private “nations” from a government or state.</li><li>A true “free private city” does not originate with conquest or decades/centuries of disputed titles, but rather with a fresh start, clear title, and a win-win market approach to services and membership (“citizenship”).</li><li>Total privatization “solves” nationality problems, <em>even while some land areas remain in the governmental sphere</em>.</li><li>Decentralization and localism “solve” problems of access for enclaves and landlocked areas.</li><li>Voting and citizenship are inferior to consent, contract, and ownership in a true private community.</li></ul>
<p>Rothbard’s conception of a nation is very different than a “state,” although we have been led to believe the two are synonymous. By identifying existing nations—organic and not contrived, like so many national borders—we dramatically increase the market opportunities for selling private governance to dissatisfied constituencies.</p>
<h4><strong>III. Common Law: No Vision Required!</strong></h4>
<p>While we identify existing nations and intentional communities, we similarly can identify existing mechanisms for ordering, structuring, and enforcing contractual societies. We don’t necessarily need dramatic new constitutions or complex legal structures. Common law, evolved over centuries of hard human experience, provides a dependable model to navigate conflicts and provide governance guardrails in a private parallel structure. We don’t need a grand vision; we need the wisdom of the ages.</p>
<p>Moreover, I think we should be very cautious about imagining what we can design. This is not only the lesson of Hayek, but also the lesson of countless entrepreneurs finding their way in the marketplace every day.</p>
<p>Remember, law is about conflict. It is about resolving, hopefully minimizing, violence and property disputes in society—which is precisely why politics is self-defeating, even if you accept its premises. Private societies seek to promote human flourishing in win-win ways, versus the zero-sum political outcomes and deeply harmful state legal systems. But we should remember that a key measure of whether a society is just and flourishing is how it handles the inevitable conflicts and frictions that occur under any kind of system.</p>
<p>But we need the market for this! In Adam Smith’s time—despite the de jure government monopoly on courts—a Scottish or English peasant had more choice of law than we do today! Parties could use local, manorial, county, ecclesiastical, merchant, chancery (equitable relief versus money damages), and common law venues. Why do we have fewer choices of law in the West today?</p>
<p>In <em>For a New Liberty</em>, Rothbard points out how the history of a changing and evolving law can be enormously useful to find just rules: “Since we have a body of common law principles to draw on, however, the task of reason in correcting and amending the common law would be far easier than trying to construct a body of systematic legal principles de novo out of the thin air.”</p>
<p>Bruno Leoni, the midcentury Italian philosopher and legal theorist, makes the best case for how to have law without legislation—and without legislatures—in his 1961 classic <em><a href="https://mises.org/library/freedom-and-law">Freedom and the Law</a></em>.</p>
<p align="left">In Anglo-Saxon common law, “law” did not mean what we think today: endless enactments by a legislature or executive. “Law” was not enacted but found or discovered; it was a body of customary rules that had, like languages or fashions, grown up spontaneously and purely voluntarily among the people. These spontaneous rules constituted “the law”; and it was the work of experts in the law to determine what the law was and how the law would apply to the numerous cases in dispute that perpetually arise.</p>
<p>A common law model of governance and dispute resolution solves so many of the thorny questions of how to order a private society:</p>
<ul><li>Five-hundred-plus years of real-world “models.”</li><li>Principles are easier than specifics.</li><li>Emphasis on discovery of law mirrors the entrepreneurial market process, akin to the Kirznerian entrepreneurial discovery process.</li><li>Choice of law is provided by the market.</li><li>Adjudication of disputes by contract, known to both parties prior, reduces those disputes.</li><li>Judge-made law reflects the most hyperlocal culture, lifestyle, geography, and economy—and therefore fashions the most just results.</li><li>Judge-made law is more temporal, individualized, flexible, and proportional.</li></ul>
<p>In closing, let me recommend three additional texts to get us thinking in the right direction. First, Titus Gebel’s <a href="https://mises.org/wire/private-cities-model-truly-free-society"><em>Free Private Cities</em></a> is quite literally the handbook for this burgeoning movement. Edward Stringham’s <a href="https://store.mises.org/Private-Governance-Creating-Order-in-Economic-and-Social-Life-P11006.aspx"><em>Private Governance</em></a> is the single best book I’ve seen on the history and technical aspects of creating economic and social order through private mechanisms. Finally, Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein’s wonderful <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3905881047/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0"><em>The State in the Third Millennium</em></a> provides an excellent and erudite argument for transforming states into private service providers as the next stage in human development.</p>
<p>A new and better world is possible through the understanding of private governance, nations within nations, and common law mechanisms for dealing with human conflict. How we market and sell this world is worth understanding, just as any entrepreneurial venture needs both a vision and the hard details.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Critiquing Florida's Public Policy of "Shared Adversity"]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60616</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Long before Ron DeSantis was the antilockdown governor and long before he was the potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate, DeSantis was the water quality governor. He funded 100 percent of appropriations bills that came to his desk his first year and he even got President Donald Trump to pay lip service.</p>
<p>While getting him to offer a comment here and there does not sound like an incredible achievement, it’s worth noting that past Florida governor Jeb Bush didn’t even get the president talking about it when the president was his own brother. I say this to show that while water quality does not sound like a sexy issue, it is so important in Florida that it built the man we know today as Governor DeSantis.</p>
<p>One of the phrases we often hear in the world of Florida water management is “shared adversity.” In an <a href="https://jacquithurlowlippisch.com/2018/07/12/is-it-time-to-address-south-floridas-greatest-taboo-shared-adversity-slr-irl/">article</a> from 2008, current South Florida Water Management District governing board member Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisch, explained the tension in the room as the then Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation director stated that “part of the Lake Okeechobee Release Schedule addresses ‘shared adversity’”: “You could hear a pin drop.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.captivasanibel.com/2010/07/21/the-challenge-of-balancing-everglades-protection-and-sharing-adversity/">What this word means</a>, as it relates to water management, that we must protect the Everglades. However, in order to do so, many parts of Florida must share the adverse effects of rising water levels in Lake Okeechobee by routing the water through various estuaries. The problem is that the mix of the Okeechobee freshwater with the natural salt water in these locations <a href="https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-lagoon/2021/05/13/stuart-florida-gov-ron-desantis-state-of-emergency-hab-lake-o-lake-okeechobee-toxic-algae-bloom/5072563001/">sparks toxic algal blooms</a> that are certainly dangerous to the local ecosystem, destroy the local economies as their tourism plummets, and are outright dangerous to the people in those regions. Thurlow-Lippisch showed exactly why these laws had become so problematic, declaring:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just like other laws of our great county, some do, indeed over time, become outdated for the times. Things change. Among other issues, in 1950, when the Central and South Flood Project law was structured and voted upon to protect the crops in the EAA (Everglades Agricultural Area) as part of flood control 2.81 million people lived in Florida. Today, 20 million people reside here.</p></blockquote>
<p>As more and more people reside where adversity is shared, it becomes more and more dangerous to thrust this water through the estuaries and into the hearts of people’s lives. This battle has waged on in Florida for far longer than I have been alive; however, almost all of the arguments are inherently consequentialist. Here, we can offer a rights-based argument that has been left far from the foreground.</p>
<p>Most readers of the <em>Mises Wire</em> are well aware of Lockean homesteading—mixing one’s self-ownership with natural resources to acquire just ownership of a good. However, some may not be as familiar with Walter Block’s <em>negative homesteading</em>. Block explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>I call this the theory of negative homesteading. In ordinary homesteading, or what we must now call positive homesteading to distinguish it from this newly introduced variety, it is the first person upon the scene who mixes his labor with the land or natural resource who comes away with the property rights in question. It is the first man who farms a plot of land, who becomes the rightful owner.</p>
<p>A similar procedure applies to negative homesteading, only here what gets to be “owned” is a negative, not a positive. This concept refers to some form of unhappiness, not a benefit such as owning land. The ownership of misery, as it were, must stay with its first victim, according to this principle. <em>He cannot legitimately pass it onto anyone else without the latter’s permission</em>. (italics my own)</p></blockquote>
<p>The application to Florida water management is clear with that last line. Shared adversity means to pass that misery on to someone else. The most convincing argument is that perhaps the cities did not vote or approve an agreement to abide by the decisions of these plans, which means they were not passing it on without permission. However, the barber that counts on tourists in season did not agree to this. The dive instructor who had to give up what could’ve been very profitable dives because of an outbreak certainly did not agree to this. The seafood restaurant that counts on local fishermen never signed anything agreeing to this.</p>
<p>This is not to say that any given county should simply give up on the Everglades or on other counties. It is, however, to say that from a rights-based approach, any given county has absolutely every right to stand up and say no, you cannot legitimately pass your negatively homesteaded misery on to me. Any given county can stand up and say we absolutely need a solution to this problem, but you have no right to force <em>this</em> solution.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Burning Down Rothbard]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60782</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Burning Down the House: How Libertarian Philosophy Was Corrupted by Delusion and Greed</em><br />by Andrew Koppelman<br />St. Martin’s Press, 2022, 320 pp.</strong></p>
<p>Andrew Koppelman, a distinguished legal academic who teaches law and political science at Northwestern University, has a quality that few of his fellow academics possess. He is able to find merit in views he strongly opposes, and he tries as best he can to be fair to these views. This quality is much in evidence in “<a href="https://balkin.blogspot.com/2017/10/corrupting-national-book-award.html">Corrupting the National Book Award</a>,” his critical review of Nancy MacLean’s <em>Democracy in Chains</em>: though he agrees with her that libertarian policies pose a danger, he will not countenance her shoddy scholarship. He also is a skilled philosopher who advances many interesting arguments in <em>Burning Down the House</em>.</p>
<p>That said, I do not think his characterization of libertarianism is altogether accurate, and this vitiates many of the criticisms he makes of it; and others of his critical remarks rest on contestable grounds. In suggesting that he is inaccurate, though, I must guard against inaccuracy myself. Koppelman distinguishes Hayekian libertarianism, which stresses the immense capacity for economic growth that the free market makes possible and accepts the need for government welfare programs of a limited sort, from what he takes to be the more extreme sort of libertarianism, defended by Murray Rothbard, Robert Nozick, and Ayn Rand, which accords absolute, or near-absolute, primacy to rights. He rejects only the latter kind, but he is a qualified admirer of F.A. Hayek, though Koppelman allows substantially more government intervention than Hayek would approve.</p>
<p>He acknowledges the strength of Hayek’s case for the free market, and indeed, Hayek’s contention that the market necessarily results in inequalities in wealth and income leads Koppelman to accept more inequality than he otherwise would have:</p>
<blockquote><p>Central planners must depend on a set of definite, specified goals. Since they cannot know all the purposes that individuals are pursuing, Hayek observed, they must impose their own. Tyrannical power is thus inherent in socialism. In short, Hayek argued that a centrally planned economy must be both wasteful and dictatorial. It would deliver neither prosperity nor freedom. In retrospect, it is remarkable how right he was. (p. 34)</p></blockquote>
<p>For Koppelman, it is crucial that Hayek does not contend that those who come out “on top” in market competition deserve their rewards: to the contrary, success depends substantially on luck. Contrary to Koppelman, though, this is not a point that separates Hayek from the rights-based libertarians, possibly excepting Rand. Koppelman says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Moreover, no producer creates the market value of what she produces. That value depends on the environment she happens to occupy. Your matchless ability to play professional basketball commands a high price only because you were lucky enough to be born into a world in which that skill happened to be wanted (and in which most others happened to lack your aptitude). That added value thus is not attributable to you alone. It is a social product, based on the contingent scarcity of your contribution to the division of labor. It is largely an accidental monopoly, like being the owner of the only oasis in a desert. (p. 90)</p></blockquote>
<p>Nozick’s famous Wilt Chamberlain case does not depend on denying this. Rather, Lockean accounts of property acquisition like those of Nozick and Rothbard bypass the question of entitlement to economic value. Once physical assets are acquired in the way the theories mandate, economic value depends on the market decisions of the owners of these assets. There is no space left for further questions about how value is owned. Koppelman goes wrong, I think, because he takes the libertarian rights argument to be that if you have acquired property according to the theory, then you deserve the economic value your ownership of the property gives you, and then objects, “You don’t deserve this value if this means that the value comes to you owing to your moral merit; your economic success, whether because of property you own or ‘natural assets’ you possess, is to a great extent a matter of luck.” Koppelman’s mistake is that the argument about entitlement to economic value doesn’t go through a step about “desert,” in his sense, at all.</p>
<p>Koppelman is guilty of a more serious misunderstanding of Rothbard. He repeats several times that Rothbard is so strongly committed to the “absolute” character of rights that he holds you would have a duty to starve yourself to death if your survival depended on a rights violation. Koppelman says, for example, “No one could sanely agree to Rothbard’s notion of an obligation to starve if one has no money for food” (p. 115). His reference is to a passage in <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/The%20Ethics%20of%20Liberty%2020191108.pdf"><em>Ethics of Liberty</em></a> in which Rothbard says the owner of water in a desert oasis is under no obligation to sell or give water to those who need it to survive; the owner does not violate their rights by refusing. But it does not follow from this that someone who needs the water is under a moral obligation to respect the owner’s rights. Koppelman hasn’t taken account of the section in <em>Ethics of Liberty</em> that deals with “lifeboat cases.” Rothbard <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/The%20Ethics%20of%20Liberty%2020191108.pdf">says</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Many libertarians who otherwise believe in property rights gravely weaken them on behalf of the “contextualist” contention that, given a choice between his life and aggressing against someone else’s property or even life, it is moral for him to commit the aggression and that therefore in such a situation, these property rights cease to exist. The error here on the part of the “contextualist” libertarians is to confuse the question of the moral course of action for the person in such a tragic situation with the totally separate question of whether or not his seizing of lifeboat or plank space by force constitutes an invasion of someone else’s property right.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rothbard’s position amounts to no more and no less than that there is no affirmative legal duty to aid others, a controversial view, no doubt, but one hardly unique to him or to libertarians.</p>
<p>The book contains an even more serious misreading of Rothbard, and I shall close with a discussion of it. This misunderstanding gives rise to the title of Koppelman’s book. He describes a case in which a county in Tennessee arranged for fire protection with a nearby city. Residents of the county had to pay an annual fee to the city fire department for the service. A man regularly paid the fee, but unfortunately for him, a fire broke out the one year he forgot to pay, and because the fire department wouldn’t come to his aid, he lost his house. Koppelman holds that Rothbard, and strict libertarians generally, would say that the fire department acted correctly. People have no right to have others protect them; they are responsible for their own mistakes and ought to suffer the consequences of them. People have no moral obligation to help others: it is “every man for himself,” unless someone freely decides to help.</p>
<p>Koppelman is right that Rothbard holds people do not have the right to be protected, but it does not follow from this that he would have to take the hardhearted view that the farmer deserved what he got, or, in this case, failed to get. Rothbard could perfectly well hold, as I would myself, that the fire department ought to have come to the man’s aid, charging him a fee afterward. Perhaps Koppelman’s point is that this is how private fire departments might be expected to act, but in what way the monopolistic arrangement between two government agencies is supposed to show this I am unable to fathom. If the point of the example is that in cases where, in contrast to provision of services by contract, the government provides fire protection directly, without contracting it out, people have a legal right to be protected, the answer is that this is just not so. It is legally up to a “public” fire department to decide how to respond to a request for help.</p>
<p>There is a great deal more in Koppelman’s stimulating book that merits discussion, such as the sections on drug legislation and antidiscrimination law, but I hope I have said enough to show that the book is worth sustained confrontation.</p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Latest Recession Alarm: Money-Supply Growth Fell in September to a 37-Month Low]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60802</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Money supply growth fell again in September, dropping to a 37-month low. August's drop continues a steep downward trend from the unprecedented highs experienced during much of the past two years. During the thirteen months between April 2020 and April 2021, money supply growth in the United States often climbed above 35 percent year over year, well above even the "high" levels experienced from 2009 to 2013. </p>
<p>During September 2022, year-over-year (YOY) growth in the money supply was at 3.92 percent. That's down from August's rate of 4.54 percent, and down from September 2021's rate of 7.02 percent. </p>
<p>The growth rates during most of 2020, and through April 2021, were much higher than anything we'd seen during previous cycles, with the 1970s being the only period that came close. Since then, however, we have seen a fast fall from previous highs and such rapid declines generally point to economic contraction in following months. </p>
<div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption" style="position: relative;"><div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption" style="position: relative;"><div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption" style="position: relative;"><div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption" style="position: relative;"><div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption" style="position: relative;"><div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption"><a href="https://cdn.mises.org/tms1_12.jpg" title="tms" class="colorbox" data-colorbox-gallery="gallery-all-u-n3mjrvgzA" data-cbox-img-attrs="{"title": "", "alt": "tms"}"><img class="media-element file-image-no-caption" data-delta="1" alt="tms" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://cdn.mises.org/styles/max_1160/s3/tms1_12.jpg?itok=gXCMjUww" width="1160" height="752" title="" /></a></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>The money supply metric used here—<a href="https://mises.org/library/austrian-definitions-supply-money">the "true" or Rothbard-Salerno money supply measure</a> (TMS)—is the metric developed by Murray Rothbard and Joseph Salerno, and is designed to provide a better measure of money supply fluctuations than M2. The Mises Institute now offers <a href="https://mises.org/austrian-school/money-supply">regular updates</a> on this metric and its growth. This measure of the money supply differs from M2 in that it includes Treasury deposits at the Fed (and excludes short-time deposits and retail money funds).</p>
<p>In recent months, M2 growth rates have followed a similar course to TMS growth rates. In September 2022, the M2 growth rate was 2.52 percent. That's down from August's growth rate of 3.78 percent. September's rate was also well down from September 2021's rate of 12.88 percent. </p>
<p>Money supply growth can often be a helpful measure of economic activity, and an indicator of coming recessions. During periods of economic boom, money supply tends to grow quickly as commercial banks make more loans. Recessions, on the other hand, tend to be preceded by slowing rates of money supply growth. However, money supply growth tends to begin growing again <em>before </em>the onset of recession. </p>
<p>Another indicator of recession appears in the form of the gap between M2 and TMS. The TMS growth rate typically climbs and becomes larger than the M2 growth rate in the early months of a recession. This occurred in the early months of the 2001 and the 2007–09 recession. A similar pattern appeared before the 2020 recession. </p>
<p>Notably, this has happened again beginning in May this year as the M2 growth rate in fell below the TMS growth rate for the first time since 2020. Put another way, when the difference between M2 and TMS moves from a positive number to a negative number, that's a fairly reliable indicator the economy has entered into recession. We can see this in this graph: </p>
<div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption" style="position: relative;"><div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption"><a href="https://cdn.mises.org/gap_m2_tms.jpg" title="tms" class="colorbox" data-colorbox-gallery="gallery-all-u-n3mjrvgzA" data-cbox-img-attrs="{"title": "", "alt": "tms"}"><img class="media-element file-image-no-caption" data-delta="2" alt="tms" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://cdn.mises.org/styles/max_1160/s3/gap_m2_tms.jpg?itok=9TIjj482" width="1160" height="611" title="" /></a></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>In the two "false alarms" over the past 30 years, the M2-TMS gap reverted to positive territory fairly quickly. However, when this gap firmly enters negative territory, that is an indicator that the economy<em> is already in recession.</em> The gap has now been negative for 5 of the past 6 months. Moreover, the gap in September was -1.4, and there is only one case—1998—in more than 30 years during which the gap was greater than -1 and the US not in recession.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this indicator also appears to follow the pattern of yield curve inversion. For example, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y#0">the 2s/10s yield inversion</a> went negative in all the same periods where the M2-TMS gap pointed to a recession. Moreover, the 2s/10s inversion was very briefly negative in 1998, and then almost went negative in 2018.  This is not surprising because trends in money supply growth <a href="https://mises.org/wire/why-yield-curve-just-inverted-signaling-coming-recession">have long appeared to be connected to the shape of the yield curve</a>. As Bob Murphy notes in his book <a href="https://mises.org/library/understanding-money-mechanics-3/html"><em>Understanding Money Mechanics</em></a>, a sustained decline in TMS growth often reflects spikes in short-term yields, which can fuel a flattening or inverting yield curve. </p>
<p>It's not especially a mystery as to why short-term interest rates are headed up fast, and why the money supply is decelerating. Since January of this year, the Fed has raised the target federal funds rate from .25 percent up to 3.25 percent. </p>
<div class="media media-element-container media-image_no_caption"><a href="https://cdn.mises.org/ffr_5.jpg" title="ffr" class="colorbox" data-colorbox-gallery="gallery-all-u-n3mjrvgzA" data-cbox-img-attrs="{"title": "", "alt": "ffr"}"><img class="media-element file-image-no-caption" data-delta="4" alt="ffr" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://cdn.mises.org/styles/max_1160/s3/ffr_5.jpg?itok=oTNkQ4C2" width="1160" height="496" title="" /></a></div>
<p>This means fewer injections of Fed money into the market through open market operations. Moreover, although it has done very little to actually reduce the size of its portfolio, the Fed has nonetheless stopped adding to its portfolio through Quantitative Easing, and allowed a small amount ($240 billion out of $8.9 trillion) to roll off. Consequently, market interest rates have headed upward and money-supply growth has decelerated. Economic pain is likely to follow. </p>

 <item> <title><![CDATA[Parallel Structures Are the Only Way to Freedom]]></title>
 <link>https://mises.org/node/60797</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>The battle for political supremacy in the West has been decided. The so-called progressives have won; conservatives and libertarians have lost. The “march through the institutions,” started by the misguided 1968 generation, has been successful, and their children and grandchildren are now at the helm. Eco-socialist, cultural Marxist, in short: <strong><em>bolshewoke</em></strong> ideas prevail in politics and culture, public administration, media, schools, universities, and increasingly even in business. At accelerating speed. If you have kept the same center-left viewpoint over the remaining twenty years, you are considered far right today.</p>
<p>In virtually all Democratic states, there is a tendency for larger organizations to drift to the left over time. This applies equally to television stations, newspapers, political parties, state authorities, universities, and other associations.</p>
<p>Why is this so? The explanation is twofold:</p>
<p>First, if you like to create things or projects on your own, or prefer to work for making a living and then enjoying private life with your family, you are probably less inclined to join any of these institutions. On the other hand, if you like to manipulate other people and control them, you are very much inclined to join these institutions.</p>
<p>The first position correlates rather with conservative positions, the second rather with progressive positions. And precisely because the most fundamental characteristic of Progressive ideas is that they do not work, Progressives concentrate in institutions where ideas do not have to work in order to survive. That is why Progressives are disproportionately found in professions where economically measurable results do not have to be achieved.</p>
<p>Thus, Progressives are often media people, teachers, professors, politicians, or otherwise employed in government service or tax-funded nongovernmental governmental organizations. This has the additional effect that they can then use this position to agitate and discredit permanently, while their victims are busy proving themselves on the market, earning their own living and also supporting their Progressive opponents through taxes.</p>
<p>Second, conservatives and libertarians tend to be more tolerant toward differing political positions. If someone is known as a leftie in their organization, mostly they would allow this person to stay. Not so with the Progressives: They want to missionize and force all nonprogressive fellow citizens, whom they consider either unenlightened or bribed, to a happiness defined by them. Progressives only give a position in an organization to those who have the same world view and kick out dissenters by all means.</p>
<p>And this is how it has been going on for decades in newsrooms, broadcasting stations, universities, and authorities. Whoever is not of their opinion is defamed, suppressed, slandered. As a result, most of these institutions have been irreparably destroyed and can no longer be reformed with reasonable effort.</p>
<p>If one can mobilize $50 billion like Elon Musk, then one can take over Twitter. But it will still be difficult to turn the platform into a beacon of <em>freedom of speech</em> as planned. That’s because virtually the entire workforce tends politically to the left (relation of donations of Twitter employees in the Biden-Trump presidential campaign: 98:2). Since the majority of these people are convinced they are in the right and fighting for a good cause, Musk’s attempts to allow dissent will be sabotaged. Musk will have to replace large parts of the workforce to change this in the long term.</p>
<p>Comparable things apply to newspapers, TV stations, administrations, including the leadership of the armed forces and police, the courts, and practically all educational institutions. Reforms in the sense of a freedom-oriented policy are not impossible but extremely difficult, and they will probably be watered down, because existing sensitivities have to be taken into account.</p>
<h4>Not Forcing People to Be Happy</h4>
<p>We have also to keep in mind that every new generation of students is released into the voting age even more tightly ideologized, thus producing more and more streamlined voters, who are no longer reachable by argumentation and who are not even willing to expose themselves to competing arguments. They learn that the state solves all their problems. Only a minority is able to break out of this framework by own efforts of thought.</p>
<p>Why force these people to be happy against their will? This only makes you unpopular and them angry. Rather, those who refuse for life to become adults, and thus self-responsible individuals, should bear the consequences themselves, And the consequences will be serious. One only has to reflect that almost <em>everything</em> that the woke mainstream claims and that is more or less absorbed by the people, is wrong and the politics based on it will therefore <em>inevitably</em> fail.</p>
<p>For example, take the idea that an industrialized country can be supplied with wind power and solar energy only, or the conviction that the world’s population can be fed with organic food without any fertilizers and pesticides, the idea that one can impose all kinds of planned economic requirements on the economy without any major loss of prosperity, or the idea that one can increase the money supply at will without triggering massive inflation sooner or later.</p>
<p>Or take the complete refusal to subject drastic measures to a harm-benefit analysis, for example measures against covid, against climate change, or against Russia. Take the idea that man and woman are social constructs and that there are more than two genders, or the conviction that all people are exactly the same and can perform all tasks equally well with the appropriate education, or the idea of preventing or sanctioning free speech for an alleged good cause, and so on. Errors accumulated over decades, now add up to a veritable delusion and inevitably to a downfall.</p>
<h4>Learning through Pain</h4>
<p>The message is that the small number of advocates of freedom should not waste their energy trying to change systems from within that can no longer be repaired. The drastic cure, rather, is to allow total and irrevocable failure of these systems, learning through pain. Only this will drive the eco-socialist insanity out of people’s minds to some extent. This cup must now be finished to the end.</p>
<p>This is not an easy medicine, as many people will suffer as a result, including those who saw the disaster coming and warned in time. But this is the only way to achieve a sustainable change in thinking and thus a turning away from statist collectivism and toward personal responsibility, which by all means also includes caring for others. The opposite of political collectivism is not selfish individualism, it is self-determination. And this is a concept beyond left or right.</p>
<p>The main insight is this: there is no right to live at the expense of others. Of course, we can and should feel morally obliged to help people who cannot help themselves, especially amongst family and friends. And we can take over respective contractual obligations, like in a marriage. But there is no <em>human right</em> to sue unrelated others for providing you a living.</p>
<p>This insight is crucial for a peaceful future beyond an all-powerful state, so let us work it out a bit.</p>
<p>Over time, instead of limiting human rights to liberty, the well intentioned have added more and more so-called participation rights. These include rights such as the right to work, the right to free education, the right to a humane existence with housing, clothing, medical care, “satisfactory remuneration” and so on. Sounds good, but what is completely lacking is the understanding that these rights can only be asserted at the expense of third parties and only by an all-powerful state. They are in direct conflict with the human rights to liberty.</p>
<p>If I cannot afford a “humane” apartment, then someone else has to pay for it. Who enforces this against whom and who decides what constitutes a humane existence? As things stand, this can only be the state, which thereby intervenes in the property rights and freedom of action of its citizens.</p>
<p>In other words, the fundamental liberty rights originally conceived as a right of defense against the state, are transformed now into powers of intervention which the state has against its citizens and which cannot or must not defend themselves against them. It is therefore not surprising that the existence of particpation rights has become a constant cause of struggles for distribution. Endless political struggles.</p>
<p>The recent idea of an <em>universal basic income</em> is only the logical consequence of believing that you have the right to live at the expense of others without having to pay anything in return. This doesn’t add up, of course. Ultimately, it can only be at the expense of those who generate surpluses that can then be taken away from them. This discourages them. Finally, the state will have to force them to work in order to earn the basic income for the others. In another context, this configuration is called slavery.</p>
<p>Rights at the expense of third parties are in truth privileges. They are an aberration that causes considerable discord. Properly understood, there is only one essential human right—namely, the right to be left alone, in order to be able to lead one’s self-determined life. All other human rights are either legitimate derivatives thereof or illegitimate privileges at the expense of third parties.</p>
<p>Only when these insight has been internalized can a new era dawn.</p>
<p>Otherwise, after the downfall, there will be only a lukewarm reform by “moderate” professional politicians, which will lead to the fact that a few years later, the very forces that caused the mess will be in charge again.</p>
<h4>Room for Maneuver for Freedom Seekers</h4>
<p>The good news is that freedom-oriented persons, be they libertarian, classical liberal, conservative, or whatever, do not have to wait idly for this collapse, which can also mean a long decline instead of a big bang. Instead, parallel structures can be set up immediately. The big advantage is that you don’t need a majority to do it and that you can make an immediate difference by yourself. After all, successful parallel structures have a role model effect that will come to full fruition when the existing systems fail more and more.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there is a catch. You actually have to do something about it—namely, get out of your comfort zone. It won’t be enough just to write know-it-all articles or comments in the online media or to participate in petitions and demonstrations. You have to create something new based on your own actions. That is exhausting.</p>
<p>But in return a meaningful existence beckons, creating the seed for a better and above all freer world. Even if it is not completely successful in our lifetime, the seed is sown for future generations. And really everyone can participate and everyone is needed.</p>
<p>Unlike the other side, such undertakings happen at one’s own expense and in recognition of reality, instead of delusional narratives. They are accompanied by a willingness to face the competition of ideas and systems. Only through this pressure of competition can permanently stable and antifragile structures be established.</p>
<p>Whoever relentlessly evaluates himself or herself and their situation, gains sovereignty over the present, which, as hard as it may be, nevertheless confronts one with selectable options for action. Conversely, those who do not want to make this cognitive effort, deserve only the status quo.</p>
<h4>To Work</h4>
<p>The progressive regime bases its power primarily on absolute domination of the media, the cultural sector, central banks, and educational institutions. These areas in particular are therefore candidates for the creation of parallel structures, along with alternative systems of living together.</p>
<p>What they have in common is not to focus on reforming existing systems, but to make them obsolete through better models. What is at stake is nothing less than the creation of parallel societies and parallel elites.</p>
<h4>Media</h4>
<p>The media domination has of course not gone unnoticed by critical minds and so, thanks to the Internet, countless new media have emerged, with widely varying quality. This includes alternatives to social media.</p>
<p>There are journalists who have managed to attract an audience of millions just on the strength of the quality and impartiality of their work, such as Joe Rogan in the USA or Boris Reitschuster in Germany. They are flanked by numerous bloggers who tirelessly bring new points of view and facts to light.</p>
<p>The former gatekeepers are now striking back with attempts of technical and legal censorship, but the genie will not go back into the bottle. That’s good.</p>
<h4>Culture</h4>
<p>New libertarian heroic figures in books like Charles Knight or Carl Brun have what it takes to reach broad audiences. In the case of a film adaptation, you could even create new cult series. In the film and music sector, so many artists have been canceled recently that it is becoming easier by the day to find one who actively participates in the construction of an alternative counterculture instead of submissively crawling back into the woke herd.</p>
<h4>Education</h4>
<p>In order to protect our children from brainwashing, we urgently need parallel structures in education. Keep in mind that in many countries, homeschooling is forbidden.</p>
<p>Luckily, home schooling always has promoted alternative offerings and numerous educational possibilities are emerging, including completely new, “nonwoke” universities like the University of Austin in Texas.</p>
<p>In this sector, too, many approaches are likely to fail, especially those that dispense with knowledge transfer and performance measurements. Such a selection process is something quite normal in new markets. Only through trial and error, and imitation and duplication of successful models, can a better system be created. This is how evolution works. Nothing is wrong with that.</p>
<p>As everywhere, competition stimulates business. Here is my proposal: For an alternative school education, historic human development should be taken as a yardstick—in addition to the classical curriculum—and children be taught not only the knowledge but also the appropriate skills, at least in the basics. Staggered according to age group, with increasing degree of difficulty, starting with making fire, building a wall, sewing clothes up to metallurgical and computer-based processes.</p>
<p>Young people with the appropriate education would not only be capable of survival and self-confidence on the basis of the work of their own hands, but were also able to understand from their own experience why the world is where it is today, especially in technological and economic terms.</p>
<p>The litmus test for true education must be: Suppose you were transported by time machine back to the Stone Age or the Middle Ages, could you teach people there anything meaningful?</p>
<h4>Finance</h4>
<p>In finance, parallel structures are the most advanced. The monopoly of state money and central banks has already been broken by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The importance of this cannot be overstated. Basically, this fulfills <em>Hayek’s</em> call to take the monopoly of money away from governments so that we don’t keep running into currency disasters every couple of decades.</p>
<p>Anyone who can pay directly from person to person without having to ask permission from intermediaries such as banks is naturally a danger to the regime. This is especially true in times when unwelcome critics regularly have their bank accounts terminated.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can still expect a fierce battle here, with efforts to ban bitcoin under the guise of saving energy. It is precisely the energy crisis that can be used by the very establishment responsible for it, to ban unwelcome parallel currencies like bitcoin. Sadly, probably to the applause of the masses.</p>
<p>But this genie is out of the bottle too and will not be pushed back completely. Even if bitcoin will be banned in many countries, it will not be banned everywhere and there are enough successors and variants, including gold-backed payment systems.</p>
<h4>Politics and Social Systems</h4>
<p>The most difficult issue is the creation of new systems of living together—that is, new political or social orders. Current political systems are characterized by false incentives for both the rulers and the governed. The rulers are not liable and have no economic disadvantages if they make bad decisions. The governed are led to believe that they can vote “free” benefits into their pockets. This politicizes the state’s monopoly on the use of force and leads to constant changes in the “social contract.” The result is a constant struggle to influence these changes in a particular direction.</p>
<p>Penetration of this market is particularly difficult because it usually requires secession, revolution, or at least the winning of an absolute majority in elections. Again, however, there are parallel structures that are easier to accomplish.</p>
<h4>Free Private Cities</h4>
<p>I have already proposed a peaceful and voluntary alternative: <a href="https://free-cities.org/free-private-cities-whitepaper/">free private cities</a>. A free private city is characterized by the fact that it is organized by a for-profit company, the city operator, who acts as a “government service provider.” This operator may also be partially or wholly owned by citizens.</p>
<p>In this capacity, the operator guarantees its citizens the protection of life, liberty, and property. The services provided by the operator include internal and external security, a predefined legal and regulatory framework, and an independent dispute resolution system. Participation is 100 percent voluntary.</p>
<p>Interested individuals and companies enter into a “citizen contract” with it and pay a fixed annual fee for these services in lieu of taxes. Within this framework, a “spontaneous order” can develop, resulting from the voluntary activities and decisions of citizens.</p>
<p>The operator cannot later unilaterally change the citizen contract without the consent of the citizen concerned. Disputes between citizens and the operator are heard by external arbitration tribunals, as is common in international commercial law. If the operator ignores the arbitration awards or abuses its power, its customers leave and it faces insolvency.</p>
<p>Since all land is currently controlled by governments, the establishment of a free private city requires the operator to enter into a contractual agreement with an existing state. In this agreement, the “host nation” grants the operator the right to establish the free private city on a certain territory under certain conditions, which include legal autonomy in various areas.</p>
<p>States may be willing to relinquish some of their power in exchange for promised benefits. These include, for example, job creation, foreign investment, and a share of the profits generated by the operator. The existence of a large number of special economic zones around the world demonstrates the basic willingness of countries to go down this path.</p>
<p>Free Private Cities do have a chance. That’s because people don’t want to be subjugated by rules and regulations that they have not consented to. People don’t want to pay for things they have not ordered. And reasonable people don’t need hundreds or thousands of laws to live peacefully together. People need a safe space where they can congregate and cooperate peacefully, but are otherwise left alone by coercive authorities. Free Private Cities can deliver these human desires. The existing political systems cannot. It is for this reason that Free Private Cities have a chance to succeed. Since eventually, people will go where they are treated best.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it is not an easy path, and even in countries open to it, it requires years of negotiations and legislative changes. Nevertheless, it must be taken; me and others are working on it or comparable models, and the first emerging economies, such as Honduras, have embarked on it. Further projects in Africa and Central America are in the pipeline. However, in Honduras, the empire is striking back already after a socialist election victory. The irony is that the very politicians who want to get rid of the most innovative forms of governance in the world, the Honduran zones for economic development and employment (ZEDEs), call themselves “Progressives.”</p>
<p>Be it as it is, the momentum is there, and there is now a Free City movement around the world that wants to try out alternative forms of government. Be it free private cities, prosperity zones, charter cities, bitcoin cities, and the like.</p>
<h4>Intentional Communities</h4>
<p>However, in most places, governments are not willing to grant even a limited autonomy. What to do? In my view, the best thing is what Prussian military strategist Carl von Clausewitz advised: “First create a secure base.”</p>
<p>Small and smallest units by the citizens themselves can be created within the existing system, by taking advantage of the remaining niches of freedom in contract law and cooperative law. It is also easier to rally a critical mass of like-minded people than to win nationwide elections. Cooperation between many small units on a contractual basis can also be more efficient organizationally and financially, politically conflict-free, and culturally autonomous, especially in the digital age. This approach can be institutionalized—namely, by founding an intentional community, on a contractual basis or as a cooperative on a defined piece of land.</p>
<p>There are already purely idealistic value communities and settlements that often have collectivist and egalitarian ideals (community ownership, veganism, equal pay for all, etc.). They are usually attached to a single strong leader. Their main problem is that they usually fall apart relatively soon due to the undeniable diversity of people and their interests.</p>
<p>Therefore, successful intentional communities should intervene as little as possible in the way their members shape their lives, but should rather have “live and let live” as their motto. They should merely presuppose certain common values that protect voluntariness, freedom, but also cohesion in the community.</p>
<p>In this respect, guiding ideas of a intentional community can be: freedom of contract, private property, self-determination, and market economy, as well as willingness to help, interest in the welfare of fellow human beings, as well as in certain regions, the desire to preserve and pass on one’s own language and culture.</p>
<p>Of course, in such cases all state laws are still applicable; but at least in the area of security, dispute resolution, and social harmony, a more pleasant coexistence can be established through this design. Furthermore, the intentional community can try to gradually establish its own parallel systems in the areas of energy supply, education, and social security, in order to avoid the existing systems as much as possible within the limits of legal possibilities. The creation of its own (crypto)currency or the use of an existing one is also conceivable. By allowing the intentional community to reject applicants and terminate those who break the rules, positive selection is possible.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>We should try to start parallel structures immediately in order not to stand isolated in the coming turbulent times. It’s a good thing. New communities of values can be created. People get to know each other and help each other. The path along the way gives confidence, is often even fun, and by doing instead of talking, the wheat is separated from the chaff.</p>
<p>It always goes on somehow. It’s up to us how.</p>
<p>Let’s spit on our hands and get to work.</p>
