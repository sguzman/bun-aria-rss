This week, Rhett details his mulit-state trip starting in Maine and ending in Florida, touring colleges, eating delicious food, and drinking tons of lattes. Rhett talks about how women from Maine took a liking to Locke, he solves the decades-long Philly cheesesteak battle between institutions Pat's and Gino's, and surprised his family with a cruise around the Florida everglades in a fan boat. Most importantly, Rhett meets a bunch of Mythical Beasts along the way!</p><p><em>Be sure to watch </em><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/shows/inside-eats-with-rhett-and-link"><em>Inside Eats</em></a><em> on Food Network &amp; Discovery+, premiering 9:30 PST | 10:30 CST Sunday, April 24th!</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: <a href="https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy">https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Our Most Memorable Live Music Moments &amp; Concert Etiquette  | Ear Biscuits Ep.330</title>
      <description>Should you ever stand in a concert or stay seated to not disturb the people behind you? Should you bother having conversations at a show that just result in you shouting in each other's ears? Should you tell your girlfriend you threw gum in her hair? These are just some of the concert-related debates that Rhett &amp; Link tackle in this week's episode. They discuss their most unforgettable experiences watching music live, like a woman saying inappropriate things about John Mayer, Rhett and his dad slow dancing with some drunk middle-aged women, Link's friend getting crushed in a crowd of people, bugging Merle Haggard on his tour bus after a show, and much more. They also discuss getting used to the idea of attending concerts nowadays in the first place.
Check out the Broken Record podcast here! For the month of April, Rick Rubin interviews different members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers to detail their career and new album "Unlimited Love."

      <title>Ep. 77 Rhett &amp; Link “Head Injuries that Unlocked Geniuses” - Ear Biscuits</title>
      <description>In this special Rhett &amp; Link-only episode, Rhett &amp; Link discuss some of the rare cases of “Acquired Savant Syndrome,” a diagnosis given to someone who sustains a terrible injury to their brain that miraculously unlocks a hidden genius, like the orthopedic surgeon who was struck in the head by lightning and was then able to masterfully play the piano, or the 20 year old Australian who was in a car accident that put him in a coma for one week only to wake up speaking fluent Mandarin. This fascinating conversation leads Rhett &amp; Link to ask the question, does everyone have these hidden abilities buried in their brain, and if so, will we ever be able to unlock them?

      <title>Ep. 58 Rhett &amp; Link “Sports” - Ear Biscuits</title>
      <description>In this special Rhett &amp; Link-only episode, the guys take a trip down memory lane to share their experiences with recreational sports from childhood to parenthood. Rhett discusses how being successful in sports helped shape him into the person he is today, while Link examines his sports experiences as a case study in anxiety. From basketball, to soccer, to baseball, and golf--the listener will hear about the first punch Rhett ever threw, how he had a tantrum in a basketball game that lead to a broken toe, and why Link received the most massive wedgie of all time.

      <title>Ep. 32 Smosh - Ear Biscuits</title>
      <description>Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox, the comedy duo better-known as “Smosh,” sit down with Rhett &amp; Link to discuss how they went from essentially two guys lip syncing cartoon theme songs in front of a web cam to having the second most subscribed personality-fronted channel on YouTube with over 17.5 million subscribers and 3 billion views in just under a decade. The guys talk about everything from nervous bathroom habits before live performances to the ever-growing pressure that they experience on a daily basis to entertain their fans, maintain their artistic integrity, and remain on top.  *NOTE: This conversation contains adult themes and language.
