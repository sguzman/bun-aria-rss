      <title>How does a Bon Appétit issue get made? </title>
      <description>It’s the last episode of Season 1! And to wrap things up, we’re tackling a question that, frankly, we ask ourselves a lot: How do we take a bunch of ideas, inspirations, recipes, and themes and turn them into a print issue almost every single month? Is it magic? Sort of! This week, we’re pulling back the curtain on the development process for our June/July combined issue (yes, we plan that far ahead). From choosing a theme to pitching ideas to actually developing a recipe, this is how it all happens. With test kitchen director Chris Morocco and special guest Asha Loupy, whose new popcorn chicken recipe is exactly what your Sunday needs, whether there’s a game on or not. 

Stuff we talk about in this episode: 

Check out BA’s June/July issue (discussed in this episode), coming to newsstands in 4 months!

      <title>What are the foods that made us fall in love?</title>
      <description>Between the candlelit dinners, the big chocolate hearts, and the bottles of bubbly, Valentine’s Day is definitely a food holiday if you want it to be. Eating is romantic! And you don’t have to take our word for it. This year, we’re swallowing our cynicism and sharing stories of meet-cutes, first dates, and romantic meals from a few of our favorite couples in the world of food. Listen to find out how a paella helped seal the deal, how a plate of chilaquiles opened hearts, and what happens when you meet your soulmate in the BA test kitchen.

      <title>Why are people obsessed with Trader Joe's?</title>
      <description>Trader Joe’s shoppers can be… intense. Like, wait-around-the-corner-for-“Everything But The Bagel”-seasoning intense. From fan pages on Facebook to a thriving scene of Instagram influencers to the Supreme-level of hype around their new product drops, the grocery chain is basically a lifestyle brand at this point. Outside of Joe himself, no one knows that better than contributor Alex Beggs. Beggs has been writing Trader Joe’s snack reviews for four years, and she’s picked up some pretty strong opinions along the way. On this episode of the pod, she joins Amanda to talk about the best, the worst, and the weirdest Trader Joe’s products of all time. Tune in for hot takes on elote chips, the juices that go best with booze, and some fierce debate about that infamous cauliflower gnocchi.

      <title>What are our secret weapon ingredients?</title>
      <description>The January slump is hitting, and cooking is starting to feel pretty dull. But rather than giving up entirely, we’re leaning on the power of our pantries. Instead of re-inventing the wheel (of cheese?), we can rely on a few tried and true staples that we always have around, and use them in new and inventive ways. This week on the podcast, Amanda chats with associate food editor Kendra Vaculin and recipe developer extraordinaire Hetty McKinnon, who spill the tea about a few of their favorite year-round flavor boosters. Then, Ken Concepcion and Michelle Mungcal from Now Serving LA—a beloved cookbook shop that you should absolutely visit in LA’s Chinatown—stop by to share a few secret weapon cookbooks you’ll actually end up using.

      <title>What does “healthy eating” even mean?</title>
      <description>It’s New Year's resolution season, which has a lot of us thinking about eating healthier.

This week on the podcast, Christina joins Amanda to talk through what she’s been cooking so far in 2022, then associate editor Ali Francis stops by to talk medicinal mushrooms, comfort foods, and more wellness trends we’re expecting to see a lot of in the year to come.

      <title>What was the best thing we cooked this year?</title>
      <description>It’s that old, familiar season, and we’re not just talking about eggnog, we’re talking about the season of “Best Of” lists. Here at BA, we’ve got plenty of best recipe round-ups in the pipeline, but those lists only tell half the story. In our eyes, the best recipes aren’t always the ones that “break the internet” (though sometimes they are—we’re looking at you Caramel Apple Cookies). They’re the ones that surprised us, taught us something new, or became our back-pocket go-tos week after week and month after month. This week, Amanda is joined by senior cooking editor Sarah Jampel and Test Kitchen director Chris Morocco to talk about which of this year’s recipes have stuck with them most. The result is a Best Of list that’s a bit less objective, a lot more opinionated, but still extremely delicious. Then, associate food editor Kendra Vaculin is back to talk about her favorite holiday recipes for kids.

      <title>What are Drew Barrymore and Pilar Valdes hungry for? </title>
      <description>Drew Barrymore didn’t always love to cook. When she first lived alone, at 14 years old, she stuck to instant ramen, boxed mac and cheese, and egg-in-the-hole toasts. But as an adult, sharing food with her friends and loved ones has become one of her favorite things, and her close friend and personal chef Pilar Valdes is a big reason why. The pair met in the midst of major life transitions, and they found solace and inspiration together in the kitchen. This week, they’re on the pod with host Amanda Shapiro talking about friendship, food preferences, and their new cookbook, Rebel Homemaker: Food, Family and Life.

      <title>What’s Stanley Tucci Doing for Thanksgiving?</title>
      <description>Who but Stanley Tucci could charm us on social media with his Negroni-making skills, eat his way through Italy for a documentary series, and publish a food-heavy memoir all during a global pandemic? He’s had so much going on that we almost forgot that he’s also a Hollywood star. The man/myth/legend gave us his best tips for entertaining in our November issue, and this week on the podcast, he sits down with editor in chief Dawn Davis to chat about his favorite Thanksgiving dishes, the gifts he insists on giving, and the pasta faux-pas that you NEED to avoid. Of course, when it comes to putting on a proper feast, we can’t all be Stanley Tucci—but that doesn’t mean we can’t try. And for the hosts who need the most help, associate food editor Rachel Gurjar is back with a procrastinator’s guide to cooking a Thanksgiving meal.

      <title>Can Thanksgiving ever just be simple? </title>
      <description>Maybe you’re like us: Year after year, we tell ourselves that THIS Thanksgiving is going to be the simple one. Then, year after year, we find ourselves back in the kitchen, feeling way too stressed out while juggling 15 recipes for sides, salads, desserts, and of course, a massive turkey that refuses to finish cooking. Why do we do this to ourselves? And is there another way? Associate food editor Kendra Vaculin thinks there is, and she’s here this week, along with test kitchen director Chris Morocco, to talk through her super-simplified menu for this year’s feast, which you can find in the November issue of the magazine. Tune in for tips on maximizing oven space and hot takes on why no one needs a roasting pan. Plus, Chris makes the case for yet another “compelling and dynamic” salad.

      <title>Why are pop-ups popping off?</title>
      <description>It used to be that opening your own restaurant was the only path to gaining recognition as a chef. But these days, more and more chefs are opening pop-ups as a first step, or even an alternative, to a brick-and-mortar spot. Pop-ups can offer flexibility, freedom, and exposure without the high overhead and financial risk. But that doesn’t mean pop-up life is a walk in the park. This week on the show, Amanda talks to two LA chefs who run their own pop-ups—Rashida Holmes of Bridgetown Roti and Brandon Gray of Brandoni Pepperoni—about the pros and cons of the business model, their mixed feelings about press attention, and what chefs need to know before popping up.

      <title>Is the martini the best cocktail of all time? </title>
      <description>Name a more iconic cocktail. We’ll wait. Yep, that’s what we thought. Today on the podcast, Amanda is joined by contributor Amiel Stanek, senior staff writer Alex Beggs, and senior food editor Christina Chaey to talk all about martinis: Why we love them, what makes them perfect vs. “perfect,” and how to order them properly (or make them at home). Along the way, Andrea Hernández aka the Snack Oracle comes by to try to explain why the espresso martini is making a comeback—and whether it’s here to stay. Stick around for trivia, jokes, and plenty of cocktail-shaker ASMR.

      <title>What Happens When You Use TikTok to Cook?</title>
      <description>Even if you’re not on FoodTok, you probably know it exists . Every day, our algorithms fill our feeds with cooking hacks, recipe walkthroughs, and ambient ASMR moments. We can’t look away, but we also can’t help but wonder: Does any of it actually work? To find out, senior food editor Christina Chaey and BA’s head of video June Kim spent a day cooking meals from TikTok—yes, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This week on the podcast, they’re reporting on how it went and giving their definitive (read: totally subjective) rankings of some of the platform’s most iconic foods.

      <title>Will dinner parties ever be the same?</title>
      <description>As Food People, we know our way around a dinner party—or at least, we did, before we couldn’t attend or throw any for almost two years. During that hosting hiatus we had plenty of time to think about what made dinner parties great but also what made them stressful, exhausting, and way too much work. This week on the show, Amanda talks to Test Kitchen director Chris Morocco and Associate Food Editor Zaynab Issa about the new rules they’re following when it comes to entertaining in a post-lockdown world. They debate outsourcing the main course, skipping dessert, and what makes a “compelling and dynamic” salad. Along the way, we also turn to Katherine Lewin—owner of Big Night, a brilliantly stocked, expertly curated dinner party shop in Brooklyn—for a crash course on cheese and charcuterie.

      <title>Are air fryers just a bunch of hot air? </title>
      <description>It’s practically impossible to ignore the air fryer. Much like the InstantPot a few years back, these countertop appliances promise us a faster and healthier way to cook: crunchy chicken, golden french fries, crispy vegetables with none of the downsides of deep frying. But how much can an air fryer really change the way you cook and eat? And, like, can you actually fry something with air? This week, Amanda is joined by BA senior staff writer and air fryer enthusiast Alex Beggs to talk about this latest must-have kitchen gadget, whether they can deliver on their promises, and how to decide if it’s worth the price...and the counter space. Along the way, associate food editor Rachel Gurjar stops in to talk about her sesame coconut chicken tenders and brussels sprouts with honey butter recipes (both made for the air fryer, of course).

      <title>What does it mean to be a Hawaiian chef?</title>
      <description>Thanks to both outside influences and native resources, Hawaiian cuisine is incredibly diverse for such a small geographic space. But when you’re Hawai'i’s most well-known chef, everyone expects you to define it. Since beginning his career at a plate lunch restaurant, Sheldon Simeon has been an acclaimed restaurateur, a Top Chef contestant, and (most recently) a cookbook writer. He lives, breathes, and cooks Hawai’i, and this week on the show he’s here to talk about what it means to be a Hawaiian chef. He and Amanda talk about growing up on the islands, his run on Top Chef, and the crossroads he found himself at when it was over. And to spark your travel appetite, he recommends his top food spots on Maui, where he lives now. Restaurants editor Elyse Inamine—who profiled Simeon for our website—pops in along the way to rep for an often-misunderstood Hawaiian ingredient: Spam.

      <itunes:summary>Thanks to both outside influences and native resources, Hawaiian cuisine is incredibly diverse for such a small geographic space. But when you’re Hawai'i’s most well-known chef, everyone expects you to define it. Since beginning his career at a plate lunch restaurant, Sheldon Simeon has been an acclaimed restaurateur, a Top Chef contestant, and (most recently) a cookbook writer. He lives, breathes, and cooks Hawai’i, and this week on the show he’s here to talk about what it means to be a Hawaiian chef. He and Amanda talk about growing up on the islands, his run on Top Chef, and the crossroads he found himself at when it was over. And to spark your travel appetite, he recommends his top food spots on Maui, where he lives now. Restaurants editor Elyse Inamine—who profiled Simeon for our website—pops in along the way to rep for an often-misunderstood Hawaiian ingredient: Spam.

      <title>Who would open a restaurant during a global pandemic?</title>
      <description>Opening a restaurant is notoriously hard: Long hours, thin margins, and a high chance of failure. The people who choose that path are either heroic, foolish, or a little bit of both. But to open a restaurant during a global pandemic? Well, that’s a whole new level of are-you-kidding-me.  
This week on the podcast, Amanda asks Eric See (chef and owner of Ursula in Brooklyn, New York) and Subrina Collier (co-owner of Leah and Louise in Charlotte, North Carolina) what in the world they were thinking, how it’s been going, and whether or not they’d do it again. And Chef Michael Carter from another new restaurant, Down North Pizza in Philly, pops in to defend pineapple on pizza and share more toppings combos he loves.

      <title>How do recipes hold us back?  An interview with Dr. Jessica B. Harris</title>
      <description>Despite her work as a cookbook author, Dr. Jessica B. Harris isn’t a fan of following recipes. Nonetheless, her books have made her an authority on the history of Black foodways, as well as their immense and under-appreciated impact on American cuisine and culture. Earlier this year, her 2011 book High on the Hog was the inspiration of a Netflix docu-series of the same name, in which she’s prominently featured. This week on Food People, Bon Appétit editor-in-chief Dawn Davis sat down with the acclaimed writer and historian to discuss her earliest memories in the kitchen with her dietician mother, cooking for friends like James Baldwin and George Garin, and the best advice they have for people curious about cooking—spoiler alert: The advice is “start cooking."

Stuff we talk about in this episode:
- A list of Dr. Harris’ literary works including Iron Pots and Wooden Spoons, Sky Juice and Flying Fish, and My Soul Looks Back
- Dr. Jessica Harris’ Red Rice recipe
- Dr. Harris’ New Orleans Restaurant recommendations: 
- Upperline Restaurant Website
- Bayona Restaurant Website 
- Justine Restaurant Website 
- Bywater American Bistro Website 
- N7 Restaurant Website 
- Dr. Jessica B. Harris’ Guide to Black Culinary History

Later on, senior commerce editor MacKenzie Chung Fegan stops by to share a few of her favorite items for eating on the go.

      <title>What makes us Food People (not Foodies, never Foodies)?</title>
      <description>Tell us you're a food person without TELLING us you're a food person. We'll go first. On this week's show, BA staffers divulge the single moments, winding paths, and everyday habits that make us food people. Associate food editor Rachel Gurjar walks us through how she went from living with her parents in Mumbai to landing her dream job at BA. Contributor DeVonn Francis tells us why, for him, being a food person means caring about far more than what's on the plate. Tune in to hear their stories, and to find out who on the BA staff drinks milkshakes for breakfast, and who lies in bed counting cheeseburgers instead of sheep.

      <title>What's the Best Way to Grill a Chicken?</title>
      <description>What is the absolute, hands down, BEST way to grill chicken? Food editors Andy Baraghani and Jessie YuChen spent a lot of time thinking about this for a recipe story all about grilled chicken in BA's August issue. Today they join Amanda to talk about their favorite parts of the chicken, how to grill them, and what marinades, sauces, and sides to pair them with. Find out who's on Team Skin vs. Team Skinless when it comes to poultry and why the word "spatchcock" desperately needs a rebrand. Plus senior staff writer Alex Beggs joins to play a special edition of "Cook, Marry, Grill."

      <title>Introducing Food People</title>
      <description>Welcome to Food People, a show from Bon Appétit made by, for, and about people who love food. Each week, BA’s editorial director Amanda Shapiro asks a serious or not-so-serious food question: What’s the best way to grill chicken? Can meal prep be less terrible? Are air fryers worth the hype? In search of answers or at least a spirited debate, she’ll bring in staffers, chefs, writers, and experts from across the culinary universe. Expect strong opinions, tons of recipe inspiration, and more food puns than we'd like to admit.

Each week, BA’s editorial director Amanda Shapiro asks a serious or not-so-serious food question: What’s the best way to grill chicken? Can meal prep be less terrible? Are air fryers worth the hype? In search of answers or at least a spirited debate, she’ll bring in staffers, chefs, writers, and experts from across the culinary universe. Expect strong opinions, tons of recipe inspiration, and more food puns than we'd like to admit.</p><p>Listen and subscribe at <a href="http://listen.bonappetit.com/foodpeople-trailer">http://listen.bonappetit.com/foodpeople-trailer</a> or wherever you get your podcasts: <a href="http://listen.bonappetit.com/foodpeople">http://listen.bonappetit.com/foodpeople</a></p><ul>

      <title>The Snack Queens with Alex Beggs and Andrea Hernandez</title>
      <description>If you’re anything like us, it’s been a year of heavy snacking, and we’re NOT mad about it. Snacks are one of life’s greatest joys, and despite what your health teacher may have told you, eating between meals can be a perfectly healthy habit. But as the “functional snack” industry booms, how do we know what’s deliciously healthyish and what’s B.S.? On this episode of the Healthyish podcast, Amanda Shapiro brings in Andrea Henandez, the mind behind the cult-favorite Snaxshot newsletter, and BA senior staff writer and in-house snack expert Alex Beggs to talk about how snacking is taking over our diets and what they’ve been loving and tossing from the snack aisle these days. There may even be some on-mic taste-testing. 

Stuff we talk about in this episode:
Alex’s story on the science and marketing of crispiness
Alex’s latest Trader Joe’s Reviews
Andrea’s Snaxshot Newsletter
Andrea on Twitter
Alex on Instagram

      <title>The Case for Quitting Meat with Sarah Jampel and Chrissy Tracey</title>
      <description>By this point we can pretty much agree that meat consumption is hard on the planet. But does that mean we should all be vegetarian...or vegan? Not everyone thinks it’s that easy, not even BA’s senior cooking editor Sarah Jampel and video host Chrissy Tracey, both lifelong vegetarians. On this episode of the Healthyish podcast, Sarah and Chrissy join Amanda Shapiro (not a lifelong vegetarian) to talk about their plant-based paths, when and why they break the rules, and how to cook to please even your most carnivorous friends... just in time for your July 4th parties.

      <title>The Forager’s Dilemma with Alexis Nikole Nelson</title>
      <description>When Alexis Nikole Nelson started her TikTok account last year, she had no idea that the videos she made of herself foraging in the parks and woods of Columbus, OH—and singing along the way—would go so viral so quickly. Today Alexis joins Amanda in the Zoom studio to talk about her lifelong love affair with wild edible plants, the racial history of trespassing laws, and what you can cook with the weeds in your very own backyard.

      <title>The Myth of Healthy Eating with Christina Chaey and Vanessa Rissetto</title>
      <description>What does it mean to be healthy in 2021? We spent the majority of this year and last cooking and eating at home, and while we’re so sick of staring into our fridges, we did learn a thing or two along the way. For our inaugural episode, Amanda Shapiro is joined by BA senior food editor Christina Chaey, who recently wrote about redefining “healthy” for herself, and dietitian and food equity advocate Vanessa Rissetto, to talk about what those lessons were and how we’re cooking (or not cooking) now.

Christina Chaey on “redefining health”: https://www.bonappetit.com/story/redefining-healthy-eating


Julia Turshen on coming to peace with her body: https://www.bonappetit.com/story/simply-julia-diet-culture


Christina Chaey on “cooking less”: https://www.bonappetit.com/story/cook-less

      <description>Everyone is into sourdough right now—or looking desperately for store-bought yeast. But today, Sarah Jampel and Jesse Sparks are talking about the wonderful world of bread beyond yeast and how to achieve that chewy, bready texture without coveted yeast. After that, Tyler Kord reads his essay about cooking meals for frontline workers at his now-closed restaurant while also taking care of his daughter. You can support his work here, and buy the Vans he mentions in the story here.

      <title>Episode 270: The Healthyish Guide to Being Alone</title>
      <description>This week, Healthyish is taking over the podcast with their Guide to Being Alone. First up, Healthyish editor Amanda Shapiro interviews associate editor Christina Chaey about the smart strategies she's developed in shopping and cooking for herself. After that, Amanda calls contributor Hawa Hassan, who has been quarantining alone while still serving her community. She's been organizing local volunteers to make and deliver meals to Brooklyn hospital workers. Finally, author Scaachi Koul reads an essay she wrote about how much she misses eating alone at restaurants—and how that made her feel physically full and emotionally replenished.

      <title>Episode 269: Rice 5.0</title>
      <description>Yep, it's true. The Rice Wizards™ are back! For their fifth rice-centric installment, Carla and Amiel focus on what to do with leftovers. After that, we talk to chef and activist Reem Assil of Reem’s in the Bay Area. While she’s currently using her restaurants as commissary kitchens to feed the most vulnerable in her community, she’s also thinking about the future. What we need to strive for, she believes, is not the return of the restaurant industry as it once was, plagued with inequity. Instead, we have the opportunity to rewire the way it works from the ground up.

      <title>Episode 268: Recipe Developing From Home</title>
      <description>Since the social distancing and stay-at-home mandates began, our food editors have been creating, testing, and shooting recipes in their home kitchens instead of in the BA Test Kitchen. Adam checks in with Chris Morocco and Sohla El-Waylly to talk about what it's been like to source ingredients, trust your own taste tests, and...do your own dishes. After that, Alex Delany tells us about the three cocktails he's making right now.
    
*One note: Alex Delany mis-identified where Tattersall Bitter Orange Liquor is from. It's Minneapolis (not Chicago).

      <title>Episode 267: How Alison Roman Is Celebrating Passover This Year</title>
      <description>Whether you're eating with roommates, partners, or family in your home or planning a remote dinner where everyone dials in, Seder is still happening. And as always, Alison and Adam have some thoughts on the Seder menu. They weigh in on everything, from day-of matzo ball soup to matzo brei the next day. After that, we're airing a conversation recorded several weeks ago—though it turns out to be particularly apt right now. Basically editor Sarah Jampel chats with Peter Miller about dishwashing, a topic he wrote...an entire book about.

      <title>Episode 266: Tom Colicchio Takes Capitol Hill</title>
      <description>Like so many other business owners, chef Tom Colicchio had to lay off the vast majority of his employees in the wake of COVID-19. He immediately turned his attention to the government—he's no stranger to its complicated mechanics after years of advocacy work—and began working tirelessly to get the restaurant industry recognized in the $2 trillion stimulus package approved by Congress and just signed by the president. Today, we talk to him about what that means exactly for restaurants and what he thinks needs to happen going forward.

      <title>Episode 263: The Great Pamela Adlon</title>
      <description>For us at BA, we're all working from home for the foreseeable future, due the current COVID-19 situation. So this week, Adam and Carla check in with each other remotely and chat about how they're stocking their kitchens and what they're cooking. (We'll be doing this with a different editor each week as the news evolves.) After that, Carla is in the studio for a segment we recorded a few weeks back with Pamela Adlon, the creator, director, and star of "Better Things." Now would be a very good time to watch her TV show.

      <description>Lisa Cheng Smith runs Yun Hai, an online shop that sells Taiwanese pantry goods like fermented black beans and soy paste, sourced directly from Taiwan.

Contributing writer Priya Krishna talks to Lisa about when the tradition started for her, how to make her astoundingly simple scallion-oil noodles, and the pressure of being an ambassador of Taiwanese food as a Taiwanese-American living in the States. After that, we're going through some of our favorite tofu recipes.

      <description>This year, our big Thanksgiving feature in the November issue is based on our video series called Making Perfect. In both the magazine and videos,  we challenged the food editors to make their best version of turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, stuffing, sides, and pie. Today, we chat with the editors about the dishes they were assigned—what went right, what went wrong, and how it all came together for the perfect meal.

      <title>Episode 245: It's Alive, Deep Dive</title>
      <description>This week, we’re going behind the scenes of It’s Alive, our video series that chronicles Brad Leone's fermentation experiments (and adventures) and is edited by Matt Hunziker. It was a big leap from videos we used to make—less hands in pans, more humor—so Brad and Hunzi sit with Adam to talk about the series' evolution. After that, we're reading letters and comments we receive. A lot of them are nice, a few are mean, and some are constructive—the kind that we like to engage with. Finally, we're airing the first of a new recurring segment called Cook, Marry, Kill with senior staff writer Alex Beggs.

After cooking together for decades at local institutions, Nasr and Hanson finally decided to open up a place of their own. Little did they knew how long Frenchette would take—and how much of a hit it would be.

      <title>Episode 224: Marinate After Grilling</title>
      <description>Conventional wisdom holds that marinating and grilling are always to be done in that order: the former before the latter. But why, really, when the moisture and sugar in most marinades can actually cause a protein to simultaneously steam and burn without ever truly searing? Adam Rapoport and Carla Lalli Music discuss recipes that flip the script. After that, Amiel Stanek goes over the basics of charcoal grilling.
Get the recipes from this episode:
Grilled Swordfish with Tomatoes and Oregano
Grilled Summer Squash and Red Onion with Feta
Grilled Chicken with Lemon and Thyme
Soy Sauce-Marinated Grilled Flank Steak and Scallions
Jalapeño-Marinated Grilled Pork Chops
Grilled Red Snapper with Green Beans and Lime

      <description>Eater's national restaurant editor, Bill Addison, and our own deputy editor, Julia Kramer, discuss what it's like to be a restaurant critic in 2018.

There's a lot to be celebrated out there in a country that cares more about food than ever before, so how do they do it?

      <title>Episode 156: The Shib Sibs REALLY Love Food</title>
      <description>Olympic bronze medalists Maia and Alex Shibutani, a.k.a. the “Shib Sibs,” stick to a pretty regimented diet while training—but it turns out they’re actually as food-obsessed as we are. This week we talk to the ice dancing duo about beignets, egg McMuffins, and their dad’s famous eggplant Parm. After that, with wedding season around the corner, we go deep on the dos and don’ts of registries. (Unsurprisingly, we've got lots of opinions on platters, wine glasses, sheets, and more.)

      <title>Episode 142: Brisket &amp; Latkes</title>
      <description>First, we go through a couple of methods for getting that big piece of brisket just right—one from Adam Rapoport's mom, and one from Mamaleh's deli in Cambridge, Mass. Then, Missy Robbins, chef at Lilia in Brooklyn, talks latkes. We've got a couple of methods here, too. Again, one from Adam's mom (are you sensing a theme?), and the other, a slightly less traditional, Italian-leaning recipe from Missy.

      <title>Episode 136: Smitten with Deb Perelman</title>
      <description>Food director Carla Lalli Music sits down with Deb Perelman of Smitten Kitchen. Deb was one of the first very successful food bloggers back in 2003.

      <title>Episode 132: Stick to Food</title>
      <description>These days it's hard not to be political–even when what you do for a living is write about food. We talk to Julia Turshen, cook and cookbook author, about why it's important to weigh in and speak out. It's something we talk about here at BA a lot, and it's something she did in her latest release called Feed the Resistance, a compilation of recipes and ideas from folks around the country whose stories and traditions so often go unheard. After that, test kitchen manager Brad Leone lets us on in on a little secret: you can actually braise on a weeknight.
Oh, and one more thing! If you love us, do us a favor and fill out this survey about our podcast: survey.megaphone.fm.

      <title>Episode 103: Chinese Food in America</title>
      <description>Wilson Tang of Nom Wah Tea Parlor in NYC's Chinatown talks about taking over the nearly 100-year-old restaurant from his uncle.
