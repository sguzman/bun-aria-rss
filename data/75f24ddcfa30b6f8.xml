      <title>Katie Nolan?</title>
      <description>Oh, I don't know. I was upset and I had to do a podcast, so I recorded myself working through it. It's not the greatest listen of all time, but it's incredibly transparent, and I only edited out one part (I was sobbing), and if I opened up like this on someone else's podcast it would've been called a "great interview" so can't we just pretend this is an interview? and that it's good actually? let's try.</description>

        <![CDATA[<p>The plan was to wait until we were "ready" to record this episode. Fate intervened, and in hindsight it's hilarious that I thought one day we'd both wake up like, "ok I'm ready!" Our best friend Ashley Braband updates us on where she's at and how she's doing. It's very relatable and, as always, I hope it helps. </p>]]>

      <description>Katie’s back with Travis &amp; Christina to give advice to their younger selves. This ragtag group of people who still make this podcast catch up on how they handled the holiday season (9:50), and Trav shares a new pet peeve (21:50). Hear every NFL score from a disembodied voice, and get answers to all the big questions: Should the Dolphins draft a QB (32:22)? Do the Bengals know how to tweet (35:42)? What do the Falcons think “reportedly” means (48:42)? Why is Katie so fired up about what the Eagles insist they didn’t do (1:05:50)? PLUS, a quick bachelorette update (1:21:00), a brief dissertation on reality reunion shows (1:25:50), and no less than 5 minutes devoted to food delivery apps (1:35:30). Top it all off with a little “what language do dogs think in (1:48:10)?” and folks? That’s a podcast.

      <description>No Ashley. No Travis. Just Katie! A solo pod (kind of?) where Katie helps a listener find things that are worse than a winless season (0:41). There’s also a KFC Lifetime movie teaser (10:06), a mental health update (16:33), and a PUPdate (20:40). Plus, the Steelers are no longer undefeated (27:31), Tuesday Night Football and Dez Bryant quit? (32:20) Jalen Hurts starts for the Eagles now (48:56), Adam Gase says he’s “rattled by last minute loss” (50:21), and Michigan vs. OSU is cancelled but Travis isn’t here to yell about it (58:56). Lastly, Katie is reluctantly joined by the most special guest to give you a comprehensive primer on MTV’s The Challenge ahead of its new season (1:04:27)</description>

      <title>Iceland: The Mighty Ducks of the World Cup</title>
      <description>Dopp is out this week, so Katie and Ashley throw out a bunch of bits they've always wanted to try. "Somethings Gotta Go" (9:49) forces Katie to get rid of one great sports accomplishment. "Gotta Hear Both Sides" (13:49) has her argue both for and against Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson's early engagement. In "Bake Your Take (Working Title)" (23:25), she tries to argue that breakfast restaurants have a unique advantage they keep failing to capitalize on. And in "Metaphorically Speaking" (33:20), they provide metaphors for each team in the World Cup to help you better understand what's happening and who you should put your money on (allegedly?). Oh, and a "Bachelorette Update" (1:10:20).</description>
