      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we are featuring one of the most thrilling new groups in contemporary soul music—Gabriels. And lucky for us, they performed three songs, one of which is still unreleased, live for <em data-stringify-type="italic">Broken Record</em>.</p>
<p>Gabriels consists of three very distinct pillars of talent: lead singer Jacob Lusk, who was raised in Compton singing gospel. Keyboardist and producer Ryan Hope, who grew up a lover of dance music in his native UK. And Los Angeles native, Ari Balouzian, who serves as Gabriels' in-house composer and violinist.</p>
<p>Gabriels’ origin story is as unconventional as their diverse musical backgrounds. In 2016 Ryan Hope and Ari Balouzian were hired to direct and score a commercial with a gospel choir. After hearing the choir director Jacob Lusk sing, a light went off for Ari and Ryan. Over the course of the next couple of years, the trio started to record and release songs independently. In 2021, those songs caught fire online. Sir Elton John said their debut EP was one of the most seminal records he’d heard in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>On today’s episode Rick Rubin sits down with Gabriels to hear how they were able to create a working environment that allowed space for vulnerability and musical exploration. And lead singer Jacob Lusk tells a harrowing story about getting lost in the LA county jail system in an effort to clear his name so he could appear in the finale of <em data-stringify-type="italic">American Idol</em>.</p>
<p>You can hear a playlist of some of our favorite songs by Gabriels <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4GuKznMHxHoT9RIkxnPG9E?si=1d662d52424b4a52">HERE</a>.</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we will hear from singer-songwriter and playwright Anaïs Mitchell who spent the past 16 years building the world of <em data-stringify-type="italic">Hadestown</em>, a career-defining stage musical that has grown from a low-budget community production in Mitchell's native Vermont, to a Broadway phenomenon and the winner of eight Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Original Score. But in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered theaters, Anaïs, like so many others, moved back home to Vermont. The move and change of pace inspired her to start writing indie folk songs.</p>
<p>Her self-titled album, released at the beginning of 2022, is made up of those songs. It’s produced by Josh Kaufman, and was made with collaborators like Bon Iver, The National, and her own band Bonny Light Horseman. On today’s episode, Bruce Headlam speaks with Anaïs Mitchell about her new album and how <em data-stringify-type="italic">Hadestown</em> came to be. She also plays some songs off her album live, just for us.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re sharing one of the most intimate conversations Rick Rubin has ever had on <em data-stringify-type="italic">Broken Record. </em>It’s<em data-stringify-type="italic"> </em>with the famed guitarist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, John Frusciante.</p>
<p>Rick Rubin last spoke to John back in April when the Chili Peppers were getting ready to release their album, <em data-stringify-type="italic">Unlimited Love</em>, their first record with Frusciante in 16 years. <em data-stringify-type="italic">Unlimited Love </em>debuted at number one in the U.S. and 15 other countries. Today, just a little more than six months later, the Chili Peppers released a second Rick Rubin-produced album, <em data-stringify-type="italic">Return Of The Dream Canteen</em>.</p>
<p>On today’s episode we’ll hear John Frusciante talk about the band’s early music, including the making of <em data-stringify-type="italic">Blood Sugar Sex Magik.</em> They talk about how his contributions on slower, more melodic songs like “Under The Bridge” and “Breaking The Girl” helped expand the Chili Peppers funk punk sound. John also talks candidly about the dark, drug-addicted years that followed the intense success of <em data-stringify-type="italic">Blood Sugar</em>. And he explains how he was able to finally get sober and rejoin the Chili Peppers to record their classic, commercial comeback album, <em data-stringify-type="italic">Californication</em>.</p>

      <title>Bartees Strange</title>
      <itunes:title>Bartees Strange</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Bartees Strange is an amalgamation of musical styles. Listen to any given song on his newest release, <em data-stringify-type="italic">Farm To Table</em>, and you can hear hints of early aughts emo, auto-tuned hip-hop vocals, and country blues—all housed in an indie rock veneer. Bartees wide-reaching sound makes perfect sense given his Midwest upbringing and early influences. He was raised in Mustang, Oklahoma as one of the few Black kids in an area rife with racial violence. As a  teenager he discovered Christian hardcore punk and for the first time he felt at home in a scene that embraced outsiders of all kinds.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bartees Strange is an amalgamation of musical styles. Listen to any given song on his newest release, <em data-stringify-type="italic">Farm To Table</em>, and you can hear hints of early aughts emo, auto-tuned hip-hop vocals, and country blues—all housed in an indie rock veneer. Bartees wide-reaching sound makes perfect sense given his Midwest upbringing and early influences. He was raised in Mustang, Oklahoma as one of the few Black kids in an area rife with racial violence. As a  teenager he discovered Christian hardcore punk and for the first time he felt at home in a scene that embraced outsiders of all kinds.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sylvan Esso’s Nick Sanborn and Amelia Meath have been making music together since 2013, when Amelia asked Nick, a music producer and bassist, to remix her band Mountain Man’s hit single “Play It Right.” He did, and the rest is history. Sylvan Esso has always had a very sleek, electro-pop feel to their production. Amelia’s powerful voice is front and center, surrounded by harmonies and samples of her own voice. Nick’s genre-destroying bass creates intricate, pulsing grooves for Amelia’s voice to inhabit.</p>
<p>Now, the married couple and electronic duo have released their fourth studio album, <em data-stringify-type="italic">No Rules Sandy</em>. It’s a follow-up to the band’s Grammy-nominated 2020 album, <em data-stringify-type="italic">Free Love.</em> The new album is a mix of improvisation and experimentation. On today’s episode, Bruce Headlam speaks with Amelia and Nick about their creative process and how <em data-stringify-type="italic">No Rules Sandy</em> came to be. They also play two songs off their new album live.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We have friend of the show Jack White back on the show today along with a legendary special guest. This conversation with Rick Rubin is full of fascinating ideas, asides and musical history that let you know just how deep Jack White is. Jack's work and a business ethic is unparalleled. His label Third Man Records has a rich roster of artists and three retail stores. They also own one of the few fully operational vinyl pressing plants in the U.S. which has been working overtime to keep up with the surging demand for vinyl. Jack also released two full length albums this year, and he’s currently on a worldwide tour.</p>
<p>After a recent two-night stand in Los Angeles, Jack stopped by Shangri-La to talk to Rick Rubin about the early Garage Rock scene in Detroit that helped shape him and The White Stripes. He also shared potential theories about why the “Seven Nation Army” riff is so catchy. And then he treats Rick and a surprise guest to an acoustic performance of his new song “A Tip From You To Me.”</p>
<p>And to cap it all off, we will hear exclusive details about an exciting new project Rick’s been working on, that will be out soon.</p>

      <itunes:title>Bon Iver: Broken Record Classic</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we are re-visiting one of our favorite episodes from 2019 featuring Rick Rubin in conversation with Justin Vernon and his engineer Chris Messina. In 2006 Justin Vernon started Bon Iver as a solo project after the end of a romantic relationship and the break up of his college band.</p>
<p>Justin recorded Bon Iver's first album, <em data-stringify-type="italic">For Emma, Forever Ago</em>, alone over three months in his dad’s hunting cabin deep in the woods of Western Wisconsin. His setup consisted of a small recording rig and a couple guitars. In the years since, Justin Vernon’s music has evolved dramatically. For one, Bon Iver is no longer a solo project—it’s still centered around Justin, but it now includes a bunch of musicians and collaborators including his engineer, Chris Messina.</p>
<p>On today's episode, Justin talks about how allowing himself to be bored without any guilt, led to him creating his now classic debut. He also talks about how the harshness of the Wisconsin winters along with the absence of any big city thrills first influenced his sound. And, Justin explains his unwavering love for his favorite song of all time “Fugitive,” by The Indigo Girls.</p>

      <itunes:title>Nile Rodgers: Broken Record Classic</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we are revisiting one of our favorite early episodes of Broken Record with the legendary producer, Nile Rodgers. Over the course of his five decade-long career, Nile Rodgers has performed on, written, and produced some of the greatest dance songs of all time, including Diana Ross’s “I’m Coming Out,” Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky,” and Madonna’s “Like A Virgin.”</p>
<p>Back in Fall of 2018, Nile met up with Bruce Headlam at the same New York City recording studio where 35 years earlier, Nile recorded the Let’s Dance album with David Bowie. This time around, Nile brought his famed disco funk band Chic to the interview to perform live renditions of their classic hits including, “Le Freak,” “Good Times,” and “Everybody Dance.” So all the music you will hear in today’s episode was recorded live, just for us.</p>
<p>In between performances, Nile shares exhilarating stories from his life, including how he found salvation as a young jazz guitarist whose teenage mom struggled with heroin addiction. Nile also talks about the night he played old James Brown tunes with Prince and Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood at a small club in London. And he explains what it was like going clubbing with Madonna as her star was starting to explode in the mid-’80s.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Kaytranada’s futuristic, soulful disco sound is suddenly everywhere—including on his new hit song “Twin Flame” with Anderson .Paak. The Haitian-Canadian DJ/producer got his start as a teenager by uploading J. Dilla and Flying Lotus-inspired beats to SoundCloud. In 2012 his edit of Janet Jackson’s “If” exploded and became a massive viral hit. In the 10 years since, Kaytranada has remixed dozens of records and released two studio albums, including the Grammy award-winning <em data-stringify-type="italic">Bubba</em>.</p>
<p>On today’s episode Rick Rubin and Kaytranada sit down to talk about how using technology unconventionally can lead to creating an entirely new sound. Kaytra also explains the anxiety he felt as an up-and-coming hip-hop producer who could never quite connect with an MPC drum machine. And he talks about what it’s like rocking stadiums as the opening DJ on the Weeknd’s worldwide tour.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we are featuring a chat with two members of the Nashville-based string band, Old Crow Medicine Show—lead singer Ketch Secor and drummer Jerry Pentecost. Since forming in 1998, Old Crow has helped preserve folk and blues songs that often pre-date World War II. Old Crow has also released a number of their own songs, and in the folk tradition, put their own spin on their favorite artists’ tunes. Their most successful song to date, the platinum-certified “Wagon Wheel,” was written around a Bob Dylan chorus Ketch heard on an old Dylan bootleg.</p>
<p>On today’s episode Bruce Headlam talks to Ketch Secor and Jerry Pentecost about Old Crow’s latest album, <em data-stringify-type="italic">Paint This Town</em>. They share  how they’re raising awareness around the major contributions black musicians like Ray Charles and DeFord<em data-stringify-type="italic"> </em>Bailey have made to country music. And then Ketch recalls Old Crow’s early days when they went through what he calls “hillbilly bootcamp” learning how to make whiskey, farm tobacco, and shoot groundhogs.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we are featuring a conversation with the world’s preeminent banjo player, Béla Fleck. Over the course of his four-decade career, Béla has won numerous Grammys in a variety of surprising genres including Jazz, Latin, Pop, and Classical. Last year, his latest release, <em data-stringify-type="italic">My Bluegrass Heart,</em> scored the Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album.</p>
<p>In addition to Béla’s innovative style and expert technique, he is also an advocate for keeping the banjo’s rich historical tradition alive. In 2008, Béla made a pilgrimage to Africa to trace the origins of the banjo in the documentary <em data-stringify-type="italic">Throw Down Your Heart</em>.</p>
<p>On today’s episode Bruce Headlam talks to Béla Fleck about growing up in New York City where he first fell in love with the banjo while watching the <em data-stringify-type="italic">Beverly Hillbillies</em>. Béla also talks about how jazz giants like Chick Corea and Charlie Parker influenced his highly technical style. And, Béla explains why he believes the banjo is far superior to the guitar.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Nilüfer Yanya is a 27-year-old singer/songwriter from West London. After several years of hitting small stages with her guitar, Nilüfer broke through in 2016 with a series of soulful, indie-pop EPs and singles. Justin Richmond spoke with Nilüfer in April, just after her performance at Coachella, about the release of her second album,<em data-stringify-type="italic"> PAINLESS</em>. The album’s tracks are laden with electronic drums and raucous guitar. They play like a diary entry, wrenched with heartbreak, loss, and hope.</p>
<p>On today’s episode Nilüfer talks about the collaborative songwriting process she has with her producer, Will Archer and friend, saxophonist, Jazzi Bobbi. She also recalls how she wrote her first songs as a 10-year-old, and how she always dreamed of being a guitarist in a band, rather than a solo act.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Swedish-born singer Neneh Cherry’s four-decade-long career has ricocheted between a number of genres including hip-hop, jazz, and trip-hop. Her first single in 1988, “Buffalo Stance,” cemented her standing as a no-nonsense Black feminist voice in contemporary urban music. This year Neneh released her sixth album, “The Versions.” It’s a collection of cover songs of some of Cherry’s biggest hits, and is performed exclusively by female artists including Robyn, Sia, and Neneh’s daughter Tyson.</p>
<p>On today’s episode Bruce Headlam talks to Neneh Cherry about her bohemian upbringing in Sweden, New York and London with stepdad Don Cherry, the famous jazz trumpet player. Neneh also recalls how she first met The Slits, the legendary all-girl punk group. And why despite scoring her first big hit with a cheeky rap verse, she never considered herself a real MC.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today on the show, we're welcoming Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter, Lyle Lovett. Lovett follows in the footsteps of Texas troubadours like Guy Clark, Walter Hyatt, and Townes Van Zandt.</p>
<p>In 1986, Lovett helped lay the foundation for the alternative country and Americana movements with his debut, self-titled album. Since then, he has continued to light up country music with a rich blend of country, big band, blues, folk, and jazz. All of those sounds are on display in <em data-stringify-type="italic">12th of June</em>—his first new album in a decade.</p>
<p>On today’s episode Lovett speaks to Bruce Headlam about his new album, a project rooted in home and family, which makes sense considering at 64 years-old, he's a new dad to twins. Lovett also shares stories of his early days playing gigs around Texas A&amp;M.</p>

      <itunes:title>The Doors: Robby Krieger and John Densmore</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have a fun follow-up to last week’s episode with Johnny Echols from the band Love. This week we’ll hear Rick interview the last two living members of The Doors—guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore—about coming up in the LA rock scene alongside the band Love, who The Doors idolized and then later eclipsed.</p>
<p>The Doors formed in 1965 and burned white-hot, releasing six albums in five years, until the death of their larger than life lead singer, Jim Morrison. In their brief time as a band, The Doors quickly became one of the biggest acts of the late 60s. Their anti flower-power appeal was accentuated by Jim Morrison’s heavy, brooding lyrics, and keyboardist Ray Manzarek’s frenzied organ licks.</p>
<p>On today’s episode Rick Rubin talks to Robby Krieger and John Densmore about their tumultuous history with Jim Morrison—who John refers to as a “Kamikaze drunk.” Both Robbie and John recall LSD-fueled stories from their early gigs with The Doors. And the role Acapulco Gold played in Jim Morrison’s songwriting process.</p>

      <itunes:title>Danny Brown and Johnny Echols on Love's Forever Changes</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re closing out Black Music Month by celebrating one of Rick Rubin’s favorite albums of all time—Forever Changes by the band Love. Formed in 1965, Love was a groundbreaking, interracial L.A. group. While their name isn’t usually mentioned alongside historic psychedelic bands like The Byrds or The Grateful Dead, Love’s influence is vast. Their charismatic, fashion-forward black frontman, Arthur Lee, inspired Jimi Hendrix’s look, and in the mid-60s Love was one of the hottest bands in Hollywood.</p>
<p>In 1967 Love recorded their third album, Forever Changes. It was the last album for the original core group with guitarist Johnny Echols and co-writer Brian McClean. The album ushered in an entirely new sound for the band, combining Baroque sounding strings with horns and folky instrumentation with poetic lyrics.</p>
<p>On today’s episode we’ll hear some of Rick Rubin’s conversation with Detroit rapper Danny Brown, who like Rick, places Love’s album Forever Changes at the very top of his greatest albums of all time list. Then, we’ll hear Rick in conversation with Love’s lead guitarist Johnny Echols about the intense turmoil surrounding the recording of Forever Changes. Echols—who grew up straddling both Black LA and the psychedelic strip—explains how Love was responsible for getting The Doors their record deal, only to be quickly overshadowed by The Doors mainstream success. Echols also recalls first meeting the Beatles when they were an opening act for Little Richard.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re continuing our celebration of Black Music Month with the incredible jazz legend, Sonny Rollins. Rollins is an American tenor saxophonist and composer who is widely regarded as one of the most influential jazz musicians of all time. Sadly, now at 91 years-old, Rollins no longer plays as a result of pulmonary fibrosis. Fortunately for us though, he's able to look back over an eight-decade career that started at the beginnings of Bebop, and included playing with the Rolling Stones, and performing on stages all over the world.</p>
<p>On today’s episode, Justin Richmond talks to Sonny Rollins about one of his first big gigs in 1949 playing alongside other jazz icons like Bud Powell and Fats Navarro. He also explains why he no longer actively listens to music, and for the first time ever, Rollins talks about how Charlie “Bird” Parker is the reason he kicked drugs.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we&rsquo;ll hear Rick Rubin talk to one of his all-time favorite vocalists, Tom Jones. With his soulful baritone and unique interpretation of the American R&amp;B and gospel, Jones became a mainstay at hip venues in London, New York and Las Vegas with now-timeless hits like &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Not Unusual,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Green Green Grass Of Home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On today&rsquo;s episode, Tom Jones shares stories with Rick from his remarkable career, including the first time he met Elvis on a movie set in Hollywood&mdash;and the night he turned down an invitation to join Little Richard on stage out of fear he&rsquo;d be deported. Tom also talks about why he thought Burt Bacharach&rsquo;s lyrics to &ldquo;What&rsquo;s New Pussycat&rdquo; were a joke the first time he heard them.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we&rsquo;re talking to Stuart Murdoch and Stevie Jackson from the Scottish folk-pop band, Belle &amp; Sebastian. After seven years, the indie pop band is releasing their ninth studio album, their first in seven years &ndash;&nbsp;<em data-stringify-type="italic">A Bit of Previous</em>. The album was recorded in Belle &amp; Sebastian&rsquo;s hometown of Glasgow, after plans to record in LA fell through because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Bruce Headlam talks to Stuart and Stevie about their new album and the band plays songs live from the new project. Stuart also talks about how getting sick at 21 was a critical moment in his music career, and how he is not personally itching to get back out in front of a live audience.</p>

In this episode, Brendan and his friend Danielle Henderson navigate the icy streets of Montr&eacute;al, making a pilgrimage to Leonard Cohen's house. Brendan meets a member of Arcade Fire, who describes his experience meeting the iconic musician, and what Leonard means to the people of Montr&eacute;al.</p>

<p>After R.E.M. broke up a little over a decade ago, Stipe followed other creative pursuits like photography.

On today&rsquo;s episode, Michael plays Rick his new song, &ldquo;Future If Future&rdquo; produced by Andy LeMaster. Michael Stipe also talks about why he decided to record a solo album, and how he always intended to be super famous&mdash;and what it was like when that actually happened.</p>

And both Anthony and John give their accounts of John’s third<em> </em>return to the band.<strong> </strong></p><p>Make sure to check out Rick's interview next week with the almighty Flea.</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Hear a playlist of all of our favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers songs<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1DdtTXGLVrojQcgr5o1dCI?si=a2a64270e70347a9"> <u>HERE.</u></a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bonnie was offered her first record deal as a college student in 1971 after a reporter saw her play an early gig in NYC, but it took almost two decades before she peaked commercially with her tenth album, <em>Nick Of Time</em>. Throughout her long career Bonnie has helped preserve American blues music by recording songs from little-known but classic songwriters.</p><p>On today’s episode Bruce Headlam talks to Bonnie Raitt about her meticulous song-selection process and the inspiration behind the tunes she wrote for her new album, <em>Just Like That</em>.

As the frontman for Led Zeppelin, his dynamic, soaring vocal style was the perfect lead for the band’s unparalleled musicianship.

Under the guidance of producer and <em>Broken Record </em>alum, T Bone Burnett, their first album, <em>Raising Sand, </em>sold over a million copies in the US and won five Grammys, including Album of the Year. </p><p>On today’s episode, Rick Rubin talks to Robert Plant about recording his latest release with Krauss, <em>Can’t Let Go</em>.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the 1970’s Jackson Browne was known as one of the originators of the carefree, California classic rock sound with hits like “Doctor My Eyes” and “Running on Empty.” As his career progressed, Jackson Browne’s knack for writing soul-searching lyrics turned more political.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have a special <em>Broken Record </em>Holiday episode with Nashville singer Amanda Shires. Shires’ new holiday album, <em>For Christmas, </em>isn’t meant to make you feel merry and bright. Instead it’s an acknowledgment of the complicated feelings that can come along with the holidays, like disappointment, longing and maybe a little bit of lust.</p><p>In addition to her solo career, Amanda Shires plays fiddle and sings in her husband Jason Isbell’s band, The 400 Unit. She is also a founding member of the female country supergroup, The Highwomen, with Brandi Carlile. But way before she hit it big in Nashville, Shires played fiddle with the Texas Playboys, the legendary Western swing band started by Bob Will’s that she joined when she was just 12 years-old.</p><p>On today’s episode Bruce Headlam talks to Amanda Shires about what inspired her to write a non-traditional Christmas album. Shires also explains how finding out that her Grandfather served decades in Alcatraz raised a ton of questions about her family’s history. And she recalls what happened the time she discovered her husband had ripped off one of her lyrics. </p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out our favorite Amanda Shires songs<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3SrfLU3UitSoZ00gcBNmbz?si=3cc3e250684e4572"> HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>Mary Gauthier: Saved By A Song</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Mary Gauthier is a folk singer/songwriter whose songs have quite literally saved her life. Writing music did not come easily to Gauthier. She began abusing drugs and alcohol as a young girl growing up in Louisiana. After years of struggling with addiction, Gauthier got clean at age 27 and began frequenting open mics around Boston. She released her debut album, <em>Dixie Kitchen,</em> in 1997 and moved to Nashville not long after. She has since become known for her ability to write vivid, literary-style lyrics that pull from her past trauma, loss, and heartbreak.</p><p>On today’s episode Bruce Headlam talks to Mary Gauthier about how the same determination that once drove her to drink now powers her songwriting. She also talks about how conversations with young U.S. veterans inspired her Grammy-nominated album, <em>Rifles &amp; Rosary Beads</em>. And Gauthier recalls seeing one particularly moving open mic performance that inspired her to become the artist she is today. <strong>  </strong></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out our favorite Mary Gauthier songs<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7h8Eq2lQnHoKvxyM3etejx?si=c2b689d738b844dc"> HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Pastor T.L. Barrett has been known on Chicago’s South side as a religious and community leader for 50 years. But it wasn’t until recently that people started to uncover Barrett’s trove of gospel music. In the 1970s, Barrett began making recordings of the music performed in his church. These were sermons he’d turn into songs that sat around for years until rappers started sampling them in the last decade. People like Kanye West, T.I., DJ Khalid, Alicia Keys. All this recent attention on Pastor T.L. Barrett has culminated in a new box set from the Numero Group called “I Should Wear A Crown."</p><p>On today's episode Justin Richmond talks to Pastor Barrett about his distant relation to the Reverend C.L. Franklin and of course his daughter, the great Aretha Franklin. Pastor Barrett also talks about how he went from a high school dropout to a community leader. Plus what it was like for him to have his music discovered after decades.</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out our favorite Pastor T.L.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve sung along to a power ballad in the last 30 years, chances are you’re already intimately familiar with Diane Warren’s songs. Some of her biggest hits include Cher’s “If I Could Turn Back Time,” Celine Dion’s “Because You Loved Me,” and Aerosmith’s “I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing.” </p><p>Over the span of her 35 year-career, Diane Warren has penned hits for hip-hop, country, R&amp;B, and adult contemporary artists. In late August she finally released her own album, <em>The Cave Sessions Volume 1</em>, The genre-spanning project is modeled after DJ compilation albums and brilliantly shows off Warren’s incredible range as a writer. </p><p>On today’s episode Rick Rubin talks to Diane Warren about how she decided to become a songwriter when she was just 11-years-old. And how her parents built a shed in their backyard where she could work out her early arrangements. Warren also talks about her one and only music teacher—who told her dad she had no future in music—and why she feels she has yet to write her best work.</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out our favorite Diane Warren songs <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/59683mSjSn1tDZ9SQYUZ3z?si=519ff5e13c314dc6"> HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Lindsey Buckingham’s signature finger-style guitar is perhaps as recognizable as the countless classic songs he wrote while he was in Fleetwood Mac. Buckingham is a self-taught guitar virtuoso and songwriter who famously joined Fleetwood Mac in the mid ‘70s with his then girlfriend, Stevie Nicks. The band had been around since ‘67 with various singers, guitarists and songwriters. The only constant was their rhythm section: drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie. But the band didn’t blow up until Buckingham and Nicks joined, writing mega hits for their insanely successful 10th and 11th albums including the 20-times platinum album, <em>Rumours</em>. On today’s episode Bruce Headlam talks to Lindsey Buckingham about his new self-titled solo album. Buckingham also tells Bruce that he and Nicks never really got closure from their breakup, and how that affected their professional relationship in the decades since. </p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out a playlist of our favorite Lindsey Buckingham songs<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/28stuzFmw5XvYjJ7efMssm?si=638c79e8695b495d"> HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

At 23 he’s spent more than half of his life working as an actor, a musician, and an entrepreneur.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we're presenting something fun from Malcolm Gladwell, co-founder of Pushkin. In a special series from his podcast, Revisionist History, Malcolm is launching a massive frontal assault on The Little Mermaid. You might wonder, "what's Malcolm doing? It's a children's classic!" But according to Malcolm, it's not a classic... It's a cinematic dumpster fire. And Revisionist History is devoting no fewer than three episodes to explain why. In the finale, Malcolm enlists an all-star cast to make his own version of The Little Mermaid, featuring Dax Shepard, Brit Marling, Jodie Foster and Glenn Close.</p><p>You can hear the entire three-part series, right now, at:</p><p>Broken Record- <a href="http://podcasts.pushkin.fm/brokenrecordrh">http://podcasts.pushkin.fm/brokenrecordrh</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

Like an old married couple, Daryl Hall says the duo has managed to stay together for the sake of the dozens of songs they wrote together which they consider their kids. </p><p>On today’s episode, Bruce Headlam talks to Daryl Hall about the night he met John Oates in an elevator as they fled a gang fight in Philadelphia. Daryl also talks about the years he spent working with the production duo Gamble and Huff who pioneered the Philly soul sound.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Mark Ronson's big break as a producer came from working with Amy Winehouse to find the perfect sound for her career defining album, <em>Back To Black</em>. Since then, Ronson has gone on to win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and seven Grammys for producing chart-topping hits for artists like Lady Gaga, Adele and Bruno Mars. Ronson’s sound is often associated with danceable, driving rhythm sections—which makes sense, considering his background as a renowned DJ. </p><p>In today’s interview with Rick Rubin we’ll hear Mark talk about the day he met Amy Winehouse and how she might’ve confused him for Rick Rubin. Mark also talks about the night he fell in love with DJing, growing up with his step-dad in Foreigner, and how being isolated from his studio during the pandemic caused him to think that his days as a pop music producer might be over. </p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out a playlist of our favorite Mark Ronson tracks <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6PM3CCDYQjHuF3ZzB3GeCM?si=c75a7ca63f2444ad">HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Archie Shepp is a tenor saxophonist and composer who's spent over half a century contributing to the evolution of Black music. Shepp has long fought for Black musicians to get their fair share of credit, recognition and recompense for their contributions to popular music. Shepp's been considered a leader of avant-garde jazz since the 60's. He's famously played alongside John Coltrane, Lee Morgan, and the great free jazz pianist, Cecil Taylor. But 84-year-old Shepp doesn’t consider the music he plays jazz at all. He calls it “African American music” to acknowledge the Black Americans who created the tradition.</p><p>On today’s episode, Justin Richmond talks to Archie Shepp about how an assignment he received in the third grade sparked the activism that's been ever present in his 60-year career. Shepp also talks about his relationship with Coltrane, who he says never took his horn out of his mouth. And he also recalls the rhetorical power of Malcolm X and the lasting image of seeing him speak to a sea of black heads on the streets of Harlem.</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out a playlist of our favorite Archie Shepp tracks <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4JQFPYMu4jVQ3IIFfVN1gT?si=5e2851e2e78146ce"> HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

He calls it “African American music” to acknowledge the Black Americans who created the tradition.</p><p>On today’s episode, Justin Richmond talks to Archie Shepp about how an assignment he received in the third grade sparked the activism that's been ever present in his 60-year career. Shepp also talks about his relationship with Coltrane, who he says never took his horn out of his mouth. And he also recalls the rhetorical power of Malcolm X and the lasting image of seeing him speak to a sea of black heads on the streets of Harlem.</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out a playlist of our favorite Archie Shepp tracks <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4JQFPYMu4jVQ3IIFfVN1gT?si=5e2851e2e78146ce"> HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Five months after releasing their debut album in 2019, the Austin-based band was nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammys. And now, one year later, Black Pumas are up for Album of the Year for the deluxe version of their debut. Guitarist/Producer Adrian Quesada and Singer Eric Burton met at a crossroads in both of their careers. Adrian left his first band, Grupo Fantasma after a successful run, including a years-long mentorship by Prince. While looking for a new direction, a friend suggested he work with Eric—changing both of their fortunes. In this episode, Adrian talks about being taken under Prince’s wing, Eric reminisces about writing the group’s biggest hit in church, and they explain their unique chemistry that’s led to instant success.<strong> </strong></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear old and new interviews, often with bonus content:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/</a></p><p>You can find some of our favorite Black Pumas songs <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7Keyd8QO7FsKYbvsY0qZzL?si=subswT5nTpevYWTcMMVcjg">HERE — enjoy!</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

But Deep Sea Diver has managed to put all that aside to drop a thrilling and relevant new album. While the Seattle-based band’s only recently started to find their place in the indie rock landscape, Jessica Dobson has played in some of the genre’s most defining bands. She toured the world as the lead guitarist for Beck and The Shins, and played keyboard and bass for the Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs. In 2015, Jessica formed Deep Sea Diver with her husband and drummer Peter Mansen. In the wake of their new album, Broken Record producer Leah Rose talked to Jessica about how a stay-at-home livestream series inspired her to write a pandemic anthem in record time. Jessica also talks about how volunteering at a shelter for homeless sex workers helped her overcome a viscious bout of depression and write what she considers the best album of her career.</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record's YouTube channel to hear old and new interviews, often with bonus content: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast">https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here: <a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/">https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/</a></p><p>You can find some of our favorite Deep Sea Diver songs by clicking <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3L3nF8nGelAV4XqL9zwfgm?si=cLhv2zzIRJSUTUgwdXmq5A">HERE — enjoy!</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

The family picked up and moved to L.A where Lenny fell in love with classic rock, funk, and skate culture. It’s also where Lenny and Rick Rubin eventually became friends in the late ‘80s. In this conversation, Lenny tells candid stories about his relationship with Lisa Bonet and talks about how writing his memoir helped him finally find peace with his overbearing father. They also talk about the time Lenny, Rick and Johnny Cash were <em>all </em>roommates and the day Lenny received the most devastating news of his life.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our episode with Justin Townes Earle was scheduled to run next month. But after we heard about Earle's passing over the weekend, we decided to put it out sooner. It's a deeply sad conversation in some places. Especially given his passing. However, it's also incredibly soulful, funny and searching. And the performances, culled from Earle's last release, <em>The Saint of Lost Causes</em>, are brilliant. Bruce Headlam takes the reigns this episode for what's turned out to be a fitting tribute to one of the great, dynamic young performers and songwriters that's now gone way too soon.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Previewing the first episode of Against the Rules Season 2 by Michael Lewis (<em>Moneyball, The Big Short, The Blind Side</em>):</p><p>It wasn’t that long ago that coaches were confined to sports. Now they’re everywhere. You can hire a life coach or a death coach, an executive coach, a dating coach, even a charisma coach. Journalist and bestselling author Michael Lewis asks who’s getting all this coaching, and who isn’t? Lewis brings his wry wit and mastery of storytelling to topics as diverse as sports, consumer finance, college, and firefighting —  to understand what the rise of coaching means for all of us.In a seven-episode season, Against the Rules takes listeners from the home of a single mom in the mountains of Colorado, the classrooms of the Harvard Business School, to a data-driven “Bionic Man” facility for baseball pitchers. He speaks with a celebrity voice coach, an analyst who grades sales calls, and a startup founder who's coaching consumers out of credit-card debt. Along the way, he also revisits the controversial methods of his own high-school baseball coach. Through conversations both amusing and horrifying, Lewis explores the rise of coaching in America and what it says about unfairness. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>BONUS: David Blaine with Rick Rubin</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Rick Rubin, like all of us, has been thinking a lot about fear lately. And few people on the planet understand fear in the same way that Rick's good friend, David Blaine, does. David has made a career of pushing his mind and body to the limit. So Rick thought David might be a great person to talk to about facing fear. Ok obviously this conversation isn’t about music. But it does touch on one of Rick’s other great loves—magic. When he was a kid, Rick studied magic. Since then magic has become so much more than sleight of hand for him … he uses the idea of pulling something out of nothing when he’s making music. So it makes sense that he would turn to one of the best living magicians for words of wisdom.</p><p>To check out David Blaine's latest special visit: <a href="https://abc.com/movies-and-specials/david-blaine-the-magic-way">https://abc.com/movies-and-specials/david-blaine-the-magic-way</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Elton John has called Rufus Wainwright “the greatest songwriter in the world today.” Broken Record’s Bruce Headlam sits down with Rufus in Los Angeles, where Rufus performs breathtaking solo versions of his songs “Poses” and “In My Arms” from his earliest albums. He also offers a new song, a lullaby for his young daughter. In conversation, he frankly discusses his crazy early life and the inspiration for his music, his move into opera and his relationship with Leonard Cohen, who is, among other things, the grandfather to Wainwright’s daughter. He also discusses his newest single, “Sword of Damocles,” which was inspired by Donald Trump and Carrie Fisher, and his upcoming tour, “All These Poses,” featuring songs from his first two albums. And after a four-year break, Rufus and his sister Martha are once again presenting their Christmas show “Noel Nights” at New York City’s Town Hall of December 16th.
