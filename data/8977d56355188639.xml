      <title>1091: CRYPTO ANALYST PREDICTS BITCOIN TO TRIPLE IN PRICE TO $63K - HERE’S WHEN!!</title>
      <description>The popular crypto analyst and host of the InvestAnswers YouTube channel says that Bitcoin could easily go on a 3x rally before the next BTC halving event.

In a new strategy session, the analyst tells his 444,000 YouTube subscribers that strong BTC rallies usually precede Bitcoin’s halvings, an event when miners’ block rewards are cut in half and therefore crunching future supply.

According to the analyst, historical precedence based on the halving dates places Bitcoin around the $63,000 level by March of 2024, which would be more than a 200% gain from current prices.

      <title>1088: COSTA RICA NEXT COUNTRY TO ESTABLISH BITCOIN AS REGULATED CURRENCY?!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Wfyk0bhuCvc</link>
      <description>Costa Rica could be one of the next countries to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a regulated payment method. 

This week, Congresswoman Johana Obando introduced a bill to allow Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to serve as a form of payment. The bill also proposes that traditional banking institutions be able to serve as crypto exchanges, including custody and wallet services for their customers.

"The cryptocurrency assets market is very new. This bill wants to propose Costa Rica as an investment center for crypto-related people and companies to see Costa Rica as a growth niche."

      <title>1083: Bitcoin Will Shoot Over $100K in 2023 Before ‘Largest Bear Market' - Top Crypto Trader!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/cwgg0OXTYoA</link>
      <description>Bitcoin will top $100,000 next year but a record-breaking bear market will follow, a popular crypto trader believes.

In a Twitter discussion on Oct. 22, Credible Crypto endorsed a theory that the next BTC halving will also see macro lows of just $10,000.

"Agreed, probably in 2025 methinks. First, new ATH in 2023- blow-off top 5th wave above 100k- followed by the largest bear market we have seen yet that is worse than the current one in both time and price- taking us to the 10-14k that everyone is waiting for now."

      <title>1079: BLOOMBERG ANALYST DETAILS $100K BITCOIN PREDICTION, CALLS BTC THE FASTEST HORSE IN THE CRYPTO RACE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/AzqgIDA8kiY</link>
      <description>A senior Bloomberg crypto analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) skyrocketing to a six figure price tag is only a matter of time.

In a new interview with Daniela Cambone of Stansberry Research, Bloomberg commodity strategist Mike McGlone says that Bitcoin’s price will eventually see a massive spike to $100,000 due to a combination of increased adoption and limited supply.

“So Bitcoin, I think it’s [only] a matter of time [until] it appreciates towards that $100,000 level. And at some point, it’s going to just slip in and kick into that bull market – maybe at the same time gold and treasury bonds do in terms of price."

      <link>https://youtu.be/WDw3Of2gBT8</link>
      <description>Comparing the Bitcoin price actions prior to the midterm elections of 2018 with those of 2022 shows a strikingly similar crypto bear market trend.

Independent market analyst Aditya Siddhartha Roy thinks the BTC price will fall into the $12,000-$14,000 range if a similar breakdown occurs. He further notes that the king cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) could bottom out in November or December 2022, just like in 2018.

      <title>1076: BITCOIN ON TRACK TO HIT 1,000,000,000 UNIQUE USERS SOONER THAN EXPECTED - HERE’S WHEN!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/_7IPqie4urc</link>
      <description>A closely followed on-chain analyst says Bitcoin is currently on pace to hit one billion unique users in the coming years.

Willy Woo tells his one million Twitter followers that 12% of the world’s population will be using the king crypto (BTC) in the next 36 months.

“Bitcoin took six months to get 1,000 users; five years to find one million users. Today, 13.8 years from inception, it has 300 million+ users, 4% of the world. At current growth rates, one billion users will be hit in the next three years. 

To clarify, these are unique users, not addresses.”

      <description>In today's breaking Bitcoin News, conservative influencer and political commentator, Candace Owens shared a letter on Twitter that shows JPMorgan Chase allegedly closed the bank account of Kanye West (also known as Ye). As far back as 2020 on the Joe Rogan podcast, Kanye West revealed the ‘True Liberation Of America’ could be Bitcoin and after this recent bank cancelation it couldn't be anymore obvious that the king crypto (BTC) really is the answer.

“Earlier today I learned that [Kanye West] was officially kicked out of JP Morgan Chase bank,” Owens tweeted on Wednesday. “I was told there was no official reason given, but they sent this letter as well to confirm that he has until late November to find another place for the Yeezy empire to bank.”

      <title>1073: ARK INVEST STANDS BY PREDICTION BITCOIN WILL TOP $1 MILLION PER COIN!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/n3StV2nFPbo</link>
      <description>Ark Investment Management analyst Yassine Elmandjra is standing by his firm’s prediction that the Bitcoin price will shoot past the million-dollar mark, despite this year’s massive crypto sell-off in the digital currency.

Cathie Wood, the fund manager behind Ark’s flagship innovation-themed ETFs, forecast earlier this year that the world’s largest cryptocurrency (BTC) would top $1 million per coin by 2030. Yet, coin holders and miners have been selling off Bitcoin en masse in 2022 as the Federal Reserve continues to aggressively tighten monetary policy, driving investors away from riskier asset classes, such as crypto.

      <title>1072: MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL CEO DOUBLES DOWN ON $250K BITCOIN PREDICTION - HERE’S WHEN!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/htxD3Bdr0ZE</link>
      <description>Morgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko remains confident that the Bitcoin price is still going to reach $250,000 (as he has predicted several times in the past):

“I absolutely positively believe that Bitcoin is digital gold… I think it is a better form of value storage. I absolutely believe that. Gold – $10 trillion above ground. Half of it [is] in jewelry and chalices – that doesn’t count. The monetary value of gold [is] about $5 trillion.

So $5 trillion from [BTC’s market cap of] $400 billion today, that’s [a] 10x. [A] 10x from here at $20,000 is $200,000. Round it, my numbers are off a little bit, to that $250,000 number. Seems easy to me to get to $250,000 because you got a few lost or stolen coins. No problem...

      <description>A popular on-chain Bitcoin analyst claims the current crypto bear market hasn’t yet sent as many BTC underwater as previous cryptocurrency bear markets.

BTC analyst Willy Woo notes that showing how many Bitcoin are at a lower value compared to their purchase price is “one way of visualizing maximum pain.”

Woo’s chart indicates that Bitcoin’s 60% underwater level is currently hovering around $10,000.

      <title>1065: MICHAEL SAYLOR SAYS BITCOIN IS 100X BETTER THAN GOLD AND WILL EXPLODE TO $500K PER BTC!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/OgwLWPRt60w</link>
      <description>Michael Saylor, the chairman and cofounder of software company turned Bitcoin acquisition vehicle MicroStrategy, has predicted the value of the king crypto (BTC) will overtake gold within ten years - potentially giving Bitcoin a $500,000 price and a market capitalization of $10 trillion.

"The next logical stop for bitcoin is to replace gold as a non-sovereign store of value asset," Saylor told MarketWatch this week, adding gold is a $10 trillion asset. "Bitcoin is digital gold, it's 100-times better than gold and if bitcoin goes to the value of gold it goes to $500,000 per bitcoin."

"The next logical stop for bitcoin is to replace gold as a non-sovereign store of value asset," Saylor told MarketWatch this week, adding gold is a $10 trillion asset. "Bitcoin is digital gold, it's 100-times better than gold and if bitcoin goes to the value of gold it goes to $500,000 per bitcoin."

      <title>1064: STOCK-TO-FLOW CREATOR PLANB BOUGHT MORE BITCOIN AND EXPLAINS WHY NOW HIS 3RD EVER BTC INVESTMENT!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/sB0WMT_df1U</link>
      <description>The creator of the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model – PlanB – admitted that recently he made his third BTC investment. At the time of the purchase, the primary crypto was hovering around $20,000.

Due to its significant price depreciation compared to the all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021, many people proclaimed Bitcoin dead in the past several months. However, PlanB revealed that each of his crypto investments was at a time when pessimism was reigning.

"My first bitcoin investment was in 2015 at ~$400 (yellow circle). Most people said bitcoin was dead.

My 2nd investment was in 2018 at ~$4000 when I published the S2F model. Most people said bitcoin was dead.

My 3rd investment is now at ~$20,000. Most people say bitcoin is dead."

      <link>https://youtu.be/Yi_0GpAQwnA</link>
      <description>According to the crypto host of InvestAnswers, Bitcoin could hit up to $26,000 over the next four weeks based on the average return for October. 

“If Bitcoin can hold in and around its level, it’ll be better than previously…

Looking forward to October, the average return for October is 28.42%, which would take the Bitcoin price up to about $25,000 – $26,000. So, we’ll see if it goes there. Twenty-five thousand dollars is where we were not too long ago, and we could easily get back to that level.”

      <title>1060: Ex-Hedge Fund Manager Makes Massive Eight-Figure Bitcoin Prediction for Year 2031!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/p71xrEn4mEI</link>
      <description>A former hedge fund manager says that Bitcoin could be worth well into the millions of dollars by the year 2031.

According to Robert Breedlove, the deterioration of the US dollar (USD) will be the key factor in the king crypto (BTC) price explosion.

“I have a public prediction that the US dollar is basically hyperinflated to zero, or close to it, by the year 2035…

I’m going to stand by that prediction today. I know the DXY [US dollar index] is way up recently but I sort of expect this thing to get volatile before it breaks down. If that is the case, then I have a matching Bitcoin price prediction of $12.5 million US per Bitcoin by the year 2031.”

      <title>1058: TOP CRYPTO ANALYST SHARES CONSERVATIVE BITCOIN MODEL REACHING $3.4 MILLION PER COIN - HERE’S WHEN!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/ImQHTiCL7u0</link>
      <description>Popular crypto analyst InvestAnswers thinks Bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars per BTC within eight years under the assumption that people will continue to flock to the leading cryptocurrency asset.

“Not hopium, just math, and we do expect it to slow down, but the key takeaway here is if Metcalfe’s Law holds, the conservative model has Bitcoin reaching $3.4 million by the year 2030. That may seem completely impossible, completely ridiculous, outlandish, compared to where we are right now, but anyway, let’s go more into what’s happening. Again, this is about adoption, it’s an arms race, it’s game theory, whatever you want to talk about it.”

      <title>1056: BITCOIN WILL HIT $500K, IT’S 100 TIMES BETTER THAN GOLD, SAYS MICHAEL SAYLOR!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/dPypehO77UQ</link>
      <description>Despite the fact that Bitcoin has lost over 73% of its value since its all-time high in 2021, BTC bull and MicroStrategy co-founder and CEO Michael Saylor is unfazed.

“I think that the next logical stop for Bitcoin is to replace gold as a non-sovereign store of value asset and gold is a $10 trillion asset as we speak. Bitcoin is digital gold, it’s 100x better than gold,” Saylor said during the Money Festival hosted by MarketWatch on Wednesday.

“The half-life of money in crypto is forever. You can move it on billions of computers at the speed of light. So if Bitcoin goes to the value of the yellow metal, it’s going to $500,000 per coin, and I think that happens this decade,” Saylor pointed out.

      <title>1055: PLAN B PREDICTS BITCOIN TO 50X REACHING $1 MILLION PER COIN IN 2025 POST BTC HALVING!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/fx6T_Wbvutw</link>
      <description>Quant crypto analyst PlanB, creator of the notorious Bitcoin stock-to-flow model (S2F) is now predicting the Bitcoin price to soar 5x-50x from it's current price reaching $100K - $1 million per coin in the next 3 years.

"IMO 2024 halving will (again and in line with S2F) have a big (lagged or front-run) impact on Bitcoin. My prediction: BTC will be $100K-$1M in 2025 (yellow square), 5x-50x from current $19K next 3 yrs. This forecast is not accurate, but better roughly right than precisely wrong."

      <title>1054: MICHAEL SAYLOR DOUBLES DOWN ON $500K BITCOIN, SAYS NEXT LOGICAL STEP FOR BTC IS TO REPLACE GOLD!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/MUA0431MJkQ</link>
      <description>MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor thinks Bitcoin will reach $500K - $1,000,000 per coin in the next years if it matches the market capitalization of gold.

“The next logical step for bitcoin is to replace gold as a non-sovereign store of value asset.”

Last year, he outlined the merits of the king crypto (BTC) and claimed that it is 50 times better than the precious metal. This summer, he doubled down on that stance, saying the asset is “obviously better than gold and everything that gold wants to be.”

Instead of going to zero (as some might predict given its recent price decline), Saylor envisioned it will shoot up to $1 million in the years to come.

      <title>1051: BLOOMBERG ANALYST DOUBLES DOWN ON BIG $100,000 BITCOIN PREDICTION - HERE’S HIS TIMELINE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/CeFYn3uLYRY</link>
      <description>Bloomberg’s lead commodity analyst Mike McGlone is doubling down on his forecast for a six-figure Bitcoin price tag.

In a new interview with Kitco News, crypto expert McGlone says that adoption and demand for Bitcoin appear to be gaining enough steam to push BTC to $100,000 in less than three years.

“Here’s the key thing about Bitcoin. To me, it’s a matter of time before it gets to $100,000. The key fact is by code, the supply is going down. You can’t change it. Adoption and demand are increasing. Unless you expect that to reverse – which I don’t – I think it’s going to accelerate. Every sign I see it’s accelerating. It will continue appreciating. It’s just a matter of time."

      <link>https://youtu.be/drbuwM6i7qM</link>
      <description>Boston Consulting Group (BCG) believes that blockchain technology presents a massive business opportunity by 2030, predicting a $16,000,000,000 Crypto tokenized market cap which suggest a $320,000 - $1,020,000 Bitcoin price action based on the entire cryptocurrency tokenized market cap growing 16x -51x in value.

The global consulting giant says in a new report that “on-chain asset tokenization” can help address the challenge posed by asset illiquidity.

      <title>1047: BIG THINGS HAPPENING SOON FOR BITCOIN, ACCORDING TO POPULAR CRYPTO TRADER!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Wesg6jIFbLk</link>
      <description>A popular crypto strategist and trader says a potential shift that could end Bitcoin’s (BTC) multi-month downtrend is on the horizon.

Cryptocurrency analyst Kevin Svenson tells his 69,200 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is on the verge of taking out its diagonal resistance that has kept the market bearish since November 2021.

“This long-term [downtrend line], from $69,000 all the way down on the linear scale, we’re potentially at breakout point to break the macro downtrend on linear… But also we have the weekly RSI, which we’re currently about to break out of. So Bitcoin has some potential bullish pivots coming, potentially [a] bullish trend shift.”

      <title>1045: BITCOIN PROJECTED TO REACH $1 MILLION PER COIN, SAYS MICHAEL SAYLOR!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/hc8aVa2wRbM</link>
      <description>With the Ethereum Merge release scheduled for Sept. 13th, reaching $1,000,000 per Bitcoin by 2030 is still inevitable, and a pretty popular projection.

Crypto trading platform BitMEX's ex-CEO Arthur Hays made precisely that prediction four months ago. Famous cryptocurrency investor Cathie Wood set the same target in April 2022.

Serial entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano took the stage at the same BTC 2022 event to say that Bitcoin could reach $500,000 or $1,000,000 in the near future -- but anything beyond that would require a social collapse and total meltdown of the US dollar.

In early June, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) chairman Michael Saylor doubled down on his bullish price predictions in a CNBC interview: "It's not going to zero. If it's not going to zero, it's going to a million because it's obviously better than gold at everything that gold wants to be."

      <description>Bitcoin is set to explode in price after the next halving in 2024 with many crypto experts projecting a minimum price target of $100,000 and according to cryptocurrency exchange Changelly, BTC might peak at around $937,000 in 2030, with an average trading price of $798,000 per coin.

“We must think about the long-term implications of Bitcoin and Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies. Once mined, this will be the next main store of value as gold once was. The halving is set to occur in 2024, and this will, by definition, increase the USD price of Bitcoin by quite a bit. For this reason, I believe this is the time to buy. Once the halving happens, BTC will be worth at least $100,000.”

      <title>1043: BITCOIN IS ON TARGET TO HIT $2.11 MILLION PER BTC BY THIS DATE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/1Y6Rino4cjg</link>
      <description>By carrying out a rudimentary extrapolation of Bitcoin price movements of the previous four year halving cycles, the king crypto (BTC) is on a run rate to hit $2.11 million by January 2030.

Using the extrapolation from January 2017 to an extrapolated May 2024 projected price of $108,000 and incorporating a 1-year price increase of 413% between May 2024 and May 2025, BTC could hit $446,000.

Incorporating the estimated 413% increase between May 2028 and May 2029, BTC would be on target to hit $2.08 million by May 2029, giving BTC a January 2030 value of $2.11 million.

      <title>1042: BITCOIN HAS BOTTOMED AND ON CUSP OF $300K BULL MARKET RALLY, SAYS CEO OF $4.5 BILLION CRYPTO FUND!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/u2uyVCCsMhU</link>
      <description>The founder and CEO of crypto asset fund Pantera Capital, Dan Morehead, is expressing bullish sentiment on Bitcoin, predicting a 15x rally over the next 5 years, suggesting a $300,000 BTC price action.

Asked to reveal his end-of-year and five-year price target for Bitcoin, the Pantera Capital CEO says that the flagship crypto asset is likely to maintain the average annual growth rate of 150% “for a while.”

“Bitcoin as a proxy for the industry has averaged 2.5x a year for eleven years. So that’s always kind of my standard forecast is that it will probably keep going at that same growth rate for a while.”

      <title>1041: BITCOIN IS A ‘WILD CARD’ SET TO OUTPERFORM, SAYS BLOOMBERG CRYPTO ANALYST - BTC $95 MILLION COME UP!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/oJeHXa4wevo</link>
      <description>Bloomberg crypto analyst Mike McGlone has labeled Bitcoin (BTC) a “wild card” which is “ripe” to outperform once traditional stocks finally bottom out.

“Bitcoin is a wild card that’s more ripe to outperform when stocks bottom, but transitioning to be more like gold and bonds.”

Meanwhile, separate observations from monitoring resource Whalemap focused on a potential sale of 5,000 BTC, which had previously stayed dormant since Christmas 2013.

"Someone cashed out 5000BTC yesterday making a whopping a $95,000,000 profit.

Original price of acquisition was $698 for him which is a 2800% increase from current price."

      <title>1040: Bank With $489 Billion In Assets Explains How Bitcoin and Crypto Can Reach Mainstream Mass Adoption!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/aBMlxj1v7aQ</link>
      <description>The largest bank in Singapore is backing Bitcoin, crypto and blockchain tech despite the regulatory uncertainty and market downturn.

According to a new report from the Financial Times, DBS CEO Piyush Gupta says the recent cryptocurrency slump shows the need for regulated financial institutions to offer digital asset products.

DBS first rolled out its crypto exchange for institutional and accredited investors in late 2020, offering trading services for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Earlier this year, Gupta announced plans to further expand its crypto offerings.

      <title>1039: HERE’S WHAT CAN TRIGGER MASSIVE BITCOIN RALLY TO ALL-TIME HIGHS: CRYPTO VETERAN BOBBY LEE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/PlXfAvAY7QA</link>
      <description>Crypto veteran and Bitcoin OG Bobby Lee says he remains bullish on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and the wider cryptocurrency market despite the recent downturn.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Lee says that if the predictions for a severe crypto winter fail to materialize, Bitcoin and Ethereum will easily go back to their all-time highs recorded in November of 2021.

The crypto veteran says that the upgrade that will see Ethereum transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof of stake (PoS) will serve as the catalyst that will see the two crypto assets rally back to their record highs.

      <title>1038: CRYPTO TYCOON RICHARD HEART DOUBLES DOWN ON BITCOIN CRASH TO $11K PREDICTION!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Wzw1_Fg6eLE</link>
      <description>HEX founder Richard Heart predicted exclusively to Watcher Guru in May 2022 that Bitcoin will crash to $11,000. At the time of his prediction, BTC was trading at $29,915, and four months later now, it is at $19,000.

Watcher Guru reached out to the crypto tycoon again if he still believes that BTC is headed towards $11,000. Heart doubled down on his predictions claiming that Bitcoin will crash to $11K dipping 85% from its all-time high of $69,044, which it reached in November 2021.

“Bitcoin will continue to fall down to $11,000 as long as the grayscale discount to NAV exists. It’s the normal 85% price dip Bitcoin does. Mt GOX coins being released is more potential sell pressure,” he said to Watcher Guru.

      <title>1037: VITALIK BUTERIN MAKES BOLD BITCOIN PREDICTION FOR YEAR 2042, SAYS ONE BIG ISSUE AWAITS BTC!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/7RJckwSNxMA</link>
      <description>Ethereum (ETH) creator Vitalik Buterin has an idea for what the state of Bitcoin (BTC) will look like twenty years from now.

In a new interview with economist Noah Smith, Buterin says that in the medium term, he thinks crypto assets including Bitcoin and Ethereum will become about as volatile as gold or the stock market, moving away from the big bubble and crash phases of the past.

The cryptocurrency visionary also says that even though crypto could satisfy a few key narratives in the next two decades, mainstream adoption is going to be the biggest factor in determining the fate of digital assets.

      <title>1036: Top Crypto YouTuber Boldly Predicts $500k Bitcoin and $3 Dogecoin by This Date!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/v5X8dqPTneI</link>
      <description>Matt Wallace, a well-known crypto influencer, predicts we could see Bitcoin at over $500k and Dogecoin (DOGE) over $3 by the end of 2024.

“We are barely beginning to scratch the surface of crypto adoption,” says Wallace. “Crypto solves so many problems that its meteoric rise is inevitable! BTC is the best store of value, and Dogecoin is the most popular currency in the crypto space. Together they will dominate the world economy. $500,000 Bitcoin isn’t just possible; it’s inevitable. As BTC rises, Dogecoin will have a clear path to well over $3,” Matt told TechBullion.

      <title>1034: DC Attorney General Sues Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy for Tax Evasion! $2M Bitcoin Prediction!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/l3QxlCwqMQY</link>
      <description>Karl Racine, Attorney General for the District of Columbia in the United States, has announced that his office has sued business intelligence firm MicroStrategy and its Bitcoin bullish co-founder Michael Saylor for charges related to tax evasion.

However, there is no shaking Saylor’s confidence, who assured that there is no price target for the king crypto at which MicroStrategy will begin liquidating its BTC holdings. Even as the market-wide meltdown evaporated trillions of value, the leading Bitcoin maximalist and his company is patiently holding firm.

“There’s no price target. I expect we’ll be buying bitcoin at the local top forever. And I expect Bitcoin is going to go into the millions. So we’re very patient. We think it’s the future of money.”

      <title>1033: Bitcoin Double-Bottom Can Spark BTC Rally to $30K Despite ‘Extreme Fear’!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Z24MSS10E7U</link>
      <description>Bitcoin price double-bottom and then to $30K?

The conflicting upside signal comes from a potential double-bottom pattern on the BTC longer-timeframe charts against the United States dollar. Double-bottoms are bullish reversal patterns that resemble the letter W due to two lows and a change in direction from downside to upside.

Meanwhile, a double-bottom’s upside target is found after measuring the distance between the pattern’s peak (neckline) and lowest levels and adding the outcome to the breakout point, as illustrated below. In other words, a potential 50% price rally taking the king crypto to the $30K level.

      <title>1032: Crypto Experts Say Bitcoin Can Still Hit $100K In 2022 - Here’s How!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/jwwbP5IzBPI</link>
      <description>It’s been a rocky start to the year for Bitcoin, but crypto experts still say it will hit $100,000 per coin - and that it’s more a matter of when, not if.

Despite the volatility and recent slumping price, many experts still say BTC is on its way to passing the $100,000 mark, though with varying opinions on exactly when that will happen. And a recent study by Deutsche Bank found that about a quarter of Bitcoin investors believe Bitcoin prices will be over $110,000 in five years.

      <title>1031: HERE’S THE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR BITCOIN AND CRYPTO MARKETS, ACCORDING TO TOP ANALYST!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/xDAquT0vLvo</link>
      <description>Analyst Benjamin Cowen is detailing a potential worst case scenario for Bitcoin and the crypto markets at large.

If this bearish cryptocurrency market structure plays out, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies would finally reach a bottom at around the $500 billion mark, which suggest a Bitcoin price bottom of about $10,000 per BTC.

“This is something to consider. It’s the worst case scenario. I have no idea if it’s going to play out or not, but it’s something that everyone I think should consider when navigating the cryptoverse."

      <title>1030: BITCOIN WILL RALLY TO $200K BUT FIRST CRASH TO $10K PREDICTS TOP CRYPTO ANALYST!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/WTo7mfF6qdc</link>
      <description>A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin could follow in the historical footsteps of gold and spark a massive 6-figure rally but notes that the king cryptocurrency (BTC) has further to fall first.

“We could start to see an asset trade very similar to gold. I’m going to make the case today about how Bitcoin could very well be that asset, especially after going through a steady decline of 75% or so far, and will likely go through a decline of around 80 to 85% at bare minimum…

After that, we can have really green pastures for Bitcoin, starting [to] charter into that six-digit territory that many people have talked about since the previous bull market, towards $100,000, $200,000, you name it, as people start to lose faith in the base currency, the dollar being the world reserve currency.”

      <title>1029: Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary Says Bitcoin Won’t Break $25K Until One Major Thing Happens!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/CYpTi7PNMzw</link>
      <description>Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary is casting doubt on the ability of Bitcoin to rally above the $25,000 price level under the prevailing conditions.

O’Leary says in a Stansberry Research interview that the BTC price is stagnating because the lack of cryptocurrency regulation is hindering institutional investment in the space.

"I’m going to predict that crypto and particularly Bitcoin will be locked between $20,000 and $25,000 until we get policy. It’s not going to go anywhere because there’s not enough buyers. You need to tap trillions of dollars being managed by sovereign wealth, and they are not going to buy Bitcoin until there’s regulation.”

      <title>1027: Bitcoin Is Going to $1 Million Best Case, Says Macro Guru Raoul Pal - Here’s When!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/nA-JMG0HDlA</link>
      <description>Crypto bull and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says that Bitcoin can still erupt en route to outperforming other asset classes in the next 10 years even in his worst-case scenario.

"I rode it up $1,000, so it went up 5x in two months, then went all the way back down 85%. I just held it because I wanted to treat it like an option. I had a 10-year view.

I said it’s probably going to $100,000 worst case, $1 million best case over the next 10 to 20 years.”

      <title>1026: Arcane Research Predicts $2 Million Bitcoin With BTC Mining Cost Less Than 0.5% of Global Energy!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/us9netNhdRM</link>
      <description>Bitcoin, the world’s most-valued cryptocurrency, has the potential to be a significant energy consumer in the future, but only if it reaches several million dollars per coin, according to new estimates by Arcane Research.

Crypto research and analytics firm Arcane Research on Monday released a report estimating the development in Bitcoin’s energy usage toward 2040.

If the BTC price hits $2 million in 17 years, Bitcoin may consume 894 Terawatt-hours (TWh) per year, surging 10 times from today’s level, the report suggests. Despite huge growth, such energy consumption would only account for 0.36% of the estimated global energy consumption in 2040, increasing from Bitcoin’s 0.05% share today, the analyst estimated.

      <title>1025: Bitcoin Can Burst to $2.1 Million Amid Largest Wealth Accumulation in History: Macro Guru!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/cjYRRpMEo_c</link>
      <description>Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal says an explosion of the crypto market cap by 200x in the next decade is within the realm of possibility, with a potential Bitcoin target price of $2,100,000 per BTC.

“What I do know is if I just extrapolate the network adoption effects, the number of users, and where the number of users is going and assume it gets to somewhere between four and five billion in the next 10 years or so – which would be central bank digital currencies enabling it, all ticketing, a whole bunch of stuff going that way – the market cap of the space goes from $1 trillion to $200 trillion…

People don’t realize the world has never seen an accumulation of wealth like that in history. This would be the shortest period of time of the largest accumulation of wealth ever seen.”

      <title>1023: Top Strategist at $1.3 Billion Crypto Fund Says Bitcoin Can Explode 2,273% - Here’s When!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/05gLoG9rIb4</link>
      <description>The chief investment officer of crypto asset manager Bitwise Investments is unveiling his massive price target for Bitcoin despite the ongoing bear market.

In a new Stansberry Research interview, Bitwise executive Matt Hougan says that Bitcoin could rally by over 2,273% from its current price of $21,062 as he believes BTC will come close to gold’s market capitalization of more than $11 trillion.

“I think it’s perfectly rational to believe that Bitcoin could trade to half a million dollars over time. The way I picked that number out of the hat is if Bitcoin held as much wealth as is held in gold, it would be about half a million dollars a Bitcoin.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/t0UiDfWPcvE</link>
      <description>The chief executive of crypto exchange Kraken says that he’s still very bullish on Bitcoin and that its improving fundamentals make it hard to bet against BTC.

In a new interview with Bloomberg Markets and Finance, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell says that he bought more Bitcoin when it was around $18,000, and hopes it will continue to climb even higher.

“I wasn’t expecting all this craziness in the macro environment, however, I’m still hopeful that I’ll be able to buy a Bugatti by the end of the year for one Bitcoin…

I’m still very bullish, I bought Bitcoin again at $18,000, so I’m happy to ride it all the way back up. I’m still very bullish in the long run, [its] fundamentals keep improving, so I would never bet against Bitcoin.”

      <title>1020: Billionaire Investor Predicts $400K Bitcoin Should Be 'Easy' to Achieve!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/xgo68sh5x-w</link>
      <description>Mark Yusko is the billionaire investor and Founder of Morgan Creek Capital. His prediction for Bitcoin is that it’ll be worth over $400,000 in the long term, a statement that made headlines in crypto because for its grandiose scale.

“It’s just math. It is gold equivalent…there are about 20 million BTC available today. Gold today is about $8 trillion. That gives you $400,000. And that doesn’t include use cases that relate to currency,” Yusko said.

He also pointed out that the leading cryptocurrency is striking fear into the hearts of bankers, precisely because Bitcoin eliminates the need for banks. When transactions are verified on a Blockchain, banks become obsolete.

      <title>1018: Coinbase Highlights Bitcoin Lightning Network’s Potential Disruption of the $150B Payments Industry!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/w5-1Bg0ZDBU</link>
      <description>Crypto exchange Coinbase says that the Bitcoin Lightning Network has the potential to disrupt the massive $150 billion payments industry.

Lightning Network is a layer-2 scaling solution built on top of Bitcoin that aims to enable instant and cost-effective transactions for BTC.

“Humble beginnings aside, the potential to turn crypto’s most valuable asset into a true medium of exchange has the power to bring greater financial inclusion to anyone with a smartphone. The ability to cost-effectively route fiat transactions over Lightning rails without users ever knowing they’re using Bitcoin can disrupt $150B+ a year industries.

What Visa/Mastercard is for fiat currencies, Lightning can be for Bitcoin. The combination of a universally accessible payment network atop the world’s first open-source protocol for money can help Bitcoin evolve into a true global reserve currency.”

      <title>1016: Top Crypto Analyst Details Bullish Scenario That Can Send Bitcoin Surging by Nearly 50%!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/-axZCwc0hkE</link>
      <description>A top crypto trader and analyst is revealing how the king crypto (Bitcoin) could soar by nearly 50% to $38,000 per coin.

Bennett says that after breaking above $26,500, BTC will have to overcome the $30,000 level in order to appreciate by about 46% from the current price and hit the next target of $38,000.

”So if we can see Bitcoin reclaim those two levels that I mentioned and start to move higher over the coming days, then here are the two key areas I’m watching over the coming weeks.

Now, the first one comes in right around $30,000, and that’s because of the consolidation that we saw back in May… so $30,000 area is going to be a huge area for Bitcoin. Above that, we do have the confluence of resistance up around $38,000…"

      <title>1015: BlackRock’s Entry Into Bitcoin Could Shoot Its Price to $773K Pretty Easily, Says Crypto Analyst!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/bL1MUaGphJQ</link>
      <description>According to a popular crypto analyst, a partnership between two financial giants could trigger growth in Bitcoin value to about $773,000. Here is an analysis of how that could happen.

He believes that if BlackRock invests 0.5% of its assets into BTC and uses my multiplier of 21x, then it will increase the market cap by $1.05 trillion, which will mean that Bitcoin will gain $75,000 in value, taking it to $98,000. From today’s price, the ROI (return on investment) would be 326%. The possibility of achieving this goal is very, very real.

There has been a lot of talk about adding 5%, and that is what Dan Tapiero says, and he believes that is much too aggressive. There is a possibility, perhaps over a period of time, maybe within three or five years, that this might become a reality. It is very likely that Bitcoin’s price will reach $773,000 in the next three to five years pretty easily.

      <title>1014: Bitcoin Prepping For Parabolic Move to $100K As Altcoin Season Peaks, Says Top Crypto Analyst!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/cePFyrwQE-Y</link>
      <description>A popular crypto analyst is impressed by how well altcoins are performing against Bitcoin but still believes the king crypto (BTC) can reach new all-time highs surpassing $100,000 in the near future.

The anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 443,000 YouTube subscribers that while 94% of altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin on the BTC Dominance chart, he believes they’re peaking and BTC is primed to rise again.

“When 75% of the top 50 coins perform better than Bitcoin over the last 90 days, it becomes altcoin season and we are way above 75%, so that is pretty staggering.

Pretty impressive, but whatever goes up comes down, so expect Bitcoin Dominance to be on the rise again soon. We’re already seeing that happen right now as we speak… so expect everything to be choppy as we go forward.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/z-o937d2dh8</link>
      <description>ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood thinks BlackRock’s entry into the crypto space could have huge implications for the Bitcoin price action.

"Last week, US-based cryptocurrency giant Coinbase announced that it teamed up with BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world, to bring crypto trading to wealthy clients.

Blackrock’s decision to partner with Coinbase is a strong signal that institutions consider bitcoin. Based on ARK’s simulated portfolio allocations, institutional allocations between 2.5% and 6.5% could impact bitcoin’s price by $200,000 - $500,000"

      <title>1012: Bitcoin Set To Peak At $937K, According to Top Crypto Exchange - Here’s When!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/MFGqZzn2018</link>
      <description>According to crypto exchange Changelly, the Bitcoin price might peak at around $937k in 2030, with the king cryptocurrency (BTC) trading at an average price of $798k per coin.

What drives these predictions? Well, a couple of reasons. For starters, most are optimistic about the value of Bitcoin's scarcity coming into play. Secondly, maximalists envision a future where demand for Bitcoin is endless. Finally, with Bitcoin adoption rising by 113% annually, many believe the same will one day be highlighted by BTC’s price.

      <title>1011: BlackRock and Coinbase Deal Could Trigger Bitcoin Burst to $773K, According to Top Crypto Analyst!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/D69xUvyK9Ss</link>
      <description>A popular crypto analyst is breaking down how the partnership between two financial giants could trigger a Bitcoin explosion to $773,000.

Last week, US-based crypto titan Coinbase announced that it teamed up with BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world, to bring cryptocurrency trading to wealthy clients.

In a new strategy session, the host of InvestAnswers tells his 443,000 YouTube subscribers that the partnership could boost Bitcoin’s market cap by a trillion dollars at the very least.

"If they add 5%, which is what Dan Tapiero says, I think it’s way too aggressive. Maybe over time, maybe in the next three to five years, that could be possible. That would take the price of Bitcoin to $773,000 in the next three to five years pretty easily.”

      <title>1010: COULD APPLE JOIN FORCES WITH BITCOIN?! THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LEAP IN BTC ADOPTION!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/qNrHOCiLiHA</link>
      <description>Why an integration with Bitcoin could be next for the personal finance ecosystem of tech giant Apple and what it would look like. And more importantly, what would it mean for the future of the king crypto (BTC)?

Let's say Apple took this next step and integrated with Bitcoin; it would be the most significant leap in adoption that the original cryptocurrency has ever received. Despite already integrating with other popular financial apps like Venmo and CashApp, a Bitcoin integration with Apple would immediately onboard the more than one billion iPhone users to the Bitcoin blockchain.

If Bitcoin were to gain that kind of exposure, it would further bolster its role in our increasingly digital world. Of course, most of this thinking is entirely speculative, but it's a valuable analysis. Current trends signal that in order to remain competitive, Apple (and many other tech companies) will have to find new ways to make BTC more accessible or risk falling behind.

        <![CDATA[<p>Why an integration with Bitcoin could be next for the personal finance ecosystem of tech giant Apple and what it would look like. And more importantly, what would it mean for the future of the king crypto (BTC)?</p><p><br></p><p>Let's say Apple took this next step and integrated with Bitcoin; it would be the most significant leap in adoption that the original cryptocurrency has ever received. Despite already integrating with other popular financial apps like Venmo and CashApp, a Bitcoin integration with Apple would immediately onboard the more than one billion iPhone users to the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p>If Bitcoin were to gain that kind of exposure, it would further bolster its role in our increasingly digital world. Of course, most of this thinking is entirely speculative, but it's a valuable analysis. Current trends signal that in order to remain competitive, Apple (and many other tech companies) will have to find new ways to make BTC more accessible or risk falling behind.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <link>https://youtu.be/28ue0Tbu-nw</link>
      <description>MicroStrategy founder and Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor is stepping down as CEO of the firm as the business software company reports incurring a $917.8 million BTC loss during the second quarter of the year.

Saylor says that his new position as the company’s chairman will allow him to focus more on being an advocate for the king crypto (Bitcoin).

“I have emerged as an important advocate and spokesperson for the Bitcoin community on a worldwide basis. This will allow me to take the role of executive chairman where I can be a more enthusiastic advocate for Bitcoin while Phong and Andrew manage the corporate operations, execute on the MicroStrategy ongoing business strategy.”

      <title>1007: HEDGE FUND CEO ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI SAYS BITCOIN ALREADY BOTTOMED AND HAS $40K FAIR MARKET VALUE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/N_nG4m3EEEw</link>
      <description>SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci says that Bitcoin is way below its actual fair value by 70%, and that the bottom is likely already in for the king crypto.

In a new interview with MarketWatch, the veteran hedge fund manager says his firm’s metrics put the current Bitcoin value at roughly $40,000 per coin.

“We believe that the leverage has been blown out of the system. I don’t think it’s going below the low that was reached for this cycle, which would be at around $17,500.

According to our fair market value metrics based on adoption, wallet size, use cases, growth of wallets, we think the fair market value for bitcoin right now is about $40,000.”

      <title>1006: STABLECOIN PATTERN SUGGEST MASSIVE BITCOIN BREAKOUT INCOMING, SAYS TOP CRYPTO ANALYTICS FIRM!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/r7KkYfGfxOs</link>
      <description>Crypto analytics firm Santiment says that the dwindling supply of stablecoins may be a sign that a massive Bitcoin breakout is on the horizon.

According to the market intelligence firm, the circulating supply of Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), the two biggest cryptocurrency stablecoins by market cap, has been dramatically decreasing since May 2022.

Santiment says that the volume of these two assets continues to decline even as the price of Bitcoin rises, which in the past has foreshadowed parabolic BTC rallies, specifically in July 2021 right before the king crypto went from the $29,000 level all the way to $69,000.

      <link>https://youtu.be/DAgNupFROu4</link>
      <description>A closely followed crypto analyst known for calling the May 2021 collapse in Bitcoin says that an indicator with a solid track record is suggesting rallies are approaching.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Dave the Wave tells his 122,000 Twitter followers that the BTC moving average convergence divergence (MACD) just flashed a signal that previously foreshadowed a 300% rally in Bitcoin in 2019.

“Last time the Bitcoin weekly MACD crossed, after an extended correction to current levels, it went on a ripper.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/qjyLLre8650</link>
      <description>Bitcoin is at the bottom &amp; the next crypto bull cycle will begin November 2023, according to top crypto analyst Trader_Jibon.

“Local Bottom is Very Close. We might see big rally around 40K. Then BTC can dump to 25-20K before the Bull Run Starts.”

Another view the top cryptocurrency analyst shared:

“BTC will Confirm the Bottom in September-October 2022. I'm not expecting a Big Crash. But I don't expect Bull Market before 2024. We might see Sideway Market until 2024. Then Bull Market 2024-25.”

      <title>1002: HERE’S HOW BITCOIN CAN REACH $10,000,000 PER BTC, ACCORDING TO TOP CRYPTO RESEARCHER!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/gm_IGBIcCG4</link>
      <description>The crypto world is abuzz after a Bitcoin chart predicting an astronomical BTC price made the rounds on social media, suggesting a full 99.7% of Bitcoin’s total wealth gener­a­tion remains ahead, ultimately meaning Bitcoin still has 400x to grow, dwarfing the gold milestone.

By putting Bitcoin’s current valua­tion into perspec­tive, it becomes clear that it’s still very early for Bitcoin. 

"Bitcoin has the potential to become worth over $10 million a coin."

      <title>1001: CRYPTO’S RICHEST MOGUL DETAILS WHAT WILL TRIGGER NEXT MASSIVE BITCOIN MOVE!! $10M BTC INEVITABLE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/8oyYsJHggeg</link>
      <description>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao says there is a myriad of factors potentially driving the next big rally for Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets.

In a new interview on CNBC, the richest person in crypto says different catalysts triggered the previous cryptocurrency bull runs and people were not even aware that these would set off massive moves.

Quoting Bitcoin advocate Dennis Porter: "At the end of the day, all fiats eventually come to an end which means in theory there is no cap on Bitcoin’s dollar price. Once you understand this you realize $1 million and even $10 million are inevitable."

      <link>https://youtu.be/de0SSXgMvYg</link>
      <description>As the Bitcoin and crypto market continues breaking out after news of the recent Fed rate hike, Shark Tank billionaire investor Mark Cuban is deeply concerned about how the impending wave of regulation will affect the cryptocurrency space.

“Think this is bad? Wait till you see what they come up with for registration of tokens. That’s the nightmare that’s waiting for the crypto industry.

How else do you keep thousands of lawyers employed and create reasons to ask for more taxpayer money?”

      <title>997: BITCOIN PROJECTED TO HIT $446,000 BY MAY, 2025 BASED ON PREVIOUS BTC HALVING CYCLES!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/ODxjhIR_ynU</link>
      <description>Based on previous Bitcoin halving cycles, the king crypto (BTC) has surged by an average of 3,158% in the one year after each halving event. By removing the 2012 anomaly, the average increase is 412.5%.

Using the extrapolation from January 2017 to an extrapolated May 2024 projected Bitcoin price of $108,000 and incorporating a 1-year price increase of 413% between May 2024 and May 2025, BTC could hit $446,000.

Incorporating the estimated 413% increase between May 2028 and May 2029, BTC would be on target to hit $2.08 million by May 2029, giving BTC a January 2030 value of $2.11 million.

      <title>995: BILLIONAIRE SAYS BITCOIN CAN GO TO $1M, EVERYBODY SHOULD OWN SOME - ISSUES GLOBAL ECONOMIC WARNING!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/hGaPX7oaLaY</link>
      <description>Virgin Galactic Chairman and Billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya who predicted Bitcoin hitting $1,000,000 per BTC is warning that the global economy appears on track to witness two phases of recession.

In a recent interview on the All-In Podcast, the Crypto O.G. says the world is currently experiencing a supply-side recession, which he notes is the first part of the process.

“We have been in a supply-side recession. That is what has caused inflation.

We have to go through a process of taking all the excess money, that’s been put in, out. And when you do that, we will destroy demand and then that’ll trigger a demand-side recession… and we will destroy asset values…

I think we’re still firmly in that first phase, and I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the reason why I still think we’re in the first part of this process is because people, broadly speaking, still have a lot of savings because of all the stimulus checks. There is still a lot of money.”

We have to go through a process of taking all the excess money, that’s been put in, out. And when you do that, we will destroy demand and then that’ll trigger a demand-side recession… and we will destroy asset values…

I think we’re still firmly in that first phase, and I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the reason why I still think we’re in the first part of this process is because people, broadly speaking, still have a lot of savings because of all the stimulus checks. There is still a lot of money.”

      <title>994: CRYPTO EXPERTS SAY BITCOIN WILL HIT $100K IN 2022 - HERE’S WHAT BTC INVESTORS SHOULD KNOW!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/rWSJqxdrLQM</link>
      <description>It’s been a rocky start to the year for Bitcoin, but experts still say it will hit $100,000 — and that it’s more a matter of when, not if.

The most extreme crypto skeptics say Bitcoin will tank to as low as $10,000 in 2022, but a middle ground might be to say the cryptocurrency can still climb to $100,000 like many experts predicted late last year - just on a slower timeline.

“What I expect from Bitcoin is volatility [in the] short-term and growth [in the] long-term,” says Kiana Danial, founder of Invest Diva and author of “Cryptocurrency Investing For Dummies.”

      <title>993: BITCOIN ON TRACK TO HIT $120K IN 2023, SAYS TOP CRYPTO TRADER AFTER $930M TESLA BTC SALE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/xT4knM9euiM</link>
      <description>Zooming out, one Bitcoin price indicator led top crypto analyst TechDev to believe that BTC/USD would see a new all-time high before its next block subsidy halving in 2024.

TechDev flagged the True Strength Index (TSI) for Bitcoin, a metric that uses several base calculations to determine how overbought or oversold the asset is at a particular price.

"As such, I expect:
- Intermediate wave 5 top at 80-120K in 2023
- Primary wave 4 down to 30-50K in 2024
- Primary wave 5 over 200K in 2025 to conclude cycle wave 3"

      <title>992: BILLIONAIRE MIKE NOVOGRATZ INSISTS BITCOIN STILL ON TRACK TO HIT $500K - HERE’S WHEN!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/KLotPdPvtnk</link>
      <description>Bitcoin is still on track to hit $500,000 over the next five years, according to billionaire crypto investor Mike Novogratz. He also admitted he was “wrong” about the extent of the leverage in the industry.

Novogratz, the founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, told Bloomberg at a summit on July 19 that demand for the cryptocurrency would be driven by higher rates of adoption and global economics.

“It’s not like diving with two feet right now because institutions are a little bit more cautious. But once we get balance, once we get equilibrium and start a new narrative they’ll come back. When I look at the global landscape, I just don’t see how fiscal prudence gets put back into a box.”

      <title>991: KRAKEN ANALYST OUTLINE POTENTIAL BITCOIN SURGE TO STAGGERING HIGH OF $322,478!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Lus3KVkkgP8</link>
      <description>A new report from Kraken Intelligence uses the Bitcoin 200-week moving average as a crystal ball, to project the future price of the king crypto.

Specifically, Kraken looks at the multiples that BTC has traded at relative to its 200-week moving average in the past.

If Bitcoin once again climbs to a 10x to 15x multiple of its 200-week moving average, which Kraken analysts say is in the historical range, this would imply a future price range of $214,985 to $322,478.

      <title>990: TOP CRYPTO ANALYST FORECAST HUGE BITCOIN RALLY, DETAILS ‘MOST LIKELY’ SCENARIO IN COMING MONTHS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/RJFQvdV3ccQ</link>
      <description>A popular crypto strategist is predicting a surge in price for Bitcoin as he maps out BTC’s possible trading range over the next few months.

Pseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 527,900 Twitter followers that a strong Bitcoin rally is imminent.

Kaleo’s chart predicts a huge Bitcoin bounce to around $28,000 in the short term prior to another leg down below $20,000, which would then be followed by a grind up to $30,000.

“I still believe the most likely outcome is a range between $20,000 [and] $30,000 through at least the next several months, so while a bounce from here might take us to around $30,000, I don’t see it as anything to get over-excited about quite yet.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/XMmXF0sIJE0</link>
      <description>A popular crypto analyst is anticipating a major relief rally for Bitcoin (BTC) amid uncertainties in the cryptocurrency markets.

In a new strategy session, Nicholas Merten tells his 515,000 YouTube subscribers that more people are now willing to buy Bitcoin as sellers of the flagship digital asset have been forced out of the market.

“We do believe that an extended bear market could still play out. We [also] do believe in the reality that there is likely going to be a relief rally in the market like there has been in the past, and it simply has to do with the fact that a lot of sellers have been forced out of the market."

      <title>988: BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR REMAINS BITCOIN HODL’ER, SAYS WILL BUY BTC IF PRICE HITS THIS TARGET LEVEL!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/4lVak0rkpgM</link>
      <description>Billionaire investor Thomas Peterffy – Founder and Chairman of Interactive Brokers – believes the American authorities might ban crypto amid concerns that they facilitate illegal activities. Nonetheless, the billionaire remains a HODLer, vowing to purchase more Bitcoin (BTC) if its price drops to $12,000.

“I believe inflationary pressures will continue for years, not months. This is not a short-term issue.

Even I myself have put a little bit of money into crypto, because even though chances are, I think, that this is not going to be a viable market, I think that there’s a small chance that this will be a dominant currency, so you have to play the odds.”

“I believe inflationary pressures will continue for years, not months. This is not a short-term issue.

Even I myself have put a little bit of money into crypto, because even though chances are, I think, that this is not going to be a viable market, I think that there’s a small chance that this will be a dominant currency, so you have to play the odds.”

      <title>985: MAJORITY OF WALL STREET INVESTORS EXPECT BITCOIN TO PLUNGE TO THIS NEW LOW!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/IaD-AibulzI</link>
      <description>A new study finds that many Wall Street investors believe Bitcoin hasn’t bottomed out and will fall to nearly half its current value.

A new Bloomberg MLIV Pulse survey says it asked 950 Wall Street investors whether they expected the king crypto (BTC) to first recapture the $30,000 level or fall to $10,000, with 60% saying they agreed with the bearish scenario.

The poll ran from July 5th to 8th, during which time Bitcoin ranged from a low of $19,420 up to as high as $22,109. At Bitcoin’s current price of $19,883, the leading crypto asset by market cap would have to drop by 49.7% to be priced at $10,000.

      <title>984: MEGA MACRO ‘DOOM LOOP’ UPSIDE: ARTHUR HAYES REITERATES $1 MILLION BITCOIN PRICE PREDICTION!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/-_mXTxe4jew</link>
      <description>Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has doubled down on his uber-bullish Bitcoin price prediction, claiming that the price of the world’s largest crypto (BTC) will eventually hit a whopping $1 million per coin.

Hayes recently predicted that the price of Bitcoin would touch $1 million by 2030. He believes that Bitcoin would be able to reach that milestone because of the “HODL culture.” Users with a high level of conviction will not sell their holdings since they anticipate significant price appreciation in the future.

"The DoomLoop has begun. 1 USD = 1 EUR. Prepare yourselves for YCC and $BTC = $1 million. But please be patient, these things take time."

      <link>https://youtu.be/NeEC-edCZSY</link>
      <description>A closely tracked crypto strategist who continues to build his following with timely Bitcoin predictions says the king crypto asset (BTC) could be gearing up for a significant rally.

Cryptocurrency analyst Kevin Svenson tells his 110,200 Twitter followers that he’s looking at Bitcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator on the three-day chart which suggests that Bitcoin is likely setting up for a sustained bounce.

“Bitcoin three-day MACD cross will likely lead to continuation up. The three-day candle closes tonight. We’re very likely going to confirm the cross soon.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/SmcF2F7tbXg</link>
      <description>Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary says he’s expecting to witness a massive Bitcoin capitulation event that will trigger fear and panic among crypto investors.

“I like a big, big panic event. That’s always been a great way to bottom. It’s towel throwing. It’s capitulation. It’s massive volume. It’s total panic in the streets and always a great buying opportunity.

I have no idea who’s next. Could be tomorrow morning, could be a month from now, but it’s coming to a theater near you, and it will definitely be a very good thing for this industry. It’ll be a great thing because it’ll take out all of the bad broken business models, the heavy leveraged [and] the speculation that was too risky.”

      <title>981: TOP CRYPTO TRADER SAYS MASSIVE UNEXPECTED BITCOIN RALLY TO TAKE PLACE THIS YEAR - HERE’S HIS TARGET!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/m7sGxssNY7o</link>
      <description>One crypto analyst maintains a contrarian bullish stance on Bitcoin for the rest of the year despite a dramatic drop from all-time highs.

The closely followed cryptocurrency analyst Credible Crypto tells his 336,000 Twitter followers he foresees BTC hitting all-time highs (ATHs) in the next six months before the real bear market begins.

“Still expecting a new ATH and six-figure BTC by 2023 and believe we are likely back on our way down in 2024-2025 and in the depths of a bigger bear market than most have ever seen at that point.”

      <title>980: BITCOIN SET TO EXPLODE BY OVER 400% AND HIT 6-FIGURES, SAYS TOP CRYPTO TRADER - HERE’S THE TIMELINE!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/S84d1serbEo</link>
      <description>Popular crypto strategist and trader Kaleo says Bitcoin will hit a new all-time high of at least $110,000 months after the next BTC halving.

“Late 2024 / early 2025 we finally see a new Bitcoin all-time high and six-figure BTC.

I want to clarify – I think BTC *does* go higher than what this chart shows (~$110,000), but even if that’s all we see… that’s still a 5x+ from current prices in less than two and a half years. That’s not bad at all. Might even be just enough to outpace inflation.”

      <title>979: BITCOIN FLASHING MULTIPLE BOTTOM SIGNALS AFTER MASSIVE CRYPTO SYSTEMIC SHOCK, SAYS ARK INVEST!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/wXqMH3mp0Eg</link>
      <description>Bitcoin is flashing multiple bottom symbols, according to Yassine Elmandjra, an analyst at ARK Investment Management.

Elmandjra notes the king crypto (BTC) is trading below its 200-week moving average (MA) short and long-term cost bases.

It’s only the fourth time that’s happened in Bitcoin’s price history, according to the analyst.

“As stakeholders with the most skin in the game, miner capitulation is a key bottom marker. The Puell Multiple, a measurement that compares daily miner revenue to its yearly average, is at a 3-year low.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/VHCOgtE2XAU</link>
      <description>One crypto analyst is comparing Bitcoin’s price action to one traditional stock to predict what’s next for BTC after a rocky last two months.

“Short and succinct, not financial advice, of course, everything mean reverts unless it’s a piece of crap or it’s broken.

Tesla has held up well during the correction and recession incredibly well. While I believe Tesla will hit $1,200 in the next six to 12 months, which is slightly less than double, I also believe Bitcoin could potentially triple in the same timeframe. Six to 12 months, which takes out to summer 2023 and that’s very, very conservative."

      <link>https://youtu.be/T0Y2jEvbGyg</link>
      <description>Seasoned crypto investor Tone Vays says that Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of another breakdown which could send the price of the leading cryptocurrency asset to a new 2022 low.

In a new strategy session, Vays tells his 121,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin’s outlook remains bleak as BTC tries to “desperately” cling to the $19,000 level.

Looking at Vays’ chart, a break of Bitcoin’s immediate support could drive BTC to his target at around $14,500.

Pseudonymous analyst Capo tells his 425,900 Twitter followers that the top crypto asset by market cap’s inability to stay above the key psychological price area of $20,000 suggests that another sell-off event is imminent.

“BTC: more accurate projected roadmap for the potential local bottom formation around $16,000.”

      <description>CNBC analyst Brian Kelly believes Bitcoin (BTC) still possesses more downside potential even as it trades at over 70% off its all-time high.

On CNBC’s Fast Money, Kelly says the flagship crypto could still fall nearly 50% from current levels as the macro environment worsens.

“The good news is that I do think we are getting a lot closer to a generational bottom. The bad news is that it might not be until Bitcoin hits $10,000.”

      <description>On-chain insights platform CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says crypto investors did not leave the market despite this year’s downturn.

According to Ju, the current dip that sent Bitcoin (BTC) plunging below $20,000 from an all-time high of nearly $70,000 can be considered the crypto market’s first recession.

“Stablecoins sitting in exchanges are now worth half of Bitcoin reserve. We have $25 billion loaded bullets which can make crypto asset prices go up. The question is when, not how.”

      <title>973: CRYPTO ANALYST PREDICTS BITCOIN BOTTOM SCENARIO AND REVEALS BIG DOWNSIDE TARGET FOR ETHEREUM!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/lVNPLjQoBmg</link>
      <description>A popular crypto analyst is digging into the charts to set low-end price targets for Bitcoin and Ethereum, the 2 largest cryptocurrency assets by market cap.

The analyst remains cautious about predicting a BTC bear cycle bottom, noting two previous instances that were punctuated by dramatic volatility downward.

“I’m not saying this is necessarily the bottom. Usually for absolute bottoms to form, you want to see some sort of nasty capitulation wick. Back in 2018, that was obviously the $6,000 level where price fell through [from] $6,000 to $3,000.

Regarding his Ethereum bottom target:

“This area remains a high-demand zone area and if we fall out here, $600 is probably the next area up.”

The analyst remains cautious about predicting a BTC bear cycle bottom, noting two previous instances that were punctuated by dramatic volatility downward.

      <title>972: CRYPTO INFLUENCER ADAM BACK SAYS BITCOIN CAN STILL HIT $100K THIS YEAR AS THE DEFI SECOR CRUMBLES!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/pVvWSLSdgBI</link>
      <description>Crypto influencer Adam Back, inventor of Hashcoin (which is used in Bitcoin mining) and CEO of Blockstream, shared his thoughts on Bitcoin recently.

Responding to a Tweet claiming that Bitcoin would still hit six figures during the next market cycle, Back said that he believes Bitcoin could actually hit $100,000 this year as the DeFi sector crumbles.

Despite the cryptocurrency market being down significantly from previous highs, Adam Back remains bullish. In the midst of widespread fear and 40-year record inflation levels, Adam Back reiterated a statement from last year in which he claimed Bitcoin ($BTC) would hit $100,000 by year-end. Of course, we now know Back missed his mark on the previous forecast but BTC did briefly surge to almost $70,000 during November.

      <title>971: BITCOIN COULD REACH $72,000 THIS WEEK ACCORDING TO S2F MODEL, BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/37gDmB-1zdo</link>
      <description>The notorious stock-to-flow model that was perfectly predicting the direction of Bitcoin's movement until the massive correction we saw in May and June suggests that the king crypto (BTC) will reach $72,000 this week, but it is unlikely to happen.

Previously, a Fidelity analyst explained why S2F is no longer accurate and will not be in the future. S2F's main source of prediction is the scarcity of the asset, which cannot drive the Bitcoin price alone, especially in modern markets.

With Bitcoin, we should add adoption to scarcity to see better results. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to accurately calculate the technology's adoption rate in the future even if we compare it to similar technologies like mobile devices or the internet.

      <title>970: FORMER CRYPTO BILLIONAIRE INSIST BITCOIN WILL SOAR TO $250K WITHIN NEXT 18 MONTHS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/OtCZ4x72qhg</link>
      <description>Venture capitalist Tim Draper thinks Bitcoin is going to go up more than 10-fold by the end of 2023. He isn’t the only crypto mogul whistling in the dark.

During an interview with Forbes in January this year, Tim Draper offered an ambitious prediction: Bitcoin would hit a whopping $250,000 within a year. At the time, BTC was worth about $41,000.

“This is the year it's gonna happen,” insisted Draper, who paid $18.7 million at a U.S. Marshals Service auction in 2014 for his stash of around 30,000 bitcoins (yes, that’s $623 per Bitcoin). “By the end of this year—or early next year.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/sjY13mb06PE</link>
      <description>The closely tracked crypto strategist who accurately called the Bitcoin May 2021 crash says he could see BTC rising exponentially in the coming years.

Dave the Wave tells his 118,000 Twitter followers that based on his logarithmic growth curve (LGC) model, Bitcoin could potentially witness an increase of over 1,100% over the next four years.

“Who’s to say we don’t get something like this? The main idea at play in this chart is the multi-year trendline, cutting through the LGC, functions as a *mean* of price.”

Pseudonymous crypto strategist Rekt Capital tells his 319,000 Twitter followers that Bitcoin will likely continue to struggle until its buy-side volume starts to go up.

“[Bitcoin’s] buy-side volume is below average so until that changes, chances for upside are also below average.”

      <description>Mobius Capital Partners co-founder Mark Mobius says leading crypto Bitcoin (BTC) has not reached its bottom yet after a prolonged downtrend.

“[As long as traders] are still talking about buying on dips that means there is a feeling of hope. That also means that we have not reached the bottom of a bear market.”

In May, Mobius predicted Bitcoin would eventually reach the $20,000 mark before slightly bouncing and continuing to decline all the way down to $10,000.

      <title>965: TOP CRYPTO STRATEGIST DETAILS BULLISH SCENARIO FOR BITCOIN AS BTC PRICE SURGES!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/8Bnj1PkLPUs</link>
      <description>A closely tracked crypto analyst is mapping out a potential scenario for Bitcoin (BTC) to trap bears and rally above $30,000 per BTC.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cred says that while Bitcoin still looks bearish, he sees a setup where the king cryptocurrency (BTC_ ignites a “meaningful” rally.

"What would the target for that be? I think to some extent it would require retracing much of the selling that took us here – a lot of this one-sided inefficient price action. On the weekly timeframe, my eye is drawn towards as far as it may seem at least the previous range low, broken support, turned resistance at $32,000.”

      <title>964: ANALYST WHO NAILED 2022 BITCOIN CRASH UPDATES BTC FORECAST, ISSUES FRESH ALERT FOR CRYPTO TRADERS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Qe0TzeYkkD8</link>
      <description>A popular crypto strategist who has accurately sounded the alarm on crashing crypto prices this year is now updating his forecast for the top two digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

The pseudonymous crypto trader known as Capo says that the king cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) has been experiencing a pattern of support/resistance flips, where the previous support low becomes the next ceiling of resistance.

He tells his 392,900 Twitter followers that investors repeatedly fool themselves into believing that a brief relief rally means that BTC has reached a cycle bottom.

      <title>963: BITCOIN WILL WHIPSAW TRADERS TO $100,000 THIS YEAR, SAYS BLOCKSTREAM CEO - HERE’S HOW!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/e8FZNAGwyyQ</link>
      <description>The chief executive officer of blockchain technology company Blockstream, Adam Back, says that the leading crypto asset Bitcoin could see a 5x increase in price by the end of the year hitting $100K per BTC.

“Everyone has their pet macro-views. My guess: stock market + US election season, moral hazard kicks up, quantitative easing ramps up again, rates drop again, money printer goes into overdrive. So the interest rate overhang falls off, and BTC decorrelates somewhere along the way once DeFi (decentralized finance) flushed.

My permabull case for BTC/USD [is] $100,000 this year. Plus a US physical Bitcoin ETF chaser (GBTC upgrade + other) would create a nice whipsaw and probably trigger a big uncoupling and positive reflexivity into a blow off top next year.”

      <title>962: BILLIONAIRE CEO OF $122 BILLION ASSET MANAGER PREDICTS MASSIVE BITCOIN CRASH!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/HIfXjqELCBs</link>
      <description>Billionaire “Bond King” Jeffrey Gundlach believes Bitcoin will plummet further to $10,000 per BTC despite having already fallen by about 70% from its all-time high.

In a new CNBC interview, the CEO of asset management firm DoubleLine Capital says he wouldn’t be “surprised at all” if the flagship crypto asset fell by more than 50% from the current levels to around $10,000.

“The trend in crypto is clearly not positive. I mean it topped out a long time ago. Remember, I was with you in July of last year, and Bitcoin was up at like $60,000 or something. And then it dropped down to $30,000…

It managed to rally back but it looks like it is being liquidated. So I’m not bullish at $20,000 or $21,000 on Bitcoin. I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it went to $10,000.”

      <title>960: BILLIONAIRE “BOND KING" WHO ACCURATELY PREDICTED RECENT CRYPTO COLLAPSE IS CALLING FOR $10K BITCOIN!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/rqmYIC1r9q4</link>
      <description>Doubleline Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach, also known as the “bond king,” says he would not be surprised at all if the Bitcoin price falls to $10,000.

“We’ve already seen around the edges some blowups in parts of the crypto world, and that could be foreshadowing some problems,” he explained.

The billionaire bond king explained that when the BTC price fell below $30K, its chart indicated that $20K “was going to happen quickly, and it did.” Emphasizing that “The trend in crypto is clearly not positive,” Gundlach opined:

"I’m not bullish at that $20,000 or $21,000 on bitcoin. I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it went to $10,000."

      <title>959: MICHAEL SAYLOR DEBUNKS BITCOIN MARGIN CALL RUMOR - SAYS NO LIQUIDATION EVEN IF BTC FALLS BELOW $3.5K</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/gErw1HMCN58</link>
      <description>Microstrategy CEO and Bitcoin mega bull Michael Saylor debunked the rumor that his company is close to having to liquidate its BTC to meet a margin call for a Bitcoin-backed loan. The rumor intensified as the price of the king crypto (BTC) continued to plummet after the weekend sell-off.

However, Saylor tweeted Tuesday:

"When Microstrategy adopted a bitcoin strategy, it anticipated volatility and structured its balance sheet so that it could continue to hodl through adversity."

The Bitcoin price dipped below the $21K level this week. However, Microstrategy told Reuters Tuesday that it has not received a margin call, emphasizing:

"We can always contribute additional bitcoins to maintain the required loan-to-value ratio."

However, Saylor tweeted Tuesday:

"When Microstrategy adopted a bitcoin strategy, it anticipated volatility and structured its balance sheet so that it could continue to hodl through adversity."

The Bitcoin price dipped below the $21K level this week. However, Microstrategy told Reuters Tuesday that it has not received a margin call, emphasizing:

"We can always contribute additional bitcoins to maintain the required loan-to-value ratio."

      <title>958: BITCOIN, ETHEREUM AND ENTIRE CRYPTO MARKET ON BRINK OF EPIC COLLAPSE WARNS EX-BITMEX CEO!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/lRky6OanK4E</link>
      <description>A closely followed crypto capitalist is issuing a warning that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are on the verge of another massive sell-off event despite being down big from their all-time highs.

Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes says that he’s keeping a close watch on on-chain data using decentralized finance (DeFi) analytics platform Parsec.

If these levels break, $20,000 BTC and 1,000 ETH, we can expect massive sell pressure in the spot markets as dealers hedge themselves. We can also expect that there will be some over-the-counter dealers and that will be unable to hedge properly and might go belly up.“

      <title>957: TRADER WHO NAILED EPIC BITCOIN 2018 COLLAPSE SAYS EXTREME BTC CORRECTION LOOMING - HERE’S HIS TARGET</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/heQ3t1NsF0g</link>
      <description>The veteran crypto trader who accurately called the Bitcoin 2018 meltdown is issuing a fresh warning that a severe correction could be looming for the king cryptocurrency (BTC).

Seasoned market analyst Peter Brandt tells his 651,800 Twitter followers Bitcoin must recover its May 31st high of around $32,000 to avoid the risk of a massive capitulation event, sending Bitcoin to a low of $12,700.

“Unless Bitcoin (BTC) can close above the May 31st high, this chart could become a textbook example of the famed ‘Drano’ chart pattern.”

      <title>956: PETER SCHIFF PREDICTS MASSIVE BITCOIN CRASH AS RECESSION DEEPENS - WARNS DON’T BUY THIS DIP!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/nc74bwm4jyg</link>
      <description>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff has made some dire predictions about crypto, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. He explained that “The need to sell Bitcoin to pay the bills will only get worse as the recession deepens,” adding that the king cryptocurrency (BTC) is poised to crash to $20K while Ether will sink to $1K.

"With Bitcoin dropping below key support at $25K and Ethereum below 1300, the combined market cap of nearly 20K cryptos has broken below $1 trillion, from a record-high of $3 trillion. That's $2 trillion down, $1 trillion left to go. The last trillion will be the most painful."

      <title>955: NEXT CRYPTO BULL CYCLE WILL START Q4 OF 2022 PREDICTS BITCOIN BILLIONAIRE MIKE NOVOGRATZ OF GALAXY DIGITAL!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Swd-RsZ5x7I</link>
      <description>Mike Novogratz, the CEO of the crypto investment company Galaxy Digital, has recently predicted that the next bull cycle of Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, could start in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Novogratz shared this opinion at the Consensus 2022 conference in Austin, Texas. According to the billionaire investor, Bitcoin is not going to trade well until the Federal Reserve takes a break.

“My hope is that by the fourth quarter, the economy will be slowing enough that the Fed says we are going to pause, and then you will see the next crypto cycle start. Then Bitcoin will break from equities and lead markets… Rates are going to 5% in the U.S. I hope crypto can decouple.”

      <title>954: BITCOIN WILL EXPLODE BY OVER 700%, ACCORDING TO CEO OF $80,000,000,000 ASSET MANAGER!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/YAEflRv7Qp0</link>
      <description>The CEO of global investment manager VanEck, Jan van Eck, is reportedly expressing optimism that the Bitcoin price will rise to stratospheric heights.

The VanEck CEO says that Bitcoin could rally by around 732% from current levels to reach $250,000 per coin, according to a report by business publication Barron’s.

“Investors see it as a complement to gold. That’s the short version. Bitcoin has limited supply; the supply is visible. And it’s very hard, almost impossible, to change that. Bitcoin will go to half the market cap of gold, or $250,000 a Bitcoin, but that could take decades. It’s hard to put a timeframe on it.”

      <title>953: MICHAEL SAYLOR BETS ON $1 MILLION BITCOIN AND SAYS SKEPTICS ARE WRONG, IT’S NOT GOING TO ZERO!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/4lYsR29gX7I</link>
      <description>Unapologetically bullish Bitcoin bull and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, whose own comments to mainstream media firmly brushed aside any suggestion of permanent price downside, says the king crypto (Bitcoin) is going to a million dollars per coin.

Those who claimed that Bitcoin would be banned or go to zero, he told CNBC on June 8, had already been “discredited.”

“If the deniers are wrong and the skeptics are wrong — and it’s pretty obvious they’re both wrong at this point — it’s not going to zero, and if it’s not going to zero, it’s going to a million,” Saylor forecast.

      <title>952: TRADER WHO ACCURATELY PREDICTED 2022 CRYPTO MELTDOWN SAYS BITCOIN CAPITULATION IMMINENT!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/H9N5D6e-Z5o</link>
      <description>A popular crypto strategist who accurately predicted Bitcoin would slice through $30,000 last month says BTC looks poised to capitulate even after its latest rally.

Pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Capo tells his 335,700 Twitter followers he expects Bitcoin to print a fresh 2022 low once BTC bears take out support at $28,500.

“Clean range. What is happening inside the range and what has happened at the range high shows that this is clear redistribution range. Clean break of the range low = last leg down confirmed = $21,000-$23,000.”

      <itunes:summary>A popular crypto strategist who accurately predicted Bitcoin would slice through $30,000 last month says BTC looks poised to capitulate even after its latest rally.

Pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Capo tells his 335,700 Twitter followers he expects Bitcoin to print a fresh 2022 low once BTC bears take out support at $28,500.

“Clean range. What is happening inside the range and what has happened at the range high shows that this is clear redistribution range. Clean break of the range low = last leg down confirmed = $21,000-$23,000.”

      <title>951: CRYPTO ANALYST WHO NAILED BITCOIN MAY 2021 COLLAPSE PREDICTS INCOMING BTC RALLY - HERE’S HIS TARGET!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/jrCGKSj5TJg</link>
      <description>A crypto strategist who accurately called Bitcoin’s May 2021 meltdown is now predicting a potential rally that could send BTC toward its long-term diagonal resistance.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 112,100 Twitter followers Bitcoin is trading within an ascending channel and potentially gearing up for a short-term rally to his target.

According to the cryptocurrency strategist, his target of $39,547 is “speculative” and is only valid as long as the channel holds.

      <title>950: FIDELITY’S MACRO CHIEF MODIFIES S2F, PREDICTS $140K BITCOIN PRICE BY THIS DATE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/RSnGBH8xw_g</link>
      <description>Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at asset management firm Fidelity Investments, recently shared a modified version of the Bitcoin Stock-to-flow (S2F) model dubbed the S-Curve Model. Using the model, he predicted that the king crypto (BTC) price could reach $144,000 within the next three years.

"I remain bullish on Bitcoin as an aspiring store of value in a world of ongoing financial repression, but the above exercise is a good reminder that we should always revisit our assumptions, especially when the price action deviates from expectations."

      <title>948: CRYPTO MACRO EXPERT PREDICTS MASSIVE BITCOIN RALLY THIS YEAR REVISITING BTC ALL-TIME HIGH!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/EvdRPxvbub4</link>
      <description>Macro analyst Lyn Alden says that the king crypto (Bitcoin) could rally higher over the coming months if certain conditions are fulfilled.

Asked in a Coin Stories interview whether BTC could revisit its all-time high this year, Alden says that the price of leading cryptocurrency could surge if the Federal Reserve reverses its current hawkish monetary policy measures, such as raising interest rates and the unwinding of asset purchases.

“I mean if you had a total capitulation, like if you had a pivot in Fed policy and a re-liquefaction of markets, it’s a pretty high volatility asset [Bitcoin]. So you could have a pretty big swing up. You could retest some highs.”

      <title>947: BILLIONAIRE VENTURE CAPITALIST TIM DRAPER EXPLAINS WHY BITCOIN WILL SOAR PAST $250K THIS YEAR!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/-NBN3BvgC80</link>
      <description>Venture capitalist Tim Draper has doubled down on his Bitcoin price prediction of $250,000 by the end of this year or early next year. However, the billionaire explained why he expects the price of the king crypto (BTC) to soar past his estimate.

Draper explained: “Women control about 80% of retail spending and retailers haven’t yet realized that they can save 2%, and they usually run on very thin margins so that might be like double their profits. They can save 2% just by accepting bitcoin instead of taking a bank-issued credit card. And that can change everything.

"All of a sudden. All the women will have Bitcoin wallets and they will be buying things with bitcoin and you are going to see a bitcoin price that will just go right through my $250,000 estimate."

      <title>946: CRYPTO ANALYST SAYS BITCOIN WILL EXPLODE BY OVER 60% IN COMING MONTHS - BUT THERE’S A CATCH!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/NlJZ3QU3HO0</link>
      <description>Popular trader and analyst Jason Pizzino is hopeful Bitcoin (BTC) could rally higher if the flagship crypto asset sustains the prevailing momentum.

“If we can get above those levels, consolidate and continue to move higher with higher highs and higher lows… the next key level is $48,000 and the $52,000 levels.

But I think we’re getting too far ahead of ourselves to even contemplate getting to the high $40,000s or even low $50,000s at this point as there’s so much work to do for Bitcoin at these lower levels.”

      <title>945: BITCOIN TO EXPLODE HIGHER THIS MONTH!! CRYPTO ANALYST SAYS 3 METRICS SUGGEST JUNE RALLY INCOMING!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/kNjwMeatzCE</link>
      <description>Popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen says three metrics indicate Bitcoin could see a price bounce in June.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 746,000 YouTube subscribers the first metric pointing to a BTC rally is a correcting US dollar currency index.

“We know that the US dollar currency index, when it’s moving higher in a parabolic rally, we know Bitcoin goes down. We’ve seen this many times in the past. And furthermore, if we just simply pull it up, you can see that over the last several months, the dollar has been in a parabolic rally."

      <title>944: BITCOIN ‘BEAR CASE’ TARGET IS $576,389 REVEALS TOP CRYPTO ANALYST - BY THIS DATE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/3-VcR8WWadE</link>
      <description>In a new video update, popular crypto analyst InvestAnswers tells his 439,000 YouTube subscribers that his “bear case” for Bitcoin in 2030 is $576,000, which is about 1,886% from current prices.

“So not bad from where we are today. That’s basically a 20x give or take, a couple of dollars, which is a huge return, but still, it is a moving target. Things change all the time. Adoption changes, networks changes, competition changes. Bear that in mind.”

By combining all three Bitcoin price targets, the host finds an average “expected” target of $785,955 for BTC, with $576,389 being the 'bear-case' low end of the range and $1.55 million being the most optimistic forecast for the king cryptocurrency.

      <link>https://youtu.be/ZcAeV6YtmOA</link>
      <description>Popular crypto analyst and the host of InvestAnswers is envisioning three possible price points for Bitcoin in the year 2030 ranging from $576K to $1.55 million per BTC.

By combining all three Bitcoin price targets, the host finds an average “expected” target of $785,955 forBTC, with $576,389 being the 'bear-case' low end of the range and $1.55 million being the most optimistic forecast for the king cryptocurrency.

"The adoption of Bitcoin is faster than that of the internet, and that of mobile phones right now. Therefore, due to Metcalfe’s Law, this is completely believable.”

      <title>942: BITCOIN MODEL WHICH ACCURATELY PREDICTED 14X RISE STILL POINTS TO $500K BTC PRICE - HERE’S WHEN!!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/dYlcS1MX_fs</link>
      <description>Quant analyst Plan B, creator of the Bitcoin stock-to-flow model, which correctly predicted the 14X rise in BTC price, from $4,000 to $55,000 shares good Bitcoin news on crypto twitter, that the S2F model still points to $500K per coin after the 2024 halving.

"Even if the original $55K model was right and the later $100K update wrong, the difference is "only" 2X. Remember that S2F model was created in March 2019, when bitcoin was below $4K. IMO the correctly predicted 14X rise (55/4) is worth more than the 2X prediction error (100/55)."

Original 2019 $55K S2F model seems to fit better than later $100K update. Interestingly a refit based on 18m average S2F ratio and 3 yrs new data confirms the original model. The bad news: $100K was probably too high. The good news: model still points to $500K after 2024 halving."

      <link>https://youtu.be/q9lhF2jornc</link>
      <description>Venture capital investor Tim Draper is reasserting his prediction that the Bitcoin price will break well into the six figures over the coming months.

Draper says in a new interview that “by the end of this year or early next year,” the king crypto (BTC) will hit a price of $250,000 per coin.

The venture capital investor who made early bets on Coinbase, Hotmail, Skype, Tesla and Twitter says that the catalyst will be women increasingly using Bitcoin to shop.

      <title>940: THIS ECLIPSE-LIKE EVENT IS WHY BITCOIN WILL REACH $100K BY NEXT YEAR, SAYS TOP CRYPTO ANALYST!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/X1CAvd2wnlY</link>
      <description>He said the so-called crypto winter for Bitcoin is over for now, with a forecast for the #1 cryptocurrency to reach $100,000 by later 2023, in a run higher that could last up to 2025.

“I’m not giving a major buy signal, I’m just saying, yes, you can start to buy a little bit,” Lamoureux told MarketWatch in a recent interview. Hovering at $30,000 and off more than 55% from a record high of $68,990 in November 2021, bitcoin meets much of his criteria to exit a bear market, he said.

“One of the main things that drives Bitcoin (BTC) is supply,” he said. “There’s less supply, so there’s less coming to the market …that historically has always driven prices higher. What I’m saying is that it’s out of the narrative now.”

      <title>939: ANALYST WHO ACCURATELY PREDICTED BITCOIN AND CRYPTO COLLAPSE DETAILS ROCK BOTTOM TARGET FOR BTC!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/FI8KhL-Qyu0</link>
      <description>The crypto analyst who predicted Bitcoin would crash this year is revealing what he thinks will be the bottom price for the benchmark cryptocurrency (BTC).

“BTC – Some of the reasons why I think we should see new lows in the coming days:

BTC broke the $30,000 support zone, which was the main pivot of the bull run. This is a zone, not a level. It’s between $29,000-$31,000, taking all the wicks. Now it’s testing that zone as resistance.”

The analyst says that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $21,000 before it will go up.

“The minimum target of the bear flag hasn’t been reached yet ($23,000). You can also see this on altcoins, where some of the main targets haven’t been reached yet.”

      <title>938: STOCK-TO-FLOW MODEL PREDICTS BITCOIN $500K+ AVERAGE AFTER 2024 HALVING!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/bcZVXExvDIA</link>
      <description>Predicting the future Bitcoin price is impossible according to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). So why did S2F model correctly predict a BTC price jump after 2020 halving? And what about 2024 halving?

"Interesting poll results: 81% thinks #Bitcoin stays below $500K next 5 years.

S2F model predicts $500K+ average after 2024 halving.

Very similar to March 2019 when I published S2F model and BTC was below $4K. Majority thought S2F prediction of $55K after 2020 halving was crazy."

"Interesting poll results: 81% thinks #Bitcoin stays below $500K next 5 years.

S2F model predicts $500K+ average after 2024 halving.

Very similar to March 2019 when I published S2F model and BTC was below $4K. Majority thought S2F prediction of $55K after 2020 halving was crazy."

      <title>937: AFTER PREDICTING $400K BITCOIN, GUGGENHEIM NOW SEES A CRASH TO $8K!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/PVNyssx_tTA</link>
      <description>With the Bitcoin price currently below $30,000, Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer of global investment giant Guggenheim Partners, believes the value of the king crypto (BTC) could further dip to $8,000 per coin.

Minerd made the bearish prediction on Monday (May 23, 2022), during an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

“When you break below 30,000 [dollars] consistently, 8,000 [dollars] is the ultimate bottom, so I think we have a lot more room to the downside, especially with the Fed being restrictive”.

      <title>936: CRYPTO ANALYST WHO CALLED 2021 BITCOIN CRASH UNVEILS REALISTIC PRICE PATH TO NEW BTC ALL-TIME HIGH!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Ds5V4pE4bWg</link>
      <description>A closely followed crypto analyst known for accurately calling the crash of May 2021 is laying out a realistic price path for Bitcoin (BTC) to follow to new all-time highs.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Dave the Wave tells his 105,000 followers on Twitter that he foresees a potential scenario where the king cryptocurrency chops around for the next year or so before cracking the $70,000 level around the end of 2023.

Based on Dave the Wave’s chart, he believes BTC is capable of reaching a cycle peak near $200,000 around May or June of 2024 or about two years from now.

      <title>935: BITCOIN WILL GO INTO THE MILLIONS, PREDICTS MICHAEL SAYLOR!! ALTCOINS RISK ANOTHER 70% DECLINE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/z0qNdWJakUk</link>
      <description>Michael Saylor’s bold multi-7-figure Bitcoin price prediction follows a market-wide crypto bloodbath as Microstrategy’s own BTC position hangs in red.

“There’s no price target. I expect we’ll be buying bitcoin at the local top forever. And I expect Bitcoin is going to go into the millions. So we’re very patient. We think it’s the future of money.”

Once people figure out why bitcoin is superior to everything else, then the institutions are going to come in with large sums of money, and we’re not going to have to struggle through this massive explanation of why we’re different than 19,000 other crypto tokens.”

      <title>934: TRADER PREDICTS CRYPTO MARKET WILL MIMIC 2018 BEAR SEASON, PREDICTS BITCOIN HIGH BEFORE NUKING LOWER</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/2eImyGfZV8w</link>
      <description>A widely followed analyst and trader says that the crypto market could copy its 2018 playbook.

“2022 could very well look like 2018 given the amount of time we could chop around for. I do think that the market is more mature these days than before, though. Overall market structure for trading is better + dexes [decentralized exchanges] + NFTs [non-fungible tokens] + gaming + new usable chains.”

Something like this would make sense for me; more people getting bullish on the bearish retest of $35,000 – $40,000 and then price nuking lower.”

      <title>933: RICH DAD AUTHOR SAYS BITCOIN WAITING FOR TEST OF NEW $9K-$20K BOTTOM BUT REMAINS BULLISH LONG TERM!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/dSU_J0iI_HY</link>
      <description>Rich Dad Poor Dad, best selling author and Crypto bull Robert Kiyosaki remains bullish on the future of Bitcoin despite his warning of BTC testing a new bottom, potentially as low as $9,000 per coin.

"I remain bullish on Bitcoin’s future. Waiting for test of new bottom. $20k? $14 k? $11 k? $9 k? Why do I remain bullish? Fed and Treasury are corrupt organizations. They will self-destruct before they regain honesty, integrity and moral compass. Take care. Be aware."

Regarding stablecoins and the recent Terra LUNA and Terra UST death spiral, Kiyosaki shared the following:

"I was right: “Why STABLE COINS are UNSTABLE.” Just before stable coins crashed I warned they were unstable. Proof I was right is on Rich Dad Radio with friend &amp; Rich Dad’s crypto expert Jeff Wang. The radio show is “Will Crypto Survive” released a week ago. What did I know?"

      <title>932: NASTY RECESSION IMMINENT WARNS MACRO GURU AS BITCOIN FORMS MASSIVE BULLISH TECHNICAL PATTERN!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/pNYtepZykF4</link>
      <description>Popular macroeconomic expert Raul Pal, thinks the world is going through a nasty recession period but remains confident that Bitcoin and crypto will be a viable investment class in the long term.

“My macro view is that we’re in recession, it’s going to be pretty nasty.

The Fed shouldn’t have done what they did but the bond market tightened for them anyway – the Fed didn’t actually do it, the bond market did it all. The Fed are going to have to unwind this mess, but it could get messy at first.

Using all the technical indicators that I look at, my view is if we are going to reach a proper bounce or a low, it happens in June. So we’ve got between now and June for everyone to freak out.”

      <description>A closely tracked crypto analyst believes that Bitcoin is almost ready to pull off a big move now that the leading cryptocurrency asset by market cap (BTC) breached a key psychological support area of $30,000.

In a new strategy session, DonAlt says that the fear and the panic in the crypto markets are leading him to believe that Bitcoin could either ignite a massive capitulation event or launch a rally to $58,000 and leave BTC bears in disbelief.

Pseudonymous crypto analyst Pentoshi tells his 546,900 Twitter followers that bears are exerting a lot of effort to push the Bitcoin price down but not getting the desired result.

“For BTC I think we can squeeze to 34k *IF* this 31k area is flipped to support. For now, this is my bias point to trade off.”

      <title>929: CRYPTO CAPITALIST ARTHUR HAYES FORECASTS ‘DRAMATIC NEW LOWS’ FOR BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/l39dxPYP6EQ</link>
      <description>The co-founder of the crypto exchange platform BitMEX predicts Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) will continue to fall in price in the wake of this week’s Terra (LUNA) collapse.

In a new blog post, Arthur Hayes says he’s gearing up to accumulate both crypto assets as he anticipates a drop to major cyclical lows.

According to Hayes, he’ll be a buyer of BTC at $20,000 and ETH at $1,300.

“These levels roughly correspond to the all-time highs of each asset during the 2017/18 bull market.”

      <title>928: INVESTING LEGEND MARK MOBIUS ISSUES WARNING TO CRYPTO INVESTORS, DETAILS DIRE BITCOIN TARGET!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/YTWNc5K1qe4</link>
      <description>Seasoned investor and co-founder of Mobius Capital Partners Mark Mobius is issuing a dire warning to Bitcoin (BTC) traders that devastating losses still await the leading crypto asset.

Mobius says that while the “buy the dip” strategy may have worked for cryptocurrency traders in the past, it’s not a good idea this time around. However, he notes there could be a slight upswing after Bitcoin drops to the $20,000 mark before it once again resumes its plummet to $10,000.

“[Buying the dip] will not work this time until Bitcoin hits $20,000, from where there might be a bounce but then the next target will be $10,000.”

      <title>927: HERE’S THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR CRYPTO MARKETS AMID BITCOIN CRASH, ACCORDING TO TOP ANALYST!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/p5J9rV8Xrw4</link>
      <description>Widely-followed crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen says the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s is giving a glimpse of what the bottom could look like for the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market.

Cowen says that an 80% drop is highly possible for crypto.

"Sometimes I struggle to comprehend an asset class that has only a market cap of $500 billion, but considering that the asset class as a whole was $3 trillion not that long ago and we’re currently at $1.26 trillion, it’s not that far-fetched to assume that we can’t drop another 40% or so down to approximately $500 billion. I would consider that to be the absolute worst-case scenario.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/vuvL3VDxftg</link>
      <description>A crypto strategist and trader who has long predicted a massive Bitcoin crash below $30,000 is revealing how low he believes BTC will go.

The pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Capo tells his 289,400 Twitter followers that Bitcoin’s free fall is not over yet.

He cites large whale transfers of BTC to crypto exchanges as the main force driving the current crash, and warns a significant amount of Ethereum has also been sent to the crypto exchange FTX.

As for his target low for Bitcoin, Capo says he believes BTC will land somewhere between $21,000 and $23,000.

      <link>https://youtu.be/E5gb7-fsqh0</link>
      <description>Panic appeared to set in on crypto markets overnight on May 11th as Blockchain protocol Terra failed to steady its bleeding crypto assets, with LUNA crashing another 90%+ for the day, now trading below $2.

As a result of the massive Terra/LUNA sell-off, Bitcoin price skyrocketed to a dubious new all time high of $140,000 in $UST as a result, while the king cryptocurrency is currently holding on to $30,000 support.

      <title>923: HERE’S THE MOST REALISTIC BITCOIN PREDICTION FOR REST OF 2022, ACCORDING TO TOP CRYPTO STRATEGIST!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/8itAcgqHgnE</link>
      <description>A closely followed crypto trader is unveiling what he believes is the most realistic price path for Bitcoin (BTC) for the rest of the year.

“When the price of an asset is on an uptrend and then it catches up with the long-term moving averages, usually that’s a sign that the trend is dying down. The momentum is lost. If you cross below them, that is a bearish signal.”

The cryptocurrency analyst highlights that the 20-month EMA was a reliable indicator of major trend shifts during the 2014 and 2018 BTC market cycles.

“That happened over here in 2014. If we go over here in 2018, [we had] a major run-up. Trend starts to go sideways after the run-up, and then we meet the long-term moving averages. We closed below that. It’s a bear market.”

      <title>922: CRYPTO BILLIONAIRE BROCK PIERCE SAYS BITCOIN WILL EITHER CRASH TO ZERO OR EXPLODE TO $1,000,000!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/SpQ_NaavGUE</link>
      <description>Crypto billionaire Brock Pierce says that Bitcoin will either fail spectacularly or become massively successful.

“[Bitcoin] could go to zero. It’s a binary outcome. It’s either going to go to $1 million a Bitcoin or zero. It’s going to be one or the other, which is why you shouldn’t put everything there.”

“This reminds me a lot of 1999, right? We are in that phase. And what came out of that? eBay and Amazon and all sorts of interesting businesses came out of the Dot-Com sort of 1.0 era. And a bunch of it went to zero. And I think that will probably be true of what we see here.

That doesn’t mean the innovation isn’t real and it’s not going to play an important role in our collective future.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/gHTYvZ12OUI</link>
      <description>A popular crypto analyst is considering how low Bitcoin could go as the cryptocurrency markets head into the weekend on a sour note.

“I want to go ahead and talk a little bit about what we talked about as our worst-case scenario. I’ve got to be honest with you guys, I’m gonna stick to my guns here again.

This is the point that I want to bring here, all the while we could come close to it, we could come here toward $30,000. I think it’s completely irrelevant and out of the question to think that we’d come down and touch $20,000.”

      <title>920: KRAKEN’S DAN HELD SAYS BITCOIN SUPERCYCLE STILL IN PLAY - HERE’S WHY!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/95ZGSj1m6ig</link>
      <description>Kraken director of growth marketing Dan Held says the Bitcoin (BTC) supercycle theory that he first put forward in 2019 still holds water.

According to Held, the theory advances the idea that a perfect storm such as mistrust in governments and institutions, will propel the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and drive up the price of the leading crypto asset.

“If we repeat 2013, we could see Bitcoin hitting between $300,000-$400,000 Bitcoin. Now. history usually rhymes, it doesn’t repeat itself, so it’s probably not going to be exactly that, but if it did, that would be my best price point.

So my price point, I would say that I think it’s going to land probably between [$100,000 and $300,000]. But if we match 2013 again, it could be [$300,000 to $400,000].”

      <title>918: BITCOIN CAN STILL IGNITE PARABOLIC RALLY TO $100K THIS YEAR, SAYS TOP CRYPTO ANALYST - HERE’S HOW!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Irs3WRSExuo</link>
      <description>According to the crypto strategist, the lack of bullish momentum is setting up Bitcoin (BTC) for one final push above $100,000.

“I’m expecting $100,000 for the fifth wave, and when it does complete, wherever that may be above $100,00… I think we’ll probably fall somewhere between $100,000 and $200,000 realistically…

But the point being is that these lows that are built up, we don’t need to take them now. We could very well continue up for the fifth wave.”

      <title>917: MORE LIKELY BITCOIN WILL HIT $100K BEFORE THE KING CRYPTO SWEEPS $30K LOWS, NEW FORECAST SAYS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/zTlP1JNV1HA</link>
      <description>In a video using Elliott Waves, Credible Crypto thus mapped out a move to a new macro top of between $100,000 and $200,000 for Bitcoin before a drawdown which could take liquidity at $30,000 or under.

“These lows that have built up — we don’t have to take them now; we could very well continue up for the fifth wave,” he explained.

He added that there was “nothing wrong” with expecting a sweep of the lows after November 2021’s all-time highs.

“But again, based on market context and everything else that I’ve seen, I think that’s a little bit more unlikely; I think it’s a lot more likely that we leave these lows untapped and simply continue up.”

“These lows that have built up — we don’t have to take them now; we could very well continue up for the fifth wave,” he explained.

He added that there was “nothing wrong” with expecting a sweep of the lows after November 2021’s all-time highs.

“But again, based on market context and everything else that I’ve seen, I think that’s a little bit more unlikely; I think it’s a lot more likely that we leave these lows untapped and simply continue up.”

      <title>916: ANALYST WHO ACCURATELY CALLED MASSIVE BITCOIN CRASH HAS BAD NEWS FOR CRYPTO TRADERS - NEW TARGET!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/9khxzLd6mw8</link>
      <description>Seasoned market analyst Peter Brandt is warning Bitcoin traders and investors alike, saying that the king crypto is poised for a sharp corrective move.

Brandt tells his 636,800 Twitter followers that the largest cryptocurrency by market cap has broken down from crucial diagonal support that has kept BTC afloat for the first few months of 2022.

“The completion of a bear channel typically results in a decline equal to the width of the channel, or in this case a hard test of $32,000 or so – my guess is $28,000. This does NOT make me a hater BTC.”

      <description>Financial advisory firm deVere Group CEO Nigel Green expects that at least two more nations will adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender before the end of the year.

“In January, I predicted that at least another three nations… would declare the world’s largest cryptocurrency legal tender in 2022. One now already has done so.

I expect Bitcoin will be adopted as legal tender in at least one more African and one Central or Latin American country before the end of the year.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/iCSXoGYAoiI</link>
      <description>The king crypto (Bitcoin) will cost $1 million by 2030, one of the industry’s best-known pundits insists, as countries worldwide shun the euro and United States dollar.

In his latest blog post published o April 27, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of cryptocurrency derivatives giant BitMEX, doubled down on his sky-high price prediction for BTC and gold.

“As the union disintegrates, money shall be printed in glorious quantities in a pantheon of different local currencies. Hyperinflation is not off the table. And again, as European savers smell what the rock is cookin’, they will flee into hard assets like gold and Bitcoin. The breakup of the EU = $1 million Bitcoin.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/oceTCEkpDpI</link>
      <description>The cryptocurrency analyst who predicted the May 2021 market collapse is warning that Bitcoin could be due for a notable dip even while he remains long-term bullish on BTC.

As the recent rally that began early this month fizzles out, the pseudonymous analyst eyes $25,000 as a potential bottom for Bitcoin.

“IF we get a Bitcoin move down comparable to the previous two, looking at the 25K region.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/TONyuxsbE28</link>
      <description>A popular crypto strategist says he still expects Bitcoin to ignite a strong cryptocurrency rally by the end of the year, noting that the current bearish price action is designed to shake traders out of the market.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 328,200 Twitter followers that the king crypto is going through its last corrective phase before it skyrockets above $100,000 by 2023.

“Mid-cycle corrections are designed to shake you out, and they’re quite effective. Just ask the guys who sold BTC under $10k during the March capitulation event before BTC ran 1,500%. Patience. [High timeframe] structure remains intact. It’s really quite simple.”

      <title>911: BRAZIL’S SENATE APPROVES ‘BITCOIN LAW’ TO REGULATE CRYPTO!! BRUTAL BTC BULL TRAP WARNING!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/_-3vPYbFjrE</link>
      <description>Brazil’s Senate has passed the country’s first Bitcoin bill governing cryptocurrency in a plenary session, which will set the stage for the creation of a regulatory framework for the country’s crypto industry.

The bill must be approved by the Chamber of Deputies and then signed off by President Jair Bolsonaro to become law in the country. This is expected to occur by the end of 2022, according to experts who spoke with Cointelegraph Brasil.

The session that approved the project was chaired by Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco, who said:

“I want to congratulate the rapporteur of the project, Senator Irajá, for the approval, here in the Plenary of the Senate, for this important bill.”

      <title>910: BITCOIN BILLIONAIRE ELON MUSK BUYS TWITTER FOR $44B! HERE'S HOW CRYPTO MARKETS WILL LOOK IN 5 YEARS!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/PGqLOh_JWP8</link>
      <description>Twitter announced on Monday that it will become a privately held company following its board of directors accepting a bid from Bitcoin billionaire Elon Musk to purchase the firm’s stock for $54.20 per share in cash — roughly $44 billion. Though the transaction is expected to close in 2022, it is still subject to the approval of Twitter stockholders as well as certain regulators.

Elon Musk, with more than 83 million followers — far more than former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey at 6.3 million — may influence behavior on the platform and social media as a whole as a result of the purchase.

The Tesla CEO said on April 14 that one of his top priorities for Twitter would be to eliminate “spam and scam bots and the bot armies,” including those connected to crypto scams.

Though the transaction is expected to close in 2022, it is still subject to the approval of Twitter stockholders as well as certain regulators.

Elon Musk, with more than 83 million followers — far more than former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey at 6.3 million — may influence behavior on the platform and social media as a whole as a result of the purchase.

The Tesla CEO said on April 14 that one of his top priorities for Twitter would be to eliminate “spam and scam bots and the bot armies,” including those connected to crypto scams.

      <title>909: BREAKING: THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC PASSES BILL TO ADOPT BITCOIN AND CRYPTO AS OFFICIAL CURRENCY!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Nq9o4ih1W1s</link>
      <description>The Central African Republic (CAR) has become the center of a hot buzz in the cryptocurrency world amid various reports of it adopting Bitcoin (BTC) quite similar to El Salvador.

However, contrary to popular headlines, the African nation has not adopted BTC as a legal tender, instead, it has reportedly legalized the use of cryptocurrencies in the financial markets.

The new cryptocurrency law would reportedly allow citizens to pay their taxes in Bitcoin or crypto and allow the use of crypto as a form of payment for businesses.

      <title>908: TOP CRYPTO ANALYST SAYS ONE ALTCOIN WILL PRINT 10X GAINS, UPDATES FORECAST FOR BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/a1L3rG5de-g</link>
      <description>A closely tracked crypto strategist and trader is unveiling one altcoin he believes could record a 900% rally while updating his outlook on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

Pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Credible tells his 327,800 Twitter followers that he expects Bitcoin to correct to as low as $38,000 before it kicks off another rally.

“Up against our resistance region now. [I] would expect a pullback to at least $39k from here soon. Again, this is just a base-forming here before a full-on reversal, in my opinion. BTC.”

      <title>907: VETERAN TRADER WHO CORRECTLY CALLED MASSIVE BITCOIN CRASH WARNS KING CRYPTO CAN COLLAPSE TO $27K!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/hh2gCjQoPo4</link>
      <description>Veteran trader Peter Brandt thinks Bitcoin could be headed for a serious price dip.

Brandt, who gained notoriety in cryptocurrency circles for correctly calling Bitcoin’s 2018 collapse, tells his 633,200 Twitter followers that BTC could drop to $27,000.

Brandt also speculates that the Nasdaq-100 index could be mirroring the dot-com crash of the early 2000s, saying on Twitter that the chart is giving him déjà vu.

“‘It’s Deja Vu all over again. 
– Yogi Berra, late 20th Century American philosopher.”

      <title>906: HERE’S HOW BITCOIN CAN EXPLODE BY 25X FROM CURRENT PRICE, ACCORDING TO CRYPTO ANALYST JASON PIZZINO!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/sXI3cPjrxB4</link>
      <description>Crypto analyst and trader Jason Pizzino is optimistic that Bitcoin will hit a seven-figure price over time.

In a new video update, Pizzino tells his 263,000 YouTube subscribers that it’s “not too far out of the question” for the king cryptocurrency to rally by around 25 times and reach a price of $1,000,000 per BTC.

“A 25x might seem like it’s a little far-fetched. But as we can see from December 2018 to the current top in 2021 in November, it’s basically been a 22x return. So 2,100% here. So it’s not too far out of the question. But I just think it’s going to take a lot more time than people are expecting.”

      <description>The pseudonymous crypto analyst Plan B says that, barring a black swan event, all the indicators point to a bright future for Bitcoin in the coming months.

In a YouTube interview with Blockware Intelligence, the quantitative analyst lays out the case for why he thinks numerous BTC metrics look so positive.

“At the risk of being called a moonboy, all the signals, whether you look fundamentally, like stock-to-flow [S2F] for example or on-chain, realized cap or other metrics, or in the news, the macro news, the number of countries that are opening up to Bitcoin. Everything is positive.”

      <title>903: BITCOIN HODL’ERS TARGETING $100K IS WHAT’S PREVENTING 40% PRICE DRAWDOWN! 10X CRYPTO RALLY INCOMING!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/2ySLvXjk2mU</link>
      <description>Bitcoin dropping to $25,000 or lower is unlikely thanks to hodl'ers hoping for all-time highs, not speculative traders, new research says.

Quoting on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Root on Crypto Twitter:

"With the HODL Army growing it's allowing us to make new ATH's (69k top) without barely any STH's in the market. Since we didn't reach prices above 100K, which so many expected, many still believe this will eventually happen and might therefore hold on to their coins."

      <link>https://youtu.be/BlFj86SJW44</link>
      <description>Popular cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe is predicting rallies in XRP and Litecoin (LTC) and says one key metric will spark the next big bull phase of Bitcoin and the entire crypto market.

According to him, the US dollar index (DXY), which pins the USD against a basket of fiat currencies, needs to reverse course on its nearly 1-year long rally.

“Still waiting for this one to turn around, then the party of crypto will begin.”

      <title>901: BITCOIN WILL HIT $100,000 WITHIN A YEAR, PREDICTS NEXO CEO!! RUSSIAN CRYPTO BILL FINALIZED!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/QKAPbda0Niw</link>
      <description>Bitcoin could hit $100K within a year, the CEO of crypto lending firm Nexo has predicted.

Antoni Trenchev told CNBC he thinks the world’s biggest cryptocurrency can surge above $100,000 “within 12 months.”

He said that BTC could fall in tandem with traditional financial markets as the Federal Reserve unwinds its massive stimulus policy. But eventually, a “crash” in stocks could force to the Fed back into easing, he said.

      <title>899: BITCOIN WILL HIT $100K IN 2022 AFTER BLOWING PAST THESE KEY RESISTANCE ZONES: CELSIUS NETWORK CEO!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/5uwsc-LGlPo</link>
      <description>The CEO of centralized finance platform Celsius Network (CEL) is predicting a six-figure price for Bitcoin (BTC) later this year.

In a Kitco News interview, Celsius head Alex Mashinsky says that Bitcoin will surge above $100,000 before the end of 2022 if it can overcome several key psychological resistance levels.

“I think we’re definitely going to hit all-time highs. All-time highs are not that far from where we are, it’s $67,000. And the question we don’t know is what happens afterward. How much resistance we’re going to have at $70,000, $80,000, $90,000. I think we are going to break $100,000.”

      <title>898: ANALYST WHO CALLED MAY 2021 CRYPTO COLLAPSE SAYS CASE FOR $135K BITCOIN IN PLAY!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/h05rUHOZa6E</link>
      <description>The analyst who called the May 2021 crypto market collapse says there’s now a case to be made for the king cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) to rally its way to the $135,000 level.

The closely followed pseudonymous analyst known as Dave the Wave tells his 96,000 Twitter followers that based on one theory, BTC could top out roughly 229% above current price levels about a year from now.

By drawing straight, long-term trend lines through each Bitcoin bull cycle, Dave the Wave identifies each cycle’s bottom, top, and bear market bottom.

“One for the bulls.

The ‘BBT’s project a 135K target mid next year~”

      <title>897: MASSIVE WALL OF MONEY IS WAITING TO ENTER BITCOIN!! RAOUL PAL UNVEILS MASSIVE CRYPTO PREDICTION!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/wmV4dkqddAc</link>
      <description>Macro guru Raoul Pal is calling Bitcoin / Crypto the fastest growing asset class in human history and predicts gargantuan growth for the cryptocurrency markets by 2030.

The Real Vision CEO says Crypto markets could 100x from current levels and reach a $200 trillion market cap, even if there are slow years along the way.

“We’re at 300 million active users worldwide in digital assets. Essentially, it’s growing at 185% [per year]. We get to 600 million-plus, call it 750 million, by the end of this year. Even if we have a slow year – we get to 500 million. The year after, it’s a billion. The year after that, it’s two billion. Year after that – four billion.

The speed at which this is coming, people do not comprehend. And the movement, I think, from the $2 trillion asset class today to the $200 trillion asset class that’s [Jeff Dorman’s] talking about is by the end of the decade."

      <title>893: ARK INVEST’S CATHIE WOOD PREDICTS $700K BITCOIN, SAYS BTC PART OF A WAVE OF DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/5XZ7b004fUI</link>
      <description>ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood says she views Bitcoin as a “disruptive innovation” in line with corporate giants like Amazon, Apple and Tesla and explains how she gets a BTC price prediction of $700,000 per coin.

"We think emerging markets are a huge use case here," Wood said. "That use case alone will account for $100,000 to $200,000" of an increase in the price of Bitcoin.

Now let's do the math.

The current Bitcoin price of about $60,000 is the base. Wood sees institutional investors adding $500,000 to that and emerging market adoption adding $100,000 to $200,000 more.

So Wood's five-year Bitcoin price target is actually a range between $660,000 and $760,000, with $700,000 falling just below the middle of the range.

      <title>892: BITCOIN ABOUT TO BREAK ALL-TIME HIGHS QUICKER THAN CRYPTO TRADERS THINK, $200K RALLY BY END OF YEAR!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/1yKs5RUnBdY</link>
      <description>Crypto analyst and DataDash host Nicholas Merten says the king crypto (Bitcoin) will hit new all-time highs sooner than most traders think and end the year between the $150,000 - $200,000 range.

“What we generally see here, as we’ve had drawn on the chart for some time, is that after we go through this May rally, even if we get a slight pullback here in the middle of the month, we would still continue higher here, get well up here towards around $75-90k for Bitcoin’s price, come down and make that support, and going from August or Septemeber, really starting to charter into November and December, up towards around $150-$200k.”

Also global investment giant VanEck is predicting Bitcoin could surge by over 100X as hard currencies become less attractive reserve assets.

      <title>889: ASSET MANAGEMENT GIANT VANECK SAYS BITCOIN CAN HIT $4.8 MILLION PER COIN AS A GLOBAL RESERVE ASSET!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/UiT2mcWXiKI</link>
      <description>American investment firm VanEck believes that Bitcoin (BTC) has double the upside of gold and could be worth as much as $4.8 million per coin if it becomes the global reserve asset.

VanEck’s analysis found that the implied price for the king cryptocurrency ranged from $1.3 million to $4.8 million. The lower prediction was based on BTC as a monetary base (M0), which investment database Investopedia says includes all circulating supply of a currency and bank deposits but is not a common marker for economists to look at.

      <title>888: BITOIN ON ITS WAY TO NEW ALL-TIME HIGH ONCE IT CLEARS THIS HURDLE, BULL CYCLE PEAK TARGETING $170K!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/YtlFn2gBqjQ</link>
      <description>Popular crypto analyst Nicholas Merten says the king cryptocurrency Bitcoin is in the middle of a push to $70,000, with one critical resistance level left in play.

Another popular analyst Plan C shares, "I do believe in diminishing returns as well as diminishing losses. My cycle peak target is 120-180k"

This was in response to Crypto Rovers tweet, "If we believe in the diminishing return structure, we should look at a Bitcoin market cycle peak somewhere around $170,000!"

      <title>887: BITCOIN HITS 2022 HIGH AS TOP CRYPTO ANALYST GIVES NEW $80,000 BTC PRICE TARGET!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/kWijInrMeOI</link>
      <description>For the first time this year, $48,000 Bitcoin price is hit, with previously cautious commentators increasingly flipping bullish on the king crypto.

Now, while acknowledging the need for a further pullback in an ideal scenario, popular trader Crypto Ed said that the time was right to be "very bullish" on BTC going forward.

"Hope for a little bit more down today, but often in these kind of bull markets, it's too much asking for," he said in his latest YouTube update.

Zooming out, Ed eyed an ongoing construction in place since the lows of summer last year. While these could technically still reappear, there were "strong doubts" about such a situation, and should the bullish follow-through occur, the target for completion was beyond current all-time highs.

"That gives me a target of around $80,000," he concluded.

      <title>886: BITCOIN CONSOLIDATION ENDS HERE, NEXT SELL AREA $230K!! YEAR-LONG CRYPTO BULL RUN IN PLAY!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/q6u52DjQi-0</link>
      <description>The last time Bitcoin closed above the EMA Ribbon was after a double bottom + Higher High, which sent the king cryptocurrency parabolic from $8,000 to $64,000.

"$230,000 is the next touch of the dotted line which is a good indicator for a possible next top of BTC.

Bitcoin initiated with the pattern since the beginning of the 2019 flip. The asset rebounded from the lows firmly at $3100 and surged high to hit $64,000 in 2021.

Further, the asset plunged and again smashed the current ATH close to $70K. In the due course, it formed a double bottom as it had formed before.

Therefore, if the BTC price follows a similar pattern then, no stronger sell area may be encountered before it smashed $200K somewhere close to the end of 2023 as predicted by the analyst.

      <title>885: MICHAEL SAYLOR PREDICTS BITCOIN HITTING $600K - SAYS THE KING CRYPTO IS UNSTOPPABLE AND WILL 100X!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/xhkKaccyz1k</link>
      <description>Microstrategy CEO and Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor expects the Bitcoin price to hit $600,000 per coin before eventually reaching $6,000,000 per BTC, noting that the king crypto is "unstoppable" and will replace gold to, “emerge as a $100 trillion asset class.”

 “Once upon a time, gold was the most desirable store of value. Now bitcoin is taking its place.”

Microstrategy described itself as “the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin in the world and the first public company to adopt bitcoin as primary treasury reserve asset.”

Its corporate strategy is to “Acquire and hold bitcoin long-term” and “purchase bitcoin through use of excess cash flows, and debt and equity transactions.”

      <title>883: BITCOIN COULD DROP TO THIS KEY SUPPORT LEVEL BEFORE EXPLODING BY OVER 230%, SAYS BLOOMBERG ANALYST!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/0rWDXQ9E5y4</link>
      <description>Senior Bloomberg strategist Mike McGlone believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could crash before hitting a six-figure price in the coming months.

In a new video interview, McGlone says that the flagship crypto is likely to fall to a key support level of $30,000 before it rallies to a price of $100,000 per coin, a gain of 230%.

“If you buy it [Bitcoin] at around $41,000, I think, maybe in less than a year, you should expect to go around $100,000.

But at these levels right now, we might easily see $30,000 first. And I fully expect that’s kind of the risk-reward because $30,000 has been the key support.”

      <title>882: HERE’S WHAT WILL PUSH BITCOIN TO $1 MILLION PER COIN, ACCORDING TO BITMEX CO-FOUNDER ARTHUR HAYES!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/6OOkeyq05vU</link>
      <description>Bitcoin is still in what some refer to as the ‘early innings’ meaning that the value of the king cryptocurrency is far from where they believe it will be in the future.

This has birthed some rather optimistic predictions for the digital asset. The latest of these predictions has come from BitMex co-founder Arthur Hayes who sees the pioneer crypto (BTC) reaching as high as $1 million per coin.

He explains that the growth in gold would also see Bitcoin grow rapidly, saying; “As gold marches its way above $10,000, bitcoin will march its way to $1,000,000. The bear market in fiat currencies will trigger the largest wealth transfer the world has ever seen.”

      <title>881: BITCOIN AND ALTCOINS WILL GO PARABOLIC IN APRIL, PREDICTS TOP CRYPTO ANALYST - HERE’S HIS TARGET!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/eGmsNq964N8</link>
      <description>Data Dash host Nicholas Merten says Bitcoin and the crypto markets are setting up for a big parabolic comeback over the coming months as he’s becoming more and more convinced that a spring cryptocurrency rally is imminent.

Merten makes the case that BTC will soon be back to $60,000, a price range not seen since November 2021. Merten also says the altcoin market, already gaining momentum, will rally in turn.

“I want to make the case that, really, as soon as later in April, if this trend plays out here, we could be back up towards that $60,000 range for Bitcoin. We could be in for a spring rally… But it’s not just Bitcoin. I want to emphasize this big time – because I understand all the while Bitcoin is obviously the most recognized currency, it is the largest crypto in the crypto space – this is unlikely to be just a Bitcoin rally."

      <link>https://youtu.be/6AAlLo8EUwM</link>
      <description>Billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya predicts is a $200,000 Bitcoin price for the king cryptocurrency and is detailing his outlook for global stock and crypto markets in the near term.

“I think that we’re in the midst of what I would call a melt-up. So probably in the next month, month and a half, there really isn’t much ‘bad news’ that hasn’t been priced in. The thing I’ve learned over the past few years is that markets don’t actually care what the news is. They can process good news and bad news equally well. What they despise is the uncertainty of what the news could be."

      <title>878: PANTERA CAPITAL CEO PREDICTS MASS ADOPTION WILL DRIVE BITCOIN UP TO $400K WITHIN NEXT THREE YEARS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Ynxacn6BDgk</link>
      <description>The chief executive of a crypto focused hedge fund thinks mass adoption could drive the price of Bitcoin (BTC) up to $400,000 per coin in as little as three years.

“Every two years, 10 times more people use cryptocurrency than they did in the past, and that’s been going on for a decade. Every two years, it’s 10 times more. And every two years, the price of crypto’s gone up 10x. And to my mind, it’s that simple that within the next 5-10 years, almost everyone with a smartphone will use cryptocurrencies, and if that’s true, they’re going to be at a much higher price.”

Morehead also unveils the catalysts that he thinks will drive Bitcoin’s price to $400,000 by 2025.

“I think it will actually be some number like that. All the use cases that are really rolling out and people are using it. Now institutional investors are really investing in the space, from taking it 10 or 20 basis points to maybe in 10 years, 8% of their portfolio.”

      <description>Bitcoin to be announced as official legal tender in Honduras, one year after El Salvador adopted the king crypto, sources say.

While the move would mark the second sovereign state to adopt BTC, Honduran President Xiomara Castro is said to have commented, “we are still early.”

“We must not allow El Salvador to be the only country escaping dollar hegemony,” Castro is said to have said. “Honduras has the right to move toward the First World.”

Castro will make an announcement on Monday morning by “putting on the lasers,” one source said.

      <title>876: BITMEX CO-FOUNDER ARTHUR HAYES PREDICTS GOLD RISING TO $10K AND BITCOIN MARCHING TO $1 MILLION!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/RiQRhM6DrkA</link>
      <description>On March 16, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitmex, published a blog post called “Energy Cancelled,” which describes the economics behind the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and makes a bullish prediction of Bitcoin marching to 7-figures.

Hayes explains in his 26-minute long opinion piece that historians may point to February 26, 2022, as the time in history when the “Petro Dollar / Euro Dollar monetary system” ended.

“For a single Bitcoin, my unit is in the millions. For an ounce of gold, my unit is in the thousands,” he continued.

“That is the magnitude of fiat denominated price that will occur in the coming years as global trade is settled via neutral hard monetary instruments and not the debt-backed fiat currencies of the West.”

      <title>875: BILLIONAIRE MIKE NOVOGRATZ PREDICTS BITCOIN WILL EXPLODE BY OVER 1,100% - HERES WHEN!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/HPUhUAMagho</link>
      <description>Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz is predicting that Bitcoin could rally by over ten times over in a new Bloomberg interview.

Novogratz says the king crypto will range for the rest of this year but will hit a six-figure price in five years as adoption of the flagship cryptocurrency grows.

“The whole year I thought we would be at $30,000 – $50,000 range in Bitcoin, risk to the upside [and] not the downside. But I think five years out if Bitcoin’s not at $500,000 I’m wrong on the adoption cycle.”

The Galaxy Digital CEO says that in 2021, the adoption of BTC happened at a faster rate than internet technology did in the 1990s.

“We see an adoption cycle that accelerates. Bitcoin grew so much faster last year [and] crypto grew [more] than the internet did its best years in the 90s. I see this going viral everywhere. If it’s in the Middle East or in you know pension funds in the United States all getting ready to participate.”

Novogratz says the king crypto will range for the rest of this year but will hit a six-figure price in five years as adoption of the flagship cryptocurrency grows.

“The whole year I thought we would be at $30,000 – $50,000 range in Bitcoin, risk to the upside [and] not the downside. But I think five years out if Bitcoin’s not at $500,000 I’m wrong on the adoption cycle.”

The Galaxy Digital CEO says that in 2021, the adoption of BTC happened at a faster rate than internet technology did in the 1990s.

“We see an adoption cycle that accelerates. Bitcoin grew so much faster last year [and] crypto grew [more] than the internet did its best years in the 90s. I see this going viral everywhere. If it’s in the Middle East or in you know pension funds in the United States all getting ready to participate.”

      <title>874: MACRO EXPERT PREDICTS HOW CANCEL-PROOF BITCOIN COULD MAKE ITS WAY ONTO CENTRAL BANK BALANCE SHEETS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/bmdIhbWYmEQ</link>
      <description>Macroeconomic guru Lyn Alden is laying out how Bitcoin can ultimately make its way onto the balance sheets of central banks of nation-states.

With countries around the world freezing and seizing assets from Russians while sanctioning the country’s assets, Alden says it is demonstrating a solid use case for Bitcoin.

"And the bigger Bitcoin gets, the more widely held it is, the more liquidity there is, the more central banks can start looking at that as a viable mutual reserve asset because it kind of fixes two things for them...

One, they have an asset that can’t be frozen by a unilateral third party, and two, they also can go around sanctions and they can have permissionless payments, and so that is something you’d think would become more attractive to countries around the world.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/nHNkH83DEEA</link>
      <description>A popular crypto strategist is outlining a path for a strong Bitcoin breakout en route to a fresh all-time high.

Pseudonymous crypto analyst Pentoshi tells his 526,300 Twitter followers that he sees a potential scenario where the king crypto continues to print bullish higher low setups and ignites a parabolic rally to $72,000.

A rally to Pentoshi’s $72K target represents an upside potential of over 83% for the leading cryptocurrency (BTC).

      <title>872: MACRO GURU RAOUL PAL UNVEILS NEW BITCOIN VALUATION MODEL WHICH PREDICTS $700K PER COIN!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/b2lPq5Cr2nA</link>
      <description>Cryptocurrency assets are growing at a far faster pace than the internet, according to macroeconomic expert Raoul Pal.

Pal is also detailing specific price targets for Bitcoin based on various rates of adoption moving forward.

“Assuming BTC remains one standard deviation below trend it gives a price target of $600,000. If it slows to two standard deviations below trend, then you get a number of around $300,000.

Maybe the regression trend should be taken from 2013 to avoid the very early spike. That gives slower growth and lower targets. That gives trend at $700,000, one standard deviation [above] at $350,000 and two standard deviations at $200,000.”

      <title>870: IS THAT YOU SATOSHI?! OVER $20M IN BITCOIN SUDDENLY MOVES AFTER LYING LOW SINCE 2010!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/yZVy0Ij8vP4</link>
      <description>A long-dormant Bitcoin whale has emerged after more than a decade of inactivity, according to whale-tracking bot Whale Alert.

Whale Alert finds that the address, which was last active in October 2010, recently moved 489 Bitcoin worth over $20 million at time of transfer.

The last time the inoperative address was functioning, Bitcoin was trading at a price of about $0.17. The top crypto asset by market cap has appreciated a staggering 23,150,500% during the time the address’s period of inactivity.

      <description>Bitbull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale thinks Bitcoin is still on track to reach $100,000 within the next 24 months despite the bearish sentiment dominating the crypto markets since the start of the year.

“I think 2023 is a safe bet. We might need some time during 2022 to take a breath and to kind of let out some of the steam,” DiPasquale said.

“We are reaching higher lows and even higher highs”, he added, commenting on BTC's price movement in the last few months.

      <title>868: LEAKED: YELLEN ON BIDENS CRYPTO EXECUTIVE ORDER! BITCOIN WILL BENEFIT FROM NEW MONETARY WORLD ORDER!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/84HOBhhEir4</link>
      <description>United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's comments on President Biden's long anticipated 'Crypto Executive Order' were accidentally posted a day early (now removed), but nonetheless captured and leaked regarding Bitcoin / digital assets calls for efforts to support innovation while addressing risk in the industry.

Yellen’s statement said that the cryptocurrency executive order could “result in substantial benefits for the nation, consumers, and businesses.”

In other breaking BTC news today: Credit Suisse with over $800 Billion in assets under management just said in a recent newsletter that a new world monetary order is coming and “after this war is over money will never be the same again… and Bitcoin will probably benefit from all of this.”

      <title>867: BITCOIN BILLIONAIRE PREDICTS $1M PER COIN, SAYS CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ON BTC AND CRYPTO IS WRONG!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/RhfvBta50C0</link>
      <description>Bitcoin billionaire and venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, who happens to be an early BTC adopter predicts the king cryptocurrency to surpass $1 million per coin within the next 15 years as well as hit $200K in the years ahead.

The Bitcoin O.G. believes it’s now best to view both the king crypto and the US dollar in a narrow lens by tracking their relative strength alongside direct competitors.

“Conventional wisdom is that the war in Ukraine is the crypto boon we’ve all been waiting for and that the USD is on its last legs. But in reality, BTC and USD are both winning right now. Here’s a more nuanced take…

BTC is separating itself as an institutional grade safe haven vs EVERY other crypto asset AND the US denominated assets are well bid vs assets in other currencies.

When BTC falls, other cryptos fall more. When US assets fall, other non-US denominated assets/currencies get smoked.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/8MvQ34gOBIo</link>
      <description>The founder of Skybridge Capital, Anthony Scaramucci, has doubled down on his $100K Bitcoin price prediction. He also believes that the king cryptocurrency (BTC) could reach $500K a coin in the long run. 

"But if you’re willing to zoom out and look at the long term chart and look at the adoption story, could bitcoin get to a half a million dollars a coin? I believe it will."

"But we’ve got some work to do here from a regulatory perspective,” he stressed. The executive also advised how an average investor should get into bitcoin.

      <title>865: ANALYST WHO CALLED 2021 BITCOIN COLLAPSE MAPS OUT KING CRYPTO PATH AHEAD! MEXICO FULL BTC ADOPTION!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/qHJYoF9VoyQ</link>
      <description>The crypto analyst who called Bitcoin’s collapse in May 2021 unveils the potential path for the king cryptocurrency to reach the six-figure mark this year.

“One for the bulls. Aligning the micro with the macro. $100,000 within striking distance this year…”

While Dave the Wave’s chart shows a strong rally to roughly $120,000 by late this year, it also forecasts a deep capitulation to around the $25,000 mark before any bullish action can start.

      <title>864: RUSSIA INVASION WILL BOOST PRICE OF BITCOIN AND CRYPTO ASSETS, ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/O7XGgwROvrc</link>
      <description>Bloomberg Intelligence says that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could aid in driving up the prices of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

“The Russia-Ukraine conflict may mark another step in Bitcoin’s maturation toward becoming the global digital collateral. Spiking energy prices are a reminder of the benefits of embracing technology, and North America achieving the status of net fossil-fuel exporter.

Supply, demand, adoption and human ingenuity point to Bitcoin regaining the upper hand vs. crude oil in 2022.”

      <title>863: FULL-BLOWN CRYPTO RALLY IMMINENT!! RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR CAN PUSH BITCOIN TO $50K BY END OF MONTH!!   </title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/TBHaMeiA2ZE</link>
      <description>The war pushed many individuals to look for financial alternatives such as cryptocurrency, which could drive Bitcoin to $50,000 by the end of the month, the CEO of DeVere Group, Nigel Green claimed.

“As banks close, ATMs run out of money, threats of personal savings being taken to pay for the war, and the major international payments system SWIFT is weaponized, amongst other factors, the case for a viable, decentralized, borderless, tamper-proof, unconfiscatable monetary system has been laid bare.”

Assuming the Western world keeps imposing penalties on Russia, Bitcoin might tap $50K by the end of the month, Green forecasted.

“I still have my skepticism, but there are hundreds and millions of people in this world today who disagree with that. To the extent that we’re trying to help institutions and investors solve their portfolio allocation problems, we have to give serious consideration to being a market maker in crypto.”

      <title>860: BITCOIN BULL MICHAEL SAYLOR MAKES WILD $6 MILLION PRICE PREDICTION!! eBAY TO ADD CRYPTO PAYMENTS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/j4SJEPqqQXQ</link>
      <description>MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who's transformed his business intelligence company into a Bitcoin acquisition vehicle, expects the king cryptocurrency to eventually hit $6 million per BTC and in a new interview reveals the factors that he believes are contributing to the wild price swings in the crypto markets.

“The volatility is driven by the immaturity of the asset class. The lack of wash trading rules – you can buy and sell [crypto assets] within the same hour…I think that’s fairly immature.

I think 20x leverage on the off-shore exchanges, I think the Wild West of crypto derivatives, the cross-collateralization of altcoins into ETH [or] BTC through decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges on a Saturday night through a very thin piece of liquidity on the 177th-biggest coin – all of those things are a recipe for volatility.”

      <title>859: KEVIN O’LEARY REVEALS WHAT WILL DRIVE BITCOIN TO $300K!! UKRAINE TARGETS RUSSIAN CRYPTO WALLETS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/vdyi_8RGg7Q</link>
      <description>Crypto bull Kevin O’Leary who is a prominent figure on the popular show Shark Tank recently shared his bullish 6-figure Bitcoin predictions and what he believes will drive the leading cryptocurrency (BTC) to that point.

“You want to talk about bitcoin going to $100K, $200K, $300K, it’s going to happen when institutions can finally buy it,” the millionaire added. However, he also noted that bitcoin itself would have to be compliant if these institutions are going to invest in it. “When they do get that go-ahead, the price of the coin is going to appreciate dramatically,” O’Leary concluded.

      <title>858: HERE’S HOW BITCOIN CAN EXPLODE TO $50,000 IN MARCH, ACCORDING TO TOP CRYPTO ANALYST!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/arTFFH6wwdY</link>
      <description>Popular crypto analyst Justin Bennett is plotting out a roadmap for how Bitcoin can recapture the $50,000 level in the coming weeks.

“I want to show you what I’m looking for in March – this potential setup that could have Bitcoin trading up toward the $50,000 area over the next few weeks."

Bennett cites two key levels which, if reached, could launch BTC back above $50,000.

“We need to see a daily close above $39,600. Also a daily close above $46,000 area.

That will expose this area between $50,000 and $53,000. This has been a key level on the chart for the past few months.”

      <title>857: NEW BITCOIN ATH IN PLAY AS CRYPTO MARKET SETTING UP FOR BULLISH 2ND HALF THIS YEAR DESPITE SELL-OFF!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/jkQyA7taeR8</link>
      <description>In a new Yahoo Finance interview, Bitwise Asset Management chief investment officer (CIO) Matt Hougan says that Bitcoin and crypto prices will rally during the second half of the year.

“It always is uncomfortable when the market goes down. But I think we’re actually setting up for an extraordinarily strong second half of the year.

I think there are short-term hurdles in front of us, but as I look at the underlying trends, I’m extremely bullish about where we end up by the end of this year.

I wouldn’t be surprised to see [Bitcoin] challenge and even surpass the previous all-time highs as long as things break along positive lines."

      <title>855: BITCOIN CRASH - UKRAINE IS BETTER ARMED THAN RUSSIA IN CRYPTO ADOPTION AS WAR BREAKS OUT!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/5_ldDO_vIh4</link>
      <description>Bitcoin crashed to $34,300 this morning along with traditional financial markets as Russia declared war on Ukraine early Thursday.

Ukraine has an advantage in terms of crypto adoption over Russia, research shows, as the latter launches an invasion of Ukraine.

While Russian President Vladimir Putin has authorized a full-scale war on Ukraine, with Bitcoin playing a vital role on both sides of the fight, Ukraine appears to be better prepared to embrace the fledgling financial technology.

      <link>https://youtu.be/nnE3RsJf50Y</link>
      <description>Canada’s war on Bitcoin appears to be backfiring as the country’s flagship exchange-traded fund (ETF) adds thousands of BTC.

Data from on-chain monitoring resource Coinglass shows that over the two weeks to Feb. 23, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF has increased its holdings from 28,854 BTC to 32,257 BTC - 11.8%.

“Canada warning everyone to get their coins off the exchanges because they will take them is the most incredible advertisement for Bitcoin I’ve seen in my entire life,” podcast host Dennis Porter wrote.

      <title>853: VETERAN TRADER UNVEILS ‘REALISTIC’ BEARISH BITCOIN PRICE TARGET, WARNS CRYPTO COULD BE IN TROUBLE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/lg00JSQKROo</link>
      <description>Seasoned cryptocurrency trader Tone Vays warns Bitcoin (BTC) traders that the king crypto is at risk of igniting another sell-off event.

“We are below all the moving averages… The [200-day] moving average is about to start declining. That is not a good sign… This is a bad-looking daily chart. If this candle closes below $38,500, it is pretty bad… This arrow [pointing to $25,000] is somewhat realistic…

There is a possibility of a snapback to the [50-day] moving average… We may be double bottoming again with $36,500 and then from there, this disaster can occur.”

      <title>851: WARREN BUFFETT’S SHOCKING CRYPTO BET SUPPORTS $1M BITCOIN PRICE PREDICTION!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/LvnNiZlOp4w</link>
      <description>The “Sage of Omaha”, Warren Buffett, is quietly coming around to crypto. A recent Berkshire Hathaway filling reveals it dumped shares in legacy financials Visa and Mastercard and sank $1 billion into a crypto-friendly neobank.

For the world’s biggest cryptocurrency critic, that’s a big change of heart. In 2020, he said: “cryptocurrencies basically have no value and they don’t produce anything,” adding “I don’t have any cryptocurrency and I never will.”

Buffett’s U-turn hints at a critical point in institutional crypto adoption that could put a rocket under BTC and crypto demand (and prices) in the coming years.

      <title>850: HERE’S THE 'WORST CASE' SCENARIO FOR BITCOIN AND CRYPTO MARKETS, ACCORDING TO TOP ANALYST!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/h1mRvryiqNw</link>
      <description>Popular cryptocurrency analyst and DataDash host Nicholas Merten has an optimistic view on the future Bitcoin price action despite the leading crypto’s most recent market dip.

Merten then says Bitcoin prices could fall back even lower, possibly another 25% from current levels, in a worst-case scenario.

“We’ve really got a chance here, and I’ll say it more than I think most people will, that we might have gotten it wrong here, and prices might roll back down to this range [around $30,000]. 

I think that’s the worst-case scenario here for crypto, that we come back down to this consolidation range, kind of like we did back [in June 2021], even though we [recently] had a more heightened breakout in prices.”

      <title>849: BITCOIN WILL RALLY DRAMATICALLY TO $300K IN NEXT 2-3 YEARS, SAYS SHARK TANK STAR KEVIN O’LEARY!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/mpYWbn6joog</link>
      <description>Shark Tank star and billionaire investor Kevin O’Leary is predicting that Bitcoin, (the king crypto) will surge in value once regulatory clarity is in place.

“At some point in the next two to three years, the US regulator is going to rule on cryptocurrencies. And they will rule first on stablecoins and Bitcoin itself… And the very large assets by market cap.

As soon as that happens, if I’m running a sovereign fund or a pension plan I’m going to allocate to it probably one to three percent. And I want to long Bitcoin when that happens.

You want to talk about Bitcoin going to $100,000, $200,000 $300,000, it’s going to be when institutions can finally buy it.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/wufbPS0-dlg</link>
      <description>A popular crypto strategist and trader is predicting that a parabolic rally is in store for Bitcoin in the coming months as he unveils his huge price target for BTC this year.

“The prices are going to start moving higher, getting back above this previous resistance range, setting in new all-time highs, and potentially making that range support and having one final spring-up rally going into the close of the year sometime in November.

That’s our target. We’ve been talking about Bitcoin reaching $150k, $200k in that time frame.”

      <description>Plan B still believes that the king crypto will inevitably skyrocket to $100,000 or more and reveals when he sees it happening in his latest update on Twitter.

Bitcoin is heading towards $100,000 by the end of next year, according to both the stock-to-flow model and the logarithmic regression, asserted the man behind them – Plan B. This comes despite the recent failures of the S2F and the analyst’s “worst-case scenario.”

Later on, Plan B explained that he had compared Bitcoin to other assets like gold, whose stock-to-flow ratio sits around 60 as its market cap is at $10 trillion and real estate. The latter’s S2F ratio is at 100, with a market cap ten times larger than gold’s.

      <title>845: BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR BILL MILLER HAS ‘VERY BIG’ BITCOIN POSITION, PREDICTS 50X UPSIDE POTENTIAL!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/n5Q87ZhCBGo</link>
      <description>Veteran billionaire investor and fund manager Bill Miller says he has “a very big position” in Bitcoin and expects the king crypto to see a lot of institutional adoption this year, particularly among endowments and foundations.

"Bitcoin is insurance against financial catastrophe as we see in Lebanon, or in Afghanistan, or many of these other countries where we saw around the time of the pandemic.

I think the average investor should ask himself or herself what do you have in your portfolio that has that kind of track record — number one; is very, very underpenetrated; can provide a service of insurance against financial catastrophe that no one else can provide; and can go up ten times or fifty times. The answer is: nothing.”

      <title>844: MICHAEL SAYLOR SAYS BITCOIN WILL 100X - HERE’S HOW!! WHAT CRYPTO GOING MAINSTREAM LOOKS LIKE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/JYp5Fwdns6U</link>
      <description>MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor talked about why bitcoin is the best store of value in a new interview, soon after vowing to stick with buying the digital asset even as it comes under pressure.

“There’s a $500 trillion monetary planet and the outer layer is currency, then you’ve got stocks, bonds, real estate. There’s $10 trillion worth of gold in there, $1 trillion of bitcoin in there. Bitcoin is going to flip gold, and it’s going to subsume the entire gold market cap...

“Then it’s going to subsume negative-yielding sovereign debt and other monetary indexes until it grows to $100 trillion. Once it gets to $10 trillion, its volatility will be dramatically less,” Saylor said. “As it marches toward $100 trillion, you’re going to see the growth rates fall, the volatility fall, and it’s going to be a stabilizing influence in the entire financial system of the 21st century.”

      <title>843: BITCOIN BULL MAX KEISER HAS ‘HIGH HOPES’ FOR EL SALVADOR’S BTC VOLCANO BONDS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/fduU8vTRdMI</link>
      <description>In conversation with Diario El Salvador, Max Keiser said El Salvador could become a Bitcoin ‘hub’ for Central and Latin America. He noted that London was one of the three largest financial centers in the world before Brexit and made a large part of the European bonds, executing big deals in the Forex market.

Keiser is hopeful that El Salvador would become a ‘hub’ and a financial center in Latin America with the king of all crypto in the picture.

“The interest of Salvadoran citizens in bitcoin has grown because Salvadorans have their own bank account on their phones. People who were not banked, which was 70% or more, now with Chivo wallet and other wallets have the opportunity to have financial services.”

      <description>JPMorgan has increased its long-term Bitcoin price prediction.

The new BTC price prediction is a level that would put the Bitcoin total market value on par with that of all gold held privately for investment purposes, they added.

      <title>839: BITCOIN WILL COST AT LEAST $5M IF THIS HAPPENS! GLOBAL CRYPTO ADOPTION HYPER-INFLECTION POINT NEAR!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/-yKaQb11nq4</link>
      <description>Could Bitcoin really be worth more than $5 million per coin if everyone in the world clearly understood exactly what it is? Absolutely according to Crypto value investor Mike Alfred.

"If everyone already understood Bitcoin it would cost at least $5,000,000 to buy one. Be thankful."

Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the research division of Wells Fargo Wealth and Investment Management, has released a report highlighting the potential of cryptocurrencies as an investment opportunity akin to the early days of the internet.

“If this trend continues, cryptocurrencies could soon exit the early adoption phase and enter an inflection point of hyper-adoption, similar to other technologies,” said the report.

"There is a point where adoption rates begin to rise and do not look back [...] Precise numbers aside, there is no doubt that global cryptocurrency adoption is rising, and could soon hit a hyper-inflection point.”

      <itunes:summary>Could Bitcoin really be worth more than $5 million per coin if everyone in the world clearly understood exactly what it is? Absolutely according to Crypto value investor Mike Alfred.

"If everyone already understood Bitcoin it would cost at least $5,000,000 to buy one. Be thankful."

Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the research division of Wells Fargo Wealth and Investment Management, has released a report highlighting the potential of cryptocurrencies as an investment opportunity akin to the early days of the internet.

“If this trend continues, cryptocurrencies could soon exit the early adoption phase and enter an inflection point of hyper-adoption, similar to other technologies,” said the report.

"There is a point where adoption rates begin to rise and do not look back [...] Precise numbers aside, there is no doubt that global cryptocurrency adoption is rising, and could soon hit a hyper-inflection point.”

      <title>836: SAMSON MOW PREDICTS $100K BITCOIN BY JUNE!! HERE’S WHAT COULD SEND BTC SOARING TO 6-FIGURES!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/rx_vY7isEh0</link>
      <description>Blockstream CSO and architect of the Bitcoin Bonds in El Salvador, Samson Mow predicts the BTC price hitting $100,000 by June as he shared in a recent tweet on Crypto twitter:

"Bitcoin $100k by June."

Despite the recent downfall of the cryptocurrency market, the projection of Bitcoin to cross the $100k threshold remains seen as a matter of time.

Back in December, Bloomberg Intelligence indicated that the anticipated mark would happen eventually “due to the economic basics of increasing demand vs. decreasing supply,” and new data shed some light on that idea.

According to RT host of the Kieser Report, Keiser claims to have evidence from internal sources who will allegedly confirm this upcoming announcement.

      <title>831: BITCOIN CRASH WILL BE FOLLOWED BY 14X RETURNS, PREDICTS SKYBRIDGE CEO SCARAMUCCI - HERE’S WHEN!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/BWi9b1n7njI</link>
      <description>SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci is optimistic that Bitcoin will ultimately be worth $500,000 per BTC despite the recent Crypto crash which he discussed in a recent interview on Kitco News.

"For Bitcoin, since it’s a network, you have to be focused on the wallet growth and the interaction among the people in the network, and so I ultimately think Bitcoin will be worth a half a million dollars. It’ll probably take four to five years. The ride will be rocky but certainly worth it.”

      <title>829: BITCOIN EXPECTED TO PEAK AT $94K THIS YEAR! ARIZONA INTRODUCES CRYPTO BILL TO MAKE BTC LEGAL TENDER!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/oKT9_dGRt1Y</link>
      <description>Finder’s panel of 33 fintech specialists has forecasted that the Bitcoin (BTC) price will peak at about $94K before ending the year above $76K. In addition, the panel expects the price of the king crypto to reach $192,800 in 2025 and $406,400 in 2030.

While several panelists said that “increasing interest rates will negatively impact the cryptocurrency market,” some believe that it is time to buy BTC, including Finder’s founder, Fred Schebesta.

"Cryptocurrencies are proving to be a staple competitor to the traditional financial infrastructure of the world, and many projects are now well beyond the theoretical realm of potential value and into reliable delivery."

      <title>824: ‘RICH DAD, POOR DAD’ AUTHOR REVEALS BITCOIN BTFD ALERT PRICE, SAYS BTC CRASH IS TIME TO GET RICHER!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/UBGkjipRbg4</link>
      <description>The American businessman and author - Robert Kiyosaki - is not concerned about the recent Bitcoin price drop in the crypto market. He described the currency BTC plunge as “great news” and vowed to increase his exposure to the asset should its USD value dip to $20,000.

The 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' best-selling author shared the following on Crypto Twitter:

"WOW: Words of Wisdom. “Your profits are made when you buy, not when you sell.” Price of Bitcoin crashing. Great news. I bought BC at $6K and 9K. I will buy more if and when BC tests $20k. Time to get richer is coming. Silver best bargain today. Silver still 50% below high."

      <title>823: BITCOIN WORST-CASE SCENARIO REVEALED BY CRYPTO ANALYST WHO NAILED BTC BOTTOM IN 2018!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/40l3SmNmzqo</link>
      <description>The crypto trader who accurately predicted Bitcoin’s lowest point during the 2018 bear market believes that BTC will record new all-time highs this year despite its bearish price action over the last two months.

Pseudonymous crypto analyst Smart Contracter tells his 203,400 Twitter followers that he thinks Bitcoin will print a new 52-week low in the coming weeks before rallying above $100,000 by the end of the year.

“Ok fine, for the lulz. I’m calling a bottom at exactly $25,800 with a $1,000 leeway on either side.”

      <title>822: BITCOIN BULL MICHAEL SAYLOR UNVEILS 2 FACTORS BEHIND THIS CRYPTO MARKET CRASH!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/ZnEJd9K9YN4</link>
      <description>In a new Bloomberg interview, Bitcoin Bull and Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor unveils two factors that he says are contributing to the volatility experienced by the crypto markets so far this year.

“I think that there’s a lot of dynamics here. If you look at the entire crypto ecosystem, you have a set of regulatory uncertainty, especially regulatory uncertainty around stablecoins and crypto tokens and whether or not they’re securities. And that creates a little bit of anxiety.

You have a lot of leverage offshore. You have a lot of crypto exchanges that can trade with up to 20x leverage. And those crypto exchanges have many, many tokens that are cross-collateralized. Between them and the decentralized finance [DeFi] exchanges, you can get much higher than 20x leverage. So that’s the second source of volatility.”

      <title>821: BITCOIN CAN CRASH TO $29K MAX PAIN WARNS ANALYST, COULD BE CATALYST FOR BTC TO HIT 6-FIGURES!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/D3lDozNl9Jc</link>
      <description>As Bitcoin dumps to hit six-month lows near $37K per BTC popular crypto analyst Nicholas Merten says that Bitcoin is likely to experience a significant price drop [$29,000 to $30,000], but such a sell-off might be the catalyst that finally sends the leading crypto past $100,000.

“We may be on the verge of a pretty harsh correction of over a 20% to 30% decline in Bitcoin’s price.

I believe that we’re still in a bull market, not a bear market… It’s very likely that we could see this correction, but at the same time, it could be the catalyst to finally set ourselves up on the next uptrend and charter towards the $150k range, $200k range for Bitcoin.”

      <title>820: BITCOIN WILL SKYROCKET TO $200,000 PER BTC, PREDICTS SOCIAL CAPITAL CEO CHAMATH PALIHAPITIYA!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/mNGzLSl4EXc</link>
      <description>Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya sees Bitcoin eventually expanding into a six-digit price territory. The former Facebook executive also doubled-down on his belief that BTC is an insurance policy that will thrive in the current times of economic uncertainty, but it will grow to something “much more important.”

“Can you play the clip in 2012-2013 when it was at $200, and everybody was laughing at me at CNBC when I was talking about bitcoin?

Where is it going? It’s probably going to $100,000 to $150,000, then to $200,000. In what period – I don’t know – 5 years, 10 years, but it’s going there.”

      <title>818: BITCOIN BULL MAX KEISER UPDATES $220K BTC PREDICTION - HERE’S HIS TIMELINE!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Gzu2TahDfvs</link>
      <description>Bitcoin Maximalist Max Keiser says that Bitcoin (BTC) will reach $220,000 at some point this year.

In a new interview with Daniela Cambone of Stansberry Research, Keiser explains why his six-digit forecast for the flagship cryptocurrency did not happen in 2021.

“As far as 2021 goes, I said we’re going to get to $220,000 per coin, which is a typical four-year cycle. What we had in 2021 was that massive China collapse in mining, in hash power. The mining and the hash power collapsed 50%. We have since recovered that now, and we’re about to hit new all-time high in hash rate. That’s why I’m pushing my $220,000 target from 2021 to 2022.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/UINfTcg_5L4</link>
      <description>Retail giant Walmart submitted a total of seven patent filings, signaling plans to create its own digital currency and NFT collection.

The multinational retailer filed several new trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Dec. 30, however, they remained unnoticed until a Sunday report by CNBC shed more light on Walmart’s ambitions.

Walmart filed a total of seven patent applications at the time, including three under its existing advertising division “Walmart Connect.”

      <title>815: MAX KEISER PREDICTS G7 COUNTRY WILL START MINING BITCOIN IN 2022 WITH 100% GUARANTEED CERTAINTY!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/GyVS7oHoKew</link>
      <description>In a recent interview with Stansberry Research, Bitcoin Maximalist Max Keiser predicts that a G7 country mining BTC will kickstart a new hashrate war, which he compares to the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union that kicked off when the latter launched the Sputnik 1 satellite into earth orbit in 1957:
"I think once a country in the G7 starts to accumulate and mine Bitcoin, it will set off like a space race." 
Keiser says that such a scenario is a “one hundred percent guaranteed certainty.”

      <title>811: BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR BILL MILLER PUTS 50% OF NET WORTH IN BITCOIN, SAYS BTC CAN GO UP 50X!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/4AeuPoycy5Q</link>
      <description>Legendary billionaire investor Bill Miller is bullish on Bitcoin despite the cryptocurrency touching multi-month lows below $40,000 in early January 2022. Miller no longer considers himself just a “Bitcoin observer” but rather a real BTC bull and now holds 50% of his net worth in Bitcoin.
﻿“I think the average investor should ask himself or herself what do you have in your portfolio that has that kind of track record - number one; is very, very underpenetrated; can provide a service of insurance against financial catastrophe that no one else can provide; and can go up ten times or fifty times. The answer is: nothing.”

      <title>810: IS BITCOIN MIMICKING RISE OF AMAZON?! MOST BULLISH MACRO BACKDROP IN 75 YEARS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/gAhGi-cRDFU</link>
      <description>Macro guru and Real Vision chief executive Raoul Pal is looking at the historical price action of e-commerce titan Amazon and comparing it to the performance of Bitcoin (BTC) since 2013. According to the macro guru, if Bitcoin is to follow Amazon’s price action in 2010, it is possible for the leading cryptocurrency to revisit crucial support at $30,000. Pal also adds that based on Metcalfe’s Law, Bitcoin’s value should be hovering around $100,000, suggesting that BTC is tremendously undervalued at its current price.

      <title>809: BITCOIN EYES DROP TO $35K AS BTC PRICE PAINTS ‘DEATH CROSS’!! CRYPTO FEAR HITS 5 MONTH LOW!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Q64H9CE9Qwo</link>
      <description>Bitcoin formed a 'Death Cross' trading pattern on Jan. 8 that is widely watched by traditional chartists for its ability to anticipate further BTC price losses.
In detail, Bitcoin's 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA) fell below its 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA), forming a so-called “death cross.” The pattern appeared as BTC underwent a rough ride in the previous two months, falling over 40% from its record high of $69,000.

      <title>801: BITCOIN HAS RISEN 7%-36% FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY EACH YEAR SINCE 2018!! BTC TO EXPLODE 400% IN 2022!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/lSMmmyyJyVQ</link>

      <link>https://youtu.be/hv0gQhn3dOg</link>
      <description>Macro Guru and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says institutional and retail investors could ultimately start feeding off each other’s movements, starting a loop of FOMO (fear of missing out).

“New capital will flow in over time and a broader rally, when it arrives, will bring retail investors and a reflexive loop of institutional investors FOMO’ing in. That day will come.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/HtBf5PX3Z_s</link>
      <description>Tom Lee states that Bitcoin could explode up to four times from current levels by the end of next year.

“Now, in terms of percentage upside, again I’m kind of disappointed it didn’t reach $100,000 this year, but I think next year [it will] easily get to the $100,000, but…

Let’s say that it should have been $100,000 this year, so maybe Bitcoin is in that $200,000 range [next year].”

      <title>798: BITCOIN CAN HIT $333K ‘PARABOLICALLY’ BY MAY 2022, IF THIS BTC PRICE FRACTAL PLAYS OUT!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/SMEtWwQwGZ8</link>
      <description>Bitcoin could target a massive $333,000 by May 2022 if the U.S. Federal Reserve provides a "perfect storm" of low rates, a new BTC price prediction argues.

"To get there parabolically, we would probably need a perfect storm of the Fed being unable to raise rates (which are probably priced in) and heightened inflation, leading to a flight to safety in BTC."

      <link>https://youtu.be/iznmbIKaZoY</link>
      <description>Popular crypto analyst Nicholas Merten is plotting a potential price path for Bitcoin that could see BTC quadruple in price to $200,000.

If we do that here, if we add an additional 12 months, we meet in the middle between the [previous] averages, we can see here that we’re on a good roadmap to be able to reach some kind of parabolic target like $200,000 later on in 2022.”

      <title>792: BITCOIN WILL SEE ANOTHER 80% CRASH NEXT CRYPTO WINTER AFTER HITTING $288K, SAYS QUANT ANALYST PLAN B</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/O3cfoBKlDQs</link>
      <description>Quantitative analyst PlanB is saying that Bitcoin will experience a severe bear market despite claims to the contrary by other experts.

“I think we will have to go up quite a bit, at least to make the stock-to-flow model values of $100K and $288K. But after that, we’ll go down 80% again… I guess that’s part of the deal, and it’s also part of the greed and fear that’s in investors.

      <link>https://youtu.be/l3MzN_xsXJw</link>
      <description>Closely followed crypto analyst Nicholas Merten says Bitcoin could be mirroring a technical price pattern previously displayed in the S&amp;P 500 index.
 
In fact, it may be only the catalyst to set up a long-term accumulation pattern that will then allow for Bitcoin to regain market dominance, spring higher, and revisit that $150K to $100K level that we’re confident in enough.

      <link>https://youtu.be/fI7oS6tu7_0</link>
      <description>A popular crypto analyst is saying that Bitcoin is due for a steep rally to the six-figure level as BTC follows a widely-known pattern.

“That would mean over the next month or two, we would expect a move back up toward the $50,000 to $60,000 to form our first floor. And this could potentially lead us to into a final mania phase all the way up to the $200,000 level.”

      <description>Plan B says that Bitcoin has yet to peak this cycle based on the crypto asset’s current value and historical data.

“I don’t think $69K was the top for this halving cycle. If $69K were the top, then a typical bear market -80% drawdown would bring the bottom to $14K… below 2017 ATH ($20K) and below 200 weekly moving average ($18K).”

      <title>779: BITCOIN WILL STABILIZE AROUND 100X THE PRICE OF AN OUNCE OF GOLD AS MONEY MANAGERS ALLOCATE TO BTC!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/AQo7PCBj4eM</link>
      <description>Bloomberg’s head commodity strategist Mike McGlone says the crypto markets look poised for a bullish 2022, with Bitcoin and Ethereum set to lead the charge.

In the long term, the commodity strategist says that Bitcoin could ultimately find a stable price somewhere in the neighborhood of 100x the price of an ounce of gold, which right now would be $178,300.

      <link>https://youtu.be/kiQ0H0aBTBM</link>
      <description>Bitcoin has not died for the 500th time, but market fear could easily convince you otherwise as analysts predict a slow return to higher levels.

BTC starts a new week with traders still digesting the impact of the last - a major price drop that at one point saw $41,900.

A modest recovery is now competing with some formidable resistance, the first of which is $50,000.

      <link>https://youtu.be/yoRy5RK1Q9M</link>
      <description>Bobby Lee thinks Bitcoin still has a long way to go before reaching a peak this cycle.

"I think there’s a good chance we’ll hit the peak either later this year or maybe early next year. But I think we’re still on for December. We’ll see a rally coming up. And when we do hit the peak, it’s going to go very fast and easily surpass $150,000 to $200,000.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/uTtkqsfoJ1Q</link>

      <description>Analyst TechDev shared his latest Bitcoin price prediction by January with his 239,000+ Twitter followers:

"Mid-Dec to End-Jan with a ~$230K top remains my base case. Obviously the earlier side of that window looks less likely. I couldn't care less if it's right. I've seen compelling work suggesting a top from mid-Dec to mid-March, with targets from $120K-$260K."

      <link>https://youtu.be/vax4SwhEZME</link>
      <description>Bitcoin has stabilized at around $55K after dropping by $6K in a single day - but crypto sentiment is still in shock.

Meanwhile, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele bought the Bitcoin dip again, investing more than $5 million into BTC as price dropped under $54K Friday.

With the addition of the 100 Bitcoin, El Salvador now holds 1,220 BTC, worth roughly $66.3 million.

      <description>Major Bitcoin innovator Blockstream, says it’s only a matter of time before the Bitcoin price hits $1 million.

"If Bitcoin at the 5-year mark reaches $1 million, which I think it will, they will sell Bitcoin in 2 quarters and recoup that $500 million dollars. In three and a half quarters, they will have enough to pay back the entire bond. I think that’s pretty good.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/lp1HtR_CR68</link>
      <description>Raoul Pal says Bitcoin and Crypto is on the verge of exponential growth as the space sees lightning-fast adoption.

“Right now, it’s a $2.5 trillion asset class. Most of the major asset classes around the world, equities, bonds, real estate, are between $150-$350 trillion, so I think this goes to $200 trillion in the next 10 years, so that’s a 100x for an asset class."

We will soon see another bull run in Bitcoin of a magnitude that will put even the dot-com bubble to shame.

And we're already seeing the first signs. In fact, thanks to a single metric – scarcity – BTC could be worth 16x as much as it is today, surpassing $1 million per coin in the years to come.

“The S2X ($288k) model will be invalidated but the S2F ($100k) model will remain intact which predicts Bitcoin will reach $1 million dollars by 2025.

      <title>746: BITCOIN WILL PEAK AT $235K, ETHEREUM AT $22K THIS CYCLE IF 2016 HALVING BTC BULL RUN REPEATS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/XrxjlzR2iTM</link>
      <description>Bitcoin price may be over seven times higher than at its last halving, but if history repeats, that number could grow another 300% with a BTC price peak as much as $253,800.

Ethereum saw much larger comparative gains relative to Bitcoin - 120 times its halving price marked last cycle’s peak in 2018. Thus, a repeat performance would mean ETH/USD trading at $22,300.

      <title>720: BLOOMBERG FORSEES BITCOIN RALLYING TO $400K THIS YEAR!! 5 COUNTRIES TO LEGALIZE BTC IN 2022!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/rStdsctmOvc</link>
      <description>It may sound like a pretty outlandish claim for anyone to assert that the Bitcoin price could hit $400,000 before the end of the year. But when such a claim comes from a reputable analytics firm, it is worth paying attention to it.

Analysts at Bloomberg Crypto in a monthly report have predicted that BTC could soar up to new highs of $400,000 this year in 2021.

      <link>https://youtu.be/dQ_MxmlTO4k</link>
      <description>Cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe is saying that Bitcoin (BTC) is set to hit a six-figure price in the current bullish cycle.

The crypto analyst says Bitcoin is likely to replicate a previous pattern, when BTC surged from around $15,000 to slightly over $63,000, before possibly reaching a new all-time high of at least $250,000.

      <link>https://youtu.be/buwxasE_kiU</link>
      <description>Bitcoin has the potential to push its prices to between $250K-$350K by the end of 2021, a long-standing fractal suggests.

The analogy appeared in anticipation that Bitcoin could post a 2017-like bull run, in which the price rose by more than 1,900%.

"Somewhere 2017 we are. Heavy breakout to come at a later stage to ~$250-350K and then landing on $65K in the bear market for Bitcoin."

      <link>https://youtu.be/IUbU-HeDp8M</link>
      <description>Veteran trader Tone Vays says Bitcoin is now in the process of targeting $100K within the coming months.

      <link>https://youtu.be/Si5F-Ad3nrw</link>
      <description>Bitcoin will soar to $500K because the US will start a war with Iran and Venezuela – of the hash-rate rather than the military variety – and the first salvoes may soon be fired, according to Bitcoin O.G. Max Keiser.

Max says bitcoin represents the “reformation of free speech,” something governments deny citizens by controlling the currency they use.

      <link>https://youtu.be/01kGlh9nDQ8</link>
      <description>The CEO of blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis is optimistic that the Bitcoin price will rise above $100,000 before the end of 2021.

“I think we are still in the bull market. I think we can see above a $100k by the end of the year, so I would be bullish on that as well. Long term, I would probably usually say the Moon is the limit but we can go beyond that as well.”

      <link>https://youtu.be/s_GtkWV26LA</link>
      <description>Dan Held at crypto exchange Kraken, says that Bitcoin could surge by over 500% if BTC follows the cycle of its 2013 bull run.

“If we repeat 2013, we could see Bitcoin hitting between $300,000-$400,000 Bitcoin. Now. history usually rhymes, it doesn’t repeat itself, so it’s probably not going to be exactly that, but if it did, that would be my best price point.

      <title>672: BITCOIN $178K BULL CASE SCENARIO TARGET NOW IN PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/Kv85Y-A2nlg</link>
      <description>We believe Bitcoin can reach our bullish scenario target of $178k by December 2021 or a bit later, in case this BTC cycle extends into 2022.

This will require minimal on-chain selling pressure, especially as Bitcoin price pushes above $100k. As long as the long-term holders continue to hold, even with BTC at $100k, we can easily expect prices to move higher.

      <title>639: BITCOIN REBOUNDS BUT WARNINGS OF ANOTHER BTC PRICE PLUNGE ARE EVERYWHERE!! IS S2F MODEL STILL VALID?</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/DboI4Rm3Ap0</link>
      <description>Bitcoin continued its bounce from its 2021 opening price on Wed, hitting $31,600 in what some fear is just a temporary reprieve from the downside.

BTC Bulls had successfully defended Bitcoin against further losses at just above $29,000 - the price at which the market began the year, however, concern is running high over current strength being a “relief rally”.

      <title>636: BITCOIN TO $1,000,000 MIGHT SOUND CRAZY, BUT IS IT? WHY BTC IS GOING TO BE WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/FLNv02Mhmho</link>
      <description>I have come to the conclusion that Bitcoin is going to $1,000,000. I now believe this is a possibility not because the value of BTC will go up, though I believe it will, but because the value of money is about to fall heavily and quite possibly into the depths of monetary hell. This is why a Bitcoin could easily become worth a million dollars or more in the near future.

      <title>600: ETHEREUM WILL LIKELY FLIP BITCOIN THIS CYCLE AND HIT $85K!! BTC WILL COMFORTABLY REACH $200K EOY!!</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/hFIPslLaVio</link>
      <description>Popular crypto trader Bitboy says that he can see Ethereum flipping Bitcoin this cycle and soaring to the tens of thousands of dollars as its ecosystem grows at an exponential rate.

“Because of this total takeover, I can see it’s very likely that by 2025, Ethereum will hit $85,000 per ETH. The first step to that will be, of course, $25,000 ETH this year.
