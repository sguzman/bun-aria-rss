			<title><![CDATA[An Honest Discussion About A Universal Basic Income | Economics Explained]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Subscribe to Economics Explained 👉 https://bit.ly/sub2ee</p>
<p>In this video we go over the pros and cons of a universal basic income. The US government spent over $5 trillion of economic stimulus and relief payments during the pandemic of 2020 and 2021. This is enough money to give every adult in the country $1,000 per month during this 2 year period. Would the money have been better spent just giving it directly to the people?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Economics of Hollywood]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><br>
$42 billion dollars. That is the amount of money grossed by films at the global box office in 2019. Impressive? Definitely. Surprising? Probably not, especially when you consider that global box office revenues have increased year-over-year since 2005. That was, of course, until COVID. As you’d expect, the pandemic has devastated Hollywood – resulting in an unprecedented seventy-one percent (71%) decline in global box office revenue. Worse yet, we all have to go another year without Daniel Craig’s No Time To Die – a title that has since taken-on somewhat of an eerie meaning. But putting the absence of James Bond aside ... movie ticket sales have actually been on the decline for nearly two decades – despite a steady increase in population over the same period. So, if people are going to movie theatres less often – and they are – then what exactly is driving the growth behind global box office revenue? [note] To answer this question, you have to understand the economics of Hollywood. How do movies get funded? What is the role of government subsidies and alternative revenue sources? How can a movie gross more than its budget and still lose money? And finally, what are the economics behind movie theatres and their twenty-dollar buckets of popcorn?&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The "Perfect" Little Economy of New Zealand ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is new Zealand, a picturesque nation whos economy looks to exclusively rely on throwing their tourists off cliffs in increasingly imaginative ways and being left off of world maps.<br>
</p>
<p>But Australia’s little brother is so much more than that and it might truely be the world’s best managed economy. Everything from the world banks ease of doing business index, from multiple quality of life assessments puts new zealand in the top spot. Move aside Norway.<br>
</p>
<p>What’s more is that it has achieved this remarkable prosperity despite not having a huge supply of natural resources, or acting as some tax haven for global businesses like so many other apparent economic miracles we have explored before.<br>
</p>
<p>No New Zealand has got to where it is today by carefully managing a market economy and providing a safe, stable and confidence inspiring place to start a family, a business, and a career.<br>
</p>
<p>Of course there are still some problems and we will certainly get to them but after exploring the Economy of Argentina last week, it’s now time to get out your pen and paper and take notes on how to actually run an economy.<br>
</p>
<p>And to do this as always we are going to break the economy into some important categories.<br>
</p>
<p>What are the primary drivers of New Zealand's economic prosperity?<br>
</p>
<p>How has the nation been able to accommodate these where other nations fail to do so?<br>
</p>
<p>And what are the challenges the nation might face to keep this success going?<br>
</p>
<p>Once thats all done we can then put New zealand on the economics explained national leaderboard.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Why Can't You Buy Anything Anymore? Well It's not all the Virus' Fault.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>So the holidays are behind us and if you were left disappointed by what you found under your Christmas tree it might be because you weren’t in the spirit of things, or it might have been because Santa couldn’t get any stock of anything.<br>
</p>
<p>The good little consumers of the world might have started to notice an increasingly common trend where more and more products sell out the day they are released, or are never available at all to ordinary consumers.<br>
</p>
<p>Everything from playstations, switches, Xboxes and graphics cards, to lego sets, handbags, watches, and even toilet paper, it seems more and more like we are living in a world that is out of stock.<br>
</p>
<p>But why?<br>
</p>
<p>Stock shortages from time to time happen, that’s just general supply chain management but why has this become such a consistent issue.<br>
</p>
<p>All of these products are made by businesses with a profit motive, and those profits don’t get made unless products get sold, so what gives?<br>
</p>
<p>Now I know what you might be thinking, “err it’s the virus of course” and certainly this has thrown a spanner into the works of global supply chains but it’s not the whole story.<br>
</p>
<p>Limited supply is one thing, but if traditional economics is to be believed, businesses don’t let themselves run out of stock, instead they just raise prices to match demand and maximize their profits.<br>
</p>
<p>What’s more, is that the coronavirus is not exactly new news to companies. If they were caught out in early 2020 then fair enough, but almost a year later you would think the corporate executives responsible for multi-billion dollar product launches could account for this new global paradigm, right?<br>
</p>
<p>But they haven’t, and you might ask why?<br>
</p>
<p>Well to understand this we as always need to look at a few key things.<br>
</p>
<p>How have global supply chains been affected, beyond just blaming everything on COVID?<br>
</p>
<p>Are the companies involved actually making poor business decisions?<br>
</p>
<p>And why aren’t these products just doing what supply and demand would tell them to do and increase in price?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[How China is Fighting Poverty With... Cows?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Whenever we see China in the news it’s normally for some impressive statistic about building stuff, or how it is now home to the most millionaires in the world, or maybe it’s even an article about whatever geopolitical tomfoolery they are trying to pull this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But what is often forgotten about this is that behind the somewhat intimidating outward appearance of economic might and glistening skyscrapers, china is an extremely poor country.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This almost sounds a bit paradoxical given the wealth that is so evident from the outside. Nevertheless average incomes in China are still less than $15,000 USD’s per year, and that’s average, so in a nation that reports a Gini coefficient of 0.47 with some independent research noting this could be as high as 0.73 that means there are a lot of poor people at home in this economic miracle.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In plain English, this means upwards of half a billion people in China are living on less than $10 per day, primarily made up of those still living in rural areas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now this fact is not lost on the Chinese government, who know that a growing wealth divide in their worker’s paradise is not a great look, especially if that divide is between the cities fueling growth and the farmers feeding them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That is why in just the last 5 years the government has poured the equivalent of over 800 billion dollars into aid in areas where extreme poverty is still commonplace. This is to say nothing on state-owned enterprises which easily bring this running total to over a trillion dollars in the same time period.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A trillion dollars in 5 years, that’s more than the entire GDP of 3 quarters of the world’s countries, on one single welfare project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Even for a government as wealthy as China’s, this is ultimately not sustainable.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So a new solution was needed to make these systems more efficient at solving core issues rather than alleviating the symptoms with handfuls of cash.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And there might be a lot to take away from what they have done so as always we need to understand a few things.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How much poverty is there actually left in china?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why is this so difficult to measure?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why does China care so much?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And how might cows be the solution to this whole problem?</p>

&lt;p&gt;But what is often forgotten about this is that behind the somewhat intimidating outward appearance of economic might and glistening skyscrapers, china is an extremely poor country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This almost sounds a bit paradoxical given the wealth that is so evident from the outside. Nevertheless average incomes in China are still less than $15,000 USD’s per year, and that’s average, so in a nation that reports a Gini coefficient of 0.47 with some independent research noting this could be as high as 0.73 that means there are a lot of poor people at home in this economic miracle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In plain English, this means upwards of half a billion people in China are living on less than $10 per day, primarily made up of those still living in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this fact is not lost on the Chinese government, who know that a growing wealth divide in their worker’s paradise is not a great look, especially if that divide is between the cities fueling growth and the farmers feeding them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why in just the last 5 years the government has poured the equivalent of over 800 billion dollars into aid in areas where extreme poverty is still commonplace. This is to say nothing on state-owned enterprises which easily bring this running total to over a trillion dollars in the same time period.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trillion dollars in 5 years, that’s more than the entire GDP of 3 quarters of the world’s countries, on one single welfare project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for a government as wealthy as China’s, this is ultimately not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a new solution was needed to make these systems more efficient at solving core issues rather than alleviating the symptoms with handfuls of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there might be a lot to take away from what they have done so as always we need to understand a few things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much poverty is there actually left in china?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this so difficult to measure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does China care so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how might cows be the solution to this whole problem?&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[The Faltering Economy of Argentina ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is Argentina – a South American nation that has been home to an unprecedented period of sustained growth quintupling in size in the last decade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This nation has seen remarkable resilience through financial crises and even though it cycled through 5 presidents in two weeks, its continued re-investment in itself has paid off many times over as average incomes have doubled in the same time period to create fantastic increases in the quality of life for all the citizens of the nation.<br>
<br>
Or at least that would have been the video we were making a few years ago.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Unfortunately today the economy of Argentina tells a very different story.<br>
<br>
Just as quickly as the economy soared to these lofty heights it has crashed back down bringing about a period of heavy inflation and widespread poverty.<br>
<br>
But perhaps this shouldn’t be a huge surprise, in the last 100 years, the economy of Argentina has been categorized by periods of massive growth followed by huge declines making the most recent decades little more than a continuation of that unfortunate trend.<br>
<br>
This is a real shame because Argentina obviously has a lot going for it, from a healthy population of productive workers, strong natural resource reserves, and even a landmass that is very conducive to foundational industries like manufacturing and agriculture.<br>
<br>
But despite all of these advantages Argentina has time and time again fallen into this unfortunate pattern and is now teetering on the edge of becoming a full-blown failed state.<br>
<br>
Nobel prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets is said to have remarked in the early 1970’s that there are four types of economies in the world, developed, underdeveloped, Japan and Argentina.<br>
<br>
We have already explored what makes Japan so weird, but to unravel the mystery of Argentina we are going to have to understand a few specific issues.<br>
<br>
What has caused the various economic booms over the years?<br>
<br>
What has caused the subsequent economic declines?<br>
<br>
And why is this most recent downturn just a little bit different?<br>
<br>
Once we have done all of that we can get to the fun stuff and put Argentina on the economics explained national leaderboard, how's that for a 2020 grand final?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Why This Billionaire Wants To Give Every Baby $6,750 to Solve The Retirement Crisis?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager of Pershing square capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill has been featured on this channel a few times before, most notably because of his trade made in early 2020 which netted him over 2.6 billion dollars in profit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then he has become a bit of an internet darling which is just great for him because a lot of his trading strategies require him winning over hearts and minds to change people’s opinions on a stock, bond, cryptocurrency or whatever else it is that he has some kind of vested interest in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this is nothing new, influential stock traders have been trying to create news stories that suit them ever since there were stock markets and newspapers.</p>
<p>But this most recent announcement has been a little bit different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ackman along with a selection of business leaders and economists have started advocating for a plan that would give everybody a few thousand dollars in cash on the day they are borns all in order to solve the retirement crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds crazy, but there may be more merit to this whole plan than you think.</p>
<p>Most advanced economies around the world today are dealing with aging populations and declining birth rates. A future where the dependent elderly far outweigh the productive young is fast approaching, current pension infrastructure may just not be able to cope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may see a future where the quality of life for elderly citizens rapidly declines, or young people are taxed very heavily in order to support them, neither of which sounds particularly appealing to anyone, so perhaps radical solutions are what we need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to understand this plan we are going to need to look at a few key areas.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>How would handing out money to babies solve problems amongst the elderly?</li>
 <li>How would nations afford this?</li>
  <li>And is this actually a sound idea? Or just another scheme by a savvy businessman to profit off front-page news.</li>

			<title><![CDATA[The Fourth Industrial Revolution & What Were Those Other Two?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>So apparently we are due for a fourth industrial revolution, which might come as a surprise to you because as far as most people can tell we have only had one industrial revolution, and some nations haven’t even got around to that one yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the same, this promise of a radical shift in the way we live our lives has got a lot of economists very excited and maybe a little bit anxious, both for very good reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first industrial revolution, you know the one that we all think is the only industrial revolution was responsible for giving us production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This production went on to define our way of life in the modern world where people in advanced economies have access to practically unlimited food, robust housing, and bits and bobs to fulfill our every little desire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world before this was very stagnant. The idea that we have economic growth at all, where society is always advancing and every generation is richer than the one that came before it is a surprisingly modern ideology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s more, is that it’s not something that we are guaranteed. We can only get so good at making stuff given our current set of technologies and resources, and in fact, we might already be starting to see this plateau.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arguably the rollout of smartphones that gave us unlimited access to information wherever we were, was the last great paradigm shift in how we lived our lives.</p>
<p>13 years later this technology is improving but it doesn’t offer anything fundamentally different to the way that we live our lives, run our economies or advance our standard of living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But maybe we are getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>To really know what to expect from this supposedly incipient fourth revolution we must first understand a few key things.</p>
<ul>
 <li>How do economists define an industrial revolution? What is a revolution and what is just some cool new technology?</li>
 <li>What were those other two industrial revolutions?</li>
  <li>What is going to be the fourth industrial revolution?</li>
  <li>And will this make our modern economies look like the land before steam engines?</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is the Carnival Imagination, a luxury cruise liner worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which just 10 short months ago was touring passengers in extreme comfort to exotic destinations all over the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ship is sailing dead ahead to its final port of call, where it has been sold for scrap alongside dozens of other ships that have become the latest victims of the global pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chittagong ship breaking yard in Bangladesh is the largest of its kind in the world, and in the past few months even its abundant shores have become inundated with pleasure cruises and industrial cargo ships alike that all could have otherwise sailed the oceans for many more decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are all very troubling signs for the unsung heroes of our modern global economy, the merchant marine fleet. Every year trillions of dollars worth of cargo is transported on ships like these and losing this fleet could turn into a huge barrier to global trade.</p>
<p>But what is really going on here?</p>
<p>Why would profit-motivated companies destroy billions of dollars worth of productive assets? Sure times are tough, tourism and trade have declined massively but this hardly looks like a reasonable response right?</p>
<p>I don’t burn down my house if a video gets less than 10,000 likes, so why would companies in such a competitive industry do something equally as self-destructive?</p>
<p>Well as always it has to do with economics (go figure) and to understand this bizarre behavior we need to understand a few key areas.</p>

 <li>What are the economics behind the merchant marine fleet?</li>

			<title><![CDATA[Could Trump Take the Economy Down With Him? & Can Presidents "Make or Break" a Market?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The United States 2020 Presidential election has been called by pretty much every organization that covers the event in any capacity and while the final decision is not made until the special club that is the electoral college has presented its final decision, it’s apparent that Joe Biden will be the next president of the united states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first time in almost 3 decades that an incumbent president has been voted out before serving a second term and it has come in the midst of national and global catastrophes galore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add fuel to a fire that threatens to ignite the global economy, the outgoing president has been vehemently challenging the results which is casting doubt over the smoothness of the transition, the continuation of much-needed government support, and the foundation of the nation’s systems in their entirety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this all begs the question, either unwittingly or maliciously, how much damage could a president do to the American economy, and by extension the global economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are checks and balances in place to control the influence of any one man in the united states around things that were relevant when those checks and balances were been written.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;The United States 2020 Presidential election has been called by pretty much every organization that covers the event in any capacity and while the final decision is not made until the special club that is the electoral college has presented its final decision, it’s apparent that Joe Biden will be the next president of the united states.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time in almost 3 decades that an incumbent president has been voted out before serving a second term and it has come in the midst of national and global catastrophes galore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add fuel to a fire that threatens to ignite the global economy, the outgoing president has been vehemently challenging the results which is casting doubt over the smoothness of the transition, the continuation of much-needed government support, and the foundation of the nation’s systems in their entirety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this all begs the question, either unwittingly or maliciously, how much damage could a president do to the American economy, and by extension the global economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are checks and balances in place to control the influence of any one man in the united states around things that were relevant when those checks and balances were been written. But it must be remembered economies back then depended a lot more on successful harvests, and a lot less on tweets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our modern economies are incredibly complex and incredibly fine-tuned, but complex fine-tuned things tend to be very easy to break, and the outcomes of throwing a proverbial spanner into the works could be just as devastating.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people die when unemployment rises, and many more could lose access to healthcare, housing and livelihoods during even a minor period of economic turbulence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that a president waging war on an economy could be just as dangerous as waging war on a nation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;What kind of influence does a president directly have over an economy?&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Do they deserve the credit for things going well?&lt;/li&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[How The Dutch Economy Shows We Can't Reduce Wealth Inequality With Taxes]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is the Netherlands, a picturesque nation filled with windmills, tulip fields, and uhh coffee shops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nation is looked to by many as an extremely forward-thinking place that practices some pretty progressive policies. The nation has an incredibly strong social security system, with universal healthcare, robust retirement pensions, as well as allowances for maternity leave.</p>
<p>And These kinds of policies are mirrored in other areas as well, the nation is home to relatively high tax rates, and the protections for employees are very strong almost to the point that people joke it is impossible to be fired in the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this kind of looks like a liberal paradise right? Well, it would if it were not hiding a dirty little secret.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This postcard-perfect little nation is according to the world bank the most unequal place on earth, and the extent of the inequality is simply staggering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have explored south Africa on the channel before, which normally gets this less than desirable title. And if you were to pose this question to google, it’s what you would walk away thinking. But this isn’t the whole story.</p>
<p>In terms of wealth inequality in recent years, South Africa has been pretty tame. The Netherlands by contrast is the only country on earth that is more unequal than the world itself.</p>
<p>So what is going on here?</p>
<p>Similar policies to the ones that have been commonplace in the Netherlands for decades are being proposed by politicians in places like the United States as a way to curb the issue of wealth inequality. But if we look at the results it doesn’t look like they will do that at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to really understand this we are going to as always look at a few key issues.</p>
<ul>
 <li>How did the Netherlands of all places become the land of inequality?</li>
 <li>What does this teach us about the nature of wealth in the modern world?</li>
  <li>And how can this help us create more robust economic policies that work to benefit everyone?</li>

			<title><![CDATA[How to Invest In Chinese Stock Markets - And Why You Absolutely Should Not!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>China has been home to the most extreme economic growth in human history. In four short decades, the nation has gone from a struggling backwater filled with poverty to this, a nation of glistening skyscrapers and more Gucci stores than you can poke a stick at.</p>
<p>The driver of this growth has obviously been its embrace of the free market and opening itself up to international trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nation has always had huge potential, given that historically for 1,900 out of the last 2,000 years it has been the largest economy on earth, but now it is finally realizing that potential once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing this sustained growth people are obviously keen to jump on board, millions of dollars are been made by millions of people and any logical investor would be foolish to not have exposure to the largest growth market in the world right?</p>
<p>I spend a fair amount of time chatting to channel viewers on discord, Patreon, and even in the comments section of the video’s and it’s probably one of the questions I see the most, Mr economics man how can I invest in Chinese companies stock?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I don’t want to sound rude, and I promise I absolutely mean this in the nicest possible way, but if you have to ask someone on youtube how you can invest in Chinese equities, you absolutely should not at all be investing in Chinese equities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in fact even for more seasoned investors, the market for Chinese companies is not exactly the promised land of double-digit annual returns you may think it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because there are a few major problems that have yet to be overcome, the stock market in China is both too regulated and not regulated enough. Which sounds silly but let’s explore it by looking at this problem piece by piece.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>How is the Chinese stock market over-regulated?&nbsp;</li>
 <li>How is the Chinese stock market under-regulated?</li>
  <li>And why does this mean that most investors probably shouldn’t be investing in these markets?&nbsp;</li>

			<title><![CDATA[Can Texas Escape Oil Dependance?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is Texas, the second-largest state in the USA by landmass, population, and GDP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But perhaps being runner up is not so bad in all of these categories. Texas has for many decades been a huge driving force of prosperity, not only for the people within the state but also for all of the USA.</p>
<p>The state provides over 40% of the oil production in the country which is, in turn, the largest oil-producing nation in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To give you an idea of just how massive this operation is, Texas produces more oil than, brazil and china combined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for regular channel viewers, you might be thinking that well that’s great and all however, oil wealth doesn’t always guarantee prosperity, but fortunately for Texas, it has diversified itself into a host of other industries some of which are very far removed from what you might picture taking place in the land of cowboy boots and Ford F350’s.</p>
<p>Texas today has the fastest growing population in all of the United States which is been driven by the state attracting a range of new businesses that will work with this young new professional demographic to continue to grow a strong economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or at least that is the theory, the rumblings of the world in 2020 have not been easy on the Texan miracle, and for the first time in almost three decades, the state might be starting to show signs of troubled waters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see if this could be a hurdle the yeehaw state could not overcome we need to look at a few key areas.</p>
<ul>
 <li>What have been the industries driving the growth of Texas?</li>
 <li>What is it about the state that makes it so attractive to these industries?</li>
 <li>And what could future growth look like after 2020?</li>
</ul>

			<title><![CDATA[Why the Stock Market is at an All Time High... Again?!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the fallout of one of the most volatile American elections ever financial markets did something very strange, they rose, and rose to new record levels, again.</p>
<p>This would be unusual during even a normal election, where most investors tend to sit back and wait for the dust to settle but it is especially strange in 2020.</p>
<p>Joe Biden, who everybody is at least 90% confident will be the next president has spoken very openly about plans to raise corporate tax rates and this is coming in conjunction with the tension around how a transition of power may or may not take place, not to mention that global pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If investors are supposed to fear uncertainty surely they would be terrified of the current world that we live in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logic would dictate that the best outcome for the major corporations that make up financial markets would have been a nice simple and decisive Republican victory. At the end of the day, they tend to be a slightly more pro-business party.</p>
<p>Instead what they got was an extremely contentious Democratic victory with the potential to bring turbulence around key issues like covid relief packages in the coming month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what is going on here?</p>
<ul>
 <li>Why have markets rallied so hard in spite of this turbulence</li>
 <li>Will this market boom reverse if the proposed policies of the Biden's campaign are rolled out.</li>
  <li>And could it just be that investors no longer favored trump as president?</li>

			<title><![CDATA[Can America Win the War On Drugs... With Economics?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The war on drugs was declared in 1971 by president Richard Nixon in a press conference that went on to outline a plan to fight the trade of controlled substances across the world. Drugs were declared national enemy number 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then over 1 trillion dollars have been spent on fighting this battle and by all metrics, it has been money poorly spent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s probably no surprise to anybody that drug-related deaths and crimes have done nothing but rise over the 50 years since Nixon made this declaration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight, it was pretty easy to see why... you can’t fight the forces of supply and demand in unregulated markets with m16’s and government agents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to do so would be like trying to fight a hurricane by dropping bombs on it. Not particularly effective and if anything it’s just going to cause even more collateral damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But perhaps this is all starting to change, just last week during the election, the people of Oregon also voted on something else that will potentially have even more influence than who the next president is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The people of the state voted to decriminalize drugs, all drugs, even the hard stuff.</p>
<p>This might look like waving the white flag in defeat and finally admitting that drugs have won the war on drugs. But it might also be what we should have been doing all along, fighting the war on drugs with economics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand what economists mean by this we will need to look at a few key areas.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Why couldn’t the war on drugs disrupt this market?</li>
 <li>What is driving the growth in this market?</li>
 <li>And could legalization provide a better solution to dealing with this issue?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

&lt;p&gt;To understand what economists mean by this we will need to look at a few key areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Why couldn’t the war on drugs disrupt this market?&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;What is driving the growth in this market?&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;And could legalization provide a better solution to dealing with this issue?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tesla is today the most valuable automaker in the world by market capitalization beating out industry giants like General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen group, and even Toyota.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has achieved this impressive feet despite a short operating history, a limited product lineup, and even relatively modest sales figures compared to these much more established entities.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The US presidential election will be held in 2 days from when this video is published.</p>
<p>The process of electing who will go on to be the most powerful man in the world always makes for big news but perhaps never more so than in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States is currently in the grips of a major health crisis that has caused untold suffering to people directly affected, and indirectly to people impacted by the economic consequences that came with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is all coming in combination with a mountain of other issues, wealth inequality, trade tensions, nationwide protests, a wildly unstable financial market, record-high levels of debts, and a host of other issues that are certainly getting less airtime in 2020 but are of no less importance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This election is a chance, at least in theory, for the citizens of America to have their say about how they would like these issues dealt with... and while there are more issues than ever the right solutions are desperately needed.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you were to ask any random person on the street what it is that they knew about economics there is a pretty good chance that the first thing that they would blurt out would be the words “Supply &amp; Demand”</p>
<p>The number of people out there willing and able to buy a good or service versus the number of people out there willing to sell a good or service, all individually vying to get the best possible price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If demand increases prices increase, if demand falls prices fall and visa versa with supply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I know this channel is called Economics Explained but for most of you listening, all of this should pretty much go without saying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only issue is that this rosy picture is in no way a reflection of the real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what is going on here?</p>
<p>In this episode of Economics Explained we will explore the following questions:</p>
<ul>
 <li>How are prices decided if not through supply and demand?</li>
 <li>What does this mean for regular people in the economy?</li>
  <li>How could all of this be used to make better policies and business decisions?</li>
  <li>And how does this all make the case for a zero dollar minimum wage?</li>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Communism vs Laissez-Faire Capitalism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these opposing theories are very extreme and, for what it&apos;s worth, don’t exist in any modern economies anywhere around the world today, despite what some nations might have you believe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this episode of Economics Explained, we&apos;ll explore the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the economic arguments for and against a communist economic system?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the economic arguments for and against a completely free market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any examples of these extreme systems actually working throughout history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Why Unprofitable Companies Are Winning in 2020]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The bottom line is the most important part of any functioning business.</p>
<p>Profit after costs, expenses, and taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The money that the founders and investors in companies get to put back into their pockets for the risk and effort they put into a business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like business 101 right? And it kind of is.</p>
<p>A business that doesn’t turn a profit is like a freezer that kind make ice, it’s more or less pointless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And sure there are things like non-profit charity organizations out there but most businesses exist to make money!</p>
<p>So why is it that some of the biggest companies in the world are not turning profits? Why is it that they don’t even plan to?</p>

The idea that 5 dollars today is not going to be able to buy 5 dollars worth of stuff in the future, and the fact that you used to be able to buy a family home for 10 grand, are all the result of inflation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that over time money becomes worthless and less influences a lot of decisions in out lives. Everything from retirement planning to salary negotiations take this relatively benign and constant force into account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So contentious in fact that any country that is doing business with the people's republic of china, you know China, has to officially declare that they recognize the island of Taiwan as the sovereign territory of China.</p>
<p>While this is all very confusing, the fallout is that the nation of Taiwan is only officially recognized by a tiny selection of countries from around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These countries include economic superpowers like Guatemala, Haiti, the Marshall Islands and Vatican city collectively making up only accounting for around 50 million people and covering a tiny portion of world trade.</p>
<p>So it's not exactly like they have brought their A team.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Why GDP Is Overrated & Nobody Should Care About It!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>GDP is one of the most universally recognized terms in economics. Even outside people with an interest in the subject most adults would be able to tell you that GDP is a measure of how large an economy is.... But they might not be able to tell you how it’s calculated, or even what it stands for.</p>
<p>In this episode of Economic Explained, we will explore the following questions:</p>
<ul>
 <li>What are the limitations of GDP?</li>
 <li>Are there better figures to look at to get an idea of how prosperous an economy is?</li>
 <li>And how could focus on something outside of pure productive capacity be good for our economy?</li>

			<title><![CDATA[What is the FIRE Movement? Could it be Hurting Our Economy?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Fire movement is a growing trend amongst young workers which is growing in popularity thanks to its very enticing goal which is spelled out in the name.</p>
<p>FIRE is an acronym of Financial Independence and Retiring Early.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea is that by following a very aggressive saving and investing strategy people can get to a point where they are effectively retired at a very young age, sometimes younger than 30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting to that point is harder for some than others, but advocates of the movement argue that this difficulty has more to do with personal lifestyles rather than personal incomes.&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Why is Working Harder Making Us Poorer?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Workers today are amongst the hardest worked individuals in history, while simultaneously being the most efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, they have traded in grueling factory floors and coal mines for air conditioned offices so they probably don’t get quite as much sympathy as their industrial revolution contemporaries but the world today is marred by different challenges.</p>
<p>Hustle culture and the glorification of roles like surgeons, investment bankers, and corporate lawyers have set a precedent of on-call all the time, under the guise of professionalism or being a team player.</p>
<p>Expectations and key performance indicators are increasingly monitored, scrutinized, and increased year on year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the discussion around overworking is not a new one, but it tends to focus on the mental health implications of this reality rather than the economic impacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we are going to be leaving that aspect of this discussion to the side for this video and instead focus just on the economics of the overworked world.</p>
<p>Partially this is because there are many people far more qualified to talk about mental health and partially because well, sometimes for things to get changed it needs to make economic sense for them to be changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the health implications of 100 hour weeks aside, we really only need to answer one question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does people working longer and harder make for a more prosperous economy?&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Why You Should Be Very Afraid Of A K-shaped Recovery]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The economic impacts of 2020 have been felt far and wide and we have covered these problems in-depth in a handful of videos on this channel. But the logical question that most people are asking is what comes next? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Disasters happen and they are never pleasant but part of being a nation, a business, or even an individual is being able to deal with adversity and come out the other side. &nbsp;Because of this people are expecting a recovery of sorts, and it seems like the only point of contention will be what letter of the alphabet this recovery will represent. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other speculations include a W-shaped recovery where we will see 1 recovery then another decline as the effects of government stimulus and relief packages wear off only to be followed by another genuine recovery later on. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But amongst all of this, there is one type of recovery that we should all be very afraid of, one that is not getting nearly as much airtime and one that is actually being hurt by a lot of current policies and that is a K shaped recovery.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Vietnam is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world today. In 2019 its growth was only beaten out by a selection of far smaller and far more unstable national economies. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
