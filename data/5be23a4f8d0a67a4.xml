      <title>Our Love Story</title>
      <description>Every couple has a love story... but most aren't as long as Judah and Chelsea's. They've been spending time together since they were each in their mothers' bellies. And even though it may seem like their romance was fated, they've had their share of twists, turns, awkward moments, and challenging fights... and this Valentine's Day, they're sharing everything — so you can feel the love, too.
A note for our listeners with children: This episode gets a little PG-13... but it's all in the name of love.
