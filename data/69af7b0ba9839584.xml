With two-thirds of all UK public spending going towards welfare, how the money is spent is an important political debate. The myth that dominates this debate, and to some extent drives policy, divides the British public into two opposing camps – those that pay into it versus those who benefit, ‘strivers’ versus ‘skivers’. Professor Hills explains to us how the picture is far more complicated. Credits: Presented by Joel Suss. Produced by Cheryl Brumley. Other contributors: John Hills.

The UK coalition government embarked on a programme of spending cuts when it came to power in 2010. Since then many economists and academics have held the view that the intellectual justification for austerity is fallible and it is not a sensible strategy in bad economic times. Mark Blyth, Professor of Political Science at Brown University in the US, takes this view in his new book Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea. He discusses why he thinks spending cuts are merely a form of self-harm. We also hear from Claire Jones, Economics Reporter at the Financial Times, about the role of central banks, particularly the Bank of England’s, in handling austerity. Presented by Joel Suss.

A year and half on since the shooting of police suspect Mark Duggan in London's Tottenham sparked nationwide rioting and looting, the unrest of 2011 still proves an emotive topic for the British public. This podcast looks back on the riots, presenting sociological and criminological perspectives on why they happened and what, if anything, can be learned from them. Tim Newburn, Professor of Criminology and Social Policy at the LSE, talks about his award winning research project Reading the Riots, which aimed to examine in detail at who was involved, the extent and nature of their participation, and at their accounts of what prompted or motivated their actions. Professor Les Back, sociologist at Goldsmith's University walks us through Catford, London, which along with the surrounding area of Lewisham, caught the attention of the national media when its multiple shops were raided and destroyed in the riots. He notes how today's disaffected youth experience an 'intense sense of the present'. To view 'Anatomy of the Catford Riots' an interactive Google map with links to slideshows and original content, including a look at Catford's industrial past, see related links.
