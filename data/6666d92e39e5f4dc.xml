Gotham Knights is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by WB Games MontrÃ©al and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. It is set to be released on October 21, 2022, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Inspired by the Batman: Gotham Knights comic series based on the DC Comics character Batman and his supporting cast, the game focuses on the characters Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, and Red Hood as they attempt to restore justice to Gotham City during a period of decline in the immediate aftermath of Batman's death. While investigating Batman's disappearance, the heroes come into conflict with the Court of Owls, a secret society that is as old as Gotham itself, and their legion of brainwashed assassins called Talons.

Gotham Knights is an upcoming action role-playing game set in an open world Gotham City.[2] The game features four playable characters: Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, and Red Hood. Each character has their own unique playstyle and abilities,[3] such as Robin being able to teleport via the Justice League's satellite.[4] Players can level up their characters, but enemies will be automatically leveled up as well.[5] They can also use vehicles such as the Batcycle to explore the city.[6] During the daytime, players will occupy the Belfry, which acts as the team's base of operations and allows players to switch characters and prepare for the next mission by managing progression, and upon leaving the Belfry, the game will fast forward to the nighttime.[7]

While the narrative campaign can be played solo, the game also features a two-player cooperative multiplayer mode, wherein the second player can drop in and out at any time without affecting the other one.[8] A separate four-player cooperative mode named &quot;Heroic Assault&quot; will be introduced in November 2022. In this mode, players must battle enemies in an arena-like environment while completing various objectives.[9]

The game is set in Gotham City after the deaths of Bruce Wayne / Batman (Michael Antonakos)[10] and Police Commissioner James Gordon, which has resulted in a rise of crime and police corruption.[11] Players assume the role of four of Batman's former protÃ©gÃ©sâ€”Dick Grayson / Nightwing (Christopher Sean),[12] Barbara Gordon / Batgirl (America Young),[13] Tim Drake / Robin (Sloane Morgan Siegel),[14] and Jason Todd / Red Hood (Stephen Oyoung)[15]â€”as they attempt to continue his legacy by protecting Gotham upon receiving a pre-recorded message from Batman.[16] During the game, the heroes encounter several supervillains, including the Court of Owls, Mr. Freeze (Donald Chang),[17][18] Harley Quinn (Kari Wahlgren),[19] Clayface (Brian Keane),[20] and Penguin (Elias Toufexis).[21][22] Supporting characters include Bruce's former butler Alfred Pennyworth (Gildart Jackson)[23] and Police Captain Renee Montoya (Krizia Bajos),[24] one of the few honest cops left in the city.[25]</media:description>

Fallout 76 is a 2018 online action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is an installment in the Fallout series and a prequel to previous entries.[b] Fallout 76 is Bethesda Game Studios's first multiplayer game; players explore the open world, which has been torn apart by nuclear war, with others. Bethesda developed the game using a modified version of its Creation Engine, which allowed the accommodation of multiplayer gameplay and a more detailed game world than in previous games.

Fallout 76 was released to generally mixed reviews, with criticism for the game's numerous technical issues, overall design, lack of gameplay purpose, and initial absence of human non-playable characters. The game was the subject of several controversies, chiefly with regard to the quality of physical content. A number of Bethesda's responses and attempts to provide ongoing support for Fallout 76 in the months following its launch were met with criticism. The game sold 1.4 million copies by the end of 2018. Wastelanders, an update that reintroduces non-playable characters in the series, launched in April 2020.

Fallout 76 is Bethesda Game Studios' first online multiplayer game.[3][4][c] Players may play individually or with a party of up to three others.[6][7] The servers for the game are public dedicated servers, with the player automatically allocated to one of them.[4] While the game was expected to launch with public servers only, executive producer Todd Howard revealed plans for private servers to be introduced some time after the game's launch. These private servers allow players to invite friends and to prevent undesirable aspects of player versus player gameplay such as griefing from affecting an individual player's experience of the game. Howard described the delay as being necessary to allow Bethesda time to assure the stability of public servers.[8] Elements of previous Fallout games are present and are modified to work with the real-time game. The V.A.T.S. systemâ€”a mechanic in the series that allows players to target specific locations on an enemy's body to attack, which previously paused the game temporarilyâ€”is used in Fallout 76 as a real-time system.[9]

The game features an open world four times the size of that of Fallout 4.[10] The game world is called &quot;Appalachia&quot; and is a representation of West Virginia. It features recreations of real locations in the region, including the West Virginia State Capitol, The Greenbrier, Woodburn Circle, New River Gorge Bridge, and Camden Park.[11][12][13][14] The game features numerous new mutated monsters, several of whichâ€”such as the Mothman and the Flatwoods monsterâ€”were inspired by West Virginian folklore.[14][15][16]

The game includes revisions to the SPECIAL progression system. Character attributes fall into one of seven categories: strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck. As the player levels up, they are able to spend skill points to boost their attributes on a scale of one to fifteen. Players are able to choose perks, or passive abilities that offer gameplay bonuses. These perks fall into each of the SPECIAL categories and take the form of trading cards. Each card has a value and the player can adopt perks equal to their respective value; for example, if the player has a strength rating of five, then they may equip strength perks worth five points. The player can merge similar cards together to create more powerfulâ€”albeit more expensiveâ€”perks. The system is designed to encourage the player to recognise the situation they are in and choose perks that aid them rather than passively selecting them and having them for the duration of the game.[17]

A Plague Tale: Requiem is an action-adventure stealth video game developed by Asobo Studio and published by Focus Entertainment. It is the sequel to A Plague Tale: Innocence (2019), and follows siblings Amicia and Hugo de Rune who must look for a cure to Hugo's blood disease in Southern France while fleeing from soldiers of the Inquisition and hordes of rats that are spreading the black plague. The game was released for Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S in October 2022.

Similar to its predecessor, Requiem is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. In the game, the player assumes control of Amicia and must face against both soldiers from the French Inquisition and hordes of rats that are spreading the black plague. Gameplay is largely similar to the first game, though the combat system is significantly expanded. Amicia is equipped with weapons such as a knife to stab enemies, a sling that can be used to throw rocks, and a crossbow which allows her to easily defeat armoured opponents. Crossbow bolts, throwing pots, and rocks can be combined with alchemical mixtures. In addition to Ignifer and Extinguis, which allows the player to light and extinguish flame respectively, the game introduces tar, which increases the radius of the light source, and can be used to ignite enemies.[1]

Locations are also larger in Requiem, giving players additional options to progress. Stealth is expanded in Requiem. Unlike Innocence, Amicia would not die after being hit once by enemies. She can also return to stealth after she was discovered by enemies, and counter their attacks if she gets too close to them. Amicia's brother Hugo, who has a connection to the plague, can use an ability named &quot;Echo&quot; which reveals the locations of enemies through walls. Hugo can also control the hordes of rats to overwhelm enemies. Similar to the first game, the rats, which are light-averse, play a huge role in the game. Amicia and Hugo must stay in the light, or they will be devoured by the rats. Amicia can use the rats to her advantage, manipulating them to solve puzzles, or even lure them to kill enemies.[1]

The game also features a progression system in which the player will be awarded additional skills and abilities. Stealth players will unlock skills that allows them to sneak around more efficiently, while those who prefer a more lethal approach will unlock additional combat skills.[1] The player's gear and equipment can also be upgraded at workbenches.[2]

Scorn is an upcoming first-person biopunk survival horror adventure video game developed by Serbian developer Ebb Software for Microsoft Windows and Xbox Series X/S. The game is inspired by the works of visual artists H. R. Giger and ZdzisÅ‚aw BeksiÅ„ski.

The player controls a humanoid lost on a nightmarish alien planet filled with odd creatures and living techno-organic structures composed of machines, flesh, and bone. The player will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion, searching for answers that will explain more about the game's world.

The game presents various biomechanical weapons that all attach to a modular base implanted on the character's body. To utilize a specific weapon, the player must remove the current weapon from the base and replace it with another. Two primary weapons have been showcased: a pistol and a three-barrel shotgun that fires organic spikes. The player starts with the pistol: a 6-shot weapon dealing mild damage to the in-game enemies. It appears to be completely organic, beginning with the mouth-like base for the weapon, which can be opened to let the pistol itself be removed and exchanged for the shotgun. The shotgun is a 3-shot weapon that deals considerable damage to enemies close-up, but the damage drops at long distances. The shotgun is composed of the same organic materials as the pistol. Later trailers have revealed other weapons such as a close-range pistol that also activates gates and an imploding grenade launcher.

Dead Space is a 2008 survival horror video game developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows as the debut entry in the Dead Space series. Set on a mining spaceship overrun by deadly monsters called Necromorphs following the discovery of an artifact called the Marker. the player controls engineer Isaac Clarke as he navigates the spaceship and fights the Necromorphs while struggling with growing psychosis. Gameplay has Isaac exploring different areas through its narrative, solving environmental puzzles and finding ammunition and equipment to survive.

Dead Space was pitched in early 2006, with an early prototype running on Xbox. Creator Glen Schofield wanted to make the most frightening horror game he could imagine, drawing inspiration from the video game Resident Evil 4 and films including Event Horizon and Solaris. The team pushed for innovation and realism in their design, ranging from procedural enemy placement to removing HUD elements. The sound design was a particular focus during production, with the score by Jason Graves designed to evoke tension and unease.

Dead Space debuted to slow sales but eventually sold over a million copies worldwide. Critics praised its atmosphere, gameplay and sound design. It won and was nominated for multiple industry awards and has been ranked by journalists as one of the greatest video games ever made. The series spawned two numbered sequels (released in 2011 and 2013), several spin-off titles, and other related media, including a comic book prequel and an animated film. A remake is currently in development by EA's Motive Studios and set for release in 2023.

Dead Space is a science fiction action horror video game. Players take on the role of Isaac Clarke, controlling him through a third-person perspective. Players navigate level-based sections of the spaceship Ishimura, completing narrative-driven missions, solving physics puzzles within the environment, and fighting monsters dubbed Necromorphs.[1][2][3] In the vacuum Isaac has a limited air supply, which can be replenished by finding air tanks within the environment. Some areas are subject to zero-G, with both Isaac and specific enemy types able to jump between surfaces; these areas have dedicated puzzles.[2][4] During exploration of the Ishimura, Isaac finds ammunition, health pickups, and Nodes that are used to both unlock special doors and upgrade weapons and Isaac's suit. At certain points in the ship, Isaac can access a store to buy supplies and ammunition.[5][6] Isaac can use a navigation line to find the next mission objective.[7]

Isaac can stomp to break supply crates and attack enemies, and punch to kill smaller enemies and repel larger ones. Two more abilities unlocked during the game are Kinesis, which can move or pull objects in the environment, and Stasis, which slows movement for a limited time.[7] All gameplay displays are diegetic, appearing in-world as holographic projections. Isaac's health and energy levels are displayed on the back of his suit, and ammunition count appears when weapons are raised. All information displaysâ€”control prompts, pick-ups, video calls, the game map, inventory, store frontsâ€”appear as holographic displays. While the player is browsing menus, time in the game does not pause.[6][7]

Dead Island: Riptide is a 2013 action role-playing game developed by Techland and published by Deep Silver. Released in April 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Riptide serves as a continuation of the story to 2011's Dead Island, with the original four survivors, plus a new survivor, arriving on another island in the Banoi archipelago, which has also been overrun by zombies.

Dead Island: Riptide received a mixed reception from critics, who cited that the game did not fix any of its predecessor's problems, nor add anything new to the gameplay. A third title and first official sequel for the series, Dead Island 2, was revealed at E3 2014. It was originally set for a 2016 release; however, the game entered development hell after the project was moved over from Yager Development to Sumo Digital in 2016. The development of Dead Island 2 changed hands again in 2019, this time to an internal studio of Deep Silver, Dambuster Studios. The game is now scheduled for release on February 3, 2023. Along with the first game, Riptide was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, and SteamOS under the title Dead Island: Definitive Edition.

Far Cry 2 is a 2008 first-person shooter developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. A top-down shooter version for mobile phones was developed and published by Gameloft. It is the second mainline entry in the Far Cry series. Set in a fictional East African country engulfed in civil war, the storyline follows a mercenary who is assigned to kill the Jackal, a weapons dealer inflaming the conflict. The player navigates the open world, completing missions for factions and allies called Buddies while managing their health and equipment. A competitive multiplayer mode allows players to fight in teams or as individuals.

Production took three and a half years, with concept work beginning during the production of Far Cry Instincts (2005). Director Clint Hocking conceived the setting and design, which he wanted to be more realistic than the original Far Cry (2004). The narrative and tone, inspired by Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness and Dashiell Hammett's novel Red Harvest, focused on the lengths to which people would go to survive through terrible circumstances. The game was built using Dunia, a game engine created by Ubisoft based on the original game's CryEngine. In pursuit of realism, the developers added real-time and reactive elements for enemies and the environment. The music, composed by Marc Canham, includes vocals by Senegalese singer Baaba Maal.

Far Cry 2 received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its setting, open-ended gameplay, Buddies, world design and visuals; however its writing, artificial intelligence and technical issues received negative attention. It received multiple game award nominations. By January 2009, the game had sold nearly three million copies worldwide. Far Cry 2 has continued to receive attention for its ambition and survival mechanics. The team used feedback from the game to develop Far Cry 3 (2012).

Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. The story takes place in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe. Players assume the first-person perspective of a customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and ranged combat.

Mafia II is a 2010 action-adventure game developed by 2K Czech and published by 2K Games. It was released in August for PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox 360.[1][2] The game is a standalone sequel to 2002's Mafia,[3] and the second installment in the Mafia series. Set within the fictional city of Empire Bay from 1945 to 1951, the story follows Vito Scaletta, a young Sicillian-American mobster and war veteran, who becomes caught in a power struggle among the city's Mafia crime families while attempting to pay back his father's debts and secure a better lifestyle alongside his best friend.

The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. The player character's criminal activities may incite a response from law enforcement agencies, measured by a &quot;wanted&quot; system that governs the aggression of their response. Development began in 2003, soon after the release of the first Mafia game. At release, Mafia II received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise particularly directed at its story, characters, and gameplay; however, the restrictive world design and lack of certain features present in other sandbox games was criticized.

A version of the game including all previously released downloadable content, entitled Mafia II: Director's Cut, was released by Feral Interactive in December 2011.[4] A sequel, Mafia III, developed by Hangar 13, was released in October 2016. To coincide with the remake of the first game of the series, Mafia II: Definitive Edition, a remastered version of the game developed by D3T, was released by 2K Games on 19 May 2020. It received mixed reviews, particularly for its bugs and glitches, most of which were not present in the original version of Mafia II.[5] This Definitive Edition was later bundled in the Mafia: Trilogy pack, released on 25 September 2020.

Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. The story takes place in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe. Players assume the first-person perspective of a customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and ranged combat.

The game was developed using the REDengine 4 by a team of around 500 people, exceeding the number that worked on the studio's previous game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015). CD Projekt launched a new division in WrocÅ‚aw, Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role. The original score was led by Marcin PrzybyÅ‚owicz, featuring the contributions of several licensed artists.

After years of anticipation, CD Projekt released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on 10 December 2020 followed by a next-gen patch for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions on 15 February 2022. It received praise from critics for its narrative, setting, and graphics, although some of its gameplay elements received mixed responses, while its themes and representation of transgender characters received some criticism. It was also widely criticized for bugs, particularly in the console versions, which suffered from performance problems; Sony removed it from the PlayStation Store from December 2020 to June 2021 while CD Projekt rectified some of the problems. CD Projekt became subject to investigations and class-action lawsuits for their perceived attempts at downplaying the severity of the technical problems before release; these were ultimately cleared with a settlement of US$1.85 million.

Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing game[1] played in a first-person perspective as V,[2] a mercenary whose voice,[3] face, hairstyles, body type and modifications, background, and clothing are customisable. Stat categoriesâ€”Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical, and Coolâ€”are influenced by the character classes that players assume, which are NetRunner (hacking), Techie (machinery), and Solo (combat). V must consult a &quot;ripperdoc&quot; to upgrade and purchase cyberware implants; black markets offer military-grade abilities.[4] The rarity of any given equipment is shown by a coloured tier system.[5] V can take cover, aim, run, jump, double jump, and slide.[6][7] Melee strikes can be dealt with close-combat weapons.[8][9] There are three types of ranged weapons, all of which can be customised and modifiedâ€”Power (standard), Tech (which penetrate walls and enemies), and Smart (with homing bullets).[10][11] Ranged weapons are equipped to ricochet bullets in a target's direction and slow them down in bullet time. Four types of damage can be inflicted and resistedâ€”Physical, Thermal, EMP, and Chemical.[12][13][14] Weapon use increases accuracy and reloading speed, which are manifested in character animations.[15] Gunsmiths repair and upgrade weapons.[8] The game can be completed without killing anyone,[16] with non-lethal options for weapons and cyberware.[17]

The open world metropolis of Night City consists of six regions; the corporate City Centre, immigrant-inhabited Watson, luxurious Westbrook, suburban Heywood, gang-infested Pacifica, and industrial Santo Domingo. Its surrounding area, the Badlands, can also be explored. V navigates these locations on foot and in vehicles, which are subject to either a third- or first-person view.[4] Pedestrians are vulnerable to vehicular collisions.[11] Depending on the location, law enforcement may be alerted if V commits a crime.[18][19]

Sunset Overdrive is an action-adventure shooter video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Microsoft Studios. The game is set in 2027, in a fictional metropolis called Sunset City. The player controls an employee of FizzCo, who has to fight off the OD, short for Overcharge Drinkers: humans who have turned into mutants after drinking FizzCo's energy drink beverage. In the dystopian Sunset City, the player character can wall-run, use zip-lines, and grind rails to swiftly navigate through it, with a large arsenal of weapons to use. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer mode called Chaos Squad, which tasks players to complete a series of missions with seven players. As the game puts emphasis on momentum, the game does not feature any cover system.

The development of the game began in 2011 when Insomniac completed Resistance 3. After the project was green-lit internally, the studio partnered with Microsoft Studios, which helped fund the game and allowed Insomniac to keep the rights to the franchise. Insomniac described the game as a &quot;celebration of games&quot;, as the team took inspiration from different sources, including Prince of Persia, Jet Set Radio and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, though at its early stage of development the team took inspirations from DayZ instead. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, but the team depicted it as an &quot;awesomepocalypse&quot; that turns the game's initial world depiction into a &quot;playground&quot; for players. Sunset Overdrive uses Insomniac's internal engine, previously used in Fuse.

It was announced at E3 2013, and released worldwide for Xbox One in October 2014. A Windows version, developed by Blind Squirrel Games, was released in November 2018. The game received generally positive reviews, with praise for its visuals, traversal system, combat system, and humor. However, the game was criticized for the lack of a compelling story or innovative quest design. It received numerous nominations, including Best Xbox Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. The game was supported with multiple pieces of downloadable content, including the story-based The Mystery of the Mooil Rig and Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen Machine, after the game's release.

Assassin's Creed: Revelations is a 2011 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the fourth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and a direct sequel to 2010's Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, concluding the &quot;Ezio Trilogy&quot;. The game was released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows in November and December 2011. A remastered version of Revelations, along with Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood, was released as part of The Ezio Collection for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on November 15, 2016, and for the Nintendo Switch on February 17, 2022.

The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features the series protagonist Desmond Miles who, after falling into a coma during the events of Brotherhood, must relive the memories of his ancestors through the Animus device in order to awaken and find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The main story spans the years 1511â€“1512, and follows an aged Ezio Auditore da Firenze (the protagonist of the trilogy) as he travels to Constantinople to find five keys needed to unlock a vault built three centuries ago by AltaÃ¯r Ibn-LaÊ¼Ahad (the protagonist of the first game in the series). While searching for the keys, Ezio becomes caught in a feud between the Ottomans and the Byzantines, and discovers that the Templars are also attempting to unlock AltaÃ¯r's vault and its secrets.

Revelations features an open world and is played from the third-person perspective, with a primary focus on using Ezio's and AltaÃ¯r's combat, climbing and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Ezio, who the player controls throughout the majority of the game, can freely explore Constantinople and complete side missions unrelated to the main storyline. AltaÃ¯r is playable in a smaller capacity, as he is featured only in a series of flashback missions set in Masyaf from 1189 to 1257. In the modern-day, the player controls Desmond in a series of first-person platforming levels within the Animus. The multiplayer mode returns from Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, and has been expanded with additional maps, characters, and game modes.

The game was released with multiple editions, some of which featured exclusive limited-time content. Most notably, several editions included an animated short film, titled Assassin's Creed: Embers, which serves as a proper conclusion to Ezio's story, and which was later re-released as a free download on the PlayStation Store. Downloadable content (DLC) released for the game includes new maps and characters for the multiplayer mode, and a story expansion titled The Lost Archive, which adds more platforming levels to the modern-day.

Upon release, Revelations received largely positive reviews, with praise directed at the world design and narrative, although some reviewers noted that the gameplay of the series was getting overly familiar and the newly introduced features felt lacking in comparison to the ones introduced in previous titles. The game was a large commercial success, outperforming the sales of its predecessors. It was followed in October 2012 by Assassin's Creed III, which introduces a new storyline and protagonist in the New World during the 18th century, while also concluding Desmond's story arc
