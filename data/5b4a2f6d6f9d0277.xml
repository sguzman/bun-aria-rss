  <description>Dearne Louise Nonnenmacher was born on the 4th January 1972\. In 1990 she was eighteen and living with her family and working as trainee chef at the Robin Hood Hotel. She had shared with family her dreams for the future and looked forward to the day she could work as a chef on a cruise liner.

On Christmas day of 1990, like many families, the Nonnenmacher family gathered together to celebrate with a Christmas lunch. Little did her family know that this would be the last time they would see their beloved Dearne.

By boxing day, Dearne's family had not heard from her and made repeated attempts to reach out. Feeling uneasy about her sudden disappearance and lack of contact they soon reported her missing at the Orange Police Station. ..</description>

  <description>**The Nowra Bodies in the Barrels**

On the 29th of January 2006, Peter Dalton and his wife were cycling along a track through the Tomerong State Forest, not far from the township of Nowra.

During their ride they had noticed burning smell that grew stronger and stronger. As they drew nearer to a clearing in the forest they could see the source of the smoke. The flames had died down but two barrels were smoldering and black smoke rose from within them.

  <description>Located south 2 hours south west of the NSW capital of Sydney, is an area of known as the Southern Highlands. If you travel 3 kms west from the Hume Highway that runs through this region you will soon end up in the towering trees of the Belanglo State Forest.

The title of the forest ‘Belanglo’, has become synonymous with the callous serial killings of several young backpackers who died at the hands of Ivan Milat.

From 1989 to 1993 this tranquil forest would become a dumping ground for Milat. Over a series of searches authorities would discover the remains of 7 individuals who had fallen victim to Milat while hitchhiking through the region.

Despite this gruesome history and the negative association with its name, Belanglo forest has still continued to be used as a popular recreational destination for trail bike riders, 4 wheel drive enthusiasts, and campers.

But despite locals and tourists alike trying to shake the memory of Milat, In 2010 a disturbing event would bring the names Belanglo and Milat to the media spotlight once again.

  <description>Frank Vitkovic (Part 2)&#13;
&#13;
On the 8th of December 1987, Frank Vitkovic, armed with high powered, sawn off rifle, shot indiscriminately at unsuspecting office workers as he moved through the Australia Post Building at 191 Queen Street in the Melbourne CBD.&#13;
&#13;
8 lives were cut down at the hands of Vitkovic in a brutal attack that lasted 17 minutes.&#13;
&#13;
During Vitkovic's frenzied attack Police gathered in the street below. They had received an alert from the building when a worker inside had triggered the bank alarm. Initially assuming they were dealing with an armed robbery they swooped on the scene. But as a shots echoed from the floors above they soon realized that were not dealing with a robbery.&#13;

  <description>While you wait for Part 2 of Frank Vitkovic....  

I was honoured to guest host an episode of In Sight Podcast. If you haven't had a chance to listen via In Sight's stream, here is it. 

For those unfamiliar with In Sight, I highly recommend checking it out.  

On January 29 2009, Arthur Freeman was driving his three children across the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne. It would be his 4-year-old daughter, Darcey’s first day of school. Unfortunately she would never make it. For reasons no one would ever be able to explain, Freeman calmly exits his vehicle with Darcey in his arms and tosses her off the bridge. Freeman goes back to his car with his other two children inside and drives away. It would not be long before Freeman is apprehended, arrested and charged with the little girl’s murder. What would cause a loving, doting father to murder his own daughter?

  <description>Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory is a popular holiday destination for both Australian Residents and international visitors alike. Also known as Australia's Tropical capital, its warm weather, night clubs, beach markets and laid back life style are among the many reasons why people choose to live in or visit Darwin.&#13;
&#13;
But behind this carefree façade hides another face of Darwin that is much more sinister. Per capita Darwin has the highest crime rate of any Australian city. In 2004, It would be the backdrop to an horrific crime that would be etched in to Darwin's history for many years to come.&#13;

  <description>Friday the 18th August 2000. Two weeks after Mark Van Krevel was sentenced, police were called to a home in Albion Park. It was a home that they had visited before. The scene that greeted them there, inside the master bedroom, seemed reminiscent of the horror inflicted by Mark Van Krevel. In the room a man was discovered kneeling beside the bed. He was slumped over with his head and chest resting on the mattress with arms hanging alongside his torso. He was covered in blood and naked. His back and head had received extensive wounds. Twenty five chop wounds in total to the neck and head had left his neck partially severed. There were also multiple stab wounds and lacerations inflicted to the torso blood covered the bedding and curtains. At the foot of the bed close to the victim’s body lying side by side were a hatchet a large kitchen knife and a fire poker. All of which were covered in blood. &#13;

  <description>There are two backdrops for this story. Boggo Road Gaol and Samford.&#13;
One, a notorious Gaol that housed some of the most disturbed and violent offenders in Australian history, where many of these offenders met their end at the gallows.&#13;
The other, a small quiet farming town around a 30 minute drive from the Queensland capital of Brisbane.&#13;
Two very different places but one tragic incident would forge a connection between the two that would still be remembered over a century.&#13;

  <description>Episode 6 of Season 1 shared the story of Carly Ryan, a teenager who was catfished through myspace by a middle aged man from Victoria who had befriended her online under the guise of Brandon Kane, a teenager from Texas who shared Carly’s interest in music and fashion. The crime was the first of its kind in Australia….Unfortunately it would not be the last.

  <description>Perth, the capital of Western Australia, during the 1950’s was described as being more like a big country town rather than a city. Neighbours knew each other, cars were left parked in the driveway and streets with the keys still in the ignition. Front doors were left unlocked, house windows were left wide open day and night.
In January of 1959 in the peak of summer. Residents within the city and outlying suburbs slept with doors and windows open in attempt to cool their dwellings during the above average temperatures the city was experiencing at the time. It wasn’t unusual to find residents sleeping outdoors on balconies, porches and even on the ground in the front yard.  People had a laid back approach to home security. Crime was low and it seemed that everyone trusted those around them. It wouldn’t be long before a string of violent and seemingly unrelated crimes would make them question this trust and turn a once quiet and peaceful city in to panicked frenzy.
