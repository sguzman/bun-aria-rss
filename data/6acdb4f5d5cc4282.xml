      <title>Mr. Cruel // 249</title>
      <description>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a masked man began snatching children from their homes in Melbourne, Australia. With crimes similar to that of a fictional boogeyman, the area was petrified with fear, and to this day, police have never identified him. This is the story of Mr. Cruel.

      <title>Teresa Halbach // 248</title>
      <description>On Halloween day in 2005, a 25-year-old photographer headed to a Wisconsin Salvage Yard and was never seen again. When her car was found a few days later on the same property, a man was arrested for her murder. But did he do it? With theories of the man being framed and other persons of interests sneaking into the story, many are left wondering if police have the right man behind bars. This is the story of Teresa Halbach.

      <title>Arpana Jinaga // 246</title>
      <description>In October of 2008, a young woman threw a Halloween party along with the rest of her apartment complex with countless attendees. But three days later, her body was found in her apartment, and the scene was not only gruesome, but incredibly confusing. With multiple partygoers as potential suspects, it was unclear to police from the start who was actually behind this tragedy. This is the story of Arpana Jinaga.

      <title>Aniah Blanchard // 245</title>
      <description>In October of 2019, a 19-year-old college student vanished after stopping at a Chevron gas station late one night in Alabama. Shortly after she was reported missing, her blood-stained, damaged car was located in an apartment parking lot almost an hour away. But thanks to surveillance footage, an eyewitness testimony, and DNA evidence, a suspect was charged. This is the story of Aniah Blanchard.

      <title>Charlie Allen Jr // 244</title>
      <description>In October of 2007, a 22-year-old tennis player was supposed to meet up with a friend before heading to a party, but he never showed up. After leaving strange voicemails for his parents and telling his sister that “important” people were after him, he vanished. Even though his car and backpack were soon found, they only brought more questions than answers. This is the story of Charlie Allen Jr.

      <title>Adrienne Salinas // 243</title>
      <description>In 2013, a 19-year-old Arizona college student went missing after being involved in a single-car accident. When it was discovered that she took a ride from a suspicious cab driver and her whereabouts were unknown, police began investigating her disappearance with numerous persons of interest. Months later, her remains were found in a nearby desert, and theories spread of a “Zombie Hunter” and potential serial killer being involved. This is the story of Adrienne Salinas.

      <title>Angie Barlow // 241</title>
      <description>In October of 2016, a 23-year-old woman in Indianapolis headed to a private party and was never seen again. Just hours before she disappeared, she sent the address of the party to her best friend in case she went missing. Months later, she would be found murdered, and thanks to surveillance footage, police came up with a theory. This is the story of Angie Barlow.

      <title>The Smiley Face Killer // 240</title>
      <description>Starting back in 1997, dozens of men have been found killed under eerily similar circumstances. Almost all of them were dubbed accidents fueled by a night out drinking with friends. But when investigators started noticing a similar calling card left by each body, graffiti paint of a smiley face, they began to suspect these seemingly random deaths were connected by one or more serial killers. This is the story of the Smiley Face Killer.

      <title>Karlie Guse // 239</title>
      <description>In October of 2018, a 16-year-old girl disappeared from California after a party. Her stepmother picked her up from the side of the road after finding her running in the dark. When they got home, they went to sleep side by side for safety since she was agitated, but the next morning, she was gone. Blame began to shift within the family as inconsistencies in the story emerged, and all the family’s dirty laundry surfaced. This is the story of Karlie Guse.

      <title>Philip Shue // 238</title>
      <description>In April of 2003, a psychologist was found dead in his car from a car crash. But shortly before his death, he had received threatening letters, and the day he died, he was seen driving erratically before crashing into a tree. Though police ruled his death a suicide, his autopsy revealed unsettling details indicating that he had potentially been tortured and held captive before he crashed his car. This is the story of Philip Shue.

      <description>In August of 2017, a 22-year-old film student in Philadelphia was murdered after a night out.

      <description>In October of 2018, a 26-year-old postal worker went missing in Chicago after leaving her apartment to run errands. But suspicious surveillance footage and a thought-to-be fake sick call made into her work the next day have led her family and investigators to believe something sinister happened to her. This is the story of Kierra Coles.

      <title>Sequoya Vargas // 231</title>
      <description>In August of 1993, a 16-year-old Indigenous girl went missing in Hawaii after going out with a friend. Earlier that day, she and her friend had been picked up by a hitchhiker who asked them to hang out later, but despite this detail, Police initially believed she had run away. Years later, they would finally received a confession that detailed the horrible truth about what happened to her the night she disappeared. This is the story of Sequoya Vargas.

      <title>The Maine Bed &amp; Breakfast Killer // 230</title>
      <description>In September of 2006, a grisly murder scene was uncovered in a picturesque farmhouse bed &amp; breakfast in rural Maine. Four people, including the innkeeper and her daughter, were murdered and dismembered by the young cook who lived there, shocking the small town and the entire region. This is the story Julie Bullard, Selby Bullard, Cynthia Beatson, and Jimmy Whitehurst, and it’s also the story of the Maine Bed &amp; Breakfast Killer.

      <title>Kayla Berg // 229</title>
      <description>In August of 2009, a 15-year-old girl left home to hang out with friends in a neighboring Wisconsin town, and never returned. Her brother's 24-year-old friend had actually been the last person to see her, claiming to have dropped her off at the home of her ex-boyfriend. But her ex-boyfriend claims they didn’t even have plans to see each other. So which of these men is lying? Or was it someone else entirely? This is the story of Kayla Berg.

      <title>Susan Eads // 228</title>
      <description>In August of 1983, a 20-year-old woman working as a cocktail waitress and a DJ was found strangled to death in a vacant field in Texas. When police began investigating her murder, they released the sketch of a mystery man they called “the cowboy”, hoping someone could identify him. Then, her mother began receiving threatening calls from an unknown man, but police had no idea if they were coming from her killer, or who her killer even was. And it would be decades before they would find out. This is the story of Susan Eads.

      <title>Kiely Rodni (Happening Now) // 227</title>
      <description>On August 5, 2022, a 16-year-old girl went to a campground party near her home and never returned. When records showed her phone last pinged at the campground before turning off minutes after she supposedly left, her family feared for the worst. Both she and her car are both still missing, with few clues as to what could have happened to her. This is the ongoing story of Kiely Rodni.

      <title>Clinton Nelson // 226</title>
      <description>In August of 2006, a 21-year-old man attended a party after relocating to Louisiana to reconnect with his biological father. Multiple reports came out from party attendants that he had been acting paranoid and then left suddenly. But the most eerie account of all came from his father, who was the last person to speak with him, and remembers his son whispering into the phone that he thought someone was following him. This is the story of Clinton Nelson.

      <title>Humboldt Missing Five // 220</title>
      <description>Between 1993 and 2014, five women with similar appearances and backgrounds vanished under comparably suspicious circumstances in the same small area of California. As an area that is already nicknamed “The Black Hole” for its large number of disappearances, many locals believe that there is a serial killer stalking the area. These are the stories of Jennifer Wilmer, Karen Mitchell, Christine Walters, Sheila Franks, and Danielle Bertolini. Also known, as the Humboldt Missing Five.

      <title>Oakey "Al" Kite // 219</title>
      <description>In 2004, a well-liked man went missing from Aurora, Colorado after dropping his girlfriend off at the airport. When police conducted a wellness check at his home 2 days later, they found him brutally and methodically murdered in his own basement, with no apparent motive and no suspect in sight. But he had recently rented his basement apartment to a stranger…so was this mystery roommate to blame for his gruesome death? This is the story of Oakey “Al” Kite.

      <title>Trisha Autry // 218</title>
      <description>On June 24th, 2000, a 15-year-old aspiring writer vanished from her home in Utah, and her mom turned to her daughter’s own stories for clues. Having been a victim of bullying, police initially believed that she ran away. But as witnesses came forward, she appeared to have a stalker who had lured her from her home on the very computer where she sat every night to write. This is the murder of Trisha Autry.

      <title>Felicia Johnson // 217 (Happening Now)</title>
      <description>In April of 2022, a 24-year-old went on a birthday trip to Houston, but disappeared after meeting up with a man in the middle of the night. Since then, a suspect has been named, and a warrant is out for his arrest after police found the victims blood in his car and apartment, mysterious Google searches and hardware store receipts, and horrific photos in his phone. However, this man is currently on the run and his whereabouts are unknown. This is the story of Felicia Johnson, and the search for Chukwuebuka Nwobodo.

      <title>Bumble Bee Road Murders // 216</title>
      <description>In 2003, a young couple was camping in their pick-up truck in a remote part of the Arizona desert to celebrate their anniversary. But before they could return home, they were murdered in the back of the truck. With few clues left behind, could the photos on their disposable camera help piece together the truth? This is the story of Brandon Rumbaugh and Lisa Gurrieri, otherwise known as the Bumble Bee Road Murders.

      <itunes:summary>In 2003, a young couple was camping in their pick-up truck in a remote part of the Arizona desert to celebrate their anniversary. But before they could return home, they were murdered in the back of the truck. With few clues left behind, could the photos on their disposable camera help piece together the truth? This is the story of Brandon Rumbaugh and Lisa Gurrieri, otherwise known as the Bumble Bee Road Murders.

      <title>Aimee Willard // 215</title>
      <description>In June of 1996, a 22-year-old college lacrosse player had a casual night out with friends at a bar in suburban Philadelphia. But on her way home, she disappeared. Shortly after leaving the bar, her car was found running with the driver's side door open on an Interstate, painting a violent attack. After an important tip came in from a local woman, a concrete suspect emerged, and it turns out, he had other victims. This is the story of Aimee Willard.

      <title>Ben McDaniel // 214</title>
      <description>In August of 2010, a 30-year-old scuba enthusiast from Memphis, Tennessee headed out for a cave dive in Ponce De Leon, Florida, and never returned. After an extensive search in the waters, his body was never found, begging the question: Was this an innocent diving accident? Or something much more sinister? This is the story of Ben McDaniel.

      <description>In August of 2012, a Georgia woman was living on a yacht in Saint Mary’s after a violent divorce. But when someone crept up to the boat while she was sleeping one night, she was murdered and the boat was set ablaze.

      <title>The Montana State Park Killer // 210</title>
      <description>“Is this Susie’s Mom?”
 “Yes it is.”
 “Well I’m the guy that took her from you.”
This was the type of taunting phone call received by the mother of a young girl kidnapped at their Montana campsite. The search for her abductor led the FBI to a vicious serial killer, and began the process of creating psychological profiles in order to catch predators. These are the cases of Susie Jaegar, Bernie Poelman, Sandra Smallegan, and Michael Raney, and the story of David Meirhofer, also known as the Montana State Park Killer.

      <title>The Evansdale Murders // 209</title>
      <description>In July of 2012, two girls disappeared in Evansdale, Iowa while riding their bikes. Police set out looking for them right away, but despite an exhaustive search, receiving tips from locals, and finding CCTV footage of the girls, all the investigation turned up was their bikes. Five months later, both of their bodies were found, but was this the work of a serial killer, or someone else hiding right under everyone's noses? This the story of Lyric Cook and Elizabeth Collins, also known as the Evansdale Murders.

      <title>Betty Gore // 208</title>
      <description>In the summer of 1980, a beloved 30-year-old schoolteacher, wife, and mother was murdered with an ax in her Texas home while her husband was away on a business trip. This killing and the subsequent discovery of her killer were so shocking that both Hulu and HBO Max have shows based on the case, though the belief of what really happened that fateful day remains divided. This is the story of Betty Gore.

        <![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 1980, a beloved 30-year-old schoolteacher, wife, and mother was murdered with an ax in her Texas home while her husband was away on a business trip. This killing and the subsequent discovery of her killer were so shocking that both Hulu and HBO Max have shows based on the case, though the belief of what really happened that fateful day remains divided.

      <title>Moriah Wilson // 207</title>
      <description>In May of 2022, a 25-year-old elite bicyclist traveled to Austin, Texas for a race. But after hanging out with another cyclist and previous romantic interest of hers, she was murdered. When police sorted through the evidence at the scene, they began to believe that the girlfriend of man the victim had just hung out with was most likely behind the killing. But before they could issue a warrant for her arrest, she had already fled the state. This is the story of Moriah Wilson, and the search for Kaitlin Armstrong.

      <title>Daniel Brophy // 206</title>
      <description>In 2018, a chef and instructor at the Oregon Culinary Institute was murdered in his classroom before a Saturday morning class. After investigators looked into his wife, who was a romantic suspense novelist, they caught her in multiple lies, and uncovered that she had previously written an essay titled, “How To Murder Your Husband”. This is the story of Daniel Brophy.

      <title>Shannon Siders // 205</title>
      <description>In July of 1989, an 18-year-old Indigenous woman in Michigan went missing after a night out with friends. Shortly after her disappearance, the local police received a disturbing call where a frantic man confessed to her murder. Years passed after the discovery of her body, and police continued to question people in and out of her circle. But it wouldn’t be until 22 years later that movement finally came to her case. This is the story of Shannon Siders.

      <title>Robert Wone // 204 </title>
      <description>In August of 2006, an attorney in Washington DC was murdered after spending the night at a friend’s house while multiple other people were in the house. After his death, they were adamant that an intruder must have entered the home. But, as details came out about the evening and the scene of the crime, they painted an incredibly bizarre scene. This is the story of Robert Wone.

      <description>In 1988, an 18-year-old woman hit the road in Colorado to visit her family in Montana. But when she never arrived, police began their search for her in Wyoming and gathered some incredibly bizarre witness sightings. Sightings that only added more questions when her body was found soon after. This is the story of Lisa Kimmell, also known, as the Lil Miss Murder.

      <description>In 1984, residents in the small Alaskan village of Manley Hot Springs began disappearing when a drifter arrived to town.

      <description>In 1999, a 19-year-old woman was working an overnight shift at a Minnesota gas station when she was abducted from behind the counter. With the help of numerous tips, a clear suspect was uncovered. And thanks to NASA and a very specific dental filling, answers came to the case. This is the story of Katie Poirier.

        <![CDATA[<p>In 1999, a 19-year-old woman was working an overnight shift at a Minnesota gas station when she was abducted from behind the counter. With the help of numerous tips, a clear suspect was uncovered. And thanks to NASA and a very specific dental filling, answers came to the case.

      <description>In 2016, a 19-year-old man in Washington told his grandmother that he had an epiphany about his life that he was excited to share with her. But when she returned home later to hear about it, he was gone. When his car was found on the side of the road the next day with his cell phone, wallet, and snacks inside, his family and police wondered where on earth he could have gone.

      <title>Katie Janness // 195</title>
      <description>In July of 2021, a 40-year-old woman was walking her dog late at night in her local park when she was brutally murdered. Her girlfriend was the one to find her and immediately phoned police, only to find out that the 9 security cameras in the park weren’t working- making it unclear who committed this horrific and senseless act. As her girlfriends father said, “There is a monster on the loose in the city of Atlanta”. This is the story of Katie Janness.

      <title>Cleashindra Hall // 194</title>
      <description>In May of 1994, an intelligent and bright 18-year-old and soon-to-be pre-med student vanished after work in Arkansas. Her boss (who was a local doctor) showed some incredibly suspicious behavior after she went missing. But was he really involved in her disappearance? And if not, then what happened to her? This is the story of Cleashindra Hall.

      <title>Shane Donahue // 187</title>
      <description>In March of 2010, a 23-year-old man was leaving his parents house in a rural part of Northern Virginia, when he disappeared forever. Between an online battle of allegations, and prominent figures in the community, this case is extremely bizarre. It’s now been more than a decade with no answers. This is the story of Shane Donahue.

      <title>Kaysera Stops Pretty Places // 185 </title>
      <description>In 2019, newly 18-year-old woman in Montana hung out with some friends, before fleeing the house when a fight ensued. After that, she was never seen alive again. Days later, her body was found wrapped in plastic in a neighbors backyard, sparking a suspicious and disappointing “investigation” into her death. This is the story of Kaysera Stops Pretty Places.

      <description>In June of 2011, a Law student studying for her bar exam in Georgia suddenly vanished from her apartment. Within days, police would discover something horrifying and it didn’t take long to put the pieces together- especially after a fellow student had a concerning interview with a local news station.

      <title>Patty Striker // 183</title>
      <description>In 2000, a 35-year-old winery owner was found murdered in her A-frame tasting room. Was her murder connected to the killing of another winery owner just two months prior? Or was this a separate tragedy? Police would find out after something unthinkable happened 14 years later. This is the story of Patty Striker.

      <title>Nova Henry // 178</title>
      <description>In January of 2009, a young mother and her 10 month old daughter were murder in their Chicago townhouse while her 3 year old son sat in the same room. Between a secret relationship with an NBA superstar, multiple paternity battles in the courts, and a scorned love affair with a lawyer, this case is tragic at every turn. This is the story of Nova and Ava Henry.

      <title>Susan Swedell // 177</title>
      <description>In 1988, a 19-year-old woman went missing while a Minnesota blizzard hit her small lakeside city. Between her talking to stranger boys on party lines, a helpful gas station attendant’s account of his sightings, and a potential break-in a week after her disappearance, this case is full of bizarre clues. This is the story of Susan Swedell.

But after being seen on surveillance footage leaving with 3 men, she disappeared. An extensive search was done to find out what happened to her, and when her remains were eventually found, it was clear who was behind her murder. This is the story of Savannah Spurlock.

      <title>Zebb Quinn // 174</title>
      <description>In early January of 2000, an 18 year old boy living in Asheville, North Carolina, disappeared one night after his work shift. Weeks later, his car was discovered in parking lot and the contents inside only left police more confused. Between suspicious phone calls, a jealous boyfriend, and strange clues, this case proves to be one of the most bizarre we have covered. This is the story of Zebb Quinn.

      <description>In 2006, a 19-year-old man from Kansas City, Missouri headed off to Chicago with a group of fellow college students to attend a mock United Nations convention. But after a long day of conferences and a night of fun with peers, he disappeared. When he didn’t show up on surveillance cameras leaving the hotel, and a massive search turned up nothing, family, friends, and investigators seriously pondered what on earth happened to him. This is the story of Jesse Ross.

      <title>Rayna Rison // 170</title>
      <description>In March of 1993, a 16-year-old girl in Indiana closed up the animal hospital she worked at in preparation for a date with her boyfriend. But when she didn’t come home that night or show up for her date, her family reported her missing. After her body was discovered and investigators uncovered numerous suspects with potential motives, an eventual confession would put all the pieces of the puzzle together. This is the story of Rayna Rison.

      <title>Lana Harding // 166</title>
      <description>One morning in January of 1974, a young schoolteacher didn’t show up to her rural Montana classroom for the day, and the police were called to investigate. When her body was found in a field nearby, police arrested a new town resident, and it was quickly suspected that he was involved in another murder in a neighboring state. This is the story of Lana Harding, as well as Debra Prety.

        <![CDATA[<p>One morning in January of 1974, a young schoolteacher didn’t show up to her rural Montana classroom for the day, and the police were called to investigate.

      <title>Summer Wells // 165</title>
      <description>In June of 2021, a 5-year-old girl living in rural Tennessee disappeared one afternoon while allegedly playing with her toys in the basement of her family home. Her parents believe that she was abducted in broad daylight, but after an extensive investigation, no evidence suggested she had been taken. There was, however, suspicion that pointed closer to home. This is the story of Summer Wells.

      <title>Peggy Carr // 163</title>
      <description>Towards the end of 1988, a recently blended family in Florida received a threatening letter in the mail, and within a few months, they all became incredibly ill. When 2 doctors concluded that they had been poisoned, an investigation into who was behind it began. Between a murder mystery weekend event, to a killing that was literally inspired by an Agatha Christie detective novel, this story really does play out like a fictional story. But it’s all real. This is the story of Peggy Carr, also known, as the Mensa Murder.

      <description>In 1988, a woman called 911 to report a strange man outside her house. After a brief moment of silence, she screamed before the phone got disconnected. Ever since the call surfaced on the internet in 2002, it’s been picked apart by internet sleuths, and has left people everywhere wondering: Is the call a hoax? Or is it a 30-year-old murder mystery waiting to be solved? This is the story of the Ruth Price 911 Call.

      <title>The Rocky Mountain Murders // 160</title>
      <description>In January of 1982, two beautiful young women seemingly vanished in Breckenridge, Colorado during a relentless snow storm. But the next day, one would be found dead, and several months later, the other’s body would turn up as well. As police struggled to find the identity of a cold blooded killer, the investigation would take a number of unexpected turns that would last almost 40 years. This is the story of Bobbi Jo Oberholtzer and Annette Schnee, also know as The Rocky Mountain Murders.

      <title>The North Pole Murders // 159</title>
      <description>Between 1979 and 1981, a handful of girls and young women disappeared around the jolly small town of North Pole, Alaska, only for their remains to show up later. When their cause of deaths matched up, local State Troopers knew they had a serial killer on their hands. And eventually, they flew out of state to track down the man behind it all. This is the story of Glinda Sodemann, Doris Oehring, Wendy Wilson, Marlene Peters, and Lori King, also known as the North Pole Murders.

      <title>Samira Watkins // 156</title>
      <description>In October of 2009, a 25-year-old Florida woman was reported missing when she failed to show up for work the morning after an important conversation. But when her body washed up in a duffel bag at a local bayou days later, the investigation into her murder began. From an eerily accurate psychic reading to a web of suspects and lies, tensions ran high during the search for this woman’s killer. This is the story of Samira Watkins.

      <title>Sydney Loofe // 155</title>
      <description>In November of 2017, a 24-year-old Nebraska woman matched with another woman on Tinder, and the pair hit it off. But after a second date, she disappeared without a trace. Massive searches took place, but it wasn’t until a friend of the missing woman catfished a suspect on Tinder for information that the details started to come to light. Between witchcraft sex cults, a spree of crimes that weaved through multiple states, and an unlikely relationship, this case truly is as bizarre as it is tragic. This is the story of Sydney Loofe.

      <title>Ashley Young // 149</title>
      <description>In November of 2018, an inspiring 31-year-old woman headed to a Grand Rapids pub with an old friend, and she was never seen again. What followed was a neighbors horrific discovery in a shared basement, a retired police sergeant’s attempted cover up for his son, and an utterly shocking display of evidence in a Michigan apartment. This is the story of Ashley Young.

      <title>Tommy Burkett // 148</title>
      <description>In late November of 1991, a college student from Virginia was visiting home for Thanksgiving when he decided to meet with some old friends for a night out. The next day, his parents returned home to find their son dead. At first glance his death appeared to be a suicide and police labeled it open and shut. But then, more details started to emerge, like a car chase through a neighborhood, unreported injuries, and more, turning this case into an Unsolved Mystery. This is the story of Tommy Burkett.

      <title>Jodi Parrack // 147</title>
      <description>In November of 2007, a young Michigan girl was headed home on her bike after visiting with a friend, but she never returned. Once her body was found in a nearby cemetery, suspicions heavily weighed on a local man who suggested the family look there in the first place. But after years of searching for a killer, answers finally came when another girl had been kidnapped. This is the story of Jodi Parrack.

      <title>Julie Jensen // 146</title>
      <description>In December of 1998, a 40-year-old wife and mother from Wisconsin became violently ill, and after 3 days of being sick, she sadly passed away. But was there more at play here? Between multiple marital affairs, harassing photos, and a letter from beyond the grave, this case is shocking at every turn. This is the story of Julie Jensen.

When her body was found in a field by a bicyclist, the investigation into her murder began, starting with the neighbors. This case is full of suspicious characters and has a crime scene that will take you back to The Black Dahlia murder. This is the story of Peggy Hettrick.

      <title>The Opera House Murder // 141</title>
      <description>In 1980, a 31-year-old violinist performed the first act of a ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House before disappearing during intermission. When the show came to a close and all that was left of her was her instrument, police scoured the dark and seemingly never-ending theater until she was found murdered. Between suspicious stage hands, a ballerina undergoing hypnosis for investigators, and newspaper headlines that read “The Real Life Phantom of the Opera”, this baffling murder mystery shocked New York City to its core. This is the story of Helen Hagnes, also known as The Opera House Murder.

      <title>Daniel Robinson // 140</title>
      <description>On the morning of June 23, 2021, a 24-year-old Geologist living in Arizona headed out to a job site for work, before suddenly leaving 15 minutes later and not being heard from again. One month later, his car was found in a desert ravine, alongside the clothes he was wearing the day he disappeared and other personal items. When the young man’s family and a private investigator begin looking into the cars internal accident reports, some incredibly suspicious details came to light. This is the tragic and very current story of Daniel Robinson.

This is the story of Kathy Frost, as well as Leslee Reynolds. Also known, as the Murder at Otter Cliff.

      <title>Matthew Hoffman // 136</title>
      <description>In 2010, a 30-year-old man turned criminal in Ohio set off on a sinister path of destruction. After hiding in a tree while he stalked a local family of 3, he went on a murderous rampage and held one of them hostage. From revealing surveillance footage, a hollow tree hiding spot, and a house full of leaves, this case proves to be one of the strangest we’ve covered. This is the story of Matthew Hoffman. And it’s also the story of Tina Herrmann, Stephanie Sprang, and Kody and Sarah Maynard.

      <title>Alexis Murphy // 134</title>
      <description>In August of 2013, a 17-year-old girl in Virginia headed out to collect hair supplies for her upcoming senior picture day. But when she didn’t return home that night, her family feared for the worst. After tracking her cell phone to a nearby location and finding surveillance footage of her speaking to a strange man at a nearby gas station, police began looking into a man who was connected to another local girl’s disappearance. This is the story of Alexis Murphy.

      <title>The Tampa Bay Murders // 131</title>
      <description>In the late spring of 1989, a woman and her two daughters left their farm in Ohio for a girls trip down in Florida that was supposed to be filled with laughter and adventure. But when 3 bodies turned up in the Tampa Bay a couple weeks after they left, their family feared for the worst. Investigators fought hard to figure out what had happened to this poor family, and who the monster behind it was. And eventually, they received an important tip about a suspicious neighbor… This is the story of Joan, Michelle, and Christie Rogers. Also known as the Tampa Bay Murders and the Rogers Family Murders.

      <title>Allyson Watterson // 130</title>
      <description>In 2019, a 20-year-old woman was out in a remote area with her recent ex-boyfriend when she suddenly disappeared. After he returned home to his parents house the following morning bloodied and dirty, his family began an extensive search for the young woman without informing her family. After reporting her missing, they finally notified her mom of the days events, and a massive search followed that same week. When her remains were finally uncovered, they brought more questions than answers to the investigation. This is the story of Allyson Watterson.

      <title>Angie Dodge // 129</title>
      <description>In 1996, an 18-year-old woman had finally moved into her first apartment in Idaho Falls, Idaho when something tragic happened inside. After she failed to show up to work the following morning, her co-workers went to her home and discovered her murdered. The 23-year investigation that unfolded would be a complex and grueling fight for justice full of false suspects, an intense DNA search that crossed the country, and a web of deceit. This is the story of Angie Dodge.

        <![CDATA[<p>In 1996, an 18-year-old woman had finally moved into her first apartment in Idaho Falls, Idaho when something tragic happened inside. After she failed to show up to work the following morning, her co-workers went to her home and discovered her murdered. The 23-year investigation that unfolded would be a complex and grueling fight for justice full of false suspects, an intense DNA search that crossed the country, and a web of deceit. This is the story of Angie Dodge.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>BONUS EPISODES</strong></p><p><a href="patreon.com/goingwestpodcast">patreon.com/goingwestpodcast</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>CASE SOURCES</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/postregister/name/angie-dodge-obituary?pid=137516177">https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/postregister/name/angie-dodge-obituary?pid=137516177</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2019/07/the-angie-dodge-case-from-1996-until-today-whats-happened-why-and-whats-next/">https://www.eastidahonews.com/2019/07/the-angie-dodge-case-from-1996-until-today-whats-happened-why-and-whats-next/</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14272064/jack-roger-dodge">https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14272064/jack-roger-dodge</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7645270/angie-raye-dodge">https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7645270/angie-raye-dodge</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.angiedodge.com/tribute/">https://www.angiedodge.com/tribute/</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/angie-dodge-murder-how-a-discarded-cigarette-led-to-an-arrest-in-idaho-falls-teens-cold-case/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/angie-dodge-murder-how-a-discarded-cigarette-led-to-an-arrest-in-idaho-falls-teens-cold-case/</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://innocenceproject.org/cases/christopher-tapp/">https://innocenceproject.org/cases/christopher-tapp/</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.idahopress.com/news/local/brian-dripps-sentenced-to-life-for-angie-dodge-murder/article_bfb0a7cf-3ea3-5b0a-99a4-0fd5068e7fe6.html">https://www.idahopress.com/news/local/brian-dripps-sentenced-to-life-for-angie-dodge-murder/article_bfb0a7cf-3ea3-5b0a-99a4-0fd5068e7fe6.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3317506/">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3317506/</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://innocenceproject.org/christopher-tapp-exoneration/">https://innocenceproject.org/christopher-tapp-exoneration/</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2021/06/after-25-years-brian-dripps-goes-to-prison-for-rape-and-death-of-angie-dodge/">https://www.eastidahonews.com/2021/06/after-25-years-brian-dripps-goes-to-prison-for-rape-and-death-of-angie-dodge/</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Kristen Modafferi // 126</title>
      <description>In 1997, a newly 18-year-old woman headed to San Francisco for the summer to attend UC Berkeley for a Photography course. But after work one afternoon, she seemingly vanished out of thin air. Weeks later, an anonymous call came into a local news station from a man claiming to know exactly what happened to her. Between a suspicious newspaper personal ad, potential ties to a well-known serial killer, and new bewildering DNA evidence, this case is loaded with incredibly conflicting suspicions. This is the story of Kristen Modafferi.

      <title>Girly Chew Hossencofft // 125</title>
      <description>In 1999, a young bank teller left work in New Mexico and was never seen again. As her co-workers began investigating her disappearance the following morning, they were confident they knew exactly what happened to her. Between proof of long-standing cons, cannibalistic conspiracy theorists, and mysterious evidence found in her home, this case proves to be one of the most bizarre we’ve covered. This is the story of Girly Chew Hossencofft.

      <title>Philip Fraser // 124</title>
      <description>In 1988, a 23-year-old man from Alaska left for a solo road trip to Washington so he could begin medical school. During the drive, he experienced car trouble, but just 5 days into his trip, his vehicle would be found engulfed in flames 1,700 miles from where his journey began. It wasn’t long until a body would be found, and witnesses began coming forward stating that they saw the young man picking up a strange hitchhiker around the time of his disappearance. This is the story of Philip Fraser.

      <itunes:summary>In 1988, a 23-year-old man from Alaska left for a solo road trip to Washington so he could begin medical school. During the drive, he experienced car trouble, but just 5 days into his trip, his vehicle would be found engulfed in flames 1,700 miles from where his journey began. It wasn’t long until a body would be found, and witnesses began coming forward stating that they saw the young man picking up a strange hitchhiker around the time of his disappearance. This is the story of Philip Fraser.

      <title>Kaylee Sawyer // 123</title>
      <description>One summer evening in 2016, a 23-year-old Oregon woman got in a fight with her boyfriend, walked off into the night alone, and was never seen again. Just 2 days after she went missing, a local woman entered a police station and explained a devastating story about police regarding her husband, who at that point, was missing. And just hours later, another young woman in the area disappeared. This is the story of Kaylee Sawyer, and it’s also the story of Andrea Maes.

      <description>In the early summer of 1986, two young blonde girls went missing in the state of South Carolina without a trace. Until a series of cryptic phone calls led investigators to their bodies. A serial killer was on the loose and a letter written by one of the victims to her own family held the key to his capture.

      <title>The Lake Oconee Murders // 121</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/show/going-west-true-crime</link>
      <description>In 2014, a successful, retired couple living on a beautiful lake in Georgia hadn’t been heard from for multiple days in a row. But after some neighbors went over to their home searching for them, they were nowhere to be found. But upon checking the house again days later, neighbors found one of them brutally slain in the garage, and the other was missing. That is, until some locals made a gruesome discovery in the water. This is the story of Shirley and Russell Dermond. Also known as the Lake Oconee Murders. *BONUS EPISODES* patron.com/goingwestpodcast *CASE SOURCES* https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ga-supreme-court/1185576.html https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/129547961/mark-christian-dermond https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/129892189/shirley-bell-dermond https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/129350580/russell-joseph-dermond https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/129547961/mark-christian-dermond https://www.dailynews.com/2014/06/13/beheading-of-husband-killing-of-wife-so-baffling-even-alligators-are-suspects/ https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/investigations/gone-cold-the-murders-at-lake-oconee-4-years-later-elderly-couples-son-opens-up/67-549362307 https://www.publicpolicerecord.com/georgia/doc-prisoner/MAJOR_TROY/0001097228 https://www.13wmaz.com/article/news/local/where-you-live/dermond-family-established-in-restaurant-business/93-299102252 https://darkideas.net/russell-and-shirley-dermond-the-beheading-at-lake-oconee/ https://www.unionrecorder.com/news/new-technology-to-be-used-in-unsolved-murder-case/article_943dc312-971b-11ea-bcfa-875703a04928.html https://www.lakeoconeenews.us/article/6-years-later Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy &amp; Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy

      <description>In the summer of 1988, a Chicago-based journalist left the city life to write a novel in a small, Colorado mining town. After he arrived, he opened up an antique shop and discovered that the previous tenant had disappeared the year prior. But while he began investigating the mans disappearance for his book, he disappeared himself. And this led to one of the biggest searches in Colorado history.

      <description>In September 2009, a Yale graduate student working towards her doctorate was just days away from her wedding when she disappeared without a trace. But as investigators began looking into her disappearance, they discovered that she was never seen on surveillance footage leaving the building that day, and that her keycard wasn’t used after entering a basement lab the morning she was last seen. As they began questioning other students and searching the building top-to-bottom, they found some incredibly disturbing evidence.

      <description>In August of 2006, a 23-year-old woman headed out to a nightclub as a “last hurrah” before returning to college in Eastern Texas. Her car was later found abandoned on the side of a highway and thought to have run out of gas, but she was nowhere to be found. As investigators began looking into her last known steps, they found some peculiar surveillance footage and even discovered that her cell phone was actively being used by an unknown man.

      <description>Between the late 1970’s to the early 1990’s, a monster invaded a main highway across Oregon and committed multiple crimes against in his wake. Although his name was always known, he was always somehow one step ahead of police and continued to get away with murder. But as time went on and fresh eyes viewed the case files, investigators finally pursued justice for numerous victims. This is the story of, Rachanda Pickle, Kaye Turner, Marlene Gabrielson, Melissa Sanders, Shiela Swan, and potentially many others.

      <description>In 1992, a 27-year old airport employee and aspiring cartoonist left work to grab she and her co-workers some food for their overnight shift- but she never returned. When her body was found days later in the trunk of her car, it was clear she had been brutally murdered. The case went cold for over a year, but when her diary was discovered, disturbing accounts were unlocked.

      <title>Pinyon Pines Murders // 114</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/show/going-west-true-crime</link>
      <description>In the late summer of 2006, numerous calls came in to the fire department regarding a house in the beautiful mountains of Pinyon Pines, California that was engulfed in flames. After the fire was put out, multiple bodies from a beloved family in the community were found inside- and the manner of death was homicide. After years of suspicion, speculation, and a need for answers, an arrest was finally made. But did police get it right?

      <title>The Suitcase Murder // 112</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/show/going-west-true-crime</link>
      <description>In 2004, three suitcases were discovered by different people in the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, and they all contained the dismembered remains of an unknown person. But when police released a composite sketch of the victim, someone came forward believing it to be an old friend from New Jersey. As police began to question his family, co-workers, and friends, one person in particular stood out as a clear suspect, and suspicions against them just kept coming in.

      <description>In 2006, a beautiful and intelligent 17-year-old girl in Colorado was savagely murdered in her home just days after getting into an argument with a police officer as well as days after her dog suspiciously went missing. With debates of family involvement and talks of police corruption, this botched investigation had this small town in a terrified frenzy. But years after the investigation began, a man found some incriminating information in a local storage unit.

      <description>In late 1992, a couple was driving after a night of partying when they got into a terrible car wreck. When their bodies were found at the crash, this small, South Dakota town wondered if they had gone off on their own or if someone had abducted them. 3 months later, a bizarre discovery was made and it brought more questions than answers to the case.

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/show/going-west-true-crime</link>
      <description>In 1977, a famous candy company heiress in Chicago mysteriously disappeared after a seemingly normal day visiting a clinic in a neighboring state. In this complex who-dun-it, you’ll question the butler, friends and family, and everyone she did dealings with to try and figure who wanted her dead; but it seems EVERYONE had a motive. From possible impersonators, to suspicious remodeling, and multiple confessions, this case has it all. This is the story of Helen Brach.

      <description>In 2017, a retired firefighter went missing from his Texas home during a seemingly normal day. After searching his vast property, a strange trail of blood was discovered in his workshop, and it seemed to stop abruptly. While checking his cell phone records, some veeeeery unnerving information came forward that made this case even more bizarre - and it lead police to look at his inner circle even more closely.

      <description>In 2015, a 19-year-old visited her family home in Virginia for a few days before heading back to Arizona to start school. But after she was taken to the Virginia airport to go home, she sent a string of strange and uncharacteristic text messages to her loved ones and never boarded the plane.

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/show/going-west-true-crime</link>
      <description>*In 1984 in Fort Myers, Florida, my mom's sister went missing after she planned to break up with her boyfriend. She wrote a letter to her parents while they were on vacation regarding her fears towards him, so they knew something was wrong when they returned home and she was nowhere to be found. Years later, he went on to murder more women- but her body has never been discovered. He’s known to have told people that the police would never find her. And upon his last questioning regarding her, he laughed and spit in the detectives face without saying a word. This is the disappearance of Carol Woolsoncroft.* *BONUS EPISODES:* patreon.com/goingwestpodcast Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy &amp; Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy

Between a suspicious note found and a very specific M.O, police feared they had a serial killer on their hands- and that these murders could also be linked to another couple’s killings months prior.

      <title>The Napa Halloween Murders // 91</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/the-napa-halloween-murders-91-online-aud</link>
      <description>On Halloween night in 2004, three roommates passed out candy to trick or treaters at their Napa Valley home before eventually heading to bed in their respective bedrooms. But just a couple hours after falling asleep, someone broke into their home and murdered two of them before running out of the house and out of sight. So, who committed these cold-blooded killings and why? This is the murder of Adriane Insogna and Leslie Mazzara. These are The Napa Halloween Murders.

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/judy-smith-88-online-audio-converter-com</link>
      <description>In 1997, a Boston woman headed to Philadelphia with her husband for his business trip. But during this trip, she went sight-seeing and never returned. Investigators began looking into those who were close to her to see if they had done anything to do. But meanwhile, they were getting tips regarding multiple possible sightings of her- making it unclear if she was dead or alive. This is the murder Judy Smith.

      <title>Stephen Hricko // 87</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/stephen-hricko-87-online-audio-converter</link>
      <description>In 1998, a Maryland couple went to a murder mystery dinner for the Valentine's Day weekend. After a fun evening at the show and a beautiful dinner alongside 100 other couples at a waterfront resort, their night ended in an eerily similar fashion as the dinner show's plot. And a real life "whodunit" story unfolded. This is the murder of Stephen Hricko.

      <description>In April 2008, a 22-year-old girl in North Carolina woke up feeling incredibly sick, so she was in and out of the emergency room throughout the day. But as day turned to night, she spoke on the phone with a friend and explained that she was going to the hospital yet again, and her ride was almost there. After she hung up the phone, she was never seen again- and a peculiar scene was left at her apartment. This is the disappearance of Jamie Fraley.

      <description>In 1989, a 13-year-old girl ran over to a neighbors house after school in her New York community, but she never returned home. Luckily, a couple people spotted her going into a certain house on her street. But when family and (eventually) police knocked on their door, no one in the house knew where she was. And they all denied seeing her that day at all. So where did she go? This is the murder of Kelly Ann Tinyes.

      <title>The Starved Rock Murders // 84</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/the-starved-rock-murders-84-online-audio_2</link>
      <description>In 1960, three Chicago women set off on a week-day getaway to a nearby lodge. After spending their first afternoon enjoying some lunch, they left for a stroll through the snowy park nearby- and they never returned. When a blizzard hit the following night and none of the staff realized the women were missing, the investigation started late- and potential evidence was lost from the new blankets of snow in the area. But one piece of evidence left at the scene would help put the pieces together. These are the murders of Lillian Oetting, Frances Murphy, and Mildred Linquist. Also known, as the Starved Rock Murders.

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/amy-allwine-83-online-audio-converter-co</link>
      <description>In 2016, a Minnesota woman began receiving mysterious emails, and the FBI informed her that she was the target of a hit that someone ordered on the dark web. But as the months rolled on and she amped up her home security, she still ended up dead. So, who wanted this kindhearted, god-fearing woman killed, and what exactly happened to her? This is the murder of Amy Allwine.

      <title>Leah Freeman // 82</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/leah-freeman-82-online-audio-converter-c</link>
      <description>In the summer of 2000, a 15-year-old girl went missing from her small Oregon town. As police set their sights on one person in particular, a key piece of evidence comes into play, followed by a body. Although you’d think these things would help answer some questions, they do quite the opposite. This is the murder of Leah Freeman.

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/donna-scrivo-81-online-audio-converter-c</link>
      <description>In 2013, a series of devastating events caused a Michigan mother to move in with her adult son. Months later, that son would go missing. When his remains were quickly discovered, police could not believe who the main suspect became- and neither could their small community. This is the murder of Ramsay Scrivo, and the story of his mother, Donna Scrivo.

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/new-jeremy-bright-79-7-28-20-6-46-pm-onl</link>
      <description>In 1986, a teenage boy attended the Coos County Fair in Myrtle Point, Oregon with his younger sister. But after a few fun days at the fair, the two split up to go off with their friends- and the boy was never seen again. From oddly specific local rumors to troubled young suspects, this case is all over the place. This is the disappearance of Jeremy Bright.

      <description>In 1989, an 18-year-old girl went back to her rural Washington hometown for Thanksgiving.
But while out for a run with her dog, something terrible happened. When her dog showed up to her house without her, the family knew she was in danger. But one day, a woman would feel suspicious about her co-worker and contact police; cracking this case wide open. This is the murder of Mandy Stavik.

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/new-mary-7-14-20-8-11-pm-online-audio-co</link>
      <description>In October 1965, a woman in Atlanta met her friend for dinner- but once the two parted ways, she vanished. Between seemingly staged evidence, strange sightings in a different states, and frightening phone calls before her disappearance, this case proves to be incredibly bizarre. This is the disappearance of Mary Shotwell Little.

      <title>Darwin Vest // 76</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/darwin-vest-76</link>
      <description>In 1999, a scientist and venomous creature specialist went missing during his walk home from a night out in Idaho Falls. This is a man who had just landed a big deal for his latest invention, and a man who had supposedly found the cure to cancer. So, was his disappearance a tragic accident, or did someone want him gone? This is the disappearance of Darwin Vest.

      <description>In 1997, a 7-year-old girl drove to Nevada with her father and step-brother for a Memorial Day Weekend trip to a casino. When she was left in the casino's arcade without adult supervision in the early morning hours, a predator found his way to her instead. This is the murder of Sherrice Iverson.

      <description>In 1987, a successful, 43-year-old businesswoman was found poisoned to death in her home. After having medicine found in her bathroom tested in a lab, investigators felt more than certain that someone had spiked it in hopes of killing her. As the details unfold, the whole story sounds more like a mystery novel than a real case. So, who did it? This is the murder of Patsy Wright.

      <description>In 2012, a 32-year-old Dallas, Texas woman was found murdered in her own bathtub.

        <![CDATA[<p>In 2012, a 32-year-old Dallas, Texas woman was found murdered in her own bathtub.

When her family found her dead in her home days later, and they knew exactly who killed her.

      <description>In early 2009, a mother of 2 decided to enjoy a glass of wine on her couch and unwind after the long work week. But 2 days later, when her ex-husband went to return their children to her, he came upon a suspicious scene at her house, and she was nowhere in sight. After reporting her missing, investigators began searching for her tirelessly, and the clues just got stranger. This is the disappearance of Nancy Moyer.

      <description>In 2007, a 19-year-old girl went missing after dance practice at her college. Although the details weren’t all too suspicious, police began searching for her immediately.

      <description>In 2014, a young, pregnant wife went missing in the desert after leaving her California home to scout hiking trails. A full day passed before she was reported missing, but police began their search for her immediately. As they questioned the people in her circle, a rabbit hole of secrets was exposed. This is the murder of Erin Corwin.

      <description>In 2008, a 21-year-old mother of 2 was abducted from her home in North Port, Florida. While in the car with her captor, she was able to make a crucial call to 911 in hopes that they'd track her location. But when the local Sheriff's Office dropped the ball, her life was at risk. Numerous other calls came into the station that afternoon as police covered 3 separate counties looking for this young woman, praying that they would find her alive. This is the story of Denise Amber Lee.

      <description>In 1975, a teenage girl moved with her family to Northern California so her father could begin his new job. But with this move came negative change.

In 1986, a Danish Pan Am flight attendant went missing from her Connecticut home after a big snowstorm knocked out the town's power. She was in the middle of a divorce with her husband who told her friends that she was visiting her sick mother back in Denmark and that he didn't know when she'd be back. But as weeks passed and she'd missed multiple flights for work and hadn't returned any of her friends calls, they began to fear for the worse. When police finally began investigating her disappearance, they discovered that just before she was last seen, her husband had made some strange purchases. This is the murder of Helle Crafts.

      <title>Michael Morton // 59</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/michael-morton-59-online-audio-converter</link>
      <description>In 1986, a 31 year old Texan woman was brutally murdered in her bed while home alone with her 3 year old son. Police immediately began to suspect her husband who had written her an angry note before leaving for work that morning. After weeks of questioning him and interrogating their loved ones, he was arrested for her murder. But years later, his attorney motioned to get the DNA tested since technology was better because he truly believed in his wife’s innocence. Once tested, the results were mixed. So, did this man kill his wife? Or was an innocent man put away for life? This is the murder of Christine Morton and the story of Michael Morton.

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/jessica-dishon-58-new-online-audio-conve</link>
      <description>In September 1999, a 17-year-old in Kentucky didn't show up to school. When her parents returned home from work, they saw her car was still in the driveway. As they took a closer look, they noticed a suspicious scene and immediately reported their daughter missing. Her body is eventually found but the investigation was horribly botched. But when the real killer is caught, no one can believe it. This is the murder of Jessica Dishon.

      <description>In March 1989, a 17 year old girl went to her job in Frederick, Maryland at a clothing store after school. Hours later, she would be found dead in the shop. After a few months passed, an anonymous man left a message for a confession hotline stated that he was the one behind the crime. Yet to this day, people believe that the investigation was purposefully botched to cover up a suspicious police officer.

      <title>Harold Henthorn // 48</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/harold-henthorn-48</link>
      <description>In 2012, a woman and her husband were hiking in the Rocky Mountains when she had a fatal fall off a cliff. It took 2 hours for life support to arrive. But when they finally did, she was pronounced dead. Before the investigation began, her husband's story wasn't quite lining up, and an anonymous letter to police would turn this "accidental death" on its head.

      <title>Lake Waco Murders // 46</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/lake-waco-murders-46-online-audio-conver</link>
      <description>In 1982, three Texas teenagers went out to watch the sunset over Lake Waco and didn't come home by curfew. When the night passed, their families feared the worst. But that following evening, their bodies would be discovered at a different park across the lake, and an intense investigation would begin. This is the story of the murders of Jill Montgomery, Raylene Rice, and Kenneth Franks. This is the case of the Lake Waco Murders.
______________________________

Anaheim investigator Julissa Trapp is not like other detectives. She’s the only woman on the homicide squad, and a skilled chameleon: undercover cop in vice stings, crime-scene commander, patient confidante of killers. A master interrogator, she invokes her personal experience – and deepest griefs -- as a tool to elicit confessions. When a young woman’s body is found at a trash-sorting plant, Trapp learns the murder may be linked to the disappearance of three other women in nearby Santa Ana. Trapp embarks on a dark journey that brings her face to face with a man who takes “a little piece of her soul.”

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/faith-hedgepeth-43-online-audio-converte_3</link>
      <description>In Fall 2012, a 19-year-old college student went out with her friend/roommate in their town of Chapel Hill, North Carolina before returning home in the early morning. Her friend left so she could get some sleep but returned home hours later to find her dead in the apartment. This is the murder of Faith Hedgepeth.

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/thomas-brown-35</link>
      <description>In Fall 2016, a high school senior doesn't come home by curfew and his mom reports him missing.

The contents of his car raise more questions than answers as people start to believe something really bad happened to him. This is the case of Thomas Brown.

      <title>Sherri Papini // 32</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/sherri-papini-32</link>
      <description>In November 2016, a mother of 2 from Northern California doesn't come home after her usual jog. Her husband tracks her cell phone only to find that it's located in a patch of grass with the headphones placed on top along with strands of blonde hair, but she is nowhere in sight. After a few weeks of searching, she turns up alive in the early hours of Thanksgiving morning- but incredibly injured. As police try to find her abductors, the investigators begin to see holes in her story, making them wonder what really happened to her. This is the case of Sherri Papini.

      <title>Kenia Monge // 31</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/kenia-monge-31</link>
      <description>On March 31, 2011, a 19-year-old girl goes to a night club with her friends. But before the night is over, she gets kicked out for being too intoxicated, leaving her alone on the streets of Denver, Colorado without her purse and phone. When the morning comes, her family and friends realize that she's missing, but think it might be an April Fools Prank. After viewing local surveillance footage and a strange text message on the victims phone, detectives do everything they can to find out what happened to this young woman. The details would blow their minds. This is the case of Kenia Monge.

      <title>Bryce Laspisa // 30</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/bryce-laspisa-30</link>
      <description>In August 2013, a 19-year-old boy takes an unexpected road trip away from college down the I-5 to visit his parents in Southern California at the same time his friends reported him having incredibly strange behavior. The (what should have been) 6-hour drive turns into a frustrating and dumbfounding 24 hour journey when he never arrives to his family home. Police find his car crashed, but there's no sign of him anywhere. This is the case of Bryce Laspisa.

      <description>One snowy night in 1996, a 23-year-old women was enjoying drinks at a bar with friends after a long day at work and a fight with her boyfriend. At 3:40am, she sat in her car in a deserted parking lot since her boyfriend had told her not to come home that night. Suddenly, she was approached by a male in a white BMW and witnesses saw him shoot her before he reached into her car and taking something. The case went cold and the victim's twin sister Jenny did everything she could do to keep the light on in her siblings case- she even put up billboards across Baltimore to gain attention from the public. But what happened that fateful night in Maryland? This is the case of Jody LeCornu.

      <title>Nicholas Barclay // 22</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/nicholas-barclay-22</link>
      <description>In 1994, a troubled 13-year-old goes missing while walking home from a basketball game. The police chalk it up to a runaway case, but he doesn't return home. 3 years later, he's found in Spain claiming that he was kidnapped in Texas and had just escaped a sex ring run by military officials. When he's reunited with his family, red flags begin to raise and police wonder what really happened to the boy who disappeared years prior. When the truth is uncovered, no one can believe it. This is the case of Nicholas Barclay.

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/rodney-alcala-21</link>
      <description>In the late 1960's, a Los Angeles-native with multiple mental health diagnoses is caught in the midst of murdering a young girl. When he vanishes without a trace, the FBI adds him to their 10 Most Wanted List. After a few years of actively searching, he is finally caught. But due to some unforeseen challenges, he is once again a free man. Young girls and women continue to die and he goes on a well-known dating show, but no one is quite able to pin any new crimes on him... for years. This is the case of The Dating Game Killer, Rodney Alcala.

      <title>Amy Bishop // 19</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/goingwestpodcast/amy-bishop-19</link>
      <description>In 2010, a professor opened fire in a biology faculty meeting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and, when police catch the woman behind it all, they realize that she has a dark past. In 1986, she had "accidentally" shot her brother in their family's Massachusetts kitchen, but was hardly questioned on the incident at all. When police re-open her brothers case and dive even deeper into her history, they also realize that she has been a suspect in multiple bombings. This is the case of Amy Bishop.
