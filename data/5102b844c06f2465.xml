      <title>Three Days In Dallas | 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>All physicians are taught, “First do no harm.” But what happens when a doctor does harm his patients?</p><p>Dr. Robert Henderson was a veteran spinal surgeon in Dallas when he got an unusual phone call from a local hospital: a new surgeon had operated so poorly that a patient who’d walked in on her own two feet now couldn’t even wiggle her toes.&nbsp;Dr. Henderson had seen a lot, but he wasn't prepared for this.

      <itunes:summary>All physicians are taught, “First do no harm.” But what happens when a doctor does harm his patients?

Dr. Robert Henderson was a veteran spinal surgeon in Dallas when he got an unusual phone call from a local hospital: a new surgeon had operated so poorly that a patient who’d walked in on her own two feet now couldn’t even wiggle her toes. Dr. Henderson had seen a lot, but he wasn't prepared for this. The surgery was so bad, in fact, he asked himself whether this person possibly be an impostor impersonating a physician?

“Death Don’t Have No Mercy” performed by Delaney Davidson and Marlon Williams, courtesy of Rough Diamond Records.
