      <title>Congressman Jamie Raskin | Oh, The Humidity!</title>
      <description>Former almost-president Al Gore issued a stark warning about the consequences of not acting to clean up the Earth’s atmosphere, and Republican Senator Josh Hawley made a laughable claim at a meeting of conservatives last weekend.  Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin returns to The Late Show for a three part interview that begins with a reminder that autocrats and dictators around the world are working together to subvert democratic institutions and ideals, and likens the former president to a mafia boss, who often succeeds at evading prosecution but could be taken down by the Department of Justice and the investigative work of the Jan 6 Committee.

      <title>Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Extended Cut) | Charge!</title>
      <description>The former president publicly went after Cassidy Hutchinson after her testimony in front of the Jan. 6th Committee, and he may have attempted to intimidate her behind the scenes as well. Over at the Supreme Court, their recent rulings regarding religion further erode the idea that America’s government should operate independently of any church. And Rep. Kinzinger tells Stephen that the Jan. 6th Committee was aware of threats against Cassidy Hutchinson’s safety and that’s why her testimony was given at a hastily-announced surprise hearing on June 28th. He also addresses his frustration with the DOJ’s handling of people who refuse to testify before the Jan. 6th Committee, and lays out the bottom-line purpose of the committee: to make the coup plotters pay for their crimes.

      <title>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Extended Cut) | This Just In-surrection</title>
      <description>Today’s surprise Jan. 6th Committee hearing featured testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson who described shockingly violent behavior by the former president and damning details about how White House officials knew things could get out of control at the “Stop The Steal” rally. Next, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez returns to The Late Show with her assessment of today’s Jan. 6th Committee hearing and her assertion that any member of congress who sought a pardon for their role in the insurrection should be expelled from their seat in the House of Representatives. The Congresswoman also says Democrats, in particular President Biden, need to show the American people they are ready to fight and to create leverage by signaling willingness to expand the Supreme Court and end the filibuster in the Senate.

      <title>Mike Myers (Extended Cut) | Gaffe From The Past</title>
      <description>After watching George W. Bush make an incredible Freudian slip about his unjustified invasion of Iraq, Stephen wonders what else the former president might come clean about. He’s also wondering just how terrified we should be about the news that a monkeypox outbreak has reached U.S. shores. And the creator and star of “The Pentaverate,” Mike Myers, chats with Stephen about their shared love of The Beatles and Peter Jackson’s documentary, “Get Back.” Stick around for more of this exclusive extended interview with Mike Myers, who is celebrating the 30th anniversary of the debut of his landmark hit film, “Wayne’s World,” by still being great friends and constantly riffing with Dana Carvey like the comedy legends they are.

      <title>Sec. Mark Esper | Singing In Ukraine</title>
      <description>The hateful, racist theory that inspired a teenager to commit mass murder in Buffalo, NY is a popular talking point among Republican politicians and the host of “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Elsewhere in America, parents are desperately searching for supplies of baby formula as the nationwide shortage becomes a full-blown crisis.

      <title>Sheryl Crow (Extended Cut) &amp; Stephen's 2010 GRAMMYs Story</title>
      <description>GOP cowards spent decades packing the Supreme Court with justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, but are now afraid to celebrate their victory. Over on Twitter, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz showed once again how much respect he has for women. Next, The Late Show Pod Show has Stephen's exclusive extended interview with legendary musician and subject of a new Showtime documentary, Sheryl Crow, who shares tales about some of the incredible artists she has worked with and shared stages with over the years. And for even more good stuff that didn't air on TV, stick around for Stephen Colbert swapping stories with Jon Batiste about Clive Davis's famous Pre-GRAMMY Gala after tonight's guests were wrapped but the cameras (and mics!) were still rolling.

      <title>José Andrés &amp; Ron Howard, Emily Bazelon | Ruh Roe </title>
      <description>“Well, s***.” Stephen reacts to the leaked Supreme Court opinion that appears to strike down Roe v. Wade, destroying a half century of protections for reproductive rights, and takes Maine Senator Susan Collins to task over her role in confirming Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett to the court. Next, listen as journalist and legal commentator Emily Bazelon joins Stephen to discuss the Supreme Court opinion that appears to overturn Roe v. Wade, including who may have leaked the report and what may happen next as Americans on both sides of the issue react to the expected ruling. Hear more of Emily’s work on “Slate Political Gabfest,” the weekly podcast she co-hosts with John Dickerson and David Plotz. And our friend José Andrés returns to The Late Show alongside Ron Howard, who directed the new film, “We Feed People,” which profiles the amazing work by World Central Kitchen volunteers and staff around the world. Listen as chef José delivers a pep talk for anyone who wonders how they can make an impact using resources they already have, and watch the documentary, “We Feed People,” when it premieres on Disney+ on May 27th, and consider supporting World Central Kitchen by volunteering or making a donation at http://www.wck.org.

      <description>Newly released emails show that Secret Service agents were outraged at the White House’s attempts to downplay the severity of dog bites suffered while President Biden’s dog Major lived on the premises, and a shock poll reveals that The Weather Channel is the most trusted name in news. Next, the first lady of The Late Show, Evie Colbert, returns for this Easter 2022 edition of “First Drafts,” where we look at some questionable decisions made by the folks who write our greeting cards. And Josh Brolin fully intended to step away from acting for a nice long break, but then he picked up the phone and director Denis Villeneuve was on the other end with an invitation to appear in “Dune.” Stick around for more of Stephen’s interview with Josh Brolin and check out his new show, “Outer Range,” streaming now on Amazon Prime.

      <title>Claire Foy &amp; Paul Bettany | Did A Bird Poop On The President?</title>
      <description>It’s our duty to fact check the video of President Biden supposedly being targeted by a bird while giving a speech, and Stephen checks in with NYC Mayor Eric Adams who announced the arrest of the suspect in yesterday’s subway shooting in Brooklyn. Next up, who has it worse when it comes to the housing market? We find out on this edition of “Generation Fights,” with Stephen Colbert representing Baby Boomers and Late Show writer Eliana Kwartler representing Millennials. And Claire Foy &amp; Paul Bettany stop by for a two-part interview that kicks off with a frank description of the problematic characters they play in their new series, “A Very British Scandal,” which premieres next Friday on Amazon Prime. And finally, Stephen comments on the passing of comedy legend Gilbert Gottfried, and shares a clip from Gilbert’s final appearance on The Late Show in a very silly send-up of Netflix’s bodice-ripping period drama, “Bridgerton.”

      <title>Molly Shannon (Exclusive Extended Cut), Rep. Cori Bush</title>
      <description>President Biden hopes to counter the effects of inflation by increasing the availability of ethanol at the gas pump, and Stephen reacts to news that Rachel Maddow will cut back to hosting her namesake show only once per week. Meanwhile, the latest offering from American Airlines isn’t a flight, and people with cash to burn might consider visiting a Texas spa that offers $300 hot tub sessions with live otters. Our friend Molly Shannon returns to The Late Show to tell Stephen about losing her mom and sister at a young age, and the reason she included that story at the very beginning of her new memoir, “Hello Molly!” Stick around for more of this Pod Show exclusive extended interview, when Molly explains her motto: "struggle itself is meaningful," and tells the story of how she and a friend successfully scammed top agents by posing as associates of the playwright David Mamet early in her career. Next, Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri returns to The Late Show for her first in-studio interview and tells Stephen how she has merged her life as an activist with her responsibilities as a politician, such as when she successfully protested for an extension to the pandemic eviction moratorium.

      <title>Chance the Rapper (Exclusive Extended Interview), Beanie Feldstein</title>
      <description>Chance the Rapper tells Stephen how he learned about his family's deep spiritual roots in Ghana, just days before making his first visit there, in this Late Show Pod Show exclusive extended interview. He's also got a new Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream flavor, proceeds from which will go to further the work of Chance’s Chicago-based charity, SocialWorks. But first, Russia’s default on its foreign debt is evidence that global sanctions are squeezing the country’s economy, and texts between the former president’s son and his Chief of Staff Mark Meadows reveal details of a pre-election plot to subvert the will of American voters. Then, Jon Batiste composed a new song for early spring, and the pandemic has been rough on everyone, so Stephen demonstrates how to let off some steam by throwing a couple quarters in the office swear jar. And Beanie Feldstein returns to The Late Show to share her excitement at playing Fanny Brice, a trailblazing entertainer who inspired the Broadway show, “Funny Girl.”

      <title>Shaquille O'Neal, Mayim Bialik | Jon Batiste's Gram Slam</title>
      <description>We couldn’t be more proud of Jon Batiste after his triumph at the GRAMMY Awards, where he performed “FREEDOM” and took home five awards including Album of the Year for “WE ARE.” The GRAMMYs audience also heard from Volodymyr Zelensky who urged musicians to use their voices to support the people of Ukraine. Legendary athlete and broadcaster Shaquille O’Neal returns to The Late Show to tell Stephen how he learned to cook during the pandemic, and why he brings his “no diet” attitude to the recipes in his new cookbook, “Shaq’s Family Style.” Stay tuned to hear Shaq and our host whip up a recipe from the book, a signature dish Shaq calls "Colbert Diesel Brownies!" But first, Mayim Bialik stops by to talk about her latest project, a film called “As They Made Us,” which she wrote and directed as a way to honor her late father, with whom she shared a deep love for music. Catch the film in theaters and on demand this Friday, and see Mayim on television hosting “Jeopardy!” and starring in her own sitcom, “Call Me Kat.”

      <title>Elle Fanning, Ben Schwartz | Tanks But No Tanks</title>
      <description>It can be difficult to trace the owners of Russian superyachts, but authorities continue to find selfies on social media that help link oligarchs to their boats. In congressional news, Stephen is still waiting for an answer from Senator Chuck Grassley about the alleged annual gathering known as Chuck Grassley’s Ass Jamboree. Next, in the latest edition of “Cyborgasm,” Stephen examines a robot that feeds treats to your dog, and takes a cautious look at China’s latest space exploration technology. Elle Fanning makes her first visit to The Late Show for a chat about how she got into character for the very complicated role she plays in the new series, “The Girl From Plainville,” streaming now on Hulu. And former “Late Show with David Letterman” page Ben Schwartz returns to the Ed Sullivan Theater for the first time in decades to tell Stephen about his new film, “Sonic the Hedgehog 2,” which opens in theaters on April 8th.

      <description>Stephen Colbert came to work business as usual on March 12, 2020, until New York City ordered its Broadway theaters to go dark in an effort to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Listen to this relic of late night history when Colbert said "the (Late) Show must go on!" and performed a playful monologue for a baker's dozen of his staff members in the otherwise empty Ed Sullivan Theater. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta also sat down with Stephen for a frank discussion about how Americans should cope and care for each other in the face of the global pandemic.

      <title>Michael Bublé, Rose Matafeo (Extended Cut) | Commander In Speech</title>
      <description>Ukraine’s president addressed the U.S. Congress on Thursday and closed his speech with a direct appeal to President Biden for a no-fly zone and more weapons. In other Russia news, Stephen wonders if he will be the next American sanctioned after the Kremlin announced they will begin sanctioning media figures who are critical of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, fans of big potatoes may be bummed to hear about a ruling from the folks who track world-record size tubers, and Stephen imagines how Parisians might have reacted to watching their iconic Eiffel Tower grow by 20 feet this week. Next, Michael Bublé had the experience of a lifetime when he got to work with Paul McCartney, who produced Michael’s cover of “My Valentine” on his new album, “Higher,” which is available everywhere on March 25th. And in this Pod Show exclusive extended interview, Rose Matafeo finds common ground with Stephen Colbert as the two discuss their bungee jumping experiences in New Zealand. Season two of her show “Starstruck” premieres March 24th on HBO Max.

      <title>Anne Hathaway, Da'Vine Joy Randolph | Putin on the Fritz</title>
      <description>With Russia’s military bogged down in Ukraine, there is hope that the conflict could be over in a matter of weeks, especially if the Russian leader accepts Elon Musk’s challenge. Then, the metawedding trend is taking off across the globe. Next, Anne Hathaway offers Stephen some sound advice on when to order carrot cake (and when it’s safer to skip it). Catch Anne starring in the new AppleTV+ series, “We Crashed,” about the rise and fall of WeWork. And “The Lost City” star Da’Vine Joy Randolph tells Stephen how much she enjoyed working with Sandra Bullock, and confides that she kept a close eye on her neighbor Brad Pitt’s casita as they lived bubble-style in the Dominican Republic while filming.

      <title>Sandra Bullock | Czar Loser</title>
      <description>Evidence is mounting that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is not going as smoothly as he’d planned, with Russian troops undersupplied and looting groceries for food. In Ukraine, the postal service is honoring the brave soldiers of Snake Island with a stamp commemorating their infamous retort to a Russian warship. Meanwhile, there’s a cursed painting available for only $50 on eBay, and a man in Florida did one of the most Florida things imaginable: called the police because his meth wasn’t working. Academy Award winner Sandra Bullock returns to The Late Show with stories from the set of her new film, “The Lost City,” in which she spends a significant amount of time acting in front of a naked Channing Tatum.

      <title>Aidy Bryant, Comedian Alex Edelman | It's Been Two Long</title>
      <description>Two years ago tonight, Stephen Colbert performed his monologue for a nearly-empty Ed Sullivan Theater as New York City began to enter the first phase of the pandemic lockdown. Join Stephen for a not-so-fond look back at the past two years and some of the ways we’ve grown (primarily at the waistband). Next, with so much money flowing into the NFT market, it’s no surprise that it has attracted a new generation of art thieves. And with NFT theft on the rise, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood turned it into a blockbuster heist movie. And Stephen can’t hide his shock when the delightful Aidy Bryant tells him she used to work four-month stints on a cruise ship teaching improv classes to young people. Stick around for more from Aidy Bryant, and check out her new show, “Human Resources,” streaming now on Netflix. Then, Stephen answers audience questions, and nothing is too personal, and no answer too dumb, especially if it involves aliens. And finally, comedian, writer and actor Alex Edelman makes his Late Show stand-up comedy debut and gets the whole theater laughing with true stories about his family.

      <title>Amb. Marie Yovanovitch (Former Ambassador to Ukraine), Martha Stewart Takes The Colbert Questionert</title>
      <description>Putin’s army is failing, in part because Russia’s oligarchs embezzled huge sums of money instead of upgrading gear and stocking fresh food rations. Over in Ukraine, members of the country’s prestigious ballet companies have put their careers on pause to return home and join the fight against Russia’s invaders. Meanwhile, Grimes and Elon Musk have done it again, and if you visit a museum in Denmark you can sit on a toilet shaped like Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich! Next, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, joins Stephen for a two-part interview focused on the latest developments in Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Her book, “Lessons From The Edge,” is available everywhere next Tuesday. And Martha Stewart takes The Colbert Questionert, so we can all finally have an answer to the question: what is Martha's favorite sandwich?

      <title>Amb. Michael McFaul (Former Ambassador to Russia), Denée Benton</title>
      <description>Vladimir Putin’s propaganda machine is trying to turn the letter ‘Z’ into a symbol of domestic support for his war in Ukraine, but his government can’t hide the fact that the world’s economic war against Russia is succeeding, as evidenced by major brands like McDonalds and Coca-Cola pulling out of the country at lightning speed. President Obama’s ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, visits The Late Show to talk to Stephen about the latest developments in Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and offers his analysis of what it would mean for NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. And Denée Benton was born to be on stage, but she spent much of her younger life working to overcome preconceived notions about what a Black girl can achieve in the performing arts. Catch Denée in her latest role, starring as Peggy Scott in, “The Gilded Age,” Mondays on HBO.

      <title>Andy Serkis, Fiona Hill, Special Appearance by Sara Bareilles &amp; Josh Groban</title>
      <description>Amid reports of ill-equipped troops quitting the fight, the Russian military continues to target civilians in Ukraine while the U.S. and other countries move to seize superyachts belonging to Putin’s oligarch cronies. Next, Sara Bareilles &amp; Josh Groban help celebrate a milestone in frozen dairy history, as Stephen Colbert’s signature flavor of Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream "Americone Dream" celebrates 15 delicious years of fudge-covered waffle cone and caramel swirl goodness. Then, one of Stephen’s favorite actors, Andy Serkis, returns to The Late Show with a preview of his new film, “The Batman,” where he plays Alfred alongside Robert Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne. And Fiona Hill advised three American presidents on Russian policy and has spent time in close proximity to Vladimir Putin, so she is uniquely qualified to talk about the man’s strengths, his weak spots, and the things we misunderstand about him.

Then, friend of the show Bob Odenkirk stops by and talks about bidding farewell to his character Saul Goodman after more than a decade portraying the corrupt lawyer in “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul.” Stick around for more from Bob Odenkirk, and check out his new memoir, “Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama,” available everywhere now.

      <title>Jon Oliver Rescues Puppies, Sam Waterston, Sophia Bush</title>
      <description>Getting folks back to the office might not be that easy, as most remote workers report they’d prefer to continue working from home. Elsewhere, Britney Spears fans have a lot to look forward to now that the singer has confirmed her first memoir will be released next year. “Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver helps Stephen Colbert tell some little white lies about these adorable puppies to help them find forever homes. “Law &amp; Order” is returning to NBC and Sam Waterston is resuming his role as attorney Jack McCoy. Listen as he tells Stephen about walking onto the new set for the first time, and shares stories about meeting and working with mega-stars like Katharine Hepburn and Robert Redford.

      <title>John Turturro, John Avlon | Say It Ain't Soviet</title>
      <description>Ukrainians have been quick to push back on the Russian leader’s false claims of cultural ownership of their country, and the 4-time World Cup champion U.S. women’s soccer team won their six year fight to be paid the same as players on the men’s squad. Meanwhile… Stephen’s “Meanwhile” segment for Twosday, 2.22.22, is brought to you by none other than the Number 2! Then, John Turturro returns to the show to tell Stephen about his role as one of the bad guys in the new film, “The Batman,” which opens in theaters on March 4th. And John Avlon, CNN senior political analyst and author of the new book, “Lincoln and the Fight for Peace,” tells Stephen he fears that the Russian leader’s move to take parts of Ukraine amounts to a test case for future land-grabs by other countries.

      <title>Jeffrey Wright, Alex Borstein | My Heart Will Go On TV</title>
      <description>A day after the LA Rams prevailed in the Super Bowl, America woke up to news that Putin may invade Ukraine at any moment, and a bird flu outbreak could impact the poultry industry. Luckily, we can still enjoy a chuckle over Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s soup gaffe. Next, parents face a lot of questions when bringing a baby into this world. Stephen takes a look at those who ask: “what branded content should we tie to our child’s birth?” Jeffrey Wright Previews His Role As Lt. Gordon In The New “Batman” Series.

      <title>Kate &amp; Oliver Hudson | Biden's Got Appoint</title>

      <title>Bradley Cooper Takes The Colbert Questionert, Corey Stoll | The More You Knomicron</title>
      <description>Stephen brings you another edition of “Disinformation Station” in an attempt to debunk some of the latest crazy covid cures, and that pillow guy has employed some very fuzzy math in his latest attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. Meanwhile… A baseball team mascot recently learned a valuable lesson in how to crop photos for social media. Next, if you don’t know his favorite smell, or the most-used app on his phone, do you really know “Nightmare Alley” and “Licorice Pizza” star Bradley Cooper? Then Corey Stoll talks Shakespeare with Stephen, and confesses that he has no interest in joining the 1% despite portraying one of them in “Billions” on Showtime. And every night before the show, Stephen answers a few questions from his live studio audience. This time, he fields hard-hitting inquiries about South Carolina barbecue, what he misses most about his home state, the perfect pizza, his facial hair, and no conversation with Stephen Colbert is complete without a "Lord of The Rings" deep dive.

      <title>Keanu Reeves Takes The Colbert Questionert, Caitríona Balfe | Cor-only A Matter Of Time</title>
      <description>Dr. Fauci predicts that Omicron will infect “just about everybody” in this country, but there are reasons to be hopeful because scientists announced that cannabis may help the body fight off the coronavirus. Next, Stephen gives an update on small business owner Zack Redmon, whose Redmon’s Popcorn shop was temporarily forced to close after the #ColbertSmallBizBump sent scores of hungry customers, and the health department, to his doorstep. Redmon’s is back in business and to celebrate, we got them an expensive billboard in Times Square for the rare Double Bump! Then, if you don’t know his favorite action movie, or what he thinks happens when we die, do you really know Keanu Reeves? Get to know the man behind “The Matrix” in this edition of The Colbert Questionert. And finally, Caitríona Balfe, star of the film “Belfast,” returns to The Late Show to celebrate her SAG Award nomination and to discuss the way the film portrays the human side of the events known as “The Troubles.”

      <title>Gayle King, Tig Notaro | Infection Point</title>
      <description>While America grapples with a massive surge in Omicron cases, scientists in Cyprus are tracking dozens of infections they attribute to a new variant that combines elements of Delta and Omicron. Elsewhere, Rep. Jim Jordan announced he will not cooperate with the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6th insurrection.

Stephen Colbert reviews all the new gear in the latest edition of his forward-looking technology segment, “Cyborgasm.” Gayle King, co-host of ‘CBS Mornings,’ joins us to mark her 10 year anniversary at CBS and to share a sweet home video of the greeting her grandson received when visiting Oprah’s house for the first time. Next, Tig Notaro, who stars in ‘Star Trek: Discovery’ on Paramount+, still hasn’t tried the industrial-sized cotton candy machine Stephen sent her as a gift years ago. Catch Tig’s ‘Hello Again’ comedy tour - dates and ticket information are available at http://www.tignotaro.com.

      <title>Jennifer Lawrence Takes The Colbert Questionert, Ralph Macchio | The Power of Positivity</title>
      <description>Florida’s surgeon general announced the state’s new plan to combat the Omicron wave: stop testing so much. Further north, drivers on Interstate 95 in Virginia were still stuck in their cars on Tuesday evening after a storm left thousands of cars stuck in the snow. Meanwhile… a new study reveals that hamsters are able to hold their liquor better than anyone else in the animal kingdom. Up next, Jennifer Lawrence takes The Colbert Questionert, because if you don’t know her favorite sandwich, or which animal she fears most, do you really know the star of “Don’t Look Up?” And “Cobra Kai” star Ralph Macchio says his show is so popular because the writers and producers have a deep love and respect for the “Karate Kid” movies and those who have been lifelong fans.

      <title>CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Utkarsh Ambudkar | Catch 2022</title>
      <description>Andy Cohen’s tipsy rant about NYC’s mayor must have distracted CNN producers on New Year’s Eve, when several Twitter pranksters managed to get their NSFW usernames displayed on screen. Elsewhere, more details are coming to light about why the former president stayed silent for over three hours as a mob of his supporters ransacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Director of the CDC, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, makes a special visit to the show to talk Omicron, the science behind the CDC’s updated guidance for isolating after a Covid-19 infection, and responds to a recent comment by Dr. Anthony Fauci who suggested Americans may soon be able to test out of isolation after 5 days. And the star of the hit CBS comedy, “Ghosts,” Utkarsh Ambudkar tells Stephen about his role on the show and then treats our host to a freestyle rap about our host’s favorite topic, the “Lord of the Rings” films. Catch Utkarsh every Thursday in “Ghosts” on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.

      <title>Anderson Cooper | House of Horrors</title>
      <description>The insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th came after a half dozen Republican lawmakers developed a blueprint to publicly hammer home the idea that the election was tainted, and plotted to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. Elsewhere, Stephen Colbert performed a special song to cheer up theatergoers who missed their Broadway shows last night due to Covid closures. And our annual Late Show Christmas Cartoon is back! It's Christmas Eve, and Santa is about to certify the Naughty &amp; Nice List in the Klaus of Representatives, when he's interrupted by a "Stop the Sleigh" rally, fueled by the shadowy internet cult "Scrooge-Anon." Will Christmas survive a full-scale tinsel-rection led by Ted Cruz and Marjorie Taylor Greene? Only Santa and Mrs. Claus stand in their un-merry way. Next, CNN's Anderson Cooper takes shots of tequila with Stephen and watches footage of himself drunk on the air while hosting CNN’s “New Years Eve Live” with Andy Cohen. Tune in this year to see what trouble Anderson gets in while hosting the ball drop in Times Square.

      <description>Rep.

      <title>Keanu Reeves | Abuse of PowerPoint</title>
      <description>The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol is turning up the heat on administration officials involved with the insurrection, like former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who handed over a PowerPoint document filled with "extreme plans" to overturn the 2020 election; and It’s the end of an era at Fox News as veteran journalist Chris Wallace announced that he’s leaving to join CNN’s streaming service. Tonight’s “More Show” segment is brought to you by DoorDash’s DashPass, which we just found out does more than food. Then, a couple years ago our drummer Joe Saylor got his own spinoff show, “Jazz Cowboy,” which has become such a big hit on CBS that it’s now getting its own spinoff series, “Jazz Cowboy: Cyber,” featuring Paul Giamatti! And Keanu Reeves returns to the show to talk to Stephen about his new film, “The Matrix Resurrection,” and talks about the journey his character Thomas Anderson has taken over the course of the series. “The Matrix Resurrection” is in theaters and on HBO Max starting December 22nd.

Jennifer Lawrence stops by to talk about her new film, “Don’t Look Up,” crack some jokes about what she did during her time off from Hollywood, and to reminisce with Stephen about their hilarious rum-fueled 2018 interview on The Late Show.

      <title>Peter Jackson Continued | The Most Plunderful Time of The Year</title>
      <description>This Cyber Monday, consider shopping at one of the small businesses profiled on Late Show’s #ColbertSmallBizBump, like Redmon’s Popcorn run by Zack Redmon in New Hope, Minnesota. How good is Zack’s luxury popcorn? Just ask Redmon’s official commercial spokesperson, Nick Offerman. And while 146 new Christmas movies were released this year, 2021 was set to give us zero Hanukkah movies until The Late Show stepped in with a slate of brand new holiday classics with titles like, “Home for the Challah-days,” “Casino Dreidel,” and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Rabbi.” In part two of his conversation with Stephen, Director Peter Jackson examines the mindset of The Beatles as they prepared for a rooftop concert profiled in the new Disney+ documentary, “The Beatles: Get Back,” and sheds light on why the band suppressed the footage for decades. Jackson also mentions a chat between George Harrison and John Lennon that might have changed the direction of the band had they ever shared the details with Paul.

Just ask Redmon’s official commercial spokesperson, Nick Offerman. And while 146 new Christmas movies were released this year, 2021 was set to give us zero Hanukkah movies until The Late Show stepped in with a slate of brand new holiday classics with titles like, “Home for the Challah-days,” “Casino Dreidel,” and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Rabbi.” In part two of his conversation with Stephen, Director Peter Jackson examines the mindset of The Beatles as they prepared for a rooftop concert profiled in the new Disney+ documentary, “The Beatles: Get Back,” and sheds light on why the band suppressed the footage for decades. Jackson also mentions a chat between George Harrison and John Lennon that might have changed the direction of the band had they ever shared the details with Paul.

      <title>Rosamund Pike, Peter Jackson | Thanksgiving: We Meat Again</title>
      <description>Happy Thanksgiving from everyone at The Late Show! Families around the country are planning a return to larger Thanksgiving celebrations as 53 million Americans are hitting the road and traveling this week for the holiday. Meanwhile… New York City’s elected leaders decided they no longer wanted to conduct business in the shadow of a man who enslaved people, so a statue of Thomas Jefferson was packed up and moved to a new location this week. Next, Rosamund Pike, the Oscar-nominated actor you know from "Gone Girl" and "Pride &amp; Prejudice," shows Stephen how she used a pencil to train her British self to speak in an American accent, a lesson that came in handy for her starring role in the new Amazon Prime series "The Wheel Of Time." Then, in part one of their extended interview, Stephen welcomes Sir Peter Jackson and sets the stage for their in-depth discussion of Jackson’s work directing the incredible Disney+ documentary, “The Beatles: Get Back,” which is set to change the public’s perception of the relationship between John, Paul, George and Ringo in their final years as bandmates.

      <title>Andrew Garfield, Chef José Andrés | Hit Me With Your Boost Shot</title>
      <description>In booster shot news, CNN’s Dr. Jonathan Reiner argues that it’s time to move the goalposts on what it takes to be considered “fully vaccinated.” Next, confused about Non-Fungible Tokens? That might be because everyone who tries to define them does a terrible job. Luckily, Stephen Colbert is here to help with an AFT (an Actual F****** Thing) that perfectly explains how NFTs work. Andrew Garfield gets emotional when talking about the recent loss of his mother, and relates her life to the life of Jonathan Larson, the man he portrays in the new film, “Tick, Tick, Boom!” Then, our good friend Chef José Andrés stops by for a holiday cooking segment and gets the party started with a fancy pour of some fancy Spanish sherry.

      <title>Quentin Tarantino, Sexiest Man Alive Reveal | That's A Pricey Meatball!</title>
      <description>Meat prices are soaring as a perfect storm of higher demand and supply chain issues hit America’s beef producers. In Washington, several former White House officials and advisors to the former president were issued subpoenas by the Jan. 6th committee who wants to examine their roles in the attack on the U.S. Capitol. AND AN EXCLUSIVE ANNOUNCEMENT: The Late Show reveals People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive. Up next, legendary director Quentin Tarantino grew up reading novelised versions of classic films, so the art form was already familiar to him when he got inspired to write a novel based on his 2019 film, “Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.”
