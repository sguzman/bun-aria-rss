      <description>There's an old story scientists tell about human ovaries: that they are ticking clocks that only lose eggs, never gain them. Now that story might be changing, opening the door to new treatments for infertility and menopause.

      <title>Lost Worlds: What killed Venus?</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/unexplainable</link>

      <title>The methane hunters</title>
      <link>https://vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>Methane traps more than 80 times as much heat as CO2 over the short term. So we could make a real difference on climate change this decade if we could stop leaking so much methane into the atmosphere. But before researchers and regulators can figure out how to do that, the methane hunters need to find the leaks.

      <title>Are humans running out of sperm?</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/unexplainable</link>

      <title>The quest to build a star</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>Scientists are closer than ever to harnessing fusion power — the same process that powers the sun — by essentially making a small star here on Earth. Fusion could give humanity its best shot at solving the climate crisis, but the technology has yet to be perfected and would require billions more in investments. Is it worth the bet?

      <title>BONUS: The 2021 song</title>
      <link>https://vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>Noam wrote an end-of-year song with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram, so we thought to drop it here as a little end-of-year surprise.

Lyrics:

2021, it was gonna be fun
Get a couple shots and then you’re done
Then the second the year’d begun
We had an insurrection

2021, it was gonna be fun
Get a couple shots and then you’re done
Then the second the year’d begun
We had an insurrection

Yeah it wasn’t just what we hoped to see
We might have started too optimistically
So if we keep our expectations low
Maybe the world won’t seem so terrible

Yeah it wasn’t just what we hoped to see
We might have started too optimistically
So if we keep our expectations low
Maybe the world won’t seem so terrible

Dial back to when the year had begun
We were looking forward to the end of hibernation 
But it didn’t even last a week
No it didn’t even last a week, mm-hmm

On the sixth day of 2021
Vanilla Isis tried to flip the election
But looking back we can’t agree 
On the facts, no, we can’t agree, mm-mm

Pretty soon we were signing up for shots (shots!)
Talking about shots (shots!)
Shots shots shots (shots!)
Everyone was a pharma fan
With the Pfizer fam, the Moderna clan (J&amp;J)

But we should have known Delta would happen 
Most of humanity not getting vaxxed and
Fourth wave — fifth wave, in rhythm
That’s one more wave than feminism!

2021, it was gonna be fun
Get a couple shots and then you’re done
But according to Joe Ro-gun
You should take Ivermectin

Yeah it wasn’t just what we hoped to see
We might have started too optimistically
But if we keep our expectations low
Maybe the world won’t seem so terrible

A booster, I’m not sure I need it. 
Dune on the IMAX, I seen it.
Back to the good life, I dreamed it. (Arrakis)
Wake up, reality, don’t fit.

Hope you don’t need a house or a condo (a condo)
Hope you don’t need a trip to Toronto (Toronto)
Hope you don’t need some gas for your Durango (Durango) 
Hope you don’t need a can of dried mangos (dried mangos)

Everyone is feeling frustration
Quitting jobs — the Great Resignation
Blaming Biden for rising inflation
While billionaires shoot off to space, racing

Did we fix the grid in Texas? (yes)
Figure out how wide the Suez is? (yes)
Don’t ask me
All I see on TV 
It's just fights on Critical Race Theory

2021, it was gonna be fun
Get a couple shots and then you’re done
Moving onto issue number one:
Whether to allow abortions!

Yeah it wasn’t just what we hoped to see
We might have started too optimistically
But if we keep our expectations low
Maybe the world won’t seem so terrible

I just want to be free
Of thinking about Covid-19
I just want to see
Something done about global warming

And I still don’t get NFT’s
Can’t understand crypto currency and
And we can’t agree on anything
But at least we got together to free Britney
(Oh baby baby)

2021, it was gonna be fun
Get a couple shots and then you’re done
Then the second as the year’d begun
We had an insurrection

And people lied about the last election
And made it harder to vote in elections
At least we don’t have another election
Wait, I think there’s another election...

2021, it was gonna be fun
Get a couple shots and then you’re done
Then the second we thought we’d won
We’re learning how to say "Omicron"

Guess you never know what’s gonna come through
Making plans for things you’ll never do 
But take it from a brown guy (and a Jew)
There’s always 2022.

This song was written and performed by Sean Rameswaram and Noam Hassenfeld, produced by Noam, engineered by Efim Shapiro, and features additional vocals from Christina Animashaun.

      <title>The James Webb Time Machine</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>To look into deep space is to look back in time. With the upcoming launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, scientists hope to see “cosmic dawn,” a period long ago when the first starlight transformed the universe. But what happened before cosmic dawn? The Webb can’t tell us, though future telescopes could.

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>After decades of planning, NASA is finally (finally!) set to launch the successor to the Hubble. The new Webb telescope will be a paradigm shift for astronomy, exploring places in the cosmos that have been completely invisible to us until now. But first, it has to safely reach a point nearly a million miles away from the Earth.

      <title>The mysteries of endometriosis</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>This common chronic condition — where tissue similar to what grows inside the uterus grows elsewhere in the body — is barely understood. So why is a condition so prevalent and painful still so unknown? It has a lot to do with who gets to ask research questions.

Correction, August 18: An earlier version of this episode implied that the tissue involved in endometriosis is the same as the endometrium, which lines the uterus. It is similar tissue, but not identical.

      <description>Earlier this year, Nicole Yamase explored the bottom of the Challenger Deep, the deepest place in the ocean, where few people have ever been. The rest of the seafloor is almost as mysterious — 80 percent remains unmapped — but the few glimpses scientists have gotten have completely revolutionized our understanding of the planet.

The rest of the seafloor is almost as mysterious — 80 percent remains unmapped — but the few glimpses scientists have gotten have completely revolutionized our understanding of the planet.

      <title>Henrietta Leavitt and the end of the universe</title>
      <link>https://vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>In the early 1900s, Henrietta Leavitt made one of the most important discoveries in the history of astronomy: a yardstick to measure distances to faraway stars. Using this tool, scientists eventually transformed our understanding of the universe. They realized space was expanding, that this expansion was accelerating, and that ultimately, everything will end.

      <title>The hunt for a new Pluto</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>Something strange is going on at the outer reaches of the solar system. One astronomer thinks it might be a Neptune-sized ninth planet, and he’s on a quest to find it.
That search is happening at an enormous telescope on the summit of Maunakea, a dormant Hawaiian volcano with a long astronomical and cultural history. But many Native Hawaiian scientists are asking: What’s lost in the pursuit of larger and larger telescopes?

      <itunes:summary>Something strange is going on at the outer reaches of the solar system. One astronomer thinks it might be a Neptune-sized ninth planet, and he’s on a quest to find it.
That search is happening at an enormous telescope on the summit of Maunakea, a dormant Hawaiian volcano with a long astronomical and cultural history. But many Native Hawaiian scientists are asking: What’s lost in the pursuit of larger and larger telescopes?

      <description>It’s surprisingly hard to predict how clouds form, move, and change, but it’s essential to try. Because how clouds react to a warming world helps determine how hot our future will be.

      <title>A new force of nature?</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>Last month, physicists at Fermilab in Illinois found that tiny subatomic particles called muons were wobbling strangely. This small observation could transform the future of particle physics, potentially pointing toward undiscovered particles or maybe even a new force of nature.

      <title>Placebos work. Why?</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>For decades, scientists thought that placebos only worked if patients didn’t know they were taking them. Not anymore: You can give patients placebos, tell them they’re on sugar pills, and they still might feel better. No one is sure how this works, but it raises a question: Should doctors embrace placebos in mainstream medicine?

      <title>It’s ball lightning!</title>
      <link>https://vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>For millennia, people have been reporting stories of mysterious spheres of light that glow, crackle, and hover eerily during thunderstorms.

      <title>Journey Toward the Center of the Earth</title>
      <link>https://vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>Sixty years ago, geologists tried to drill down through the Earth’s crust to pull up a piece of the Earth’s mantle. Their mission didn’t go exactly as planned. But it sowed the seeds for a new field of science that’s helped us rewrite not only the history of the planet, but, potentially, our definitions of life itself.

The documentaries featured in this episode are "The First Deep Ocean Drilling: Mohole, Phase 1" and "Project Mohole: Report No. 1."

      <title>No one nose</title>
      <link>http://vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>Believe it or not, scientists still don't know how the sense of smell works. But they're looking at how powerful it is - dogs can actually sniff out cancer and many other diseases - and they're trying to figure out how to reverse engineer it. In fact, one MIT scientist may have built a robot nose ... without completely understanding how his invention works.
