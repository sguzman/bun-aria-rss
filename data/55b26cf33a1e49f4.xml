The core of McKeown's philosophy of "Essentialism" is to identify what is absolutely essential  —  and then work to prioritize that, and eliminate everything else.

His framework is helpful for every important decision  —  in both the professional arena, and the personal. ]]></description>

      <title>The Rise: Sarah Lewis</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Dr. Sarah Elizabeth Lewis is Associate Professor of History of Art and Architecture and of African and African American Studies at Harvard. Early in her career, she became fascinated with what she calls "back-turned paintings"--the paintings which artists keep turned around in their studios, thereby shielding them from view. She realized all of them were necessary steps in the artists' pursuit of mastery.

      <description><![CDATA[Shellye Archambeau knew as a teenager she wanted to grow up and become a CEO. But when Shellye started as an undergraduate at the Wharton School of Business in 1980, there were just two female CEOs of large corporations, and none of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies were Black.
