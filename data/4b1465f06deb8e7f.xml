      <title>573. Quilting Fails</title>
      <description>Happy Halloween! We thought we'd get in the spirit by sharing spooky stories from our sewing rooms. Our staff and listeners are sharing some quilting fails, scary moments, or silly mistakes. We also share results of a poll we did on fabric shopping habits, details of a winter sew-along, the answer to a listener question about crazy quilts, and genius listener sewing hacks.

      <title>572. How to Overcome Outer Judgement</title>
      <description>This episode is Part 2 of 2 in a topic we're excited to explore. On this episode, we'll examine how to overcome outer judgement. (Last episode, we looked at how to deal with your inner critic). Whether comments about your quilts are well-meaning or not, having our quilting feel under attack is very stressful and hurtful. We walk through some strategies for dealing with off-putting comments and moving forward in a positive way. We also share details about Quilts of Honor, our fave tools for hand-embroidery, and a fun binding trend we're seeing.

      <title>557. Quilty Goals Check-In</title>
      <description>We're halfway through the year! Back in January 2022, our staff made quilty goals for the year. We decided to do an update episode--both as a way to keep ourselves accountable, but also as a way to get back on track. So now 6 months later, we're all checking in to share our progress! We also share what a staff member is sewing now, how to tailor your time spent on UFOs to your personal schedule, and the benefits of handwork. Then we answer a listener question about when to adjust your stitch length while sewing.

      <description>Quilters have long been known for their sustainable practices â they save the smallest of scraps, they âmake doâ in their projects, they repurpose clothing or feed sacks, and more. So as green living continues to be more popular and more important than ever, itâs no surprise that many quilters are asking themselves what steps they can take in their sewing lives to make a difference. We share 11 tips for making your sewing space more eco-friendly. We also share ideas for making a quilt for a picky recipient, how to organize longterm projects, and we chat with Jeannie Plant of Richland Sewing Center in Hurst, Texas.

      <description>It's our 550th podcast episode!! We can't believe it. After more than 12 years, we've hit this momentous number. And to celebrate, we asked our listeners to submit quilting questions for us to answer. On this episode, we answer questions related to a variety of topics including choosing fabrics, fixing blocks that aren't the right size, organizing pieces for your blocks, getting a vintage sewing machine up and running, nesting seams, and more.

      <title>524. How Do Quilters Vacation?</title>
      <description>Quilters infuse every aspect of their lives with quilting -- including their vacations. Our staff shares some quilty memories from their recent travels. From bringing handwork on a plane to visiting local quilt shops or even photographing quilts in beautiful locations, there are a lot of ways to keep your hobby close at hand and close at heart, no matter how far away you travel from your sewing room. We also chat with Carole Lyles Shaw, a modern quilter, pattern designer, and teacher. Carole shares snippets of her knowledge from 30+ years of quilting and 20+ years of teaching, including her quilting journey, how she found her quilting community, how she pivoted her business when the pandemic started, and tips for making improv quilts and thinking about your stash in a sustainable way.

Then we chat with Carla Hall, who you know from The Chew, Good Morning America, and The Food Network. She also serves as a board member for 4-H and recently expanded her love of crafting into the quilting world.

      <title>518. Sew Something Special for a Child or Pet</title>
      <description>We hear from many quilters that the reason they started quilting in the first place is because they wanted to make a gift for someone else â and many times that gift comes in the form of a baby quilt or even a small blanket for a special pet. In this show, we share some special considerations to have before making a quilt for a little one or an animal. We also share tips for fixing tension problems on your sewing machine, the ombre fabric trend we love, and what to look for when shopping for a longarm quilting machine.

We also share tips for fixing tension problems on your sewing machine, the ombre fabric trend we love, and what to look for when shopping for a longarm quilting machine.

      <title>509. Fix Blocks that Aren't the Right Size</title>
      <description>With every mistake, there are great learnings. On this show, our staff share some quilting errors that taught them important lessons. And we hope the lessons help others, too! We touch on what to do when your blocks aren't all the right size (bigger? smaller? both? We have solutions!). We also share how to troubleshoot problems with your machine's foot pedal and some great things to know about English paper piecing templates and stitches. And if you're in need of a new project, we give details about a sew-along based on Barbara Brackman's "Encyclopedia of Pieced Quilt Patterns.".

      <title>502. Explore Fabrics Other Than Quilting Cotton</title>
      <description>For many of us, quilting cotton is our go-to when weâre making projects. But there are so many fun types of fabrics in the market, and some of these specialty types of fabric are being made with higher quality and cuter materials than we may have seen in the past. We talk about the different kinds of fabric you may want to consider when sewing your next project, as well as tips for smooth sewing. We also chat with Allison Harris of Cluck Cluck Sew about her design process, choosing fabrics, her Diagonal Seam Tape, and more!

      <itunes:summary>For many of us, quilting cotton is our go-to when weâre making projects. But there are so many fun types of fabrics in the market, and some of these specialty types of fabric are being made with higher quality and cuter materials than we may have seen in the past. We talk about the different kinds of fabric you may want to consider when sewing your next project, as well as tips for smooth sewing. We also chat with Allison Harris of Cluck Cluck Sew about her design process, choosing fabrics, her Diagonal Seam Tape, and more!

We also chat with the amazing Shannon Gillman Orr, the author of the Plan to Quilt organizer.</p><p>For more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here: www.allpeoplequilt.com/magazines-more/quilting-podcast/episode-495-finally-tackle-your-pile-of-ufos</p><p>Email us at APQPodcast@meredith.com.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>492. Tips for Sewing with Pets</title>
      <description>According to a 2020 study, 67% of U.S. households or about 85 million families own a pet. Thatâs a lot of pets! So the odds are that many quilters listening right now are sewing in a space that has an animal. Owning a pet is so rewarding, but we know that our pets can also present some problems in our quilting lives, so we're excited to discuss some tips for sewing with pets! We also chat with the amazing Andra Walker, a prolific sewing, known for making everything from bags to garments to quilts. Youâll love hearing the advice she has to offer.

      <description>As we prepare for what could be a long and possibly lonely winter of being quarantined, we wanted to share some ideas for hosting a virtual quilt retreat. Hopefully it inspires you to connect with your quilting friends in a new way and still get your sewing fix. We also share a project one of our staff members is working on, some basic info on different types of pins, tips for binding (we promise, you havenât heard some of these tips before!), and why you may want to use a Project Tracker for your UFO projects.

      <description>This episode is going to be a little different than usual â no interviews, no chats with our staff about tips and tricks. Today, we want to focus solely on the coronavirus and what we can all do to help each other and keep ourselves safe. Itâs crazy times right now â there are constant updates on the news, new precautions to take, new closures around the city, and many of us are having to change our whole lives and routines to deal with the changes. There's so much fear and uncertainty around the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation. And weâre all trying to deal with it in different ways. On todayâs show, weâll be sharing how to help your local quilt shop and small business owners during this time, how to de-stress and gain back control using sewing, and if youâre one of the lucky parents or grandparents who are watching kids during this extended spring break, we have tips for squeezing in more time to sew when your whole family is under quarantine.

      <link>https://www.allpeoplequilt.com/magazines-more/quilting-podcast/episode-448-handmade-gifts-for-everyone-on-your-list</link>
      <description>It's already December and we're making a list and checking it twice! Has your sewing space turned into Santa's workshop? If you're like us, we love making handmade gifts for everyone on our list, but sometimes it's hard to find the right project they'll love -- and that you can make quickly! We have some gift suggestions that may be just what you're looking for! We share ideas for organizing using basic office supplies -- perfect for any last-minute sewing items you're stashing away before company comes. We'll also be giving fast finish ideas for any holiday quilts or UFOs you're trying to complete before the end of the year. And on Getting Sewcial, we chat with Holly LesuÃ© of Maker Valley, who talks about the evolution of her business and her love of scrappy quilts.

I found Kim Jamieson-Hirst on youtube with her book reviews. She has such a fantastic channel and teaching style. If you want to learn something Kim has most likely done a video for you! She is owner of Chatterbox Quilts and host of The Quilerâs way, an online membership site.Â

Michelle May of âThe Raspberry Rabbitâ creates darling things I want to make. Recently I was stalking herâ¦ I mean following her, and saw her daily embroidery project and had to hear more!. The photo of that follows. is her year long hexie project.

      <title>Guests: Mallory Donohue, Nancy Mahoney, and Jenny Wilding Cardon join Pat for a chat!</title>
      <description>One of the best things about working with Baby lock is meeting the other ambassadors that work in with the machines. Mallory Donohue make a lot of things, specializing in clothing. I first âfound herâ by her wonderful videos on how to use the Sashiko machine. She and her mom Zede run SewHere.com. Which is about teaching sewing for everyone via their website, videos, FaceBook lives, and podcasts. We chat about making clothing that fits as we quilters have amazing fabric we can use for things other than quilts!
----
Who do I turn to for questions on the quilting design program Electric Quilt? My good friend Nancy Mahoney! She has been using the program for years, is and EQ Ambassador, and knows the ins and outs. I wanted to tell you about some of the features you might not know about with Nancy as our guide!
---------
I was so excited to see Jenny Wilding Cardonâs book Visible Mending. The idea of artfully mending items is on the upswing and her book has so many fantastic ways to do this. Things we quilters will love! I first saw visible mending in about 1973 when one of the girls a few grades older than me was doing this to her favorite jeans. The one I remember most was a pocket, with zipper, on the inside thigh of her jeans. She kept her lunch money there.. it was the 70s.. the jeans had elephant bells and she was very on trend! Jenny also works for Martingale as an editor in charge of their online blog, facebook and Instagram account. She is incredible, you are going to love her!

      <title>Guests: Janet Frisch, Nicole Volgelsinger, and Joe McClain join Pat for a chat!</title>
      <description>Iâve love Janet Wecker Frisch of Joy Studioâs work. She creates with an underlying theme of sewing in many of her pieces. I also adore her Halloween things! She shares lots of inspiring photos taken in her amazing studio. And she is now learning to quilt.
-----
I have been following Nicole Volgelsinger of Wild Boho for awhile. Her newest book is Boho embroidery, full amazing ideas for new motifs and how to use them with applique. I love the whole concept!
------
I recently heard about a wonderful organization called Help Heal Veterans. They help our Veterans by using craft therapy. For 45 year their mission has been to provide therapeutic craft kits to every veteran who wants them. I asked the current CEO Joe McClain to join me for the 2nd half of my show to tell us about this organization how how we can help. Joe is retired USN and has held many leadership positions. Including currently on the board of the Association of Creative Industries.

      <title>Guests Mary Koval, Angela Huffman, and Kristina Brinderhoff join Pat for a chat!</title>
      <description>I meet Mary Koval at her booth of antique quilts at one of the shows. Iâve always loved stopping in to see what type of quilts she has found. Mary also has a shop and retreat center in Beford PA. Her fabric lines are based on Antiques, canât wait to hear about the newest!
-----
I meet Angela Huffman of Quilted Joy when we were both doing demos for a long arm company. She was traveling, running her business and raising her triplets. Angela taught me a lot about longarming and working a business your own way. She now has a beautiful shop and you can visit her!
------
I love finding fresh new creative designs by quilt makers. Kristina Brinkerhoff of Center Street Quilts is creating amazing and fun design after design! She has a cool way of using checkerboards in her quilt that is next on my list to do.

I meet Angela Huffman of Quilted Joy when we were both doing demos for a long arm company. She was traveling, running her business and raising her triplets. Angela taught me a lot about longarming and working a business your own way. She now has a beautiful shop and you can visit her!
------
I love finding fresh new creative designs by quilt makers. Kristina Brinkerhoff of Center Street Quilts is creating amazing and fun design after design! She has a cool way of using checkerboards in her quilt that is next on my list to do.

      <title>Guests: American Patchwork &amp; Quilting Editors</title>
      <description>A few times a year the amazing team of American Patchwork &amp; quilting editors take over the podcast to share tips and insights. Like you and me, they are all quilters!

Reader Tips:Editor Lindsay shares reader-submitted tips aboutÂ storage solutions for your sewing spaceÂ -- everything from storing batting to a creative use for a wine rack!

Quilting Changes Everything:Lindsay shares a story originally published in theÂ San Angelo Standard-Times, about a woman grieving for a dying friend and husband and how donating quilts to charity has helped her cope.

Try This At Home:Editor Joanna challenges our listeners to abandon quilt guilt! She shares ideas ofÂ projects perfect for orphan blocks, where to donate unwanted quilts and scraps, and where to find support to finally finish your UFOs.

Editor Interview:Alison Gamm, designer for Quilts &amp; More, shares how she got into quilting, how she explores new colors and fabrics, and the technique she's tackling in 2019!

Trending:Alison talks about the trend of Mindful Sewing to kick off the new year, including getting organized, joining a quilt along, and quilting because you love it -- and not for the Instagram likes!

Products We Love:Designer Elizabeth shares her top product picks this month, which include small (and low-cost) products that will make your quilting life easier!

      <title>Guests Kerry Foster, Babara Cain, and Christopher Thompson join Pat</title>
      <description>Kerry Foster of Penny Dog Patchwork is a self professed serial crafter, I like that! She has been working in the crafting industry sharing her things and when she learned to quilt has done the same. Her newest book is Paint by Number Quilts. This is her signature applique method of creating amazing animal quilts.
---
I love Barbara âBâ Cainâs fresh style of quilt pattern, She is an author and pattern designer. I am super fond of her airplane &amp; blimp!! Also the bee, I see a pattern of flight here! I really love her use of color too. 
-------
One of my favorite things about working in the quilting industry is making new friends through. I had meet Christopher. But it was when we were both at a Baby lock ambassador event that we really had to change to chat. Weâve been friends ever since. He is a fabric designer for Riley Blake and creates amazing projects with his lines.

      <title>Guests: Mona Phelps, Sue Reich, and Jenni Smith join Pat Sloan</title>
      <description>I saw Mona Phelps quilts at the Moda Bakeshop. She creates very doable projects and has great tutorials. When I contacted her it was fun to learn she has only been quilting two years.
------
Many quilters are involved with the Quilts of Valor. By volunteering and making quilts to be given. The organization was started in 2003 by founder Catherine Roberts after her son Nat was deployed in Iraq. Since 2003 they have given 200,000 quilts. Their website has a wonderful history section where you can learn how the organization progressed from her initial idea to what it is today. I have Sue Reich the Board President with me today.
------
Jenni Smith is one of the few designers I had a chance to meet in person first! She was at the Aurifil Booth at one of the trade shows. We chatted and have been friends every since. Jenni is multi talented as she does clothing and quilting. She have a block in our Splendid Sampler 2 book and has been doing wonderful videos of the blocks. Plus she works with Liberty of London fabric, I want you to know all about that too!

      <title>Guests: Barb Cherniwchan, Sue Daley, Michael McCormick, and Pat!</title>
      <description>This whole show is done from the Trade Show in Houston TX. I set up interview and then we try to find a somewhat quiet spot near my guests booth so I don't have to have them go to far. 

I was so glad to catch up with the super creative Barb Cherniwchan of Coach House Designs! She talks us through how she thinks about working with panels. And she has a great new FREE feature at her website to change out colors in designs before you decide what you like! It's called FabSwitch, you will have such fun with it! 
--------
Sometimes it takes a few years until I finally meet a designer I admire, Sue Daley and I had a fabulous chat! She is so talented and had a great array of patterns, fabric and tools.
---------
When I got the first issue of QuiltFolk I knew this was going to be a journal for me. Full of stories and amazing photos of quilt makers. It does not have patterns, but it does have amazing inspiration. Michael McCormick is created this magazine with the goal of telling the stories of quilt makers. He had some time at the show to chat and you'll love hearing the behind the scenes!
----------
Happy 25th Anniversary to American Patchwork &amp; Quilting Magazine! I remember that first issue, the excitement!

At the end of the show today I give you an overview of the trade show, including what's behind me!

      <title>Guests: Donna Desoto, Mary Abreu, and Roseann Kermes</title>
      <description>For my 400th show I want to celebrate doing new things. My friend and author Donna Desoto pushes many of us to do something ânewâ with her challenges. She started with her collaboration book Inspired by the Beatles, she also did the National Parks, and now Inspired by Elvis. I took that challenge, Donna and I will talk about her project &amp; book!
----------
I want to celebrate learning new things with my friend Mary Abreu today. Youâll remember she was my monthly guest one year and we all learned so much from her. She is an author, an amazing seamstress, a teacher and so creative. If you are in the Atlanta area, stop into Intown Quilters to say hello where she is one of the shop managers!
-----------
Roseann Kermes of Rosebud's Cottage has been a frequent guest on the show, if I had a permanent co-host my buddy Roseann would be it!Â  We have known each other forever and I love chatting quilting with her. We do a little 'back in the day' comparison to how quilting has changed and not changed much in the time we've both been making quilts. Then Roseann will help me celebrate my 400th show by asking me some trick questions..haha! Well maybe not trick but she'll interview me!

Sometimes I find my guests in unique ways. I was on vacation chatting with some other guests in a wine bar on a ship.

Of course I had to find out about this and today, I have quilt maker Mary Ellen Parsons here!

Sarah Elizabeth Sharp is a talented quilt maker and author at the website âNoHatsInTheHouseâ. I love reading about her process and thoughts as she shares her projects at her website. Today weâll dive into some paper piecing design, her new book is fabulous!
---------
I love hearing that teachers use quilting in the classroom. Sarah Morris is an 8th grade math teacher in Tennessee and she has a barn quilts project her class is doing that is so good, I had to have her share with us!

I love hearing that teachers use quilting in the classroom. Sarah Morris is an 8th grade math teacher in Tennessee and she has a barn quilts project her class is doing that is so good, I had to have her share with us!

      <description>Arlene Stamper and Melissa Harris are the mother, daughter design team at Quilt Company. If you love applique like I do, then I know you have seen their darling patterns. Have you wondered how they come up with all the amazing project ideas? In this show we gain some insight into how they design and a lot more.

Many of you know about the Wonderful Quilt show in Houston Texas held in late October or early November called Quilt Festival. Quilts Inc also hosts 2 trade show each year and over my 23 years in the industry Iâve meet quite a few of the staff. I wanted to focus on Learning so I invited the super talented Marcia Barker, the Director of Education, to give me a few highlights of what is at Quilt Festival for you to learn from.
-------
Iâm excited to chat again with Karen Miller of Red Bird Quilt Company. Itâs been awhile and Karen has been out teaching and creating some amazing programs I want you to know about. One is about thread education as we both love and do projects with Aurifil. So today youâll learn more about thread weights and what they are for.

      <description>Author and designer Linzee McCray was on the show earlier this year to chat about feedsacks. She wrote the book True Blue Feedsacks which is an awesome book filled with so many great stories and photos. Linzee is continuing her quest for more knowledge about feedsacks and I am excited to hear more about what she is doing.

Being part of the Babylock family, I am so lucky to meet an incredible array of designers in all areas of sewing. From home dec to fashion, Babylock ambassadors are everywhere.

Rebecca Bryan of Bryan House Quilts is a multi talented quilt maker who is all about color! From her website to her patterns and projects, you will first see her great use of color. Rebecca is one of the designers for our Splendid Sampler 2 project and we are going to dive a bit in color and about goals. She had a huge family move to another country and then back again over 18 months and learned a lot about goal setting that can help all of us. She was also the covergirl from American Patchwork &amp; Quilting, August 2016 issue with Star Bright, Star White.

      <title>Guests: Tammy Tutterow, Amanda Niederhauser, and Russell Conte</title>
      <description>If you have been following my Button club projects, you see in year 3 that Tammy Tutterowâs delightful alphabet pattern is one of the features! Tammy is a fantastic designer who focuses on small applique projects she calls âbit sizeâ projects. Ones that can be started and finished in a limited amount of time. She give us an insight into her work and a few tips too!
------
To say Iâm a HUGE fan girl of Amanda Niederhauserâs quilts is an understatement, I might be the life long fan club president at this point. She is not just create with her quilting, but with her writing, her photos and her collaboration work. Amanda is a mom of both people and cats, so for those of you who are cat momsâ you need to follow her Instagram to see all the gorgeous kitty assistant photos. Itâs been awhile since I checked in with Amanda so Iâm thrilled to catch up and hear about her newest projects!
-------
Russell Conte of Sewp box is leading a fully creative life. I meet Russell at the Babylock Sewing Machine Ambassador event. We had a chance for a chat before our group went to the Opera and I loved getting to know him. Besides being a shop owner for 20 years, he created a massive teaching culture for the shop and now teaches full time as part of the faculty in the Fashion Department at Los Angeles Trade Technical College. Russell has a passion for teaching and we are going to talk about this and how you can teach others. He has great tips. Also I love his motto is â"Needle, thread, machines, leather, material...and a voice from my Sewp Box for passion and creativity". You are going to love Russell.. oh my the way.. he makes shoes too.. seriously.. leather shoes...

      <title>Guests: Carolyn Forster, Jo Avery, and Gail Pan </title>
      <description>Carolyn Forster is an author and I like to think of her as the ultimate teacher. Her book are so full of information and techniques. If you are lucky enough to be able to take a workshop with her, you must! Her newest book is The Handmade Quilt, a skill building sampler. Iâm all about samplers and skill building, looking forward to a few tips today, I see curves!
----------
Jo Avery is the very talented designer at myBearpaw. Which is a fabric, yarn and haberdashery store in central Edinburgh Scotland. Iâve followed Joâs work for years, we invited her to our Splendid Sampler 2 design team and I finally was able to schedule a time we could talk!
----------
I meet Gail Pan years ago at the tradeshow when my friend was helping me at the show. She followed Gailâs work and took me over to introduce us, weâve been friends every since! She is an incredible embroidery designer, fabric designer, and author. She is also created a block for our Splendid Sampler 1 book! We are talking stitching and fabric today, because Gail is the expert!

      <title>Guests: Lynn Miller and Lori Kennedy </title>
      <description>I love antique quilts and reading about the people who made them. Itâs a joy to open Lynn Millerâs website Vintage and Antique to read the stories she has written about quilt makers from the past. Lynn often writes a series of articles so itâs very fun to dive deep into the background behind either the maker or sometimes the collectors.
==========
Iâve been lucky to get to know Lori Kennedy of The Inbox Jaunt (she was our July 18 Splendid Sampler Designer) and today we are going to dive deep into tips &amp; tricks she has for machine quilting. Her new book is fabulous, you must get it! Also we are going to talk about learning to quilt as all five (yes 5!) of Loriâs adjust daughters are learning right now.

      <title>Guests: Jen de Jong, Melanie Call, HollyAnne Knight, and a chat with Pat</title>
      <description>In my online quilt community at Facebook there are so many amazing quilts being made everyone during my sew alongs. Many of you will even share a personal story to go with my story about the sew along blocks. Jen de Jong made my Grandmaâs Kitchen and she didnât just do one, she did many and then she involved her whole family during the process. I loved the joy she brought to her family and to my community. Iâm thrilled to chat with Jen about making her memory quilts from my project.
-------------
I have have followed Melanie Callâs at her website A Bit of Scrap Stuff for awhile now. I love how she combines fabrics and how she takes parts of sew alongs for super fun variations. Itâs great to see how quilting can be changed up!
-------
HollyAnne Knight of String and Story is a quilt teacher with her training videos and articles and also started a charity called Quilts for Cure to raise awareness about childhood cancers. I asked her if she would talk about her charity organization as so many quilters do charity work.
-------------------
I tell you the back story to The Splendid Sampler 2 sew along!

      <title>Guests: Marla Varner, Lindsey Neill, Cindy Needham, and Richy Lainson </title>
      <description>Marla Varner of Penny Lane Quilts creates exciting quilts in modern improvisational style. But she didnât start that way. Marla began with traditional quilts and Iâm excited to hear about her journey to a different style of making.
================
I first saw Lindsey Neillâs Pen and Paper quilts when there were a lot of adorable snail blocks showing up in my instagram feed. Lindsey creates whimsical modern and minimalist quilts. Letâs hear how she comes up with her creations and what might be around the corner for us
================
Cindy Needham tag line on her about page is âQuilting Changed My Lifeâ, I feel the same way. She is an avid quilter that, like me, quit her day job to create a business. She travels to teach and has a class on Craftsy. Iâm very interested in her work on linen, how cool is that?
================
Richy Lainson has a fabulous sense of color. He combines things and everyone goes, why didn't i think of that!Â  He has a new role designing projects for the BasicGrey company to showcase their fabric and he is on our Splendid Sampler design team!

      <title>Guests: Susan Knapp, Shannon Brinkley, and Krista Hennebury</title>
      <description>I love the projects from Susan Knapp of the Quilt Branch, they are fun and doable. You may know her from signature project âSix Halves Make a Whole, where each project starts from 6 half-yard cuts of fabricâ. We are going to get some great tips about embracing unique shapes and getting used to a specialty rulers.
-------------
I love how Shannon Brinkley uses scraps to applique. Use applies this approach to very fresh designs and has a whole book of projects with it. Shannon shares tips making scrappy applique work and will tell us about her first fabric line with Andover called Mosaic.. which seems like a fitting name! 

Shannon has some fantastic tips for doing the pointy edges with satin stitch on her projects, well worth listening!
-------------
Teacher, author and amazing quilt maker, Krista Hennebury joins me again so we can talk about taking quilting on the road! She has attended big and small shows across the world, plus taught.. it's fun to hear about her travels. And Krista is one of the designers of our Splendid Sampler II project!

      <title>Guests: Ashley Nickels,Â Karen Overton, andÂ Linzee McCray</title>
      <description>Iâm so intrigued by Ashley Nickels quilts, they have this unique painting on them and then she adds a wonderful layer of quilting. When I see pieces like this my curiosity has me typing an invite to the maker to come on the show and tell me about their work. And I'm super excited that she is also a writer and has a love of the story.
===========
Karen Overton is a long time maker writing about her work at The Quilt Rambler. She loves to teach and has a great tips for us today about how to think about our quilting while we are doing the patchwork.Â 
=============
Linzee McCray is back to talk feedsacks. Her newest book is full of so much history.
I asked Linzee if she could do an deep dive into feedsacks and then tell me how her first fabric line 'Feed Sacks: True Blue' for Moda came about!

      <title>Guests: Kathy Shaw, Heidi Parkes, Leslie Jenison, and Lissa Alexander</title>
      <description>Iâm always attracted to beautiful embroidery work. When I saw Kathy Shawâs books and her work I had to learn more! If you were curious about crazy quilts and stitches, youâll love this chat!
------------
Heidi Parkes tagline is âArtist - Quilts - Mending â and I am intrigued by that. Quilts and Mending on the same line? Heidi will change your mind on what that means.
----------------
Leslie Jenison and I have been friends a long time, it might have started when we both did a âuse this Nancy Drew Fabricâ challenge! She is an award winner quilter, fabric designer, and extremely amazing quiltmaker. Leslie and I chatted about how to stay healthy so we can quilt a very long time.
------------------
Lissa Alexander's newest book is all about scraps and it's fantastic! She is also the director of Marketing for Moda Fabrics, which means she is the organizer of getting all the amazing things about Moda out for us to learn. I've worked with Lissa since the first year I went into business. I'm also lucky enough to have gotten a bit of time to have her tell us about the new Color Cuts that Moda is doing!

      <description>Erin Dollar of Cotton Flax is a surface pattern designer who does her own print making and has her designs on Robert Kaufman fabrics for us to enjoy. I love hearing how people bring their art to fabric for quilters. Erinâs super talented and you are going to enjoy meeting her.
------------
Karen Neary is a designer, author, and has had her quilts exhibited in shows across the world. She loves to take complicated patchwork and simplify them.

      <title>Guests: Krista Moser, Janella McKay, Jen Daly, and Jennifer Nevitt</title>
      <description>I may have first seen Krista Moserâs work when I spotted her Hollow Star pattern, which is super clever. That lead me to her tutorials which are so complete youâll feel like you are in class with her! Iâm really excited to learn more about using 60-degree angles, these are Kristaâs specialty
----
Iâve admired Janelle McKayâs bags for a long time and Iâm excited to chat bag making with her todayâ¦ and did you know she is also a quilter? We learn how to take our quilting fabrics to the next level in her amazing bag patterns. 
-----
Jen Daly is a regular contributor to American Patchworkâs family of magazine and the Moda Bakeshop. You might have even made one of her fun and clever projects. Jenâs designs look fantastic in both traditional and fun fabrics, so I want to learn how she does it!
----
Jennifer Nevitt of MommySew is a fearless quilter taking on curves, tiny pieces and color combos that make you want to rush out to sew up her projects. Her quilt in the Dec 2017 issue of American Patchwork &amp; quilting caught my eye, so it was time to chat!

      <title>Guests: Shelley Cavanna, Stacy lest Hsu, and Wendy Butler Berns</title>
      <description>You will recognize Shelley Cavannaâs quilts from her signature patterns she designs for her company Cora Quilts. She also has a new fabric line with Benartex. Weâll get a tips from Shelley on how she creates her beautiful color combinations.
----------
Moda fabric designer Stacy Iest Hsu creates darling fabrics that also have stuffed dolls panels. I might be guilty of hoarding these fabrics because the prints are so usable in quilts! Some have themed images.. like dogs &amp; cats, little girls in red capes and buck-a-roo boys, they fantastic! Today Stacy is going to share about her latest kitty &amp; puppy pouches &amp; some tips for stuffing items.Â  I included 2 videos she did that will really help you!
--------------
Many of you know Wendy Butler Berns from her online classes that teach you how to create landscape quilts and more. Wendy has been teaching quilting for many years, but she is also an award winning quiltmaker and has a rich history that I want to know more about! As always, there is more to each maker than just their latest project.

      <description>Iâve been a huge fan of Malka Dubrawskyâs work for years. I love her hand dyed fabric, her quilt shop fabrics and her process for creating. Malka always has the most interesting articles . Itâs time we caught up again!

Designer and Author Carl Hentsch of 3 Dog Design creates exciting quilts. With circles, and flying geese and angles that capture your attention. He has has a keen interest in Amish quilts. Weâll learn some of his thoughts on color and process to create his quilt designs.
--------------
Itâs been awhile since my friend the very talented designer of quilts &amp; fabric and author Sherri McConnell was here to visit. We had booths near each other at the trade show in October where we had some time to catch up on life. And her awesome husband was there too so my shipping department &amp; hers had a chance to meet. Sherri is not only talented but prolific so I hope to get some of her âSew-Joâ today!
----------------
Jo Morton is back to talk about her Little Favorites books, Joâs Floral Album, her newest fabric and she has a few tips for us on using the back basting technique for applique!

      <title>Guests: Debbie Busby, Elisabeth Hardey, Shayla Wolf, and Pam Damour</title>
      <description>Designer and Author Debbie Busby of Wooden Spool designs is back to chat with me. We are going to talk about her new book âSew Many Notionsâ and dispel a few common fears quilters have about diving into working with wool.
---------
Fussy cutting fabric is contagious. Iâve followed posts from Elisabeth Hardey, the event manager in the marketing dept at Robert Kaufman, for awhile. Then when she and her friend Nichole Ramirez wrote âThe Fussy Cut Samplerâ I was thrilled to see all their tricks &amp; tips documented in a great book. You might have even done a sew along for their book!
-----------
I know youâve seen the amazing block of the month designs from Sassafras Lane. They also create loads of other designs and I have Shayla Wolf, who is half of the Mother/Daughter team of Shayla Wolf and Kristy Wolf here to give me some pointers on creating their foundation designs.
------------
Pam Damour of the Decorating Diva has so many great projects and tutorials. She is an author and fellow Baby Lock ambassador. Itâs always fun to learn how to use our fabric for projects that are not quilts. I asked Pam to share some ideas and tricks today with us!

      <title>Guests: Shannon Orr, Sylvia Schaefer, and Bev McCullough</title>
      <description>Artist, Author, teacher, designer of pretty fabrics &amp; wonderful quilts, Shannon Orr also loves to plan! Planning what she will make is such a passion for her she created an amazing âPlan to Quiltâ journal! She is going to share her top planning tips with us today, I canât wait!
-----------
Award winning Quilt designer Sylvia Schaefer has a modern style with a little bit of science put in the mix. I was thrilled that this year when I was asked to Judge the Craftsy Quilt Designer Fellowship, Sylvia was the one selected. Iâm really interested in how she designs and where she is heading with her business.!
-------------
If you have EVERY thought a project on Pinterest was darling, and saved it, and maybe even MADE itâ¦ I can almost promise you that one of them was designed by Bev McCullough of Flamingo Toes! Iâm personally a huge fan-girl, and have saved a bunch of her things to make. That map is first up, then the Flamingo.. thenâ¦. Iâm excited to chat for the 2nd half of my show with Bev about all things making and hear about her new fabric lines!

      <title>Guests: Deb Tucker, Amy Ellis, Heidi Kaisand, and Janine Vangool</title>
      <description>I canât wait to chat with Deb Tucker! She has been creating and teaching quiltmaking for 30+ years and her specialty is piecing efficiency. From patterns to tools to demos Deb can help us get it right easily!
------------
Author, Moda fabric designer and curator of fun project, my friend Amy Ellis always has something going on! We are going to chat about some of her collaborations including her new modern quilt publications that are very unique!
------------
I love when Heidi Kaisand of Hen &amp; Chicks Studio joins me! Heidi and I have worked together for many years and we have shared a lot of creative ideas. What I love about her and what she does in her shop, is that she explores ways to be creative that are not just making quilts. We are going to share a few top ways to be creative that are similar, but different to quilt making.
------------
I have long admired the work of Janine Vangool, who is the publisher, editor and designer of UPPERCASE, which a quarterly print magazine for âthe creative and curiousâ. I love that tag line! Her publications are inspired by design, typography, illustration and craft. Her magazine and books celebrate the process of making, the commitment to craft and the art of living creatively, my kind of gal! She is also a fabric designer for Windham and today we are going to talk about her creative process.

      <description>I learned how to sew by making clothing. In reality I made clothing badly but I still kept making them, even wore some. I wish Iâd had a âJoi Mahonâ to teach me. Joi is an author, teacher, owns the Sewing Factory in Sioux City, Iowa, is a fellow Baby lock ambassador and clothing pattern designer. She also has a rich family history of sewing which includes quilts. Canât wait for you to meet her and maybe Iâll even try sewing clothing again!

      <title>12-4-17 Mary (Marney) Hertel, Kathleen Berlew,Â Kristin Esser,Â andÂ Lesley ChaissonÂ Chat with Pat on Pat Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Marney Hertel writes at Made by Marney where she shares her darling paper pieced designs! 
-------------
Kathleen Berlew is a designer that writes at kbbcrafts and her work is showcased in many of the Quilts &amp; More issues, like her heart pillow in the summer 2017 issue &amp; the awesome ocean scene the Winter 2018 issue of the magazine.  She works in felt and Iâm excited to chat with her about how we can use felt!
----------
I love Kristin Esserâs book with her co-author Minki Kim called âSew Illustratedâ. Youâll also recognize her cover quilt from the Summer 2017 Quilts &amp; more .. how many of you have pulled fabric to make it (I raise my hand!) Kristin has some great tips for getting that gradation of color from your stash.
-------------
Lesley Chaisson of Berry Bird is an author, designer, regular contributor to American Patchwork &amp; Quilting family of magazines and an all around maker of things! I love her fun sense of humor with her work, as youâll recognize her fun pincushions like the Donuts &amp; Hamburger. She has some great tips for us!

I love Kristin Esserâs book with her co-author Minki Kim called âSew Illustratedâ. Youâll also recognize her cover quilt from the Summer 2017 Quilts &amp; more .. how many of you have pulled fabric to make it (I raise my hand!) Kristin has some great tips for getting that gradation of color from your stash.

Youâll recognize her quilts from the magazine pages, including the cover! We are going to chat about applique and how her years of living in Alaska formed her color sense.

------------------
With a website named Quilted Blooms I knew Iâd love Paige Alexanderâs quilts. She works in a modern style with a base in the blocks and shapes we all know and love. She loves a challenge and shares many of her processes to work on one, which will teach you a lot about how to think and design as you go.

Lindsay Conner is a super creative gal and fellow Baby lock ambassador. We had a chance to work together this year at the industry event Baby Lock holds for itâs ambassadors called âCommon Threadsâ. She was helping me to learning embroidery machine techniques, we had a fun time! Today Iâm excited to hear about her NICU smocks charity sew along and she is going to tell me about some of the babylock machines!

I love the writing, sharing and inspiration at Debbie Jeskeâs site A Quilterâs Table. She is a long time quilter, and now works in a improvisational manner. She hosts lots of sew alongs, shares her work as she goes and I love her thoughts on how we feel about our work. She keeps it real and youâll want to start following her!

My love of folk art drew me to Rebekah Smithâs work. For quilters and stitchers, she works with wool and linen. She also is a painter and has a rich history of working in folk art. We are going to talk about about how she takes her style to wool and linen and she has lots of great information on both for us.

My good friend Linda Pumphrey has a new book out on Red and White quilts. When Linda writes a book she always brings history and meaning into it. And itâs always a project book as Linda is a quilt maker! Linda has a few great tips for red/white making today, as you know itâs my favorite!

Proceeds of the Red &amp; White go to the Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum.

Kristyne does amazing projects, she did one for our Splendid Sampler book with gorgeous stitching. Her fabrics are super happy and weâll learn how she designed them. Plus a great tip from her today!

Iâm excited today to have a chance to chat with Christopher Thompson about his quilting. He writes at The Tattooed Quilter and have super fun style, with lots of mini quilts. We had a chance to get to know each other being Baby lock ambassadors so that is very fun for me. Being modern in aesthetic and quilt making, Christopher also loves vintage and I want to find out a bit more about how he blends that.

--------------------
I first meet Emily Breclaw of the Caffeinated Quilter when I showcased her quilt in the Official Downton Abbey Sews magazine.  She has been designing for years now and her new book âAdventures in Hexagonsâ is full of very unique and clever designs. I am so fascinated by her process of looking at shapes to create very unique quilts that you can make too.

Janet Clare, Moda Designer and extraordinary stitcher chatted with me in person at the trade show. It was great to catch up and now YOU can visit her studio when you go to the UK! She tells us how.

We had a chance to get to know each other being Baby lock ambassadors so that is very fun for me. Being modern in aesthetic and quilt making, Christopher also loves vintage and I want to find out a bit more about how he blends that.

I first meet Emily Breclaw of the Caffeinated Quilter when I showcased her quilt in the Official Downton Abbey Sews magazine.  She has been designing for years now and her new book âAdventures in Hexagonsâ is full of very unique and clever designs. I am so fascinated by her process of looking at shapes to create very unique quilts that you can make too.

Janet Clare, Moda Designer and extraordinary stitcher chatted with me in person at the trade show. It was great to catch up and now YOU can visit her studio when you go to the UK! She tells us how.

      <title>8-7-17 Matt Reese, Evy Hawkins, Jane Sassaman &amp; Anita Bradshaw Chat with Pat on Pat Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Matt Reese is the new owner of the wonderful quilt show Road 2 California. I want you to meet Matt, some of you already know him from his years of working the show with his grandmother. And my curiosity was about bringing in all the show quilts to hang for the show. What is the process? How do they track it? Matt is going to tell us how they do it at R2C!

=============
If you have not meet Evy Hawkins yet of âA Bit of Stitchâ you are going to love her! She is super creative and does a lot of different projects. Today weâll talk quite a bit about the Sashiko machine by Babylock. Evy has been using it for very fun techniques, things you might not have thought of.

==============
Jane Sassaman is an art quilter and fabric designer. Her exuberant quilts and fabric designs have attracted worldwide recognition. As an art quilter, Janeâs designs are always recognizable for their bold color and graphic style. In fact, her quilt ,âWillowâ, was named as one of the one hundred best American quilts of the 20th century. For sixteen years she has also translated her unique vision into exciting designs for FreeSpirit, a company producing fabrics for quilters. Like her appliquÃ© quilts, Janeâs fabrics are nature inspired, large scaled and colorfully enthusiastic!

==========
I love finding designers doing projects that are fresh and different with techniques that may have been around for years. Anita Bradshaw does fun things with her âno-biasâ stained glass that are super creative! I am pretty excited to learn more about her and the style of quilts she likes to make.

      <title>7-17-17 Sue Marsh, Deborah Fisher, Annette Plog, and Mathew Boudreaux  Chat with Pat on Pat Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>You know you are going to find fun and whimsy when you learn a designer started her business on April fools day! Sue Marsh of Whistle Creek Pig Production is just that! As a fabric designer, author and creator of darling designs, she knows how to put a smile on your face when making her projects!
Whistlepig Creek Productions
------------------
Artist and author Deborah Fisherâs book âQuilt Givingâ caught my eye. Quilters love to make for others and one of our greatest joys is giving a quilt. Debroah designed 19 quilts that let us make projects that are not super time consuming and are wonderful to look at. Many are a more modern flair and you can use your scraps, prints, and solids to create warm and cozy presents. She is also the founder of the Bright Hopes Collaborative Quilt Project and Iâm excited to learn about why she created it. Â

Annette Plog is the Author of True Blue Quilts and loves reproducing antique quilts. She is part of a group of friends who call themselves the 19th Century Patchwork Divas group. Iâm excited to talk reproduction quilts and the love and blue with Annette today!

I love creative people who jump in and do something new and fresh with things that have been around awhile. Add to that mix enthusiasm, endless energy, and a huge smile and you have Mathew Boudreaux, better known as Mr. Domestic. Since Iâve known Mathew I think I look at things a little differently. He has always been creative and we are lucky he now is hooked on quilting. Iâm going to find out a bit about fabric weaving and English Paper Piecing today.. see.. lots of ideas!

      <title>7-10-17 Dora Cary, Deb Grogan, and Jacquelynne Steves Chat with Pat on Pat Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Itâs always fun for me to be able to talk with future guest at a show where they have all their quilts for me to see.. well maybe not all but a group! I had seen Dora Cary of Orange Dot Quilts booth and knew I had to meet. I didnât the first time, but after inviting her to the show, we had a chance to talk this past May at an event. I love all her work, itâs fresh, inspiring and something Iâd like to make. She is from Romania, now a US Citizen, and had no knowledge of quilts, I think you will enjoy meeting her and her fun and different journey into making quilts!

http://www.orangedotquilts.com/
----------
Deb Grogan of the Quilt Factory is a very talented designer. With years of designing for other industries, she changed it up and moved into designing for quilter and we are lucky she did! I adore her whimsical style and very can do projects. Need a baby quilt? Deb has so many options youâll be making her patterns for years to come!

https://www.thequiltfactory.com/
---------------------------
UnFinished Object â¦ better known to a quilter as a UFO. A project we got stuck on, got tired of, got filed and we forgot about it (yesâ¦ it happens!) â¦ maybe even a project we no longer love like we used to. My buddy Jacquelynne Steves is back to chat UFO busting with me! PLUS she has a crazy great deal for my quilters, thatâs you! If you want in one of the few kits for her FREE Block of the month, which by the way are awesome, use her exclusive to ME Coupon code PAT2017 Good through July 18, 2017 for $6 off kit

      <title>6-26-17 Alex Anderson, Jenny Lister Chat with Pat on Pat Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>The first time I saw Alex Anderson was in my living room on my television for her HGTV show "Simply Quilts". Alex tells us how she really got that job, and how she moved from there into the first internet tv show at The Quilt Show.  This is recorded live and I don't do any touch ups, so you find out we lost the connection but got her back!

Chat with Pat ... I want to start a list of the Quilt Museums!
So please leave me a comment giving me your favorite, or ones you know of, or even ones you WANT to visit!

Moda fabrics has a new partnership with the Victoria &amp; Albert museum to reproduce the designs of fabrics in the collection for quilters. They are starting with a collection by the famous William Morris. I was delighted to spend time talking with curator Jenny Lister about why William Morris is important and seems perfect as the first collection.

      <description>Erin Schlosser found her calling as a teacher early on, and mixed with design background.. we are the lucky winners of her talent!

We talk about home sewing, fabric content, and that trying something you think is 'hard' might not really be hard at all!
http://www.schlosserdesigns.com/

Have you wondered what the difference is between types of quilt shows? Local guilds, Regional or National shows? Linda and I tell you what goes on at all of these types of shows and why they are all great to experience!  Plus you can meet Linda and take a workshop from her in Grand Rapids in August!
http://lindathielfoldtthequiltedgoose.blogspot.com/
--------------------
My friend Kim Niedzwiecki from GoGoKim has been fussy cutting fabrics for projects for a long time. We take the 2nd half of the show to talk about that process, I tell you about my biggest Fail at it (oi!) and she explains how starch IS your friend.

Many of you have seen Koala Studios at your favorite quilt shows. You may even have them in our sewing studio or you are dreaming of them. Iâm very excited to talk to Ed Moore who is the founder of Koala Studios. He shared with me how this beautiful furniture is made and a little about the company. Can you guess why it's named Koala?

Suzi Parron, in cooperation with Donna Sue Groves, documented the massive public art project known as the barn quilt trail in her 2012 book Barn Quilts and the American Quilt Trail Movement.In Following the Barn Quilt Trail, Parron brings readers along as she, her husband Glen &amp; their dog Gracie, follow the barn quilt trail through thirty states across thirteen thousand miles as Suzi collects the stories behind the brightly painted squares. This book has stories &amp; beautiful color photographs. The blocks are more than just something to hang up, I love a great story!

If you have been quilting for awhile, you will recognize the brand name Thimbleberries and the designer behind that is Lynette Jensen. She was one of the first pattern designers to partner with a fabric company to build a distinctive look. When I first started quilting it was one of the first names I got to know.  Lynette shows us how to use our quilts as part of our lifestyle, to incorporate them into our homes in all sorts of ways.

Iâm delighted that Linda Thielfoldt is my quilt expert joining me in 2017. She is an award winning quilter, a teacher, designer, author and she quilts for hire too. With Lindaâs deep technical knowledge of the quilt making process we are picking a topic each month and digging deep on it. This month weâll talk about a group charity project Linda did with some friends and how you can do the same. FULL of great tips on running a charity project.

      <title>3-20-17 Sallie McCauley, Gwen Goepel, Kitty Wilkin, and Kimberly Einmo! on Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>When I learned about the âLoveâ quilt that the Floyd Quilt Guild, of Floyd VA, created I had to know more. The VA tourism board has used âLoveâ many ways over the years from VA is for lovers to the new âLOVEâ with a heart logo. Many of the rest stops have giant letters in front. Being that I live in VA this makes it even more special to see this amazing quilt and hear it's story. Sallie McCauley and Gwen Goepel were the organizers of having the quilt made, I love hearing the story!
floydquiltguild.com
---------------
Iâm a big fan of Kitty Wilkinâs work. She writes at Night Quilter about her own patterns, but also about quilt making she encounters along the way. She shares tutorials and this year is doing a âYear of Stitchesâ.. which is hand embroidery. I really love the idea of a âyear ofâ something and canât wait to learn more!
https://nightquilter.com/
===============
It is always great to have Kimberly Einmo on my show! She is such a talented designer and is full of great ways to do thing. We are going to talk about her latest book and how to achieve spectacular quilts without a lot of work!  Then I asked Kimberly is she would talk about having quilts judged in a show. She is a quilt show judge and I'm personally fascinated by the judging process.. I have entered quilts years ago, and Iâm thinking of doing that again. Because people donât see my work in person if I donât take the time to enter them.  You will love this episode!

      <title>3-6-17 Julie Neu, Robin Pickens, Linda Thielfoldt, and myself for a Q&amp;A on Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>I love when I get a note about a quilt project that is unique. Julie Brown Neu collaborated with her sister Karen H. Brown on a childrenâs book. Julie did the illustrations which are quilts! I love collaborations and the story behind them. Julie is also a talented quilt maker that brings her love of detail into her other work. Weâll hear how the book came about and she has some great tips for us on using Y Seams.

We are so lucky in the quilting world when great designers do quilting fabric collections. Robin Pickens is a Moda designer, and you will find her art of many different products. I had so much fun chatting with her at the show and today she is going to give us a look at how she works with designs and colors.

This month weâll give you all the tips and tricks for getting your quilt ready to quilt.

      <itunes:summary>I love when I get a note about a quilt project that is unique. Julie Brown Neu collaborated with her sister Karen H. Brown on a childrenâs book. Julie did the illustrations which are quilts! I love collaborations and the story behind them. Julie is also a talented quilt maker that brings her love of detail into her other work. Weâll hear how the book came about and she has some great tips for us on using Y Seams.

We are so lucky in the quilting world when great designers do quilting fabric collections. Robin Pickens is a Moda designer, and you will find her art of many different products. I had so much fun chatting with her at the show and today she is going to give us a look at how she works with designs and colors.

      <title>2-20-17 Felicia T. Brenoe, Kat Tucker, Brenda Ratliff, and Heather Valentine on Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Felicia Brenoe is a talented quiltmaker and designer. From teeny tiny log cabin blocks to appliqueing a garden she has designed it all. I really love her philosophy on honoring your personal style. We chat about her book, how living in Norway introduced her to textiles and a tip on how to handle tiny paper piecing!
http://www.feliciasworld.com/
--------------
I truly love the internet. How else would I have found about about the quilt designed to celebrate Canadaâs 150th anniversary by Kat Tucker of Next Step Quilt Designs? She designed 150 blocks and each is inspired by the story of an Canadian born woman who made a difference.
nextstepquiltdesigns.blogspot.ca/, 
------------------
Brenda Ratliff is the dynamic owner of Pink Castle Fabric, organizer of Camp StitchAlot &amp; SewPro and a fabric designer with RJR. I am excited to be working with Brenda as part of the 2017 Aurifil Design team and today we talk about retreats. What they are, how to attend a retreat if you have never done that before, and what to do to have the most enjoyable experience
http://stitchalot.com/
----------
Heather Valentine from the Sewing Loft always has loads of fun things at her website. From themed topics to teaching you how to use the embroidery unit on your Baby lock, itâs a great site for information. Heather and I were talking the other day and she mentioned her grandmother had worked for the Coats family, as in Coats &amp; Clark threadâ¦ how neat is that! She tells us all about that and how it inspired her to sew and create her Sewing loft company.

      <title>2-13-17 Sue Pfau, Marilyn Foreman, Jacquie Gering, and myself for a Q&amp;A on Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>I love discovering how clever and resourceful designers are. Sue Pfau of Sweet Jane Quilting has a book with 12 project sure to make you swoon over precuts! And Her story about how you landed on this is great! Anyone can be successful with a little formula in their pocket.
https://www.instagram.com/sweetjanequilts/
==============
Iâm so happy to chat with Jacquie Gering again! If I can point to one person that has influenced how I think about machine quilting in the last couple of years, it is Jacquieâs walking foot quilting. She has showed you in her craftsy classes and now she has a beautiful and information packed teaching book called âWalkâ. We are going to get a peek at how she thinks about using the walking foot to quilt.. hint.. not in the ditch!
www.jacquiegering.com/ 
===============
I know a LOT of you own a Twister ruler, today I have one of the company owners, Marilyn Foreman, here to talk to me about how she used the ruler then bought the business! Plus she has some tips for you on them.
www.twistersistersdesigns.com/
=============
Q&amp;A with Pat -I want to share about the Moda All Star book projects, the new Moda Challenge and a Q&amp;A Where I have some really interesting questions to answer.. like 'I can't seem to find my style' and 'how to shop for what you will really use'.. oh my.. I think i see all of you nodding your heads!

      <title>2-6-17 Tasha Noel, Linda Thielfoldt, and Gwen Marston on Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Iâm smitten with the delightful images that Tasha Noel creates. On fabric and in her embroidery, they are darling! Weâll get an insider peek to how Tasha designs and I canât wait to hear more about how she loves to use decorative stitches as quilting stitches on her machine!
www.instagram.com/tashanoel1/
==============
Iâm delighted that Linda Thielfoldt is my quilt expert joining me every month in 2017. She is an award winning quilter, a teacher, designer, author and she quilts for hire too. But besides all that Linda has a very deep technical knowledge of the quilt making process. Each month weâll have a chance to dig deep into a topic everyone wants to know about! To kick off the year, weâll talk about teaching. And more importantly, teaching someone else to quilt so that they love it as much as we do. You are in for a real treat this year getting to know Linda!
http://www.thequiltedgoose.com/
==================
For the second half of my show I will be talking with Gwen Marston. Her work spans folk art, to liberated quilting making, to minimalist styles. Her newest book, I believe #30, is a retrospect of her pieces called âA common Threadâ. A coffee table book full of amazing photos of her quilts that span her work to this date. Gwen curated the collection and I canât wait to talk about quilting âthenâ and ânowâ â¦ and mostly about how she she developed as an artist through the years.

      <title>1-30-17 Sheri Cifaldi-Morrill, Frances OâRoark Dowell, Vicki Ruebel, and Joanna Figueroa on Pat Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>I believe a lot of us first noticed Sheri Cifaldi-Morrillâs work with her âBuzzzâ quilt that won the 2015 Quilt Alliance animal quilt contest. I want to learn how Sheri has taken her graphics design background, love of math, and symmetry to her unique quilts. With this combo Sheriâs quilts pull a lot of design punch. Weâll hear today how she works through creating a new design
http://wholecirclestudio.com/
====================
As quiltmakers we usually do a few other things beside quilt. Maybe crochet, garden, bakeâ¦ or read. Yepâ¦ quilters LOVE a story and put a quilter IN that story and we can really relate! We are so lucky that many novelist are also quilters and choose to make the star of the novel a quilt maker. Iâm excited to have author Frances Dowell with me today to tell me about her book Birds in the Air. I want to learn how she spins our quilting into the book!
http://quiltfiction.com/  
==================
Vicki Ruebel is an extraordinary award longarm quilter. I was drawn to her work because she has a way of adding another whole layer to the quilt top that brings out the very best. She is going to share with me some tips for thinking about the quilting design and how to prepare to hire a longarm quilter to work on your quilt.

I've been a huge fan of Joanna Figueroa of Fig Tree for years. She is a regular contributor to American Patchwork &amp; quilt magazine, and have been on the show several times. Joanna told me the other day she is redoing her studio.. which is a personal obsession of mine! So we are talking studio redos, her new Coney Island fabric line for Moda, and if we have time... a little about her block of the month quilts inspired by antique quilts.

I want to learn how Sheri has taken her graphics design background, love of math, and symmetry to her unique quilts. With this combo Sheriâs quilts pull a lot of design punch. Weâll hear today how she works through creating a new design

====================
As quiltmakers we usually do a few other things beside quilt. Maybe crochet, garden, bakeâ¦ or read. Yepâ¦ quilters LOVE a story and put a quilter IN that story and we can really relate! We are so lucky that many novelist are also quilters and choose to make the star of the novel a quilt maker. Iâm excited to have author Frances Dowell with me today to tell me about her book Birds in the Air. I want to learn how she spins our quilting into the book!

==================
Vicki Ruebel is an extraordinary award longarm quilter. I was drawn to her work because she has a way of adding another whole layer to the quilt top that brings out the very best. She is going to share with me some tips for thinking about the quilting design and how to prepare to hire a longarm quilter to work on your quilt.

I've been a huge fan of Joanna Figueroa of Fig Tree for years. She is a regular contributor to American Patchwork &amp; quilt magazine, and have been on the show several times. Joanna told me the other day she is redoing her studio.. which is a personal obsession of mine! So we are talking studio redos, her new Coney Island fabric line for Moda, and if we have time... a little about her block of the month quilts inspired by antique quilts.

      <title>1-16-17  Yvonne Fuchs, Paula Nadelstern, and my Q&amp;A Sections on Pat Sloan's Talk show for American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Yvonne Fuchs designs, teaches and writes as âQuilting Jet Girl - sewing at the speed of soundâ. â¦ she is my kind of gal! She has a great design style plus shares many great tutorials at her website. One thing we have in common is building quilt communities. Yvonne does a lot of projects and Iâm excited to get to know her today!

http://quiltingjetgirl.com/
--------------------
If you have not had a chance to meet Paula Nadelstern yet, you are in for a treat today! She creates innovative and complex designs for her quilts that are inspired by the symmetry of kaleidoscopic images. Her award winning work has been exhibit at quilt shows &amp; museums. Such as having the first one-person exhibition highlighting the work of a contemporary quilt artist (2009) at the American Folk Art Museum's in NYC. She is an author and a fabric designer with her super power being to create fabrics that are cut apart to design incredible images. We are going to hear how she designs and then get a peek at how working in series has brought her to the newest book âFabricadabraâ
www.paulanadelstern.com/ 
---------------------------
This month my Question &amp; Answer session goes over what do beignner really need to nail to go forward, (hint.. 1/4" seam and why), how to get motivated to work on your projects, Can you sharpen a Seam Ripper (why yes you can, and Amy Friend tells you how!), plus more along with . learning about Janet Clare's Apron and her New Fabric line. Plus why Templates are a GREAT thing! (PS... I was recovering a bit from my cold still.. had a few 'cough pauses'... bleh... )

      <title>1-9-17 Tina Curran, Mary Kerr, Linda Thielfoldt, &amp; Jody Sanders! join Pat Sloan on American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Guest links at http://blog.patsloan.com/radio-shows/
-------------------
Tina Curran is an award winning art quilter and designer of some pretty fun project patterns. I first noticed her work when someone share a photo of a quilt they did from her pattern. Tina is known for her use of color both in her art quilts and her patterns.
---------------
Mary Kerr always comes up with pretty amazing projects, often incorporating vintage textiles and vintage quilts or quilt âpartsâ. You know .. those pieces you made but didnât use? Quilters have done this for years and Mary takes those parts and uses them in her quilts. Her book âTwisted, Modern Quilts with a Vintage Twistâ is brilliant! She not only took quilt parts, made unique tops, but then asked well known quilter to quilt the pieces. She shares their process for taking that blank canvas to the next extraordinary level. Iâm excited to hear about the project from Mary and get tips and how to do something like this myselfâ¦ maybe weâll even get an insider story out of her.. wink!
-----------------------
Iâm delighted to have Linda Thielfoldt as my quilt expert joining me every month in 2017. She is an award winning quilter, a teacher, designer, author and she quilts for hire too. But besides all that Linda has a very deep technical knowledge of the quilt making process. Each month weâll have a chance to dig deep into a topic everyone wants to know about! To kick off the year, weâll talk about teaching. And more importantly, teaching someone else to quilt so that they love it as much as we do. You are in for a real treat this year getting to know Linda!
-------------
The first show of every year I have the American Patchwork &amp; Quilting editor on the chat about what weâll find in the issues this 2017! Iâve worked with Jody Sanders for many years and not only is she a great editor, but she is so talented! You should follow her at Instagram to see all her really neat projects.

      <title>12-5-16 Diane Bohn, Amy Barickman, Amy Ellis &amp; Jennifer Keltner join Pat Sloan on American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Diane Bohn of From Blank Pages creates pretty amazing paper pieced quilts. The sparkle and have a life of their own as she encourages you to use fabrics that you love in her work. She also is an advocate of making quilts for charity and bringing people together to make them. Quilters want to help by giving a ârealâ hug to people in need via our quilts. Quilters are the most generous of people this way. Diane has run a group to partner people up, she is an inspiration to me!

Amy Barickman of Indygo Junction was the first designer, business that I meet when I went to my first trade show. I had already been a huge fan of the Designs and team at Indyo Junction and Amyâs wonderfully warm welcome to the business side of quilting was so kind. We have worked together several times over the years and we keep up with each other on all things quilting and sewing! She is super clever and always has fun new ways for us to sew, from quilts to clothing to totes to her new Fabriflair items! Canât wait to learn more about the newest things with Amy!

I am excited to catch up with Amy Ellis to see what she has new! Amy is a Moda Designer, Author, Baby lock Ambassador and always has something fun for us to participate in. She is the founder of the Bloggerâs Quilt Festival online and has taken the online fun to new levels. She also creates both fabric and quilt designs with a modern feel that I love!

      <title>11-21-16 Brenda Ratliff, Roseann Kermes, and Bill Volckening join Pat Sloan on American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Brenda Ratliff is the dynamic owner of Pink Castle Fabric, organizer of Camp StitchAlot, SewPro and a fabric designer with RJR. I am excited to be working with Brenda as part of the 2017 Aurifil Design team and today we are going to talk about finding and using unique fabrics.

Roseann Kermes is back and we are going to deep dive into how to jump start yourself when you need it. In this case, for getting a hand a project ready.. and the person who needs that jump start? yours truly!
www.rosebudscottage.typepad.com/
-----------------
Itâs great to chat quilts of any kind with Bill Volckening again. I love the internet because I make so many friends through quilting. Billâs idea to buy a few New York Beauty quilts turned into an impressive collection of this style quilt, along with a beautiful book of the quilts and their stories. He has since collected many styles of quilts, including a love of 70s quilts. He is also the author of Modern Roots, 12 projects inspired by patchwork. I love old quilts and knowing their stories. Join Bill and I to get a look at what itâs like to collect.

      <title>11-14-16 Amy Warner, Linda Pumphrey, and Tula Pink join Pat Sloan on American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Amy Warner of âSew Incredibly Crazyâ is a designer and quilting cheerleader! She is always sharing her fun projects and hosting sew alongs. We are going to talk about how to be part of sew along and how to set up a successful one if you are itching to try it!

http://sewincrediblycrazy.blogspot.com/
-----------------
The very first batting that I sought to âpurchase againâ was Mountain Mist. I loved that the company has a rich history and that the batting was so nice to work with. When I started my business I contacted Mountain Mist and Linda Pumphrey and her staff were who I worked with. Linda is now with Mountain Mist again as the Senior Account Executive. She brings her experiences of working on the board of museums and with other companies back to Mountain Mist. She is also the author of the Mountain Mist Historical Quilt book. We are going to learn all about the quilt patterns that are a signature component of the company.

-------------
I bought some of Tula Pinkâs first fabric line was Full Moon Forest, the first with free spirit fabrics was Parisville and I bought that tooâ¦ now 21 lines later is Tabby Road about to come out. What I found is that not only was her fabric interesting and detailed with images woven in, but there is also a story. For each Line Tula creates an entire universe of stories to bring all the prints into life. If you have a chance to hear her talk about how she creates, go! She is also an author and of course designs quilts to showcase her fabric. Tulaâs on for the second half of the show so we have time to really chat!

      <title>10-17-16 Judy Breneman, Deanne Eisenman, and Carolyn Woods join Pat Sloan on American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Judy Breneman is the creator of the website WomanFolk: The Art of Quilting: Quilts and Quiltmaking Yesterday and Today. Iâve been an avid follower of her articles at her website for years and I love to read about quilting history. In 2016 Judy celebrated her 20th anniversary as a website.. that stopped me in my tracks! She built her first website in 1996, it may be the first quilt website! Iâm so happy she can join me to chat about Quilt history!
http://www.womenfolk.com
===============
From patchwork to applique to wool Deanne Eisenman of Snuggles Quilts creates cozy and beautiful projects! She is going to give us some needle turn applique tips and weâll hear all about love of applique!
www.snugglesquilts.com/
===================
A topic every single quilters wants to know more about, how to store .. and then FIND our stuff. Being creative often means we can live with a bit (or a lot) of creative chaos in our space. I personally love to organize and dream of having someone give me tips. My dreams came true when Carolyn Woods wrote the book just for us âOrganizing Solutions for Every Quilterâ. As a professional organizer she has this nailed and is giving us tips today!

In 2016 Judy celebrated her 20th anniversary as a website.. that stopped me in my tracks! She built her first website in 1996, it may be the first quilt website! Iâm so happy she can join me to chat about Quilt history!

From patchwork to applique to wool Deanne Eisenman of Snuggles Quilts creates cozy and beautiful projects! She is going to give us some needle turn applique tips and weâll hear all about love of applique!

===================
A topic every single quilters wants to know more about, how to store .. and then FIND our stuff. Being creative often means we can live with a bit (or a lot) of creative chaos in our space.

      <description>Ellen Osten is the National Director of Education at Sulky of America. Iâm excited to talk thread and get some really good info for us on different types of thread.

If you have looked at any quilt photos from a big show, you will have seen Cathy Wigginsâ work. And when she started to quilt with leather, I was intrigued and excited to see her work! Cathy is going to tell me how an regular quilter like me can use leather in projects.. are you in for learning something new?

Each month this year Mary Abreu of Confessions of a craft addict is joining me so we can talk about in depth on topics we quilters want to know about! We want to talk learning and classes, but not from a beginners stand point. But from how to look at learning once you have a few years experience. And we are talking to give you pointers on how to develop a class so that you can teach others!

      <description>Free patterns!.. My guests today are Kelli Fannin, John Kubiniec, and Alison Glass! 
I loved Kelli Fanninâs work the first time I saw it and that thought got locked in when I found out her website is called âSeriously It looks like it Needs stitchesâ.. super fun name, super fun projects and she has some incredible design skills!
http://thatlookslikeitneedsstitches.blogspot.com/
===================
John Kubiniec of Big Rig Quilting is an author, longarm quilter and traveling teacher. He has an amazing sense of color which I know youâve seen in the many quilts he has had published in magazines over the years. Johnâs first book is a âNew Spin on Drunkardâs Path blocksâ and I love it! He is going to share some tips with us today for how to use this basic block in unusual ways.  
 https://bigrigquilting.com/
==================
I have been a huge fan of Alison Glass and her fabrics, quilts, embroidery for a long time. She has developed lines of fabric that are so timeless and blend so with what we have that you want to collect them all. Her batik lines are beautiful and now she has embroidery and other fun things.. like removable tattoos that have glitter.. love them!

      <title>8-29-16 Jackie Padesky, Donna DeSoto, and Helen Stubbings join Pat Sloan on American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>I thought it would be super fun to share how things roll in the land of quilting! I am inspired every day by quilters and their creativity. A few months back I noticed that pineapples were showing up all over the place and low and behold there was also a pineapple quilt that was too cute for words! I of course, want to make it. Because I love to make cute things. BUT I also wanted to chat with the quilter behind âthat pineapple quiltâ and learn a bit about Jackie Padesky of Pineapple fame!
https://www.instagram.com/jackiepadeskyquilts/
----------------
Donna Desoto is back and Iâm so excited! She loves to organize large quilt challenge, and she is very good at it! The first was the tribute to the Beatles and now the 2nd quilt challenge to honor the 100th anniversary of the National Parks is out on exhibit and there is a beautiful book to go along with it. Donnaâs challenges are clever and well thought out. I will reveal what the 3rd is and IF Iâm participating this time.. on todayâs show!

        <![CDATA[<p>I thought it would be super fun to share how things roll in the land of quilting! I am inspired every day by quilters and their creativity. A few months back I noticed that pineapples were showing up all over the place and low and behold there was also a pineapple quilt that was too cute for words! I of course, want to make it. Because I love to make cute things. BUT I also wanted to chat with the quilter behind âthat pineapple quiltâ and learn a bit about Jackie Padesky of Pineapple fame!

Donna Desoto is back and Iâm so excited! She loves to organize large quilt challenge, and she is very good at it! The first was the tribute to the Beatles and now the 2nd quilt challenge to honor the 100th anniversary of the National Parks is out on exhibit and there is a beautiful book to go along with it. Donnaâs challenges are clever and well thought out. I will reveal what the 3rd is and IF Iâm participating this time.. on todayâs show!

      <title>8-22-16  Kori Turner, Kimberly Bourne, Amanda Niederhauser, and Andy Knowlton join Pat Sloan on American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>I have friends that travel a lot, and some had stopped at Kori Turnerâs shop, Olive and Grace. Then I saw her quilts at the trade show and was very excited she is able to talk to us about her quilts and give us some stitchery tips! 
http://www.olivegracestudios.com/   
================
Kimberly Bourne of Main Street Market Designs creates some incredible quilts. Some are mind boggling like her eclipse series, others are projects you can do over and over with her unique twist to the way she layouts out a design. Also she happens to love curved piecing and we are going to get some tips from her on that today!
https://mainstreetmarketdesigns.com
================
Iâve been following Amanda Niederhauser of JediCraftGirl for quite awhile. She has amazing tips and tricks, shows her craft process and hey.. she loves Starwars, you have to guess that from her business name (check her about page at her website for the proof)!
http://www.jedicraftgirl.com/
================
Andy Knowltonâs at âA Bright Cornerâ creates quilts with wonderful color combinations. And she very generously shares photos of her work, tips, tutorials and tricks to get it right. Andy also loves scraps so we are going to explore that a bit!

      <title>07-25-2016 Editor's Invade the Podcast</title>
      <description>On this weekâs American Patchwork &amp; Quilting podcast, the editors give out VIRTUAL HIGH FIVES to celebrate their readersâ big (and small) accomplishments. They challenge online quilting communities to be a safe place for quilters to share their projects, ask questions, and learn new things, as well as encourage quilters to be proud of everything they make and stop the negative thoughts surrounding their own abilities. Share your own quilting accomplishments with American Patchwork &amp; Quilting on Facebook (Facebook.com/apqmagazine) and Instagram (@allpeoplequilt).

The editors also explore common questions people have when collecting and caring for antique quilts. They touch on the importance of history, how to date a vintage quilt, and tips for purchasing antique quilts. They also share personal stories of the antique quilts that really changed their lives.

Then, editor Jody from Quilts and More magazine shares a sneak peek at the new Fall issue. She gives tips for working with T-shirt quilts, shares a hot new trend (hint, itâs denim!), and how bag-making just got easier! Pick up the latest copy of Quilts and More on newsstands now!

      <title>6-6-16   Katarina Roccella, Gail Pan, Susan-Clare Mayfield, Frances Newcombe and Jane Davidson join Pat Sloan on American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>Today is my all International Talk Show, taped in Salt Lake City Utah during the trade show, such fun!

I got to know Katarina Roccella when she showed her first fabric line and had her first trip to the United States. She is Serbian and I was really interested to find out what type of quilting goes on in her country (not much!). Her beautiful fabrics are with Art Gallery and I can't WAIT for Pandalicious  to be in stores!
 http://likeflowersandbutterflies.blogspot.com/
==========
Gail Pan has a new stitchery book and it's ALL about Christmas!!  As an Australian Fabric designer and Author she always has uniquely 'Gail' touch to her work. I got a few really useful tips on embroidery, you will love this show!
http://gailpandesigns.typepad.com/
==============
When I was teaching at Paducah I meet Susan-Clare Mayfield and she told me about her 'Block of the Day' called Town and Country Quilt. Isn't it incredible! Lucky for me I was able to get a few minutes of her time. Susan-Clare took a month an toured the US, she is from New Zealand. We have a super fun chat!

http://www.gourmetquilter.com/   
===============
The dynamic duo of Frances Newcombe and Jane Davidson are now designing for Moda fabric called Manderley. This line blends American Frances' love of sea with Australian Jane's love of color and design, it's an amazing fabric line and they have created incredible patterns! The two tell me about their partnership and how they design by skype!

      <title>5-23-16 Michelle Bartholomew, Casey York, and Nancy Mahoney join Pat Sloan on American Patchwork and Quilting Radio</title>
      <description>I spotted Michelle's work when she was featured on a project called 52 quilters. I love her story, her quilts and her great photography! Michelle is going to tell me about the 52 quilter project and share some photo taking tips with me today, I'm pretty excited!
