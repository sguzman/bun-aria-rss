      <title>How to Make Retirement Withdrawals and Not Miss Market Gains</title>
      <description>Unlike in 2020 when the stock market was upended by the pandemic, seniors with retirement savings accounts during the current market volatility have to make required minimum distributions by the end of the year. WSJ personal-finance reporter Ashlea Ebeling joins host J.R. Whalen to discuss how retirees can make withdrawals in a down market but still capitalize on eventual market gains. Correction: Congress waived rules for required minimum distributions from retirement accounts in 2020. A previous version of this podcast incorrectly said the RMB rules hadn't been in place since 2019.
