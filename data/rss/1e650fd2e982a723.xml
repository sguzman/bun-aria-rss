For the past century, stories of cryptids — like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster — have continued to fascinate. And while these creatures likely don’t exist, that doesn’t mean it isn’t fun to speculate on their biology. Enter Cryptozoologicon, a book that imagines evolutionary backstories for legendary creatures. Created by renowned paleontologist Darren Naish, alongside channel mainstays C.M. Koseman (author of All Tomorrows) and John Conway — the volume is so detailed that it’s worth exploring further.

So, for this entry into the archive, we’ll investigate the speculative biology of the world’s most famous cryptids. You can purchase the book and follow and support the creators using the links in the description below.

Now, let’s explore the creatures of Cryptozoologicon…

When I look at just one picture from Simon Stålenhag’s Tales from the Loop, I feel like I’ve watched an entire film. In a single, haunting image, a novel’s worth of narrative seems to play out just below the surface. If you’ve ever seen this art before, you’ve probably experienced this too — even if you didn’t know where it was from.

Tales from the Loop and its sequel Things from the flood are worldbuilding projects set in an alternate version of Sweden in the 80s and 90s, in which a gigantic particle accelerator buried beneath the fields and suburbs begins to alter reality in unpredictable ways. Yet the story is so much more than a summary can convey. So, for this entry into the archive, I want to dive deep into the hidden lore of Tales from the Loop — and investigate why this project has struck a chord with myself and so many others.

Now, let’s enter the world of Simon Stålenhag, and discover the mysteries of Tales from the Loop.

Have you ever seen a photo of a planet made entirely of living flesh? Or an insect-human hybrid that can control minds? Or a thousand-foot-long sea serpent that emerges in Iceland every year? These images might look like they come from some long-lost paranormal case file. But this is actually the work of the brilliant artist and worldbuilder Eduardo Valdés-Hevia, who has spent the last several years bringing to life a menagerie of nightmares.

Brought to life through a combination of old photographs and new elements, Valdés-Hevia’s art merges history and the surreal, with images that feel like they come directly from classified historical documents. The artist creates stand-alone images as well as richly detailed series with dense, interconnected lore. So, for this entry into the archive, we’ll investigate the monsters and madness of these dark case files.

 Now, prepare yourself for the terrors of Valdés-Hevia…

Have you heard of a dragon whose tail releases a spray of explosive slime? Or a dragon that hunts with noxious fumes? Or one that vomits spires of super-heated glass? Across various myths and cultures, dragons have taken on many forms. But few are more fearsome than the terrors that lurk within the pages of the Dragonslayer Codex — a worldbuilding project from the brilliant imagination of artist Sawyer Lee. 

The volume is written as a survival guide to the world’s most dangerous dragons, explaining their abilities, behavior, and how to slay them if necessary. But be warned: many of these scaly tyrants will not go down without a fight. So, for this entry into the archive, we’ll learn critical things about each species that can mean the difference between survival and searing flames. 

Now, let’s dive into the burned pages, and discover the secrets of the Dragonslayer Codex…

   <media:description>A nature documentary deep dive into the aliens of No Man’s Sky. What sort of ecosystems will we discover in a procedurally generated universe?

Across the infinite cosmos of the video game ‘No Man’s Sky,’ there are a similarly infinite number of alien lifeforms. Through the use of procedural generation, the game contains more than 18 quintillion planets to discover — many of which teem with extraordinary creatures. While No Man’s Sky had a rocky reception at launch, the developers have done persistent work making this virtual universe worth exploring.

So, for this entry into the archive, we’ll embark on a classic documentary-style expedition, exploring the lives of extraterrestrials on scorching worlds, frozen wastelands, and many others. I’ll also speculate on how the biology of each lifeform might feasibly work. I admit that there are a few too many total planets for this Archivist to document, so this documentary will focus on only the most interesting ones I’ve discovered.

Now, let’s set off into the unknown, and see what awaits us among the stars…

‘Barren,’ a post-apocalyptic worldbuilding project by Keegan Francis, imagines an alternate history where civilization ended in nuclear conflict, and mutated animal life rapidly evolves to rule over the irradiated wastes left behind.

A retro-future that calls to mind the worldbuilding of the Fallout series, the project reveals a world where human survivors must contend with biological horrors created by their own folly. So, for this entry into the archive, we’ll travel across the wastes, creating a ‘survival guide’ of sorts to the creatures that roam this desolate world. 

Now, let’s cross into an alternate timeline, and witness the broken world of Barren…

The vast oceans of the video game Subnautica and its sequel Below Zero teem with incredible life — some friendly, and some deadly. While the series is focused on survival, the lifeforms of Subnautica are amazing even when they’re trying to eat you: possessing fascinating biology, bizarre behavioral patterns, and hidden mysteries.

I’ve explored the various creatures of the series before on my channel, and in this special compilation episode — you can get the full, documentary-style experience in one video. From the sunlit shallows to the deepest abyss, we’ll explore the biology behind these puzzling aliens, and discover the role they play in their larger ecosystems.

So, let’s take the plunge together, and see what awaits us under the surface…

This video is a new chapter in my long-running series exploring the incredible speculative evolution saga of Serina, the world of birds. Serina was created by the talented artist and worldbuilder Dylan Bajda — and many extraordinary developments have occurred since we last explored this distant moon.

The triumphs and tragedies, the joys and the sorrows of this era are perhaps greater than any that have come before. So, for this entry into the archive, we’ll chronicle the rise and fall of fascinating species, and discover astonishing revelations as the world of Serina creeps ever closer to its end…

In the original series of Star Trek, the show tries to pass off what is clearly someone’s dog with a horn taped to its head as an ‘alien lifeform.’ It’s pretty hilarious to revisit — not just to see the actors make a heroic attempt to stay in-character while carrying this thing around — but also because this unicorn dog doesn’t seem distinct enough from life on earth to make a believable alien.

But this raises an interesting question: if there is life elsewhere in the universe, just how ‘alien’ will aliens look? It’s a question many scientists and sci-fi authors have speculated on, and is a fascinating rabbit hole to go down.

So, for this entry into the archive, we’ll explore relevant phenomena in evolution and physics to determine if extraterrestrials are more likely to look like Earth animals, or something far stranger...

Humans have always been explorers. As a species, we are innately curious about what lies beyond our horizon. If the day ever comes when we embark across the cosmic oceans beyond our moon, what vessels will we use to discover new worlds?

Few art projects capture the wonder and awe of voyaging to an unfamiliar planet better than the ‘Explorer’ series. Brought to life by incredible digital artist Christian Grajewski, the story is set in a distant future, where the remnants of humanity journey to a lush exoplanet called Aion

The ongoing ‘Explorer’ project doesn’t just examine a vibrant alien ecosystem, but also documents the fascinating vehicles the early explorers use to chart the unfamiliar planet. So, for this entry into the archive, we’ll tag along with the first wave of explorers, and voyage across this mysterious world in a range of different machines. And as always, you can follow and support the artist using the links in the description. Now, let’s set off towards Planet Aion…

Have you ever heard of dragonflies that snipe their prey with bolts of energy? Or octopuses that serve as guard dogs? Or Necromancer Bees that live in reanimated carcass-hives? These are from the Codex Inversus — a modern worldbuilding project like Codex Serephinianus from the imagination of the brilliant artist and writer Luca Vanzella. 

Brought to life through collages of classical art, the world of Codex Inversus is full of flora and fauna that have evolved to use magical energy, visitors from parallel dimensions, and fractures in space and time. At a glance, the surreal, scrambled visuals are difficult to make sense of. Yet like a medieval bestiary, the project does follow a unique system of internal logic.

So, for this entry into the archive, I’ll investigate the creatures, people, and locations of this scrambled world — and reveal the hidden order to the chaos of Codex Inversus…

Speculative Evolution or Speculative Biology can be defined as a genre focused on hypothetical scenarios in the evolution of life.

Today, Speculative Evolution is everywhere — from Subnautica, to Humanity Lost, to the Birrin, to After Man, to All Tomorrows, to any of the hundreds of amazing online projects that explore worlds beyond our own. But… how did we get here? Interest in the biology of fictional life wasn’t always so widespread. Monsters from ancient myth weren’t typically of thought to be part of an ecosystem, they just kind of… existed. The origin and rise of Speculative Evolution as we know it today is a fascinating tale — deeply intertwined with scientific advancement, and full of unexpected twists.

So, for this special anniversary entry into the archive, I’ll give you the full tour of this genre’s incredible history, and reveal the ‘evolution’ of Speculative Evolution…

Welcome back to the world of Horizon. In the most extreme biomes of this planet of machines, ill-tempered titans, skilled survivalists, and genuine terrors still await discovery. Like the animals braving the harshest regions of our current age, these machines have had to get creative to endure the hazards of the elements.

The environments are perilous, and the machines that live here even more so, but sometimes discovery requires certain risks. And with mysterious robots that aren’t part of the ecosystem awakening in the darkest corners of the land, who knows what final secrets are buried beneath the ground.

So, join me on the last section of our documentary-style journey, as we conclude our expedition across the uncharted regions…

Imagine an ecosystem made entirely of autonomous machines. Where every ecological niche is filled by an artificial organism. In the video game ‘Horizon: Zero Dawn’ and it’s sequel ‘Horizon: Forbbiden West’ a global calamity has led to a version of planet Earth inhabited by animal-mimicking machines — from mighty herbivores to deadly predators. While these synthetic creatures might not be ‘biological,’ their fascinating interactions, unique behavioral patterns, and hidden intricacies make them worthy of study.

The story takes place thousands of years in the future, but a little thing like the flow of time isn’t going to stop this archivist from doing his fieldwork. So, for this entry into the archive, I’ll lead us on another documentary style expedition, investigating the artificial ‘biology’ of these intriguing machines and revealing what animal roles they fill. We’ll need, though, to stay alert—there are constant dangers in this environment. 

Now, let’s leap forward in time, and discover an ecosystem of metal and wire...

Dragons cast a large shadow over the mythologies of the world. Few legendary monsters can compare to these gigantic beasts. But what if dragons cast… a slightly smaller shadow?

What if some dragons weren’t huge monsters, but strange and secretive creatures evolved to live hidden lives in the shadows and margins of the world? The amazing artist and writer Andy Frazer imagines a world where dragons are all around us, from the highest mountains to the deepest forest. Concentrated primarily in the author’s homeland of Wales, these smaller dragons — or ‘Microdragons’ as I call them – make up for their reduced size with their incredible diversity and ingenious survival strategies. The author has released many field guides on these tiny wonders that explore their evolution, anatomy, behavior, and habitats in great detail. 

So, for this entry into the archive, I’ll assume the role of a naturalist and observe some of these creatures out in the field…
