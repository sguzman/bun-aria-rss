      <description>It is a new year, and Season 2 brings two stories of frights, one from author Jasper DeWitt and another from Brian Martinez. In the first, we learn of the secret history of what Saint Nicholas really did...what is in store for years to come. In the second, a young man retells a story of his childhood...about the sister he tries to protect, his abusive father, and something which comes to the window in the night.

      <title>S9E015 – "Dead Ends" – Scary Stories Told in the Dark</title>
      <description>Otis serves up two slices of terror from Ryan Peacock. In the first story, a successful businessman goes to take care of the only thing that could stand in the way of a long and happy retirement...but he may not like the consequences. In the second, an elderly man's attempt to stave off boredom by attaching a camera to his wandering feline leads to a revelation he may have been better off not knowing.

      <title>Introducing: The Town Whispers</title>
      <description>We’re proud to introduce you to the latest horror series on our network: THE TOWN WHISPERS - a serialized audio drama written, produced and performed by Cole Weavers. 
In the series, you’ll explore The Fort, a town hidden behind the fog, the trees, and the rain of the Pacific Northwest. A town where the locals manage to sleep easy most nights, despite the screams heard echoing over the nearby bog at night – and something just isn’t right.

The Town Whispers is a horror audio drama that exists at the crossroads between Eldritch terrors, and folk horrors. If you enjoy Lovecraft, The Wicker Man, tales of Pagan lore, or Twin Peaks, you’ll love The Town Whispers!

In this episode, you’ll hear the first thrilling chapter of The Town Whispers in its entirety. While you’re listening, make sure to subscribe on Apple Podcasts or wherever you listen to your favorite programs, so you never miss a new weekly episode – there are over a dozen chapters available now – or click the link below.

      <title>06: S6E06 – "Where the Skies End" – Scary Stories Told in the Dark</title>
      <description>In this episode of Scary Stories Told in the Dark, we bring you four terrifying tales from author Christopher Maxim, performed by host and narrator Otis Jiry, about astral instructions, creepy canines, eerie elevators, and dangerous desires.
 
Today, we’re asking for your help, if you’re able to offer it, on behalf of tonight’s talented featured author. Regrettably, Chris has been hard-hit both financially and physically by the coronavirus pandemic. He suffers from a high-risk health condition that’s left him immuno-compromised and quarantined indefinitely. Coupled with serious issues collecting unemployment, Chris has found it difficult to make ends meet, let alone afford the treatment he needs to improve his health. So, we'd like to ask you a simple favor: if you’re able to help in any way, whether by donating to him directly, or by purchasing his books on Amazon.com, it would mean a lot to all of us.
 
We’ve set up an author profile for Chris on our website, at https://www.SimplyScaryPodcast.com/maxim. On that page, you’ll find links to Chris’s Amazon page, as well as an assortment of his featured books. You’ll also find a donation link that will allow you to show your appreciation for his bone-chilling fiction by contributing a few dollars to him directly. Just look for the donation link us his social media links, at the top of the page. You can also use the page to contact Chris, if you’d like to ask about other ways to help. From Chris and everyone on our team, thank you for your support of indie horror and of our talented writers in their time of need.

      <title>25: Season 2 Announced: A Taste of Terror from Horror Hill – Presented by Scary Stories Told in the Dark</title>
      <link>https://audioboom.com/posts/6853298</link>
      <description>Good evening… this is Otis Jiry, host of _Scary Stories Told in the Dark_. I hope you’ve enjoyed the first season of the program, and all 24 episodes. Myself and the team at Chilling Entertainment and the Simply Scary Podcasts Network are hard at work on Season 2, which begins right on schedule this upcoming Wednesday, May 16, now with three *free* stories per episode. But, in case you who just can’t wait until next week for your fill of frights, you’re in luck, as I come to you today with the gift that keeps on giving. If you don’t already know, mine is not the only horror audio drama on the Simply Scary network. We also produce the program that started it all, the _Simply Scary Podcast_, which frequently features yours truly, and which just launched its third season this past Tuesday. Season 3, episode 1 features me in a starring role, so don’t miss it. (You can see that episode here: http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/series/the-simply-scary-podcast/3x01/) If you’re not a subscriber to the _Simply Scary Podcast_, you can find them also on SimplyScaryPodcast.com, as well as on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, Spotify, and wherever else podcasts are found. And if you’re just discovering our friends over there, you’ve got a lot of catching up to do, and there are more than 30 episodes for you to satisfy your taste for terror with. Also on the network is our brand new program, _Horror Hill_, starring _Chilling Tales for Dark Nights_ fan-favorite Jason Hill as both host and narrator. Jason’s show is for mature audiences only, is not for those faint of heart, and features a wide range of anthology horror from both published and unpublished authors, complete with sound effects and music. So if you’re interested in losing any more sleep, he’s got your fix every Thursday night. For those of you listening in now and supporting me, I wanted to go the extra mile and make it easy to experience what it’s like over at the Horror Hill… so, with the kind permission of Jason, I present to you the latest episode of his program, in its entirety, here on my feed. If you enjoy what you hear, please subscribe to _Horror Hill_ on iTunes or your podcast app of choice, leave him a 5-star review, and post a kind word if you feel so inclined. It would bring a smile to this old storyteller’s face to see fans of my show enjoy his as well. From all of us here at the Simply Scary Podcasts Network, where we like to give you more horror than you can handle…. stay spooky… and enjoy the show… and I’ll see you next week for the debut of Season 2 of _Scary Stories Told in the Dark_. See full episode details, including the text of the featured stories, here:http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/series/horror-hill/s1e14-hh/

      <title>5: S1E05 – “Risk and Reward” – Scary Stories Told in the Dark</title>
      <link>https://audioboom.com/posts/6799618</link>
      <description>In this fifth episode of _[Scary Stories Told in the Dark](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/shows/scary-stories-told-in-the-dark/)_, we bring you two terrifying tales from [Ben Pienaar](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/authors/ben-pienaar/) and [Thomas O. Wagner](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/authors/thomas-o-wagner/), performed by host and narrator [Otis Jiry](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/performers/otis-jiry/), about making what at first appears to be a deceptively simple choice: make a deal, get a reward. But as many often do, our protagonists find out that there are many different interpretations of an agreement to be had. The only remaining two questions are: which end of the bargain will they end up on, the victim’s, or the opportunist’s? And, wherever they find themselves, will it be worth both the “_Risk and Reward_?"

      <title>3: S1E03 – “Singularity” – Scary Stories Told in the Dark</title>
      <link>https://audioboom.com/posts/6799620</link>
      <description>In this third episode of _[Scary Stories Told in the Dark](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/shows/scary-stories-told-in-the-dark/)_, we bring you two terrifying tales from an anonymous author and [Christopher Gideon](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/authors/christopher-gideon/), performed by host and narrator [Otis Jiry](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/performers/otis-jiry/), about both sides of the A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) coin, and the abject fear that one can experience both being the creation, as well as the creator. Regardless of which end of the spectrum you fall on yourself, or or empathize with, one thing is certain: the "_Singularity"_ will someday affect us all, and when it does, pulling the plug may not be so easy as we expect.

      <description>In this second episode of _[Scary Stories Told in the Dark](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/shows/scary-stories-told-in-the-dark/)_, we bring you two terrifying tales from authors [Christian Thompson](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/authors/christian-thompson/) and [John Morressy](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/authors/john-morressy/), performed by host and narrator [Otis Jiry](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/performers/otis-jiry/), about shops discovered in both out-of-the-way places, as well as in plain sight, which hold within their walls some treasures that sound just too good to be true. Sometimes, the old addages turn out to be more true than one could ever expect, and the Latin phrase “_Caveat Emptor_” – buyer beware – becomes more crucial than ever.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this second episode of _[Scary Stories Told in the Dark](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/shows/scary-stories-told-in-the-dark/)_, we bring you two terrifying tales from authors [Christian Thompson](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/authors/christian-thompson/) and [John Morressy](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/authors/john-morressy/), performed by host and narrator [Otis Jiry](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/performers/otis-jiry/), about shops discovered in both out-of-the-way places, as well as in plain sight, which hold within their walls some treasures that sound just too good to be true. Sometimes, the old addages turn out to be more true than one could ever expect, and the Latin phrase “_Caveat Emptor_” – buyer beware – becomes more crucial than ever.

      <description>In this debut episode of _[Scary Stories Told in the Dark](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/shows/scary-stories-told-in-the-dark/)_, we bring you two terrifying tales from authors [Jeff Hartin](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/authors/jeff-hartin/) and [Polum Chill](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/authors/polum-chill/), performed by host and narrator [Otis Jiry](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/performers/otis-jiry/), about things that go bump in the night, in the dark…. and which react in interesting fashion to light. Sometimes, it turns out, it’s better to see what’s after you. Other times, not so much. After all, you can never be quite what sort of “_Danger in the Dark_” is on your tail.
