      <title>Thuioobua Prophecy: An Alien Abduction To The 9th Planet </title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com </link>
      <description>Tonight, I sit down with author Samuel Chong to discuss the information he was told first-hand by the late Michel Desmarquet about his incredible abduction experience.

Material technology, without spiritual knowledge, is leading us to a global catastrophe on Earth. Technology should ASSIST in the spiritual development and not be used (as it is used now) to confine and enslave people within a monetary system and materialistic world, which are both temporary anyway.

No matter how much we defend our current beliefs, doctrines and traditions, nothing can change the TRUTH and the order established in the Universe. Believing is not enough. You need to KNOW:

- The purpose of the Universe and our life on Earth
- True dangers in life, surpassing the atomic destruction
- Conscious reincarnation, life after death
- Big Bang, creation and evolution
- Astral travel, telepathy, levitation, development of the mind
- Aura and its significance
- 1.3 million years of past civilisations on Earth
- Knowledge and sciences lost on Earth
- Great Pyramid as a cosmic tool
- Life on Mars and in our Galaxy
- Parallel Universe on Earth, Bermuda Triangle
- Space travel by transubstantiation
- Universal Law
- the Law of the Universe
- The future ...

      <title>A Haunted History of Invisible Women </title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com</link>
      <description>My special guests tonight are authors and paranormal researchers Leanna Renee Hieber and Andrea Janes here to discuss their new book called A Haunted History of Invisible Women.

"Deliciously eerie.” —Leslie Rule, Bestselling Author

From the notorious Lizzie Borden to the innumerable, haunted rooms of Sarah Winchester's mysterious mansion this offbeat, insightful, first-ever book of its kind from the brilliant guides behind “Boroughs of the Dead,” featured on NPR.org, The New York Times, and Jezebel, explores the history behind America’s female ghosts, the stereotypes, myths, and paranormal tales that swirl around them, what their stories reveal about us—and why they haunt us . . .
 
Sorrowful widows, vengeful jezebels, innocent maidens, wronged lovers, former slaves, even the occasional axe-murderess—America’s female ghosts differ widely in background, class, and circumstance. Yet one thing unites them: their ability to instill fascination and fear, long after their deaths. Here are the full stories behind some of the best-known among them, as well as the lesser-known—though no less powerful . . .
 
Tales whispered in darkness often divulge more about the teller than the subject. America’s most famous female ghosts, from ‘Mrs. Spencer’ who haunted Joan Rivers’ New York apartment to Bridget Bishop, the first person executed during the Salem witchcraft trials, mirror each era’s fears and prejudices. Yet through urban legends and campfire stories, even ghosts like the nameless hard-working women lost in the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire —achieve a measure of power and agency in death, in ways unavailable to them as living women.
 
Riveting for skeptics and believers alike, with humor, curiosity, and expertise, A Haunted History of Invisible Women offers a unique lens on the significant role these ghostly legends play both within the spook-seeking corners of our minds and in the consciousness of a nation.
 
Afterword by Bram Stoker Award-winning author Linda D. Addison

“An absolute must-buy for the spooky people of the world . . . utterly brilliant.” —Mallory O'Meara, bestselling author of The Lady from the Black Lagoon and Girly Drinks

“If this book doesn’t leave with you a sense of wonder and a healthy dose of goosebumps, check your pulse—you may already be among the spirits.” —Marc Hartzman, author of Chasing Ghosts: A Tour of Our Fascination with Spirits and the Supernatural

Yet through urban legends and campfire stories, even ghosts like the nameless hard-working women lost in the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire —achieve a measure of power and agency in death, in ways unavailable to them as living women.</p><p> </p><p>Riveting for skeptics and believers alike, with humor, curiosity, and expertise, <em>A Haunted History of Invisible Women</em> offers a unique lens on the significant role these ghostly legends play both within the spook-seeking corners of our minds and in the consciousness of a nation.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Afterword by Bram Stoker Award-winning author Linda D.

The Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine Warren (The Paranormal Investigators Featured in the Film "The Conjuring") 
If you think ghosts are only responsible for hauntings, think again. This New York Times Best Seller reveals the grave religious process behind supernatural events and how it can happen to you. Used as a text in seminaries and classrooms, this is one book you can't put down. For over five decades Ed and Loraine Warren have been considered America's foremost experts on demonology and exorcism. With thousands of investigations to their credit, they reveal what actually breaks the peace in haunted houses. Chapters include Annabelle and The Enfield Poltergeist. Don't miss the the Warrens in the hit film 'The Conjuring' and the upcoming film 'The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It' in theaters June, 2021.


The Haunted: One Family's Nightmare 

The world s most famous demonologists, Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren, were called in to help an average American family who were assaulted by forces too awesome, too powerful, too dark, to be stopped. It s a true story, supported by dozens of eyewitnesses neighbors, priests, police, journalists, and researchers. The grim slaughterhouse of odors. The deafening pounding. The hoofed half-man charging down the hall. The physical attacks, a vicious strangling, failed exorcisms, the succubus... and the final terror which continued to torment the Smurls. In this shocking, terrifying, deeply absorbing book rivaled only by The Amityville Horror a case also investigated by the Warrens journalist Robert Curran digs deep into the haunting of the Smurl home in West Pittston, Pennsylvania, and the unshakeable family bonds that helped them survive. Don’t miss the new film "The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” based on the Warrens’ case files. Books by Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren also include Graveyard, Ghost Hunters, In a Dark Place, Werewolf, and Satan's Harvest.

      <title>Haunted On Ghosts Witches Vampires Zombies and Other Monsters of the Natural and Supernatural Worlds </title>
      <description>My special guest is Leo Braudy who's here to discuss is book called Haunted On Ghosts Witches Vampires Zombies and Other Monsters of the Natural and Supernatural Worlds.
An award-winning scholar and author charts four hundred years of monsters and how they reflect the culture that created them

Leo Braudy, a finalist for both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, has won accolades for revealing the complex and constantly shifting history behind seemingly unchanging ideas of fame, war, and masculinity.
 
Continuing his interest in the history of emotion, this book explores how fear has been shaped into images of monsters and monstrosity. From the Protestant Reformation to contemporary horror films and fiction, he explores four major types: the monster from nature (King Kong), the created monster (Frankenstein), the monster from within (Mr. Hyde), and the monster from the past (Dracula). Drawing upon deep historical and literary research, Braudy discusses the lasting presence of fearful imaginings in an age of scientific progress, viewing the detective genre as a rational riposte to the irrational world of the monstrous. Haunted is a compelling and incisive work by a writer at the height of his powers.

Drawing upon deep historical and literary research, Braudy discusses the lasting presence of fearful imaginings in an age of scientific progress, viewing the detective genre as a rational riposte to the irrational world of the monstrous. <em>Haunted</em> is a compelling and incisive work by a writer at the height of his powers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>BECOME A PLUS PASS MEMBER TO ACCESS ARCHIVED EPISODES AND MORE!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mysterious-radio-paranormal-ufo-lore-interviews/id1145222943"><strong>APPLE IPHONE USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PLUS PASS MEMBER ON APPLE PODCASTS</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://mysteriousradio.supercast.com/"><strong>ANDROID USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PASS MEMBER AND LISTEN FROM MOST PODCAST APPS</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>PLUS PASS MEMBER BENEFITS:</strong></p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO<strong> MYSTERIOUS RADIO</strong> <strong>PLUS:</strong></p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO PARANORMAL FEARS!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO SEVEN!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO <strong>OVER 150 HOURS </strong>OF ARCHIVED EPISODES!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO CONTROVERSIAL EPISODES!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS </strong>TO <strong>BONUS EPISODES </strong>FOR MEMBERS ONLY!</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://themysteriousradiocollective.mn.co/"><strong>Request To Join Our Private Community</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p><br></p><p>Visit our home on the web: <a href="https://www.mysteriousradio.com/">https://www.mysteriousradio.com</a></p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mysteriousradio/">@mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Follow us on TikTok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mysteriousradio?lang=en">mysteriousradioTikTok</a></p><p>Follow us on Twitter<a href="https://www.twitter.com/mysteriousradio"> @mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Follow us on Pinterest <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/mysteriousradio">pinterest.com/mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Like us on Facebook<a href="http://www.facebook.com/mysteriousradio"> Facebook.com/mysteriousradio</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want All Paranormal Episodes?

      <title>Haunted Shores </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Tonight, Dale Jarvis joins me to discuss ghost stories from the province of Newfoundland. Get his book Haunted Shores: True Ghosts Stories of Newfoundland and Labrador on Amazon.

From the northern shores of Labrador to the south coast of Newfoundland, there are as many ghost stories as there are bays and inlets. The province of Newfoundland and Labrador is rich with tales of ghost ships, mysterious lights, sinister spectres, tokens of impending death, headless pirates and murdered loves. From legends of phantom loggers to stories of possessed teapots, Haunted Shores: True Ghost Stories of Newfoundland and Labrador is an eerie exploration of the phantom-filled nooks and crannies of the province. Why does a mournful lady ghost return to Arnold’s Cove every November? Do ghostly submarines still sail the waters of Trinity Bay? What is the most haunted street in St. John’s? 
Drawn from both archival sources and first-hand accounts, the stories herein weave together anecdote, oral tradition, history and folklore to form a rich tapestry depicting a rarely explored side of Newfoundland and Labrador.

      <title>The Secret Serial Killer: The True Story of Kieran Kelly</title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is Robert Mulhern who's here to discuss his book about a low key serial killer in the city of London snatching the lives of the homeless like nobody's business. Get his book The Secret Serial Killer: The True Story of Kieran Kelly on Amazon.

Robert's Twitter


This true crime investigation into the notorious case of Kieran Kelly reveals “new twists that add further intrigue to the mystery” (Irish Post).
 
On the evening of August 21,1983, Metropolitan Police detectives raced to London’s Clapham Police Station to find a prisoner dead. His cellmate sat quietly in the corner. Kieran Kelly, a laborer from Ireland, calmly confessed to strangling the prisoner—and then stunned officers by confessing to dozens of unreported and unsolved murders over the previous 30 years.
 
Kelly may have been Britain’s most prolific serial killer, yet he was convicted on just two of his admissions. In 2015, a former police officer who worked on the case made a bombshell accusation: that Kelly' crimes were covered up by the British Government.
 
Strangulations, murders on the London Underground, an internal Metropolitan Police review—as the story’s elements whipped the international news media into a frenzy, journalist Robert Mulhern set off from London to rural Ireland on a methodical search for the truth. Could Kieran Kelly really have murdered 31 times?

      <title>Fentanyl: The Deadliest Opioid Ever Created </title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is author Ben Westhoff who's here to discuss the deadliest opioid ever created causing instant death in adults, children and even infants. Get his book Fentanyl, Inc.: How Rogue Chemists Are Creating the Deadliest Wave of the Opioid Epidemic on Amazon.
A remarkable four-year investigation into the dangerous world of synthetic drugs―from black market drug factories in China to users and dealers on the streets of the U.S. to harm reduction activists in Europe―which reveals for the first time the next wave of the opioid epidemicA deeply human story, Fentanyl, Inc. is the first deep-dive investigation of a hazardous and illicit industry that has created a worldwide epidemic, ravaging communities and overwhelming and confounding government agencies that are challenged to combat it. “A whole new crop of chemicals is radically changing the recreational drug landscape,” writes Ben Westhoff. “These are known as Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS) and they include replacements for known drugs like heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, and marijuana. They are synthetic, made in a laboratory, and are much more potent than traditional drugs”―and all-too-often tragically lethal.
Drugs like fentanyl, K2, and Spice―and those with arcane acronyms like 25i-NBOMe― were all originally conceived in legitimate laboratories for proper scientific and medicinal purposes. Their formulas were then hijacked and manufactured by rogue chemists, largely in China, who change their molecular structures to stay ahead of the law, making the drugs’ effects impossible to predict. Westhoff has infiltrated this shadowy world. He tracks down the little-known scientists who invented these drugs and inadvertently killed thousands, as well as a mysterious drug baron who turned the law upside down in his home country of New Zealand. Westhoff visits the shady factories in China from which these drugs emanate, providing startling and original reporting on how China’s vast chemical industry operates, and how the Chinese government subsidizes it. Poignantly, he chronicles the lives of addicted users and dealers, families of victims, law enforcement officers, and underground drug awareness organizers in the U.S. and Europe. Together they represent the shocking and riveting full anatomy of a calamity we are just beginning to understand. From its depths, as Westhoff relates, are emerging new strategies that may provide essential long-term solutions to the drug crisis that has affected so many.

      <itunes:summary>My special guest tonight is author Ben Westhoff who's here to discuss the deadliest opioid ever created causing instant death in adults, children and even infants. Get his book Fentanyl, Inc.: How Rogue Chemists Are Creating the Deadliest Wave of the Opioid Epidemic on Amazon.
A remarkable four-year investigation into the dangerous world of synthetic drugs―from black market drug factories in China to users and dealers on the streets of the U.S. to harm reduction activists in Europe―which reveals for the first time the next wave of the opioid epidemicA deeply human story, Fentanyl, Inc. is the first deep-dive investigation of a hazardous and illicit industry that has created a worldwide epidemic, ravaging communities and overwhelming and confounding government agencies that are challenged to combat it. “A whole new crop of chemicals is radically changing the recreational drug landscape,” writes Ben Westhoff. “These are known as Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS) and they include replacements for known drugs like heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, and marijuana. They are synthetic, made in a laboratory, and are much more potent than traditional drugs”―and all-too-often tragically lethal.
Drugs like fentanyl, K2, and Spice―and those with arcane acronyms like 25i-NBOMe― were all originally conceived in legitimate laboratories for proper scientific and medicinal purposes. Their formulas were then hijacked and manufactured by rogue chemists, largely in China, who change their molecular structures to stay ahead of the law, making the drugs’ effects impossible to predict. Westhoff has infiltrated this shadowy world. He tracks down the little-known scientists who invented these drugs and inadvertently killed thousands, as well as a mysterious drug baron who turned the law upside down in his home country of New Zealand. Westhoff visits the shady factories in China from which these drugs emanate, providing startling and original reporting on how China’s vast chemical industry operates, and how the Chinese government subsidizes it. Poignantly, he chronicles the lives of addicted users and dealers, families of victims, law enforcement officers, and underground drug awareness organizers in the U.S. and Europe. Together they represent the shocking and riveting full anatomy of a calamity we are just beginning to understand. From its depths, as Westhoff relates, are emerging new strategies that may provide essential long-term solutions to the drug crisis that has affected so many.

      <title>Bombshell: The Night Bobby Kennedy Killed Marilyn Monroe</title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is author Mike Rothmiller to discuss what his evidence that points to Bobby Kennedy's killing Marilyn Monroe. Get his book Bombshell: The Night Bobby Kennedy Killed Marilyn Monroe on Amazon.

‘Bombshell reads like a James Ellroy novel with its catalogue of corruption’ Mick Brown, Telegraph

-
‘Bobby called. He’s coming to California. He wants to see me.’
Drawing on secret police files, Marilyn Monroe’s private diary and never before published first-hand testimony, this book proves that Robert Kennedy was directly responsible for her death. It details the legendary star’s tumultuous personal involvement with him and his brother, President John Kennedy, and how they plotted to silence her.
The new evidence and revelatory statements are provided by Mike Rothmiller who, as a detective of the Organized Crime Intelligence Division (OCID) of the LAPD, had direct personal access to hundreds of restricted LAPD files on exactly what happened at Marilyn Monroe’s Californian home on August 5, 1962.
With his training and investigator’s knowledge, Rothmiller used that confidential information to get to the heart of the matter, to the people who were there the night Marilyn died – two of whom played major roles in the cover-up – and the wider conspiracy to protect the Kennedys whatever the collateral damage.
There will be those with doubts, but to them, the lawman – who directed international intelligence operations targeting organized crime – says the printed, forensic and oral evidence are totally convincing. He insists: ‘If I presented my evidence in any court of law, I’d get a conviction.’

        <![CDATA[<p>My special guest tonight is author Mike Rothmiller to discuss what his evidence that points to Bobby Kennedy's killing Marilyn Monroe.

He’s coming to California. He wants to see me.’</strong></p><p>Drawing on secret police files, Marilyn Monroe’s private diary and never before published first-hand testimony, this book proves that Robert Kennedy was directly responsible for her death. It details the legendary star’s tumultuous personal involvement with him and his brother, President John Kennedy, and how they plotted to silence her.</p><p>The new evidence and revelatory statements are provided by Mike Rothmiller who, as a detective of the Organized Crime Intelligence Division (OCID) of the LAPD, had direct personal access to hundreds of restricted LAPD files on exactly what happened at Marilyn Monroe’s Californian home on August 5, 1962.</p><p>With his training and investigator’s knowledge, Rothmiller used that confidential information to get to the heart of the matter, to the people who were there the night Marilyn died – two of whom played major roles in the cover-up – and the wider conspiracy to protect the Kennedys whatever the collateral damage.</p><p>There will be those with doubts, but to them, the lawman – who directed international intelligence operations targeting organized crime – says the printed, forensic and oral evidence are totally convincing. He insists: ‘If I presented my evidence in any court of law, I’d get a conviction.’</p><p><br></p><p><strong>BECOME A PLUS PASS MEMBER TO ACCESS ARCHIVED EPISODES AND MORE!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mysterious-radio-paranormal-ufo-lore-interviews/id1145222943"><strong>APPLE IPHONE USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PLUS PASS MEMBER ON APPLE PODCASTS</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://mysteriousradio.supercast.com/"><strong>ANDROID USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PASS MEMBER AND LISTEN FROM MOST PODCAST APPS</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>PLUS PASS MEMBER BENEFITS:</strong></p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO<strong> MYSTERIOUS RADIO</strong> <strong>PLUS:</strong></p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO PARANORMAL FEARS!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO SEVEN!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO <strong>OVER 150 HOURS </strong>OF ARCHIVED EPISODES!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO CONTROVERSIAL EPISODES!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS </strong>TO <strong>BONUS EPISODES </strong>FOR MEMBERS ONLY!</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://themysteriousradiocollective.mn.co/"><strong>Request To Join Our Private Community</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p><br></p><p>Visit our home on the web: <a href="https://www.mysteriousradio.com/">https://www.mysteriousradio.com</a></p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mysteriousradio/">@mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Follow us on TikTok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mysteriousradio?lang=en">mysteriousradioTikTok</a></p><p>Follow us on Twitter<a href="https://www.twitter.com/mysteriousradio"> @mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Follow us on Pinterest <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/mysteriousradio">pinterest.com/mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Like us on Facebook<a href="http://www.facebook.com/mysteriousradio"> Facebook.com/mysteriousradio</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want All Paranormal Episodes?

      <title>Silent Invasion: The Pennsylvania UFO-Bigfoot Casebook</title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is author and researcher Stan Gordon who's here to discuss the onslaught of strange reports connecting Bigfoot, UFO's and paranormal activity together in Pennsylvania. Get his book Silent Invasion: The Pennsylvania UFO-Bigfoot Casebook on Amazon.
Stan Gordon began his journey in field investigations of UFOs and other Paranormal encounters in Pennsylvania in 1965. During 1973 UFOs began to make widespread appearances in the sky across the Keystone State. It was during the summer of that year however when a mysterious wave of events began to unfold. Alarmed citizens over a widespread area reported close encounters with huge hairy Bigfoot-like creatures. Frightened residents called local authorities and media outlets reporting enormous footprints and terrified animals. As the pace of the abnormal encounters quickened through the following months, more eyewitness reports of other strange creatures, and a variety of other paranormal events came to the attention of Gordon's investigation team. Stan's second book covers many of the mysterious incidents from that period which continued into 1974, including illustrations and photos. For the first time the author reveals many new details about this puzzling period of time. Some of the startling cases discussed suggest that there may be more to the Bigfoot mystery than a flesh and blood explanation. Some of the first hand accounts and details you will read about include: • UFOs And Bigfoot Seen At The Same Time And Place • The Case Of The Vanishing Bigfoot • Bigfoot Shooting Incidents • UFO Landings And Car Pursuits • Mystery Men Interviewing Witnesses And Destroying Evidence • The Government Interest

      <title>The Twenty-Ninth Day: Surviving a Grizzly Attack in the Canadian Tundra</title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com</link>
      <description>My special guest is Alex Messenger who's here to discuss how he managed to reach help 1000 miles away after being mauled by a grizzly bear deep in the Canadian Wilderness. Get his book The Twenty-Ninth Day: Surviving a Grizzle Attack in the Canadian Wilderness on Amazon.

A 600-mile canoe trip in the Canadian wilderness is a 17-year-old's dream adventure, but after he is mauled by a grizzly bear, it's all about staying alive. 
This true-life wilderness survival epic recounts 17-year-old Alex Messenger's near-lethal encounter with a grizzly bear during a canoe trip in the Canadian tundra. The story follows Alex and his five companions as they paddle north through harrowing rapids and stunning terrain. Twenty-nine days into the trip, while out hiking alone, Alex is attacked by a barren-ground grizzly. Left for dead, he wakes to find that his summer adventure has become a struggle to stay alive. Over the next hours and days, Alex and his companions tend his wounds and use their resilience, ingenuity, and dogged perseverance to reach help at a remote village a thousand miles north of the US-Canadian border. 
The Twenty-Ninth Day is a coming-of-age story like no other, filled with inspiring subarctic landscapes, thrilling riverine paddling, and a trial by fire of the human spirit.

      <title>Unidentified: The UFO Phenomenon</title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com</link>
      <description>My special guest is former Air Force Officer Robert Salas who's command unit witnessed a UFO that disarmed their nuclear warheads. Pick up his book Unidentified: The UFO Phenomena on Amazon.
In 1969 the U.S. Air Force issued a statement that read‚ "No UFO reported, investigated and evaluated by the Air Force was ever an indication of threat to our national security." This statement is patently false. It has been proven untrue by the testimony of many military officers and airmen and documentation of incidents involving UFOs and nuclear weapons, testimonies of which the U.S. Air Force was fully aware. Unidentified details many of these testimonies, some for the first time.

As partial justification for its position, the Air Force cites a University of Colorado study that was contracted and paid for by federal funds. Unidentified reveals how this study was actually just another part of the plan to cover up the reality of the UFO phenomenon. For the first time, Unidentified publishes evidence that the investigators for the Colorado study knew about the UFO-related missile shutdown incidents but did not investigate them or include them in their final report.
 
"To date, many former or retired U.S. Air Force personnel - once trusted to operate or guard weapons of mass destruction - have come forward and revealed ongoing UFO surveillance of, and occasional interference with, our nuclear weapons. The entire body of these factual accounts alters the historical perspective on the nuclear arms race."
 
Robert Sales, a retired United States Air Force Officer, witnessed first-hand a UAP visiting and disabling nuclear missiles at that Malmstrom Air Force Base and shares his experience as well as the many incidents of the last 80 years of similar visits that have been covered-up.

      <title>Vampires, Gators, and Wackos: A Florida Newspaperman's Life</title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com </link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Frank Standfield who's here to discuss shocking crimes and events that occurred during his years as a journalist in Central Florida. Get his book Vampires, Gators, and Wackos: A Florida Newspaperman’s Life on Amazon.

Teens savagely murder a couple in the name of their vampire cult.
A sex-starved teacher cannot get enough of her young male student.
The case of a missing child keeps cops awake at night for years after his confounding disappearance.

During his decades-long crime coverage in Central Florida, journalist Frank Stanfield covered every atrocity that man or nature could unleash.

Vampires, Gators, and Wackos: A Florida Newspaperman’s Life recounts some of the frequently craven, and at times downright stupid, crimes Stanfield covered during his time in the field. He somehow made it through without winding up more mental than the crackpots he tracked. However, his unvarnished, no-holds-barred account of news events reveals just how crazy-making a case can be when you are dead set on nailing the truth.

“Here’s a tip for young reporters: Don’t beat the cops to a homicide. Crowds at murder scenes are sometimes wildly angry, drunk, high, confused and looking at a face that is decidedly out of place in their neighborhood. In those days we wore nice clothes, even ties, if not jackets, to a crime scene. ‘Who are you?’ they asked, figuring I must be a cop, because surely, no sane person would show up unarmed in the middle of a melee.” - Frank Stanfield

      <title>True Story of Contact with An Ancient Alien - Part Two - Bruce Solheim's Final Interview</title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com</link>
      <description>Giving me to chat with him one final time, Bruce Solheim sits down to discuss more information shared by his communication with an Ancient Alien spirit and why this will be his last interview. You can add all if his books to your collection on Amazon.

Anzar is an ancient alien mystic whom I have known most of my life and have been in weekly direct contact with since 2018. Anzar the Progenitor documents my spirit communication with this ancient alien, including his prophecies, sage advice, and commentary on the world. The book has extensive endnotes and includes my research on the nature of this communication through mediumship and my theory of how the alien world, the spirit world, and the quantum world are the same—a quantum nexus. We can no longer wait for government disclosure about UFOs and aliens. The time has come for personal revelation through a leap of consciousness in a new Era of Reconversion. We are all related and we are the aliens.

      <title>Ted Bundy: The Yearly Journal </title>
      <description>Ted Bundy was beyond vicious. A sexual sadist he took pleasure in the torture and murder of young women for years without an ounce of remorse. My special guest is Kevin Sullivan who's here to discuss his 7th book on the monster that once walked among us. Get Ted Bundy: The Yearly Journals on Amazon.

“With all the material we have on Ted Bundy, it’s easy to think we’ve thoroughly covered his life and crimes. But there still are holes, still things to learn . . . Newly discovered facts, some speculation, and some clarification—they’re all here. For those who can’t get enough of Bundy, the items in this illuminating volume show that we can still chip away at his secrets.” —Katherine Ramsland, author of Confession of a Serial Killer: The Untold Story of Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer

Due to Sullivan’s extensive writing about Ted Bundy (which has produced six books), he’s become a sort of magnet over the years, drawing out many people who were part of the Bundy story, but have otherwise kept a low profile over the decades; and these first-person contacts continue to this day. As such, this is the first book in a new series of books, whose aim is to bring new revelations to the public about Bundy, the victims, the murders, and the almost murders that failed Bundy for one reason or another. 

This first offering, Ted Bundy: The Yearly Journal Volume One, contains a great deal of never before published information from a number of women who barely escaped his grasp. It also reveals Bundy’s geographic hunting pattern after his arrival in Salt Lake City, Utah in September 1974; a surprising discovery the author never expected to make, but did, and it all came about through the valid testimonies of the women who encountered him during this period.

The book also delves into what the author believes is perhaps an accurate, albeit it conservative estimate, of how many women or young girls Bundy approached but failed to abduct during his years of murder. Each new volume will focus on particular aspects of the case where further investigation is warranted. There are still “unknowns” out there, and as the author has experienced, where unknowns exit, the possibility of discovery awaits.

      <title>Bothell Hell House - Part Two (From Our Podcast Paranormal Fears)</title>
      <link>http://www.paranormalfears.com </link>
      <description>We pick up with our special guest Keith Linder about his book 'Bothell Hell House'.
My special guest is Keith Linder here to discuss the extraordinary phenomena that he experienced after moving into a rental home with his girlfriend. Get his book The Bothell Hell House: Poltergeist of Washington State on Amazon. His youtube - https://youtu.be/DHp59_Lia3s True Haunted House story - 2012 Keith Linder after successfully obtaining a management position at a prestigious healthcare company decides the time is right for him and his girlfriend to move in together. That's putting things lightly. Weird things begin to happen within days of moving into the modern suburban home. The horrors Keith and his girlfriend witnessed and desperately tried to fight off would end up putting them at odds with members of the paranormal community and themselves. This griping story, told from the house occupant point of view not only lists tales, but also includes pictures, video reenactments, commentary, and audio of the events being reported. Keith Linder does not ask that you believe him. He only asks that you listen. The Bothell Hell House has finally arrived ladies and gentlemen. The house that Zak Bagans and his team came to investigate (albeit for a short time) only to leave empty handed has come full circle. The house occupant tells his story. The complete story which includes why Zak and crew left empty handed. Spontaneous fire outbreaks and inexplicable wall writings are not the most horrific things that happened here. Something more sinister lurks. Robb Tilley of the Australian Institute of Parapsychology Research says "This case is right up there with the most frightening of poltergeist cases: the Enfield Poltergeist, the South Shields Poltergeist, the Bridgeport Connecticut case, and the Matthew Manning case; all well-researched and detailed in various books and documentaries over the years. The Bothell Hell House is a major work, a turning point in poltergeist research—Well done. "

      <title>Bothell Hell House - Part One (From Our Podcast Paranormal Fears)</title>
      <link>http://www.paranormalfears.com </link>
      <description>My special guest is Keith Linder here to discuss the extraordinary phenomena that he experienced after moving into a rental home with his girlfriend. Get his book The Bothell Hell House: Poltergeist of Washington State on Amazon. His youtube - https://youtu.be/DHp59_Lia3s True Haunted House story - 2012 Keith Linder after successfully obtaining a management position at a prestigious healthcare company decides the time is right for him and his girlfriend to move in together. That's putting things lightly. Weird things begin to happen within days of moving into the modern suburban home. The horrors Keith and his girlfriend witnessed and desperately tried to fight off would end up putting them at odds with members of the paranormal community and themselves. This griping story, told from the house occupant point of view not only lists tales, but also includes pictures, video reenactments, commentary, and audio of the events being reported. Keith Linder does not ask that you believe him. He only asks that you listen. The Bothell Hell House has finally arrived ladies and gentlemen. The house that Zak Bagans and his team came to investigate (albeit for a short time) only to leave empty handed has come full circle. The house occupant tells his story. The complete story which includes why Zak and crew left empty handed. Spontaneous fire outbreaks and inexplicable wall writings are not the most horrific things that happened here. Something more sinister lurks. Robb Tilley of the Australian Institute of Parapsychology Research says "This case is right up there with the most frightening of poltergeist cases: the Enfield Poltergeist, the South Shields Poltergeist, the Bridgeport Connecticut case, and the Matthew Manning case; all well-researched and detailed in various books and documentaries over the years. The Bothell Hell House is a major work, a turning point in poltergeist research—Well done. "

      <title>Inside The World of Corporate Spies</title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Robert Kerbeck who's here to discuss his book that details how he started down the path of becoming a wealthy corporate spy. Get his book Ruse: Lying the American Dream from Hollywood to Wall Street on Amazon.

“Kerbeck’s juicy memoir tells riveting tales [with] the thrill of a spy novel. . . Kerbeck bares all of his wild business secrets within the world of corporate espionage” —Foreword Reviews
"Robert Kerbeck has mastered the art of social engineering, or what he calls 'rusing', and taken it to a whole new level." —Frank Abagnale, author of Catch Me If You Can
B-list actor, A-list corporate spy
In the world of high finance, multibillion-dollar Wall Street banks greedily guard their secrets. Enter Robert Kerbeck, a working actor who made his real money lying on the phone, charming people into revealing their employers’ most valuable information. In this exhilarating memoir that will appeal to fans of The Wolf of Wall Street and Catch Me If You Can, unsuspecting receptionists, assistants, and bigshot executives all fall victim to “the Ruse.”
After college, Kerbeck rushed to New York to try to make it as an actor. But to support himself, he’d need a survival job, and before he knew it, while his pals were waiting tables, he began his apprenticeship as a corporate spy.
As his acting career started to take off, he found himself hobnobbing with Hollywood luminaries: drinking with Paul Newman, taking J.Lo to a Dodgers game, touring E.R. sets with George Clooney. He even worked with O.J. Simpson the week before he became America’s most notorious double murderer.
Before long, however, his once promising acting career slowed while the corporate espionage business took off. The ruse job was supposed to have been temporary, but Kerbeck became one of the world’s best practitioners of this deceptive—and illegal—trade. His income jumped from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars a year.
Until the inevitable crash….
Kerbeck shares the lies he told, the celebrities he screwed (and those who screwed him), the cons he ran, and the money he made—and lost—along the way.

      <title>One Giant Lie For Mankind: Faked Moon Landing</title>
      <link>http://www.mysteriousradio.com</link>
      <description>Tonight's guest is Bart Sibrel who's here to discuss his book Moon Man: Moon Man: The True Story of a Filmmaker on the CIA Hit List. Get it on Amazon.
Moon Man is Bart Sibrel’s revealing memoir recalling his harrowing journey investigating what really happened during America’s famous “Apollo” missions. It features truly hair-raising and life-threatening encounters with agents from the US government’s secret agencies. Sibrel’s memoir divulges, for the very first time, his real-life espionage adventures while uncovering one of the CIA’s greatest secrets, including Sibrel’s discovery of privately recorded audio of an Apollo astronaut plotting his assassination by the CIA, which would not be necessary if the Apollo missions were real.
Moon Man also exposes, for the very first time, the official CIA Code-Name for the real Apollo project, the military base where the first fake Moon landing was filmed, as well as the names of fifteen US government scientists and officials who were recorded in attendance for the first Moon landing falsification, some of whom are still alive today. This highly revealing information was provided to Sibrel by the Chief of Security of this secretive military base, who finally confessed his regrettable participation in this despicable government fraud on his deathbed.
Bart Sibrel is an award-winning filmmaker, writer, and investigative journalist, who has produced television programs and documentaries for over 35 years. He has been employed by two of the three major US networks, worked as a television news reporter, and has produced segments for ABC, NBC, and CBS. Sibrel regularly speaks as a guest commentator regarding the Moon landing fraud, and has appeared as such on NBC, FOX, CNN, and HBO to discuss his films A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon and Astronauts Gone Wild.
Bart Sibrel grew up as a devout supporter of the supposed Moon landings, yet over the years, gradually began to recognize their unfortunate falsification. In Sibrel’s mind, the claim that astronauts walked on the moon on the very first attempt with antiquated untried 1960s technology, when today with five decades of more advanced technology the US can only send astronauts one-thousandth the distance to the Moon, simply defies logic. Sibrel is convinced that until the Moon landing fraud is exposed, the governments of the world will continue deceiving the people under their care until their eventual demise.

      <title>Cemetery Stories: Haunted Graveyards, Embalming Secrets, and the Life of a Corpse After Death</title>
      <description>Special guest is author and forensic psychologist Katherine Ramsland here to discuss her book Cemetery Stories. Amass your book collection by adding this title right now from Amazon.
Never look at a grave the same way again
Admit it: You're fascinated by cemeteries. We all die, and for most of us, a cemetery is our final resting place. But how many people really know what goes on inside, around, and beyond them?
Enter the world of the dead as Katherine Ramsland talks to mortuary assistants, gravediggers, funeral home owners, and more, and find out about:

Stitching and cosmetic secrets used on mutilated bodies

Embalmers who do more than just embalm

The rising popularity of cremation art

Ghosts that infest graveyards everywhere

If you've ever scoffed at the high price of burying the dead, or ever wondered how your loved ones are handled when they die, or simply stared at tombstones with morbid fascination, then take a trip with Katherine Ramsland and learn about the booming industry -- and strange tales -- that surround cemeteries everywhere.

      <title>Necropolis London and It's Dead </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Author Catherine Arnold joins me for a fascinating conversation about the history of some of the most iconic graveyards and cemeteries in London. Get her book Necropolis London and It's Dead right now on Amazon.
Above, a city thriving with life. Beneath, a city filled with the dead. 

London. A vast, labyrinthine, ever-moving place that shimmers as the jewel of Britain. But what about beneath it? What of it's history? It's mishaps? It's dead? 

Catharine Arnold invites us on a gloriously macabre tour - across London's many graveyards, cemeteries and burial plots in a quest to discover whether what has departed can teach us anything about what is to come. It's an intriguing, occasionally dark, occasionally humorous journey that reaches right back to the Romans and concludes with the most recent display of mass public mourning: Princess Diana's funeral. 

Utilising archaeology, anthropology, anecdote and history, Arnold explores the presence of death in people's lives and the developments and changes in mourning and burial through two millennia. London's greatest disasters, including the Great Fire and the Black Plague, are explored and analysed for their massive impacts on both the population and the change in the disposal of the dead, while the unusual resting places of several thousand Londoners are highlighted and studied, as a means of examining growth and city development. Implicitly entwined with the passing of generations is the transformation of an entire population; where and how people live, where and how they die, and where their children move on to. Arnold marvellously celebrates the possibilities of living in a city as large as London and sensitively demonstrates how much modern citizens owe to their ancestors. 

Filled with beautiful details, such as the reason we wear black to funerals (Romans believed the colour made mourners invisible to vengeful spirits), and in an optimistic and respectful voice, Arnold brings us a unique history of one of the world's greatest cities - built atop centuries of history and still rising to this day. If you've ever wondered where the sweet hereafter might be, then look no further - Arnold shows us beautifully how even in a city as massive as London, the dead never really leave us.

      <title>Halloween Nation: Behind the Scenes of America’s Fright Night 2nd Edition (Haunted America)</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is author Lesley Pratt Bannatyne who's here to discuss Halloween and the holiday phenomena that it has become over the years.

America's leading authority on Halloween presents interviews with spooky rock groups, amateur vampires, haunted house creators, champion pumpkin carvers, and more, all in the quest of explaining the nation's unique love affair with this holiday. The collection of essays and interviews explores the pop culture phenomenon that is Halloween, and why we celebrate it the way we do today.

      <title>Corrupt Bodies - Death and Dirty Dealing In A London Morgue </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Peter Everett is my special guest here to discuss the shocking corruption he uncovered in a London morgue. Get his book Corrupt Bodies on Amazon.
In 1985, Peter Everett landed the job as Superintendent of Southwark Mortuary. In just six years he’d gone from lowly assistant to running the UK’s busiest murder morgue. He couldn’t believe his luck.  
What he didn’t know was that Southwark, operating in near-Victorian conditions, was a hotbed of corruption. Attendants stole from the dead, funeral homes paid bribes, and there was a lively trade in stolen body parts and recycled coffins.  
Set in the fascinating pre-DNA and psychological profiling years of 1985–87, this memoir tells a gripping and gruesome tale, with a unique insight into a world of death most of us don’t ever see. Peter managed pathologists, oversaw post mortems and worked alongside Scotland Yard’s Murder Squad – including on the case of the serial killer, the Stockwell Strangler.  
This is a thrilling tale of murder and corruption in the mid-1980s, told with insight and compassion.

      <title>Crystal Healing for the Heart: Gemstone Therapy for Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual Well-Being</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Originally recorded in 2018. Special guest Nicolas Pearson is here to discuss how crystals can promote physical and emotional healing.
A gemstone-supported healing journey guided by your heart 

• Offers hands-on exercises and meditations with more than 60 gemstones and minerals, each a specific heart-healing stone 

• Explores the anatomy of the physical heart and its spiritual symbolism 

• Shows how your heart is itself a sensory organ and coordinator of your energy field 

• Explains how to fortify your heart with emotional strength, reclaim your will, cultivate forgiveness, and nurture romantic relationships in a meaningful way 

The word heart can be used in so many different ways. We talk about putting our hearts into our work and wearing our hearts on our sleeves. There are people who are warmhearted and those willing to heal your heartache. Each of us has likely known the pangs of conflict between the head and heart. For all the trials and pains of daily living, many people are taught to distance themselves from their hearts in order to avoid folly and failure. The truth is that only in embracing the language of the heart can we truly know who we are and where we are going. 

Focusing on the role of crystals in the journey to wholeheartedness, Nicholas Pearson reveals how the heart, as the literal and metaphorical center of one’s being, has the power to lead us to greater balance, healing, and happiness. He explores the anatomy of the physical heart and its spiritual symbolism and shows how its four chambers are related to the four elements. Offering hands-on exercises and meditations with more than 60 gemstones and minerals, each a specific heart-healing stone, the author explains how to build a better relationship with the heart as your spiritual center as well as how to fortify your heart with emotional strength, reclaim your will, and cultivate forgiveness. He shows how your heart is the coordinator of your energy field and is itself a sensory organ and information processor, working to enact healing on many levels. He also looks at the heart chakra and how the higher heart chakra is evolving. 

Providing stone-supported lessons for applying a heart-centered approach in daily life, from expressing yourself to nurturing romantic relationships in a meaningful way, the author shows how the journey to wholeness and wholeheartedness isn’t always easy, but it cannot be undertaken without first spending time to hear the soft, gentle voice of your heart and embrace the transformational force of inner alchemy known as love.

      <title>Sex Weird-O-Pedia: Shocking, Scandalous, and Incredibly Bizarre Sex Facts</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is author Ross Benes who's here to discuss all the weirdness when it comes to sex in our world. Get his book Sex Weird-O-Pedia on Amazon. 

Sex is the ultimate multidisciplinary subject, and it cannot be confined to a single facet of life. Through a series of amusing tidbits, Sex Weird-o-Pedia will walk you through how sex affects our technologies, economics, politics, religions, and cultures, as well as some strange sex facts that, for better or for worse, will make your conversations memorable to everyone at the party. 

Bizarre facts include: 

Which animal species engage in necrophilia 

Who has done it in outer space 

Why premature ejaculation has evolutionary advantages 

How masturbation led to the invention of cereal 

And more! 



Knowing that Calvin Klein cologne turns tigers on probably won’t help you get laid, but it could prove useful if you’re in a conversation needing some pizzazz—or you find yourself in mixed company with a bunch of large cats.

      <title>Back to the Beyond: Exploring Near-Death Experiences Through Hypnosis</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is Adam Dince here to discuss amazing near-death experiences that many wish they hadn't come from. Get his book Back to the Beyond: Exploring Near-Death Experiences Through Hypnosis on Amazon.


"Brilliant and compelling insights. Adam's stunning research [of] hypnotic regression with near-death experiencers [is] a noteworthy contribution to what happens to us after our physical body dies."
-Anita Moorjani, New York Times bestselling author of Dying to Be Me and What If This is Heaven?
What happens after you die? Is there an afterlife? How can I find peace in my fear of death, or comfort after I've lost a loved one?
After the tragic death of his father, Adam Dince wrestled with these questions for years. In search of answers, he began to research stories of those who had near-death experiences-people who briefly died but came back to life. 
These brilliant accounts filled Adam with hope that we live on long after our bodies do.
Today, Adam is a certified hypnotherapist who specializes in past life regression, along with regressing clients back to memories and experiences in their "life between lives."
In Back to the Beyond, discover: 

seven stunning firsthand accounts of near-death experiences, 

the science behind the new hypnotherapy modality, near-death experience (NDE) regression, and

what the multidimensional aspects of the mind can teach us about consciousness and other realms.

Fans of After by Dr. Bruce Greyson will appreciate this secular approach to a spiritual question-and the transformational lessons it provides.
What awaits us after physical death is both perfect and beautiful. And what people who have gone back to the beyond can tell you-is that it's all about love.
"A beautifully written primer on NDE's and out-of-body experiences for the well-seasoned veteran, and novice alike. The topic of the physical death can be mystifying and sometimes scary, but this book addresses [it] with humility, grace, and an open heart."
-Elias Druckman MD, DC DACNB

        <![CDATA[<p>Tonight, my special guest is Adam Dince here to discuss amazing near-death experiences that many wish they hadn't come from. Get his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Back-Beyond-Exploring-Near-Death-Experiences/dp/1634894871/ref=sr_1_1?crid=KTETYO99AANT&amp;keywords=Adam+dince&amp;qid=1656382352&amp;sprefix=adam+dince%2Caps%2C83&amp;sr=8-1">Back to the Beyond: Exploring Near-Death Experiences Through Hypnosis on Amazon.</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>"Brilliant and compelling insights. Adam's stunning research [of] hypnotic regression with near-death experiencers [is] a noteworthy contribution to what happens to us after our physical body dies."</strong></p><p><strong>-Anita Moorjani, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Dying to Be Me</em> and <em>What If This is Heaven?</em></strong></p><p>What happens after you die? Is there an afterlife? How can I find peace in my fear of death, or comfort after I've lost a loved one?</p><p>After the tragic death of his father, Adam Dince wrestled with these questions for years. In search of answers, he began to research stories of those who had near-death experiences-people who briefly died but came back to life. </p><p>These brilliant accounts filled Adam with hope that we live on long after our bodies do.</p><p>Today, Adam is a certified hypnotherapist who specializes in past life regression, along with regressing clients back to memories and experiences in their "life between lives."</p><p>In Back to the Beyond, discover: </p><ul>
<li>seven stunning firsthand accounts of near-death experiences, </li>
<li>the science behind the new hypnotherapy modality, near-death experience (NDE) regression, and</li>
<li>what the multidimensional aspects of the mind can teach us about consciousness and other realms.</li>
</ul><p>Fans of After by Dr. Bruce Greyson will appreciate this secular approach to a spiritual question-and the transformational lessons it provides.</p><p>What awaits us after physical death is both perfect and beautiful. And what people who have gone back to the beyond can tell you-is that it's all about love.</p><p><strong>"A beautifully written primer on NDE's and out-of-body experiences for the well-seasoned veteran, and novice alike. The topic of the physical death can be mystifying and sometimes scary, but this book addresses [it] with humility, grace, and an open heart."</strong></p><p><strong>-Elias Druckman MD, DC DACNB</strong></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://themysteriousradiocollective.mn.co/"><strong>Request To Join Our Private Community </strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>﻿Wanna get creeped out?

      <title>The True Story of Danny Rolling, the Gainesville Ripper (Originally Released in 2018)</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Author J.T. Hunter joins me to discuss one of the most vicious serial killers in recent history. Get his book on Amazon.
Ambitious, attractive, and full of potential, five young college students prepared for the new semester. They dreamed of beginning careers and starting families. They had a lifetime of experiences in front of them. But death came without warning in the dark of the night. Brutally ending five promising lives, leaving behind three gruesome crime scenes, the Gainesville Ripper terrorized the University of Florida, casting an ominous shadow across a frightened college town. What evil lurked inside him? What demons drove him to kill? What made him "A Monster of All Time"?

      <description>My special guest is author Bruce Jenvey who's here to discuss the little known stories and haunted history around the Great Lakes. Get his book Heros and Haunts of he Great Lakes on Amazon.

For ten years, Bruce Jenvey explored the Great Lakes as a journalist for Great Lakes Cruiser Magazine. Along the way, he collected stories of the little-known heroes and in some cases, forgotten history that helped shape the two nations that share this famed waterway. Here is a handpicked collection of Bruce’s favorite stories from his travels, stories of inspiration, ingenious innovation and valiant courage against all odds. These are the stories of The Cable, Albert Ocha, The Great Farini, The Battle of Lake Erie, The Lorain Tornado and more. Here are tales of humor and lessons learned like The Wreck Of The Gunilda and The Day Dave Bombed Detroit. There are legends, too, such as The Maid Of The Mist and Nanabosho, The Sleeping Giant, as well as the haunting at The Olde Angel Inn and The Ghosts Of Fort George. Here are over forty such stories in total that will surprise you, thrill you, and become part of your own Great Lakes Heritage…

      <description>My special guest is Elizabeth April who's here to discuss her book You're Not Dying, You're Just Waking Up. Get it now on Amazon.

There’s a reason you were drawn to this audiobook. Maybe you’re dissatisfied with what you’ve been told you “should be”. Maybe you know there’s something bigger out there, waiting for you, but the people in your life just don’t understand. Maybe you feel crazy or alone, like part of you is dying. You’re not dying. You’re just waking up. Even if you have seen my content before, it's time to strap in and hold on tight because this is not your average text. It’s your soul’s reminder of how powerful you are, and of how much you already know! Stop living your life in safety and stagnation. Stop making choices through obligation and attachment. Step up, live your life to the fullest.
You are ready, and the world is waiting.

      <title>(Part Two) Are Alien Races Abducting, Eating and Taking Some Humans Off Planet? </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>This is part two with special guest Elena Danaan is here to discuss her shocking book A Gift From The Stars: Extraterrestrial Contacts and Guide of Alien Races. 
This is the true story of an abduction and a rescue by benevolent extraterrestrials, various direct contacts Elena Danaan had throughout the years with UFOs and visitors from other worlds. This book includes as well an illustrated descriptive of 110 different alien races involved with our planet, detailed information about groups and alliances in this galaxy and precious information, as well as a map of the sky with locations of alien life. This book contains also beautiful messages of hope for humanity. This book has been expected for a long time. It brings support and understanding to all those who have been through the ordeal of alien abduction, answering many questions. Born in France, Elena Danaan graduated in Fine Arts in Paris and completed a Post-Grad in Archaeology at the Louvre University. She worked as field Archaeologist twenty years of her life, among which eight years in Egypt as an engineer epigraphist for the CNRS (Karnak, Luxor, Cairo, Dendera and Valley of the Kings) before returning to France, assigned to the University of Toulouse. Completing studies in Druidry, Shamanism, energy and sound healing, she is actually working as a spiritual practitioner.

      <title>True Story of Contact with an Ancient Alien - Part One</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is Dr. Bruce Solheim who's here to discuss his years of contact with an Ancient Alien Mystic detailed in his new book Anzar the Progenitor. 

Anzar is an ancient alien mystic whom I have known most of my life and have been in weekly direct contact with since 2018. Anzar the Progenitor documents my spirit communication with this ancient alien, including his prophecies, sage advice, and commentary on the world. The book has extensive endnotes and includes my research on the nature of this communication through mediumship and my theory of how the alien world, the spirit world, and the quantum world are the same—a quantum nexus. We can no longer wait for government disclosure about UFOs and aliens. The time has come for personal revelation through a leap of consciousness in a new Era of Reconversion. We are all related and we are the aliens.

      <title>A Psychic Medium Discusses Remote Viewing, Homicide Cases, Messages From The Dead And More</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Special guest Marla Frees sits down to discuss her newly released memoir American Psychic: A Spiritual Journey from the Heartland to Hollywood, Heaven, and Beyond and extraordinary abilities that many others don't possess.
In this best-selling memoir, Marla Frees reveals her extraordinary life journey from a small-town girl in a troubled family to a stage and TV actress and ultimately one of the country’s most respected transformational psychic mediums. Her tales of a harrowing childhood, burgeoning career in Hollywood, and astounding psychic and spiritual adventures along the way reveal the resilience and heights of the human spirit. U.S. military psychic spies, homicide cases, messages from the other side, spiritual healing - Marla Frees was given a gift from “Spirit” that she uses to help others.
In this audio edition, Marla delivers her narrative as only she can, reliving all the drama and humor of her life in her inimitable, dynamic voice. In a story that acclaimed author Brian Weiss, MD (Many Lives Many Masters) calls “powerful and fascinating,” Marla takes us into realms that will astonish, inspire - and heal.

      <title>Is There Really Nothing After Death?</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Author Matthew Alper joins me to discuss his book The "God" Part of the Brain and why and how humanity came to believe in the myth that an afterlife exists. Get his book on Amazon. 
Is Man the product of a God...or is "God" the product of human evolution? 
From the dawn of our species, every human culture―no matter how isolated―has believed in some form of a spiritual realm. According to author Matthew Alper, this is no mere coincidence but rather due to the fact that humans, as a species, are genetically predisposed to believe in the universal concepts of a god, a soul and an afterlife. This instinct to believe is the result of an evolutionary adaptation―a coping mechanism―that emerged in our species to help us survive our unique and otherwise debilitating awareness of death.
Spiritual seekers and atheists alike will be compelled and transformed by Matthew Alper's classic study of science and religion. The 'God' Part of the Brain has gained critical acclaim from some of the world's leading scientists, secular humanists, and theologians, and is as a must read for anyone who has pondered the question of God's existence, as well as the meaning of our own.
Praise for The "God" Part of the Brain
"This cult classic in many ways parallels Rene Descartes' search for reliable and certain knowledge...Drawing on such disciplines as philosophy, psychology, and biology, Alper argues that belief in a spiritual realm is an evolutionary coping method that developed to help humankind deal with the fear of death...Highly recommended."― Library Journal
"I very much enjoyed the account of your spiritual journey and believe it would make excellent reading for every college student - the resultant residence-hall debates would be the best part of their education. It often occurs to me that if, against all odds, there is a judgmental God and heaven, it will come to pass that when the pearly gates open, those who had the valor to think for themselves will be escorted to the head of the line, garlanded, and given their own personal audience." ― Edward O. Wilson, two-time Pulitzer Prize-Winner
"This is an essential book for those in search of a scientific understanding of man's spiritual nature. Matthew Alper navigates the reader through a labyrinth of intriguing questions and then offers undoubtedly clear answers that lead to a better understanding of our objective reality." ― Elena Rusyn, MD, PhD; Gray Laboratory; Harvard Medical School
"What a wonderful book you have written. It was not only brilliant and provocative but also revolutionary in its approach to spirituality as an inherited trait."― Arnold Sadwin, MD, former chief of Neuropsychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania
"A lively manifesto...For the discipline's specific application to the matter at hand, I've seen nothing that matches the fury of The 'God' Part of the Brain, which perhaps explains why it's earned something of a cult following." ― Salon.com

      <title>UFOs and the Extraterrestrial Message</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/ufos-and-the-extraterrestrial-message/</link>
      <description>Special guest returning to the show is Dr. Richard Lawrence here to discuss his book UFOs and the Extraterrestrial Message. 
Visit Dr. George King's Website
Spiritual investigator Richard Lawrence looks at the evidence for extraterrestrial contact and attempts to explain why aliens are so interested in us. In this unique investigation of cosmic communication, Richard Lawrence presents the evidence for extraterrestrial contact in a whole new light, examining how these benign beings might offer humanity a rare opportunity for spiritual evolution. From creation myths and the big UFO theories to little-known eyewitness accounts, X-file exposes and his fascinating personal experience of alien contact, Richard also looks at channelled messages from alien beings - and reveals how these messages hold the key to our own cosmic intelligence. Enlightening and controversial, he answers many of our questions about aliens but reveals, too, that understanding the greater universe can be part of our own journey towards higher consciousness in our everyday lives.Richard Lawrence is an award-winning author. He has written extensively on guardian angels, prayer, meditation and many other aspects of personal development and empowerment. A world-renowned UFO expert and spiritual investigator, Richard was the first to bring declassified CIA and Pentagon UFO files to Britain in 1980. He is a popular broadcaster and is the author of Prayer Energy (CICO Books), the award-winning Gods, Guides and Guardian Angels and many more.

      <title>Couples That Kill</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/couples-that-kill/</link>
      <description>Special guest Mitzi Szereto joins me to discuss her new book based on true crimes committed by couples. Get her book on Amazon.
A true crime anthology exploring the dangerous side of romance—with couples who bonded over murder, mayhem and more.

What brings criminal couples together? And what drives them apart? This volume of The Best New True Crime Stories attempts to answer these questions with a deep dive into true tales of lawless love. Everyone’s heard of Bonnie and Clyde, but the annals of crime history are full of dysfunctional duos whose deadly escapades are equally enthralling.

Featuring contributions from an international list of award-winning crime writers, journalists, and experts in the dark crimes field, The Best New True Crime Stories: Partners in Crime is a must-read for any true crime afficionado. Because when love goes wrong, there’s never a dull moment.

      <title>Woke, The Spiritual Awakening of a 9/11 Rescue &amp; Recovery Worker</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/woke-the-spiritual-awakening-of-a-911-rescue-recovery-worker/</link>
      <description>Special guest Tony Losito joins me to discuss his book Woke, The Spiritual Awakening of a 9/11 Rescue &amp; Recovery Worker. 
On this 20th Anniversary of 9/11, Anthony “Tony” M. Losito, a US Special Agent who responded to the attacks on the World Trade Center, breaks his silence and describes the events of that horrific day. 

Only that day would change Tony’s life in ways he never expected.

“Woke” is the chronicle of Tony’s spiritual awakening and how a near death experience, the attacks of 9/11, and other key events impacted his life and spiritual journey.

Following 9/11 Tony began to see specific repeating number sequences and angelic signs. He would later come to know these special number combinations as “Angel Numbers”. It took time, but through various methods, he decoded these angelic communications and began to understand their divine messages.

“I receive divine messages from the Angelic realm, and I have been asked to share them with the world.”

A very personal mission and journey was assigned to Tony from the highest office in the land, and now Tony shares that message with you.

Join this 25-year law enforcement and military veteran as he shares his experiences with well-know evidential medium Steve Spur, the "Cowboy Psychic", and his personal conversation with best selling Irish author of "Angels in My Hair", and renown peace ambassador Lorna Byrne, and takes you through his very personal spiritual transformation to deliver a message of hope, faith, love, and unity to the world.

It will inspire you on your spiritual journey and bring you closer to your Guardian Angel.

      <title>Secrets of Megalithic America </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/secrets-of-megalithic-america-1/</link>
      <description>Special guest Glen Kreisburg joins me to discuss his book Spirits in Stone.

A ground-breaking study of ceremonial stone landscapes in Northeast America and their relationship to other sites around the world 

• Features a comprehensive field guide to hundreds of megalithic stone structures in northeastern America, including cairns, perched boulders, and effigies 

• Details the Wall of Manitou, the Hammonasset Line, landscape astronomy along the Hudson River, and a several-acre area in Woodstock, NY, with large, carefully constructed lithic formations 

• Analyzes the archaeoastronomy, archaeoacoustics, and symbolism of these sites to reveal their relationships to other ceremonial stone sites across America and the world 

Presenting a comprehensive field guide to hundreds of lost, forgotten, and misidentified megalithic stone structures in northeastern America, Glenn Kreisberg documents many enigmatic formations still standing across the Catskill Mountain and Hudson Valley region, complete with functioning solstice and equinox alignments. 

Kreisberg provides a first-person description of the “Wall of the Manitou,” which runs for 10 miles along the eastern slopes of the Catskill Mountains, as well as narratives about related sites that include animal effigies, reproductive organs, calendar stones, enigmatic inscriptions, and evidence of alignments. Using computer software, he plots the trajectory of the Hammonasset Line, which begins at a burial complex near the tip of Long Island and runs to Devil’s Tombstone in Greene County, New York. He shows how the line runs at the same angle that marks the summer solstice sunset from Montauk Point on Long Island, and, when extended, intersects the ancient copper mines of Isle Royal in Upper Michigan. He documents a several-acre area on Overlook Mountain in Woodstock, New York, with a grouping of very large, carefully constructed lithic formations that together create a serpent or snake figure, mirroring the constellation Draco. He demonstrates how this site is related to the Serpent Mount in Ohio and Ankor Wat in Cambodia and reveals how all of the vast, interlocking sites in the Northeast were part of an ancient spiritual landscape based on a sophisticated understanding of the cosmos, as practiced by ancient Native Americans. 

While modern historians consider these sites to be colonial era constructions, Kreisberg reveals how they were used to communicate with the spirit world and may be remnants of a long-vanished civilization.

      <title>South Carolina State Hospital </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/south-carolina-state-hospital/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is author William Bechheit who's here to discuss South Carolina's Lunatic Asylum founded in 1821.
Nearly two decades after it closed, the South Carolina State Hospital continues to hold a palpable mystique in Columbia and throughout the state. Founded in 1821 as the South Carolina Lunatic Asylum, it housed, fed, and treated thousands of patients incapable of surviving on their own. The patient population in 1961 eclipsed 6,600, well above its listed capacity of 4,823, despite an operating budget that ranked 45th out of the 48 states with such large public hospitals. By the mid-1990s, the patient population had fallen under 700, and the hospital had become a symbol of captivity, horror, and chaos. Author William Buchheit details this history through the words and interviews of those who worked on the iconic campus.

      <title>Diary of a Deputy Coroner </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/diary-of-a-deputy-coroner/</link>
      <description>My special guest is Donna Francart who's here to discuss her shocking experiences as a Deputy Coroner and the spirits that started to appear in her home. Get her book I've Seen Dead People: Diary of a Deputy Coroner on Amazon right now.

      <title>The Safety Trap: A Security Expert's Secrets for Staying Safe in a Dangerous World</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/the-safety-trap-a-security-experts-secrets-for-staying-safe-in-a-dangerous-world/</link>
      <description>My special guest is author and security expert Spencer Coursen here to discuss why we must take responsibility for our own personal safety. Get his book Safety Trap: A Security Expert's Secrets for Staying Safe in a Dangerous World on Amazon.
Threat management expert Spencer Coursen offers proactive strategies to protect yourself and your loved ones in the event of hostile encounters and emergency situations in The Safety Trap: A Security Expert’s Secrets for Staying Safe in a Dangerous World. 
Despite what the news and social media would have you believe, we have never lived in a safer time than we are now. Unfortunately, we live under a false sense of security enforced by authorities that only alleviates fears without reducing risk. We have placed our personal safety, and our responsibilities of guarding it, into the hands of people trained only to respond to crises, not actively prevent them. Our blind faith in institutions to protect us has only dulled our natural survival instincts. 
The truth is that when we feel safest is actually when we are in the most danger. This is the paradox of The Safety Trap. 
When you don’t expect danger, you simply fail to see the signs that something bad is about to happen. But the signs are always there, and staying safe is about training yourself to see them. In easy-to-implement methods of maintaining vigilance, assessing risk, and taking preventative measures, you’ll discover how to be alert without anxiety and know how to best protect and defend yourself on the job, in school, in public places, at home, and online.   
With Coursen’s simple formula of Awareness + Preparation = Safety as your guide - as well as real world examples of managing threats - you will learn how to develop the skills and confidence to reclaim your own security and avoid The Safety Trap.

      <title>Forensics - The Science Behind The Deaths Of Famous People </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/forensics-the-science-behind-the-deaths-of-famous-people/</link>
      <description>Many famous people have died under mysterious circumstances. Tonight, my special guest is Dr. Harry Milman here to discuss the deaths of Carrie Fisher, Michael Jackson, Brittany Murphy, Heath Ledger and Prince. Get his book FORENSICS: The Science behind the Deaths of Famous People on Amazon.

Carrie Fisher, also known as Princess Leia from Star Wars, had been abusing cocaine and other pharmaceuticals for many years, so when it was announced that she died from sleep apnea, I was skeptical. A more plausible explanation would have been that she died from a drug overdose. A review of the medical examiner's report revealed that the Fisher family refused to give permission for an autopsy and toxicology tests to be done. Constrained by these limitations, the coroner labeled the manner of death "undetermined". FORENSICS: The Science behind the Deaths of Famous People is an analysis and description of how coroners determine the cause and manner of death. An investigation of twenty-three deaths of famous people was conducted based on a review of publicly available autopsy and toxicology reports, as well as published scientific and lay articles. Drug use was implicated in 70 percent of the deaths. Four celebrity deaths were the result of suicide or homicide. Four others were from natural causes.

      <title>Introducing: Paranormal Fears</title>
      <description>Follow our newly launched ALL PARANORMAL podcast called 'Paranormal Fears'. Paranormal Fears is a new podcast that conducts in-depth interviews about true hauntings that have scared the living daylights out of those that have experienced them. People that experience hauntings, if not ready for it, will have their sanity tested to the fullest. Some are lucky enough to find help when facing the malevolent actions of a house or something that seems sentient and downright angry. Then you have others that can't find help and being too frighten to even sleep, become mentally fragile with nowhere to go. While spirits and entities are not on our plane of existence, some of them still claim our dwellings as their own. The only question is....are YOU in one?

      <title>Ghosts of Whitby </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/ghosts-of-whitby-from-the-archives/</link>

A collection of twenty two supernatural tales about the old seaport of Whitby on England's beautiful and mysterious North East Coast.

Stories include tales about ghosts, vampires, the fairy folk and ancient customs and superstitions, all of which paint a suitably spectral sketch of the ghostly goings on in this famous old town over the centuries.

The origins of creatures and spectres from the imaginations of Bram Stoker and Wilkie Collins feature in this book, put together by the former Collector of Dues of Whitby Harbour, Paul McDermott. He was able to prise some spectral gems and first hand reports from the citizens and old salts he dealt with at the harbour on a day-to-day basis.

Also included is the research he carried out on some of the more ancient tales of this one time Viking, Norman and in particular, eighteenth Century ship building port, these carried out in the famous and fascinating archives of The Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society, of which he was a member.

      <title>Werewolf Killer: The True Story of a Russian Cop turned Serial Killer </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is author C.L Swinney who's here to discuss one of the most prolific serial killers in Russian history.
Mikhail Popkov seemed to live the perfect life. Beautiful family, rewarding career, admiration and respect of the entire police force he worked with. Yet underneath, he had a deadly secret no one would ever believe...he moonlighted as a serial killer. His family and co-workers doubted his guilt in the beginning, but when he confessed to the crimes and led the police to his many dumping sites, they were horrified. In an effort to avoid Black Dolphin, Russia’s most feared prison, Popkov continued to list names and locations of more and more victims. When his kill count climbed above 81 souls, everyone wondered what could have caused this seemingly ordinary man to snap, carry out a never-before-seen reign of terror on the people of Russia, and turn into the worse serial killer in Russian history.

Death is the beginning of life. Or, more accurately, is death just the beginning of a richer, fuller and more fulfilling life? Is what we label death just a precursor to a life that really begins once someone makes the transition from this physical world to – what, where or even when? The what, where, when and even some of the how are answered in the pages of this book. The who you know already and the why is left up to you and your relationship with the Great Mystery. Consider, then, this book a general roadmap to a journey we will all be taking. You have the ability to explore the territory in greater detail yourself. One of the goals of this book is to encourage readers to go deeper into those topics on their own. Pendulum dowsing is just one of many tools available to converse with the spirit realm. Discover what you can of the undiscovered country. And fear not, for when you actually do get there, you’ll see - death is just the beginning of life.

      <title>Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is author Bill Schutt here to discuss the history of cannibalism as it naturally occurs in different lifeforms on the planet. Get his book Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History on Amazon.

“Surprising. Impressive.  Cannibalism restores my faith in humanity.” —Sy Montgomery, The New York Times Book Review

For centuries scientists have written off cannibalism as a bizarre phenomenon with little biological significance. Its presence in nature was dismissed as a desperate response to starvation or other life-threatening circumstances, and few spent time studying it. A taboo subject in our culture, the behavior was portrayed mostly through horror movies or tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life flesh-eaters. But the true nature of cannibalism--the role it plays in evolution as well as human history--is even more intriguing (and more normal) than the misconceptions we’ve come to accept as fact.

In Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History,zoologist Bill Schutt sets the record straight, debunking common myths and investigating our new understanding of cannibalism’s role in biology, anthropology, and history in the most fascinating account yet written on this complex topic. Schutt takes readers from Arizona’s Chiricahua Mountains, where he wades through ponds full of tadpoles devouring their siblings, to the Sierra Nevadas, where he joins researchers who are shedding new light on what happened to the Donner Party--the most infamous episode of cannibalism in American history. He even meets with an expert on the preparation and consumption of human placenta (and, yes, it goes well with Chianti).

Bringing together the latest cutting-edge science, Schutt answers questions such as why some amphibians consume their mother’s skin; why certain insects bite the heads off their partners after sex; why, up until the end of the twentieth century, Europeans regularly ate human body parts as medical curatives; and how cannibalism might be linked to the extinction of the Neanderthals. He takes us into the future as well, investigating whether, as climate change causes famine, disease, and overcrowding, we may see more outbreaks of cannibalism in many more species--including our own.

Cannibalism places a perfectly natural occurrence into a vital new context and invites us to explore why it both enthralls and repels us.

      <title>Evidence of Extraterrestrial Visitation to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and Beyond </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is Raymond Szymanski to discuss his knowledge of alien visitation to military installations including the Wright-Patterson where he worked for many years. Get his book 50 Shades of Greys on Amazon.

-- Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Insider Investigation Reveals Exciting New Evidence and Theories -- Nick Pope, UK Ministry of Defense UFO Project, 1991 – 1994, Author of Encounter in Rendlesham Forest, excitedly states: “Fifty Shades of Greys is a fun and informative book that is part UFO exposé and part travel guide. Written in a gonzo style, Raymond Szymanski tours the world, researching iconic UFO sightings and meeting a colorful cast of witnesses, experts and enthusiasts along the way. The author's four-decade career as an Engineer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (where many believe crashed alien spaceships are stored), and his exciting new evidence will doubtless start a few conspiracy theories.” For the very first time, an executive-level Wright-Patterson Air Force Base scientist takes you on a dangerous personal search for evidence of alien visitation inside the legendary, super-secret Department of Defense installation and beyond. Unconvinced by third-person stories rewarmed in “shadow-government-conspiracy UFO books”, Raymond Szymanski presents compelling, first-person UFO research adventures and discoveries - balanced between the very serious and sometimes not-so-serious misadventures. Raymond researched many Department of Defense scientific mysteries in his distinguished career. Now armed with insider information, he’s researching the most polarizing scientific mystery-of-the-century: “Do we have Aliens?” During this life-changing journey he discovers and examines evidence of alien visitation and strong hints that, contrary to widely published reports, Air Force senior scientists may not be unanimously laughing off UFOs after all. Join Raymond’s exciting, thought provoking adventures: - In the United Kingdom’s UFO-infested Rendlesham Forest; - With Travis Walton at the secretive Walton abduction site in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest; - And inside the Holy Grail itself, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. An alien visitation investigation, cloaked in mystery, wrapped in an adventure story, illustrated by more than one hundred never-before-published photographs, will be enjoyed by adventurists, enthusiasts, researchers, and conspiracy theorists alike.

-- Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Insider Investigation Reveals Exciting New Evidence and Theories -- Nick Pope, UK Ministry of Defense UFO Project, 1991 – 1994, Author of Encounter in Rendlesham Forest, excitedly states: “Fifty Shades of Greys is a fun and informative book that is part UFO exposé and part travel guide. Written in a gonzo style, Raymond Szymanski tours the world, researching iconic UFO sightings and meeting a colorful cast of witnesses, experts and enthusiasts along the way. The author's four-decade career as an Engineer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (where many believe crashed alien spaceships are stored), and his exciting new evidence will doubtless start a few conspiracy theories.” For the very first time, an executive-level Wright-Patterson Air Force Base scientist takes you on a dangerous personal search for evidence of alien visitation inside the legendary, super-secret Department of Defense installation and beyond. Unconvinced by third-person stories rewarmed in “shadow-government-conspiracy UFO books”, Raymond Szymanski presents compelling, first-person UFO research adventures and discoveries - balanced between the very serious and sometimes not-so-serious misadventures. Raymond researched many Department of Defense scientific mysteries in his distinguished career. Now armed with insider information, he’s researching the most polarizing scientific mystery-of-the-century: “Do we have Aliens?” During this life-changing journey he discovers and examines evidence of alien visitation and strong hints that, contrary to widely published reports, Air Force senior scientists may not be unanimously laughing off UFOs after all. Join Raymond’s exciting, thought provoking adventures: - In the United Kingdom’s UFO-infested Rendlesham Forest; - With Travis Walton at the secretive Walton abduction site in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest; - And inside the Holy Grail itself, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. An alien visitation investigation, cloaked in mystery, wrapped in an adventure story, illustrated by more than one hundred never-before-published photographs, will be enjoyed by adventurists, enthusiasts, researchers, and conspiracy theorists alike.

      <title>Shot Down: The true story of pilot Howard Snyder and the crew of the B-17 Susan Ruth</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is author Steve Snyder who's here to discuss his book Shot Down that details his father's amazing survival after being shot down by German fighters during WWII. Get his book Shot Down: The true story of pilot Howard Snyder and the crew of the B-17 Susan Ruth on Amazon.
Winner of 20 national book awards, SHOT DOWN is set within the framework of World War II in Europe and recounts the dramatic experiences of each member of a ten man B-17 bomber crew after their plane, piloted by the author's father, was knocked out of the sky by German fighters over the French/Belgian border on February 8,1944.
Some men died. Some were captured and became prisoners of war. Some men evaded capture and were missing in action for months before making it back to England. Their individual stories and those of the courageous Belgian people who risked their lives to help them are all different and are all remarkable. 
Even before the dramatic battle in the air and the subsequent harrowing events on the ground, the story is informative, insightful, and captivating. Prior to the fateful event, the book covers the crew's training, their journey to England, what life was like on base as well as in London and the English countryside, and the perils of flying combat missions over occupied Europe and Germany. 
Through personal letters, oral and written accounts, declassified military documents, and interviews - all from people who took part in the events that happened over 70 years ago (even the German Luftwaffe pilot who shot down the Susan Ruth) - the stories come alive. Adding to the feeling of "being there", are more than 200 time period photographs interspersed throughout the book.
To add background and context, many historical facts and anecdotes about and surrounding World War II are entwined throughout the book so that the reader has a feel for and understanding of what was occurring on a broader scale. SHOT DOWN is an account about brave individuals, featuring pilot Howard Snyder, set within the compelling events of the greatest conflict in world history.

      <title>Murder At Blue Sea Cottage</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is author James Stewart here to discuss the murder of a 20-year old dancer in the 1920's that turned into one of the most sensationalized trials in San Diego's history. Get his book Murder at Blue Sea Cottage on Amazon.
Set in Jazz Age San Diego against the backdrop of yellow journalism, notorious Hollywood scandals, Prohibition corruption, and a lively culture war, Mystery at the Blue Sea Cottage tells the intriguing true-crime story of a beautiful dancer, a playboy actor, and a debonair doctor.
In January 1923, 20-year-old Fritzie Mann left home for a remote cottage by the sea to meet a man whose identity she had revealed to no one. The next morning, the barely clad body of the beautiful and bewitching dancer washed up on lonely Torrey Pines beach, her party dress and possessions strewn about on the sand.
The scene baffled investigators. Was it suicide, murder, or an accidental drowning? A botched autopsy created more questions than it answered. However, the investigation revealed a scandalous secret and, possibly, a powerful motive for murder.
After a suspect was arrested and charged with murder, an ambitious district attorney battled a high-profile LA private counsel in the most sensational trial in San Diego’s history that was followed avidly across the nation. The big question: What really happened at the Blue Sea Cottage?

      <title>Repeat Experiences of the Strange and Unknown</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is author Michael Brien here to discuss his new book containing years of collected experiences from people who seem to have repeated experiences with the paranormal and other strange phenomena. Get his book The Road to Strange: The Contiguous Universe on Amazon.

They say UFOs are real.
Humanity's biggest mystery, the alien presence on Earth, continues!
For thousands of years, to the present "modern era," people have been obsessed with the idea that we've been visited by intelligent beings from elsewhere - whether extraterrestrials, inter-dimensionals, or maybe even denizens from our future.
The US Pentagon admits not only are we not alone, but that we need to revive our study and understanding of what is really going on in our skies.
UFOs, aliens, and the paranormal have received renewed coverage in the media. No longer do we need fear the ridicule of the past; these subjects are not only worthy of continued study, they demand it!
In this audiobook, we examine UFOs and the paranormal, with an expanded look at the lives of people who not only have had at least one major UFO or paranormal experience, but who have even had a lifetime of such experiences. We examine in depth what more we can learn from people who have had multiple, repeat experiences of the strange and the unknown.

      <itunes:summary>My special guest is author Michael Brien here to discuss his new book containing years of collected experiences from people who seem to have repeated experiences with the paranormal and other strange phenomena. Get his book The Road to Strange: The Contiguous Universe on Amazon.

They say UFOs are real.
Humanity's biggest mystery, the alien presence on Earth, continues!
For thousands of years, to the present "modern era," people have been obsessed with the idea that we've been visited by intelligent beings from elsewhere - whether extraterrestrials, inter-dimensionals, or maybe even denizens from our future.
The US Pentagon admits not only are we not alone, but that we need to revive our study and understanding of what is really going on in our skies.
UFOs, aliens, and the paranormal have received renewed coverage in the media. No longer do we need fear the ridicule of the past; these subjects are not only worthy of continued study, they demand it!
In this audiobook, we examine UFOs and the paranormal, with an expanded look at the lives of people who not only have had at least one major UFO or paranormal experience, but who have even had a lifetime of such experiences. We examine in depth what more we can learn from people who have had multiple, repeat experiences of the strange and the unknown.

      <title>Haunted Hills of Greene County Pennsylvania</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Joining me on the show is author Kevin Paul who's here to discuss the strange paranormal activity happening in Greene County, Pennsylvania. Get his book Haunted Hills and Hollows: What Lurks in Greene County Pennsylvania on Amazon.
The Most Haunted County in America The far southwest corner of Pennsylvania looks on the surface to be a pleasant rolling, river-cut landscape carpeted with vegetation and trees. But underneath is a bloody history and a supernatural reality brimming with ghosts, aliens, unknown creatures – and things that can change a person’s life forever. Kevin Paul, a native of Greene County, and paranormal researcher Rosemary Ellen Guiley take you deep into Greene County’s dark and unexplored corners to uncover a twilight world that exists alongside of us, waiting for us to be in the right place at the right time to make itself known. Here are true stories of drifting ghosts, strange alien beings and their sky craft, Bigfoot, dogmen, Lizard Man, black “blobs,” winged humanoids, spirits of the land, mysterious black-eyed people and more, all of whom roam the suburbs and wilds of Greene County. “A spine chilling journey through Pennsylvania’s Greene County. From haunted locations and ghostly apparitions to encounters with UFOs, Bigfoot and other bizarre creatures, it’s a real page turner full of mysterious paranormal accounts.” – Stan Gordon UFO-Bigfoot researcher and author “I have been out in the field investigating with Kevin Paul and Rosemary Ellen Guiley and have seen for myself the weird and unexplained phenomena that exist here.” – John Zaffis, star of Haunted Collector and co-author of Demon Haunted: True Stories from the John Zaffis Vault.

      <description>My special guest is occult researcher Jordan Maxwell who's here to discuss Sun(Son) Worship and who he says religions of the world are really having their masses pray to.
Jordan Maxwell continues as a preeminent researcher and independent scholar in the field of occult / religious philosophy. His interest in these subjects began as far back as 1959. He served for three and a half years as the Religion Editor of Truth Seeker Magazine, America's oldest Freethought Journal (since 1873). His work exploring the hidden foundations of Western religions and secret societies creates enthusiastic responses from audiences around the world.
He has conducted dozens of intensive seminars, hosted his own radio talk shows, guested on more than 600 radio shows, and written, produced and appeared in numerous television shows and documentaries (including three 2-hour specials for the CBS TV network, as well as the internationally acclaimed 5-part Ancient Mystery Series - all devoted to understanding ancient religions and their pervasive influence on world affairs today. 
His work on the subject of secret societies, both ancient and modern, and their symbols, has fascinated audiences around the world for decades.

A dimension that is more real than we can understand.

      <title>Identified Flying Objects: A Multidisciplinary Scientific Approach to the UFO Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is Dr. Michael P. Masters who's here to discuss how it's possible that extraterrestrials could very well be humans that have come back in time for a purpose. Get his book Identified Flying Objects: A Multidisciplinary Scientific Approach to the UFO Phenomenon on Amazon.

Could “UFOs” and “Aliens” simply be us, but from the future? 

This provocative new book cautiously examines the premise that extraterrestrials may instead be our distant human descendants, using the anthropological tool of time travel to visit and study us in their own hominin evolutionary past. Dr. Michael P. Masters, a professor of biological anthropology specializing in human evolutionary anatomy, archaeology, and biomedicine, explores how the persistence of long-term biological and cultural trends in human evolution may ultimately result in us becoming the ones piloting these disc-shaped craft, which are likely the very devices that allow our future progeny to venture backward across the landscape of time. 

Moreover, these extratempestrials are ubiquitously described as bipedal, large-brained, hairless, human-like beings, who communicate with us in our own languages, and who possess technology advanced beyond, but clearly built upon, our own. These accounts, coupled with a thorough understanding of the past and modern human condition, point to the continuation of established biological and cultural trends here on Earth, long into the distant human future.

Since 1908, residents in and around the small town of Fouke, Arkansas, have reported sightings of a strange creature in their backwoods and waterways; a huge, ape-like beast that walks upright like a man. Locals call it the Fouke Monster, while others call it the Boggy Creek Monster due to its association with the cult-classic docudrama, The Legend of Boggy Creek.Now, for the first time, all the documented encounters with the famed Boggy Creek Monster have been collected in one source. Researched, compiled, and presented in chilling detail by author and Boggy Creek historian, Lyle Blackburn, these remarkable encounters offer an intriguing story of backwoods mystery that continues today. From startling roadside glimpses to frightening confrontations and mysterious footprints, the Boggy Creek Casebook is ultimate collection of Fouke Monster phenomena featuring over 90 eyewitness accounts. Read it as a standalone book or as a vital supplement to Blackburn’s acclaimed Boggy Creek series

      <title>Bundy: The Man and The Monster </title>
      <description>My special guest is author Kevin Suvillan here to discuss serial killer Ted Bundy.
Ted Bundy’s Murderous Mysteries is a deep-dive into the archival record of the America’s most notorious serial killer. It’s a veritable goldmine of information on Bundy, his victims, and this very voluminous case. 
Written by the foremost authority on Ted Bundy, this latest examination of this brutal serial killer contains new, revealing, and never-before published interviews with those close to Bundy, close to his victims, and a potential victim who barely escaped his clutches. 
Ted Bundy’s Murderous Mysteries brings to light for the first time many heretofore passed-over facts about Bundy and reveals previously hidden aspects of the lives of some of his victims.

      <title>R. Kelly: The Worst Predator in The History of Popular Music </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/r-kelly-the-worst-predator-in-the-history-of-popular-music/</link>
      <description>My special guest is author Lizzette Martinez who's here to discuss the years of sexual abuse and trauma she suffered at the hands of popular Grammy-winning music artist R. Kelly. Get her explosive book Jane Doe #9: How I Survived R.Kelly right now on Amazon.

"Lizzette Martinez’s story embodies the fire energy that gives light and life to survivors all around her! Survivors need to see strength and perseverance despite opposition, and Lizzette models just that." -- Melissa Schuman, actress and singer

In January of 1995, 17-year-old Lizzette Martinez met Grammy-winning musician and record producer R. KELLY at Aventura Mall in Florida where he was performing. At first, it seemed that her hopes of becoming a professional singer were about to come true when he offered to help boost her career. However, this mentorship quickly turned into sexual grooming, leading to years of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse.

After struggling to free herself of the relationship and rebuild on her own, Lizzette’s successful new life, far away from the entertainment industry, was interrupted in 2017 by allegations against R. Kelly by other women. This led her to coming forward to the authorities with her own history of abuse by the music icon.

In January 2019, she participated with other survivors in a documentary series with Lifetime called “Surviving R. Kelly.” It should have been a healing experience but instead left them feeling abandoned and fearful for their lives.

In August 2021, Kelly went on trial in New York on racketeering and sex trafficking charges and was found guilty of all charges.

In JANE DOE #9 by Lizzette Martinez and Keelin MacGregor, readers get a no-holds-barred look at Martinez’s relationship with Kelly, her efforts to break free and pursue her dreams, and courage to take on her abuser and seek justice.
"Lizzette has been very courageous and persistent in her battle to make sure that R. Kelly was held accountable. I am honored to represent her." - Gloria Allred, women's rights attorney and National Women's Hall Of Fame inductee
"In twenty-one years of reporting on R. Kelly abusing his wealth and fame to prey on so many girls and young women—and it was their bravery in speaking out that finally stopped the worst predator in the history of popular music—Lizzette Martinez has always struck me as one of the strongest and most courageous. I could not admire her more, and I am eager indeed to read her story in her own words. She is an inspiration." - Jim DeRogatis, music critic, journalist, and author of Soulless: The Case Against R. K

Kelly.” It should have been a healing experience but instead left them feeling abandoned and fearful for their lives.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>In August 2021,</strong> Kelly went on trial in New York on racketeering and sex trafficking charges and was found guilty of all charges.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>In JANE DOE #9<em> </em></strong>by Lizzette Martinez and Keelin MacGregor, readers get a no-holds-barred look at Martinez’s relationship with Kelly, her efforts to break free and pursue her dreams, and courage to take on her abuser and seek justice.</p><p><em>"Lizzette has been very courageous and persistent in her battle to make sure that R. Kelly was held accountable. I am honored to represent her."</em> <strong>- Gloria Allred, women's rights attorney and National Women's Hall Of Fame inductee</strong></p><p><em>"In twenty-one years of reporting on R. Kelly abusing his wealth and fame to prey on so many girls and young women—and it was their bravery in speaking out that finally stopped the worst predator in the history of popular music—Lizzette Martinez has always struck me as one of the strongest and most courageous. I could not admire her more, and I am eager indeed to read her story in her own words. She is an inspiration." </em><strong><em>-</em> Jim DeRogatis, music critic, journalist, and author of <em>Soulless: The Case Against R.

      <title>A Sociologist's Encounters with Unidentified Aerial Objects, Unexplained Events and Mysterious Beings</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/a-sociologists-encounters-with-unidentified-aerial-objects-unexplained-events-and-mysterious-beings/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is Dr. Simeon Hein who's here to discuss his journey from not believing in alien life forms to his amazing revelations through the study of remote viewing. Get his book Black Swan Ghosts on Amazon.
Black Swan Ghosts is an investigation into how our society treats witnesses to unexplained events, unidentified aerial objects, and mysterious beings. It’s a topic that I once dismissed as being weird, fringe, and kind of crazy. Something I’d avoid. 

But after getting involved in the subject of Remote Viewing and getting to know participants in this previously classified government program, I began to encounter more and more highly credible witnesses to these hard-to-explain phenomena. And after a while, the weight of the evidence overcame any doubts I had about the authenticity and veridicality of these subjects. 

This is an investigation of why our society is so reluctant to engage and address the critical issues raised by such phenomena. Why are we afraid to take the subject seriously? What are the consequences to the witnesses? Exactly what kind of universe do we live in? 

Includes witness stories from a former Air Force and commercial pilot, children of high ranking Air Force officials, an Aerospace engineer, a former NASA astrobiologist, a retired U.S. government remote viewer, and many others.

You’ll hear and see what it’s like to come face to face with the unknown. It’s now time for their stories to be heard. And it’s time we all started listening. Now includes video interviews, on the BlackSwanGhosts.com website, with many of the witnesses in the book. 


Includes witness accounts of:

▪ a hostile encounter between U.S. Air Force jets and an anomalous object over Lake Superior in the 1960’s
▪ B-52’s during Cold War get scanned by an mysterious objects from space near Soviet border
▪ former government remote viewer recounts contact with an alien control panel and interview by intelligence agents
▪ campers on Silbury Hill, UK witness strange luminous objects hovering with a secondary sighting by supporting witness
▪ NASA astrobiologist shows evidence of meteoric extraterrestrial fossils, suppressed Skylab UFO photos, and first-hand account of accidental near-launch of Soviet nuclear missiles caused by huge unidentified disc
▪ woman and friend have car stall and experience missing time near Mt. St. Helens
▪ man and friend see flying disc and its occupant land at night and then get mysterious phone calls
▪ and much, much more!

In 1974, Dennis Lynn Rader stalked and murdered a family of four in Wichita, Kansas. Since adolescence, he had read about serial killers and imagined becoming one. Soon after killing the family, he murdered a young woman and then another, until he had ten victims. He named himself “B.T.K.” (bind, torture, kill) and wrote notes that terrorized the city. He remained on the loose for thirty years. No one who knew him guessed his dark secret. He nearly got away with his crimes, but in 2004, he began to play risky games with the police. He made a mistake. When he was arrested, Rader’s family, friends, and coworkers were shocked to discover that B.T.K. had been among them, going to work, raising his children, and acting normal. This case stands out both for the brutal treatment of victims and for the ordinary public face that Rader, a church council president, had shown to the outside world. Through jailhouse visits, telephone calls, and written correspondence, Katherine Ramsland worked with Rader himself to analyze the layers of his psyche. Using his drawings, letters, interviews, and Rader’s unique codes, she presents in meticulous detail the childhood roots and development of one man’s motivation to stalk, torture, and kill.

In 1974, Dennis Lynn Rader stalked and murdered a family of four in Wichita, Kansas. Since adolescence, he had read about serial killers and imagined becoming one. Soon after killing the family, he murdered a young woman and then another, until he had ten victims. He named himself “B.T.K.” (bind, torture, kill) and wrote notes that terrorized the city. He remained on the loose for thirty years. No one who knew him guessed his dark secret. He nearly got away with his crimes, but in 2004, he began to play risky games with the police. He made a mistake. When he was arrested, Rader’s family, friends, and coworkers were shocked to discover that B.T.K. had been among them, going to work, raising his children, and acting normal. This case stands out both for the brutal treatment of victims and for the ordinary public face that Rader, a church council president, had shown to the outside world. Through jailhouse visits, telephone calls, and written correspondence, Katherine Ramsland worked with Rader himself to analyze the layers of his psyche. Using his drawings, letters, interviews, and Rader’s unique codes, she presents in meticulous detail the childhood roots and development of one man’s motivation to stalk, torture, and kill. She reveals aspects of the dark motivations of this most famous of living serial killers that have never before been revealed. In this book Katherine Ramsland presents an intelligent, original, and rare glimpse into the making of a serial killer and the potential darkness that lives next door.

Are ETs healing humans?The answer, of course, is yes! In this landmark book, The Healing Power of UFOs, leading UFO researcher, Preston Dennett, presents a fascinating compilation of more than 300 cases of people who have been healed by extraterrestrials. Supported by firsthand eyewitness testimonies, stretching back more than 100 years to the present day, coming from across the United States and the world, this book proves that healing humans is one of the primary alien agendas on our planet. Verified by doctors and leading UFO researchers, the UFO healing cases represent incontrovertible evidence of UFO reality. Preston Dennett began his research into UFO healings in the early 1990s. His first book, UFO Healings (1996, Wild Flower Press) was the first book published on the subject, and presented more than 100 cases. This new volume presents the original cases (with new information) plus 200 more, many of which have never been published before. Preston Dennett has been documenting and researching healing cases for more than 25 years and is the world’s leading expert on UFO healing accounts. This landmark book is the culmination of his research and settles the question once and for all that medical healings as the result of a UFO encounter do actually happen.The healings include a wide variety of conditions. Injuries and flesh wounds, colds, flu and infections, serious diseases--all have been cured by ETs. Inside you will find:•More than 70 healings of injuries.•More than 50 healings of colds, minor illnesses and ailments.•More than 120 healings of serious illnesses and chronic diseases.•More than 40 healings of cancer.•Cases involving “health upgrades.”•Cases involving healings of animals and even plants.•A study of the connection between UFO abductions and psychic healing.•Accounts in which people have been “rescued” by ETs.•A study of miraculous cures from angels, NDEs, OBEs, lightning strikes, past life therapy, Native American ceremonial healings and more.•Evidence that our governments have obtained UFO healing technology and are using it for themselves.Who is being healed and why? What types of ETs are doing the healing? How are these healings being done? Are ETs our friends or foes? This massive 500-page book dives into the heart of the phenomenon and answers all these questions and more. Ignored for far too long, the UFO healing cases show a positive aspect to a phenomenon that has been saturated with disinformation for decades. The truth can no longer be denied. The aliens have arrived and as this book will show, one of their primary missions is the healing of all humanity.

The great debate over the Big Bang and the quest to understand the fate of the universe
Today, the Big Bang is so entrenched in our understanding of the cosmos that to doubt it would seem crazy. But as Paul Halpern shows in Flashes of Creation, just decades ago its mere mention caused sparks to fly. At the center of the debate were Russian American physicist George Gamow and British astrophysicist Fred Hoyle. Gamow insisted that a fiery explosion explained how the elements of the universe were created. Attacking the idea as half-baked, Hoyle countered that the universe was engaged in a never-ending process of creation. The battle was fierce. In the end, Gamow turned out to be right -- mostly -- and Hoyle, along with his many achievements, is remembered for giving the theory the silliest possible name: ''The Big Bang.'' Halpern captures the brilliance of both thinkers and reminds us that even those proved wrong have much to teach us about boldness, imagination, and the universe itself.

With its uncanny night howls, unrivaled ingenuity, and amazing resilience, the coyote is the stuff of legends. In Indian folktales it often appears as a deceptive trickster or a sly genius. But legends don't come close to capturing the incredible survival story of the coyote. 
As soon as Americans - especially white Americans - began ranching and herding in the West, they began working to destroy the coyote. Despite campaigns of annihilation employing poisons, gases, helicopters, and engineered epidemics, coyotes didn't just survive, they thrived, expanding across the continent from Anchorage, Alaska, to New York's Central Park. In the war between humans and coyotes, coyotes have won hands down. 
Coyote America is both an environmental and a deep natural history of the coyote. It traces both the five-million-year-long biological story of an animal that has become the "wolf" in our backyards and its cultural evolution from a preeminent spot in Native American religions to the hapless foil of the Road Runner. A deeply American tale, the story of the coyote in the American West and beyond is a sort of Manifest Destiny in reverse, with a pioneering hero whose career holds up an uncanny mirror to the successes and failures of American expansionism. 
An illuminating biography of this extraordinary animal, Coyote America isn't just the story of an animal's survival - it is one of the great epics of our time.

In Indian folktales it often appears as a deceptive trickster or a sly genius. But legends don't come close to capturing the incredible survival story of the coyote. </p><p>As soon as Americans - especially white Americans - began ranching and herding in the West, they began working to destroy the coyote. Despite campaigns of annihilation employing poisons, gases, helicopters, and engineered epidemics, coyotes didn't just survive, they thrived, expanding across the continent from Anchorage, Alaska, to New York's Central Park. In the war between humans and coyotes, coyotes have won hands down. </p><p><em>Coyote America</em> is both an environmental and a deep natural history of the coyote. It traces both the five-million-year-long biological story of an animal that has become the "wolf" in our backyards and its cultural evolution from a preeminent spot in Native American religions to the hapless foil of the Road Runner. A deeply American tale, the story of the coyote in the American West and beyond is a sort of Manifest Destiny in reverse, with a pioneering hero whose career holds up an uncanny mirror to the successes and failures of American expansionism. </p><p>An illuminating biography of this extraordinary animal, <em>Coyote America</em> isn't just the story of an animal's survival - it is one of the great epics of our time.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

About Julie:
I’m a psychic and medical intuitive. I can sense what medical conditions and illnesses a person has, I can facilitate energetic healings, I can see energy fields—and I can communicate with spirits both alive and dead. I can work from anywhere; it’s rare I’m with someone while scanning them.
In addition, I can scan animals, access people’s past lives, and remove ghosts from homes and other buildings, and I can tell how close to death someone is.
I’m not one of those psychics who’s had dead people stalking her since childhood. Well, at least if I did, I didn’t know it. I learned the basics of how to do energy work more than 25 years ago, added and refined my own techniques over the years, and have been doing it ever since.
I turn my abilities on and off at will. I don’t go around scanning everyone. It’s an ethical thing with me. Someone’s private information is theirs to share only if they wish, so I scan only when I have permission and then keep all information about someone completely confidential.
Although the psychic and medical intuitive aspects of my life have been amazing side interests, I’m basically a businesswoman, an inventor, an author, and a serial entrepreneur. During my 35-year career, I’ve invented surgical devices that are sold throughout the world and founded several companies in the medical, natural gas, advertising, long-term care, compliance, and data breach prevention industries.
Most importantly, however, I’m a wife, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend.

Julie Ryan is an inventor, entrepreneur, medical intuitive and psychic whose learned skills have helped many families understand the glorious side of the dying process. This process involves angels, multitudes of deceased family and friends, the spirits of deceased pets, and countless serendipitous (and miraculous) moments that are all part of a prescribed series of events she calls the Twelve Phases of Transition™. During what is normally an incredibly heart-wrenching time, families almost always experience profound comfort once Julie describes what’s happening from the perspective of the spirit world—including which spirits and deceased pets from the “other side” have come to assist the dying person, what the person needs and whether they are in pain (when they can’t talk for themselves), and how close they are to actually passing.The information Julie coveys brings peace at a time that seems filled with anything but peace, and a new way for those left behind to embrace life through what they learn about the experience of death.Reading the remarkable, heartwarming, and even amusing stories in this book will change your life.

      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/the-west-memphis-3-satanic-ritual-killing/</link>
      <description>My special guest is William Ramsey here to discuss his research into the horrific unsolved murder of 3 young boys in West Memphis, Arkansas thought by many to carried out as a satanic ritual. Get his book Abomination: Devil Worship and Deception in the West Memphis Three Murders on Amazon.

By analyzing original police transcripts and court documents, William Ramsey conclusively proves that witchcraft and the occult were involved in the heinous murders, and that a continuing wall of deception has prevented the public from realizing the awful truth about the West Memphis Three child killings.

It was a palace of the Kings of France; the creation of the Sun King, Louis XIV. The marvel of all Europe it soon became a gilded cage for the monarchs and the courtiers who lived there. The saga of Versailles is filled with intrigue, scandal, glory, and tragedy. It is here that the nobility of France manipulated and poisoned their way to the top. Marriages, deaths, mistresses, secret passageways, and betrayal---it all added up to the French Revolution that cost Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette their heads. Yet it is also within these opulent walls that we find the dreams of those who conquered Europe through military campaigns or outsmarting their own bloodline. No one was safe. No one was exempt from the King's spies who secretly opened letters and reported on every move within the palace and grounds. 
Join me as we look behind the scenes at the lives of the French Kings, their wives, their mistresses, and blood relations as they built, tore down, and rebuilt a name that became synonymous with jaw-dropping opulence, power, wealth, fashion, and scandal. Come with me inside the golden gates of Versailles. Packed with photographs, floor plans, and maps, this is a comprehensive look at the palace's history. Also included is the documented hauntings at the palace, including the bestselling account of two women academics who visited the Petit Trianon grounds in 1901 and interacted with the ghost of Marie Antoinette and others of her time period. It is a story that has fascinated the world for decades. Other reports of paranormal activity at the palace are also included. Rebecca F. Pittman is a bestselling author of 14 titles. Her History and Haunting Of series is regularly featured on international TV, radio, and podcast shows. She researches the most-haunted venues in the world, staying in their shadowed bedrooms and interviewing the owners and staff. Her book The History and Haunting of Lizzie Borden spotlights five new pieces of evidence Ms. Pittman found in the famous murder case of 1892. A companion rummy-style card game, The Lizzie Borden Paranormal Card Game, featuring evidence, suspects, alibis and a paranormal twist, is available for sale on her website. She makes her home in Colorado.

      <title>Slaughter of The American Serengeti </title>

America's Great Plains once possessed one of the grandest wildlife spectacles of the world, equaled only by such places as the Serengeti, the Masai Mara, or the veld of South Africa. Pronghorn antelope, gray wolves, bison, coyotes, wild horses, and grizzly bears: less than 200 years ago these creatures existed in such abundance that John James Audubon was moved to write "it is impossible to describe or even conceive the vast multitudes of these animals". In a work that is at once a lyrical evocation of that lost splendor and a detailed natural history of these charismatic species of the historic Great Plains, veteran naturalist and outdoorsman Dan Flores draws a vivid portrait of each of these animals in their glory - and tells the harrowing story of what happened to them at the hands of market hunters and ranchers and, ultimately, a federal killing program in the 19th and 20th centuries.

From The Author Of INCONVENIENCE GONE
On the early morning of March 6, 1993, an intense fire broke out in a tiny nursery. Sixteen minutes later, firefighters had extinguished the blaze, only to reveal a room burned so severely, everything was virtually unrecognizable. Then, they were told to look for a baby. What they discovered looked more like a monster from a horror film. The small skull had been incinerated, and the legs and arms were nothing more than charred stumps. The only identifiable human feature was the baby's genitals, covered in what remained of his diaper.

Two people were home at the time the fire broke out: the newborn's parents.

The arson squad declared the fire suspicious and the homeowner's insurance company hired investigators, who determined the fire to indeed be arson. The prosecutor wanted to dismiss the case, but the arson unit had a newly appointed prosecutor who refused to do so.

Was it arson? What was the motive? Along with the tenacious and determined Detective Leslie Van Buskirk, Diane Marger Moore persisted for more than two years to find the truth and get justice for Baby Matthew Wise.

      <title>A Strange Harvest: Unexplained Cattle Mutilations with Linda Moulton Howe</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/a-strange-harvest-unexplained-cattle-mutilations/</link>
      <description>My special guest is Emmy Award winning journalist Linda Moulton Howe. She joins me to discuss her research into cattle mutilations and the mind boggling details in which organs and other body parts are removed from the animals.
The bovine corpses stunned the ranchers who found them. The animals’ ears, eyes, udders, anuses, sex organs and tongues had routinely been removed, seemingly with a sharp, clean instrument. Their carcasses had been drained of blood. No tracks or footprints were found in the immediate vicinity—nor were any of the usual opportunistic scavengers.
Between April and October of 1975, nearly 200 cases of cattle mutilation were reported in the state of Colorado alone. Far from being mere tabloid fodder, it had become a nationally recognized issue: That year, the Colorado Associated Press voted it the state’s number one story. Colorado’s then-senator Floyd Haskell asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to get involved. 
Throughout the 1970s, cases had continued to mount throughout the American heartland. And in 1979—after thousands of reported cattle mutilations, causing millions of dollars of livestock losses—the FBI finally opened an investigation into a series of cases that had reportedly taken place on New Mexico’s Indian lands. Pressure came, in part, from a heated public symposium on the subject that had been convened by that state’s science-minded U.S. senator, Harrison Schmitt, who had a Ph.D in geology from Harvard and had walked on the moon as an Apollo 17 astronaut. 
Ultimately, the FBI’s inquiry poured cold water on the idea that something strange was afoot. On January 15, 1980, the Bureau closed the investigation, putting out a statement saying that, “none of the reported cases has involved what appear to be mutilations by other than common predators.”
Locals sharply disagreed.
“I've been around cattle all my life and I can sure tell whether it's been done by coyote or a sharp instrument,” Sheriff George A. Yarnell of Elbert County, a rural area south of Denver, told The New York Times in the fall of 1975.

Mysterious livestock mutilations weren’t confined to the 1970s, or to the United States. Similar cases involving sheep, cows or horses have been reported as far back as the early 17th century and as recently as 2019. The ‘70s cases, however, brought the most widespread attention.
Broadly speaking, the debate about cattle mutilation falls into two camps: those who see the mutilations as unexplained phenomena, and those who see them as normal cattle deaths, repackaged as something mysterious or paranormal. 
For those in the unexplained camp, opinions have diverged about the possible explanation. Some law enforcement communities opined that the animals were being mutilated by people in strange, quasi-religious rituals. In 1980, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police blamed the mutilations on an unidentified cult. The Department of Criminal Investigations in Iowa, meanwhile, asserted that the mutilations were being conducted by satanists. Read more here

      <itunes:title>A Strange Harvest: Unexplained Cattle Mutilations with Linda Moulton  Howe</itunes:title>

      <itunes:summary>My special guest is Emmy Award winning journalist Linda Moulton Howe. She joins me to discuss her research into cattle mutilations and the mind boggling details in which organs and other body parts are removed from the animals.
The bovine corpses stunned the ranchers who found them. The animals’ ears, eyes, udders, anuses, sex organs and tongues had routinely been removed, seemingly with a sharp, clean instrument. Their carcasses had been drained of blood. No tracks or footprints were found in the immediate vicinity—nor were any of the usual opportunistic scavengers.
Between April and October of 1975, nearly 200 cases of cattle mutilation were reported in the state of Colorado alone. Far from being mere tabloid fodder, it had become a nationally recognized issue: That year, the Colorado Associated Press voted it the state’s number one story. Colorado’s then-senator Floyd Haskell asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to get involved. 
Throughout the 1970s, cases had continued to mount throughout the American heartland. And in 1979—after thousands of reported cattle mutilations, causing millions of dollars of livestock losses—the FBI finally opened an investigation into a series of cases that had reportedly taken place on New Mexico’s Indian lands. Pressure came, in part, from a heated public symposium on the subject that had been convened by that state’s science-minded U.S. senator, Harrison Schmitt, who had a Ph.D in geology from Harvard and had walked on the moon as an Apollo 17 astronaut. 
Ultimately, the FBI’s inquiry poured cold water on the idea that something strange was afoot. On January 15, 1980, the Bureau closed the investigation, putting out a statement saying that, “none of the reported cases has involved what appear to be mutilations by other than common predators.”

      <title>The Rite: A Look at Vatican Exorcisms </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/the-rite-a-look-at-vatican-exorcisms/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Matt Baglio who's here to discuss his book and research into Vatican exorcisms that was the inspiration behind the movie 'The Rite' starring Anthony Hopkins.
In 2005 a Vatican-run university opened its doors to priests from around the world, running a course for would-be exorcists. Looking for a story, Rome-based investigative journalist Matt Baglio attended the class, and there met Father Gary Thomas -- a Californian priest who had been chosen to attend by his bishop. Father Gary was concerned that many of the 'possessed' were in reality suffering from psychological disorders best left to the care of doctors. How and why his view changed is the subject of this book. We follow Father Gary's year-long training with a senior exorcist as he is transformed from a doubter into a believer. Baglio gained unprecedented access to this world, including participating in exorcisms and culminating with Father Gary's own fearsome confrontation with the Devil. Woven into his story is the fascinating history of exorcism, its rites and rituals, and the ways and reasons that people become possessed. Matt Baglio speaks to psychologists and detectives, as well as Vatican clergy, to wrinkle out the truth about this most Gothic of subjects. The Riteis proof that the truth about demonic possession is not only stranger than fiction, but far more chilling.

The Dyatlov Pass incident resulted in nine unsolved, mysterious deaths; Keith McCloskey attempts to decipher the bizzare events that led up to that night and the subsequent aftermathIn January 1959, 10 experienced young skiers set out to travel to a mountain named Mount Otorten in the far north of Russia. Otorten translates to "don't go there" in the local Mansi language. During the trip, one of the skiers fell ill and returned. The remaining nine lost their way and ended up on another mountain slope known as Kholat Syakhl, or "Mountain of the Dead." On the night of February 1, 1959, something or someone caused the skiers to flee their tent in terror, using knives to slash their way out instead of using the entrance. When they failed to return home, search parties were sent out and their bodies were found, some with massive internal injuries but all without external marks. The autopsy report showed that the injuries were caused by "an unknown compelling force." Subsequently, the area was sealed off for years by the authorities and the deaths and events of that night remained unexplained. Benefiting from original research carried out in Russia, this book attempts to explain what happened to the nine skiers who lost their lives in what has come to be known as the "Dyatlov Pass Incident."

INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER

An Amazon “Best Book of 2019”
A Washington Post “10 Books To Read in July”
A Los Angeles Times “Seven Highly Anticipated Books for Summer Reading”
A USA Today “20 of the Season’s Hottest New Books”
A New York Post “25 Best Beach Reads of 2019 You Need to Pre-Order Now”
A Bustle “The Best New True Crime Books You Can Read Right Now”

“Maureen Callahan’s deft reporting and stylish writing have created one of the all-time-great serial-killer books: sensitive, chilling, and completely impossible to put down.” —Ada Calhoun, author of St. Marks Is Dead

Ted Bundy. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Dahmer. The names of notorious serial killers are usually well-known; they echo in the news and in public consciousness. But most people have never heard of Israel Keyes, one of the most ambitious and terrifying serial killers in modern history. The FBI considered his behavior unprecedented. Described by a prosecutor as "a force of pure evil," Keyes was a predator who struck all over the United States. He buried "kill kits"--cash, weapons, and body-disposal tools--in remote locations across the country. Over the course of fourteen years, Keyes would fly to a city, rent a car, and drive thousands of miles in order to use his kits. He would break into a stranger's house, abduct his victims in broad daylight, and kill and dispose of them in mere hours. And then he would return home to Alaska, resuming life as a quiet, reliable construction worker devoted to his only daughter.

When journalist Maureen Callahan first heard about Israel Keyes in 2012, she was captivated by how a killer of this magnitude could go undetected by law enforcement for over a decade. And so began a project that consumed her for the next several years--uncovering the true story behind how the FBI ultimately caught Israel Keyes, and trying to understand what it means for a killer like Keyes to exist. A killer who left a path of monstrous, randomly committed crimes in his wake--many of which remain unsolved to this day.

American Predator is the ambitious culmination of years of interviews with key figures in law enforcement and in Keyes's life, and research uncovered from classified FBI files. Callahan takes us on a journey into the chilling, nightmarish mind of a relentless killer, and to the limitations of traditional law enforcement.

INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER

An Amazon “Best Book of 2019”
A Washington Post “10 Books To Read in July”
A Los Angeles Times “Seven Highly Anticipated Books for Summer Reading”
A USA Today “20 of the Season’s Hottest New Books”
A New York Post “25 Best Beach Reads of 2019 You Need to Pre-Order Now”
A Bustle “The Best New True Crime Books You Can Read Right Now”

“Maureen Callahan’s deft reporting and stylish writing have created one of the all-time-great serial-killer books: sensitive, chilling, and completely impossible to put down.” —Ada Calhoun, author of St. Marks Is Dead

Ted Bundy. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Dahmer. The names of notorious serial killers are usually well-known; they echo in the news and in public consciousness. But most people have never heard of Israel Keyes, one of the most ambitious and terrifying serial killers in modern history. The FBI considered his behavior unprecedented. Described by a prosecutor as "a force of pure evil," Keyes was a predator who struck all over the United States. He buried "kill kits"--cash, weapons, and body-disposal tools--in remote locations across the country. Over the course of fourteen years, Keyes would fly to a city, rent a car, and drive thousands of miles in order to use his kits. He would break into a stranger's house, abduct his victims in broad daylight, and kill and dispose of them in mere hours. And then he would return home to Alaska, resuming life as a quiet, reliable construction worker devoted to his only daughter.

When journalist Maureen Callahan first heard about Israel Keyes in 2012, she was captivated by how a killer of this magnitude could go undetected by law enforcement for over a decade.

From the author of the acclaimed book Emergence comes a step-by-step guide to design and create abundance in any area of life, including money, time, love, creativity, and more.  
The Abundance Project is about having more than enough in every area of your life - more than enough money, time, love, creativity, happiness - regardless of the circumstances you’ve been through or are currently facing. This may sound like wishful thinking, but once you understand what you’re really made of, and what the source of real abundance is, you will increase your capacity and unleash your divine inheritance.  
Built on universal, proven principles, The Abundance Project breaks you out of the unsustainable buying/consuming loop created by the mindset that fulfillment comes from outside ourselves. Instead, Derek Rydall - international life coach and integrative therapist - shows you that the infinite-sum reserve that’s already in you will provide all that you need.  
Rydall teaches the laws of giving and circulation that will release the channels of abundance-creating energy in your life through his Seven Gifts that Give You Everything; he will help you identify Abundance Blind Spots and Shadows that get in the way; and he walks you through the step-by-step Abundance Boot Camp so you can design and master the life you’ve envisioned. The Abundance Project is a way of living that turns life from transactional to transformational.

Harold Schechter, Amazon Charts bestselling author of Hell’s Princess, unearths a nearly forgotten true crime of obsession and revenge, and one of the first—and worst—mass murders in American history.
In 1927, while the majority of the township of Bath, Michigan, was celebrating a new primary school—one of the most modern in the Midwest—Andrew P. Kehoe had other plans. The local farmer and school board treasurer was educated, respected, and an accommodating neighbor and friend. But behind his ordinary demeanor was a narcissistic sadist seething with rage, resentment, and paranoia. On May 18 he detonated a set of rigged explosives with the sole purpose of destroying the school and everyone in it. Thirty-eight children and six adults were murdered that morning, culminating in the deadliest school massacre in US history.
Maniac is Harold Schechter’s gripping, definitive, exhaustively researched chronicle of a town forced to comprehend unprecedented carnage and the triggering of a “human time bomb” whose act of apocalyptic violence would foreshadow the terrors of the current age.

The true nature of what actually crashed in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947 remains classified. Only a select few have ever had access to the truth about what became known as Area 51.
But what happened to the remnants of that crash is shrouded in even greater mystery. What began in the high desert of New Mexico ended at Wright-Patterson, an ultra-top-secret Air Force base in Dayton, Ohio. The physical evidence of extraterrestrial visitation was buried deep within this nuclear stronghold. How tragic that such seismic news should be kept from the people of the world . . . pieces of history, now quickly dwindling into oblivion as the last of the secret-keepers passes on.
In addition to its rich history of military service to our nation, Wright-Patterson also stands as the secret tomb of one of the greatest occurrences in recorded history. Be prepared . . . the real Area 51—Wright-Patterson‘s vault—is about to be opened.
UFO Secrets Inside Wright-Patterson is a thoroughly researched work that includes:

New eyewitness accounts from the late Leonard Stringfield's files about the crash retrieval evidence stored at Wright-Patterson

New testimonies from the late Emmy-award-winning TV reporter Carl Day concerning physical evidence of crashed UFOs stored in underground facilities at Wright-Patterson

Newly discovered Project Blue Book files from Wright-Patterson including photos and Air Force investigations of UFOs.

In addition to its rich history of military service to our nation, Wright-Patterson also stands as the secret tomb of one of the greatest occurrences in recorded history. Be prepared . . . the real Area 51—Wright-Patterson‘s vault—is about to be opened.
UFO Secrets Inside Wright-Patterson is a thoroughly researched work that includes:

New eyewitness accounts from the late Leonard Stringfield's files about the crash retrieval evidence stored at Wright-Patterson

New testimonies from the late Emmy-award-winning TV reporter Carl Day concerning physical evidence of crashed UFOs stored in underground facilities at Wright-Patterson

Newly discovered Project Blue Book files from Wright-Patterson including photos and Air Force investigations of UFOs.

      <title>The Invisible Crime: Illegal Microchip Implants and Microwave Technology  </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/the-invisible-crime-illegal-microchip-implants-and-microwave-technology/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is author Michael Fitzhugh Bell who's here to discuss how he believes that a covert group is responsible for years of torture, kidnappings and harassments with the use of microchips. Get his book The Invisible Crime: Illegal Microchip Implants and Their Use Against Humanity on Amazon.
Book Description:
An innocent man becomes the unwitting target of a secret criminal organization using high-tech weaponry, microchip implants, and mind control on its victims, leaving no evidence. The organization is covert, highly organized, well-funded and uses the latest technology. This heinous, unconscionable crime has gone global—and rapidly has become a huge national problem. 
Author, Michael Fitzhugh Bell is drugged, abducted, raped, and surgically implanted with illegal microchip implants; all done without his knowledge or consent. Michael is tracked, stalked, and tortured, 24/7—and physically burned remotely with directed energy weapons which most people don’t even know exist. His every thought and feeling is being read in real time by his perpetrators via GPS and current cellular satellite systems, making him, quite literally, a human piñata. Michael must prove his crime to the police and a judge before his attackers erase his memories and murder him.
This story goes one step beyond Dr. John Hall’s own chilling tale of organized stalking by proxy. It is the author’s personal account of being electronically stalked and surgically implanted with micro-electronic transmission devices. It is the story of Michael’s uphill battle with doctors, lawyers, police, F.B.I., C.I.A., and a secret, global criminal union operating above the law. Beginning in Hollywood, California, Michael’s journey towards resolution will take him around the world—Madrid, Spain; London, England; Patagonia, Argentina; North and South Carolina, San Antonio, Texas; and back to southern California.
This book contains medical evidence, M.R.I. and ultrasound images, all clearly showing non-therapeutic /tracking torture devices. Surprisingly, these devices are legal and are available for purchase by anyone on the Internet. They are known as psychotronic weaponry; combing the words psychological and electronic.
Despite the most determined efforts to destroy him, Michael remains optimistic and focused, relentless in his pursuit to find his way out this never ending terror and nightmare of a labyrinth which has become his life.

      <title>Cern: The Large Hadron Collider </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/cern-the-large-hadron-collider/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is physicist Don Lincoln who's here to discuss is work using The Large Hadron Collider located in Switzerland better know as Cern. You can get his book The Large Hadron Collider: The Extraordinary Story of The Higgs Boson and Other Stuff That Will Blow Your Mind on Amazon.
An insider's history of the world's largest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider: why it was built, how it works, and the importance of what it has revealed.
Since 2008 scientists have conducted experiments in a hyperenergized, 17-mile supercollider beneath the border of France and Switzerland. The Large Hadron Collider (or what scientists call "the LHC") is one of the wonders of the modern world―a highly sophisticated scientific instrument designed to re-create in miniature the conditions of the universe as they existed in the microseconds following the big bang. Among many notable LHC discoveries, one led to the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for revealing evidence of the existence of the Higgs boson, the so-called God particle. 
Picking up where he left off in The Quantum Frontier, physicist Don Lincoln shares an insider's account of the LHC's operational history and gives readers everything they need to become well informed on this marvel of technology. 
Writing about the LHC's early days, Lincoln offers keen insight into an accident that derailed the operation nine days after the collider's 2008 debut. A faulty solder joint started a chain reaction that caused a massive explosion, damaged 50 superconducting magnets, and vaporized large sections of the conductor. The crippled LHC lay dormant for over a year, while technical teams repaired the damage.
Lincoln devotes an entire chapter to the Higgs boson and Higgs field, using several extended analogies to help explain the importance of these concepts to particle physics. In the final chapter, he describes what the discovery of the Higgs boson tells us about our current understanding of basic physics and how the discovery now keeps scientists awake over a nagging inconsistency in their favorite theory.
As accessible as it is fascinating, The Large Hadron Collider reveals the inner workings of this masterful achievement of technology, along with the mind-blowing discoveries that will keep it at the center of the scientific frontier for the foreseeable future.

You can get his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N5158Y4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0">The Large Hadron Collider: The Extraordinary Story of The Higgs Boson and Other Stuff That Will Blow Your Mind on Amazon.</a></p><p><strong>An insider's history of the world's largest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider: why it was built, how it works, and the importance of what it has revealed.</strong></p><p>Since 2008 scientists have conducted experiments in a hyperenergized, 17-mile supercollider beneath the border of France and Switzerland. The Large Hadron Collider (or what scientists call "the LHC") is one of the wonders of the modern world―a highly sophisticated scientific instrument designed to re-create in miniature the conditions of the universe as they existed in the microseconds following the big bang. Among many notable LHC discoveries, one led to the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for revealing evidence of the existence of the Higgs boson, the so-called God particle. </p><p>Picking up where he left off in <em>The Quantum Frontier</em>, physicist Don Lincoln shares an insider's account of the LHC's operational history and gives readers everything they need to become well informed on this marvel of technology. </p><p>Writing about the LHC's early days, Lincoln offers keen insight into an accident that derailed the operation nine days after the collider's 2008 debut. A faulty solder joint started a chain reaction that caused a massive explosion, damaged 50 superconducting magnets, and vaporized large sections of the conductor. The crippled LHC lay dormant for over a year, while technical teams repaired the damage.</p><p>Lincoln devotes an entire chapter to the Higgs boson and Higgs field, using several extended analogies to help explain the importance of these concepts to particle physics. In the final chapter, he describes what the discovery of the Higgs boson tells us about our current understanding of basic physics and how the discovery now keeps scientists awake over a nagging inconsistency in their favorite theory.</p><p>As accessible as it is fascinating, <em>The Large Hadron Collider</em> reveals the inner workings of this masterful achievement of technology, along with the mind-blowing discoveries that will keep it at the center of the scientific frontier for the foreseeable future.</p><p><strong>Wanna get creeped out?

Obsession, Unrequited Love, Jealousy, Revenge, and Violence Collide in this Page-Turning Anthology
#1 New Release in Forensic Science Law and Hoaxes &amp; Deceptions
Crimes of passion are both eerie and strangely tantalizing. How can someone you hold dear become someone you fear? This riveting anthology explores the question through some of the most compelling true crime accounts and stories of obsession and vengeance.
Crimes fueled by emotions. Love, passion, obsession, jealousy, and betrayal. When it comes to the emotions, people can react in strange and unexpected ways. Whether it’s a heart hurt by unrequited love, or a lover so passionate they’ll stop at nothing to get their way—even the most mild-mannered soul can suddenly flip, becoming a vengeful spirit with dark intentions. From the ancient Greek myth of Jason and Medea to Shakespeare’s Othello, themes dealing with deeply felt emotions have persisted. But unlike mythology or fiction, The Best New True Crime Stories: Crimes of Passion, Obsession &amp; Revenge contains stories from real life.
A special selection of stories written exclusively for this book. The Best New True Crime Stories: Crimes of Passion, Obsession &amp; Revenge includes stories from around the world and from different times. As with all titles in the popular The Best New True Crime Stories series, this volume contains original nonfiction accounts penned by writers from across the literary spectrum. Dive into these twisted true tales of passion and unrequited love turned violent. Examine why some have fully embraced their dark side, resorting to crime to achieve their own special brand of satisfaction and retribution.
If you enjoyed Mitzi's last book in her series, The Best New True Crime Stories: Well-Mannered Crooks, Rogues &amp; Criminals, and books like You Love Me, and The Big Book of Serial Killers Volume 2, then you’ll love The Best New True Crime Stories: Crimes of Passion, Obsession &amp; Revenge.

A channeled guide to the life-death transition experience and how to prepare for the wonders of the afterlife

• Reveals the afterlife as a fluid realm of imagination and invention, a luminous landscape created entirely of consciousness 

• Explains how to navigate the early stages of the afterlife, how we learn and grow in the spirit world, and how to release anxiety about the end of life 

• Includes exercises and meditations to prepare you for navigating and communicating in spirit 

There is no better source of information on death and the afterlife than someone who has died and lives in spirit. Channeling his late son, Jordan, psychologist Matthew McKay offers a postdeath guide for the living, revealing in vivid detail what to expect when we die and how to prepare for the wonders of the afterlife. 

Specifically describing the transition experience and the early stages of the afterlife, including how to navigate each stage, Jordan shows how death is a fluid realm of imagination and invention, a luminous landscape created entirely of consciousness. He explains how a soul that has newly crossed over is an amnesiac, arriving without senses, a nervous system, and all that has anchored us to the world. Jordan details how to navigate without a body, how we learn and grow in the spirit world, and how to release anxiety about the end of life and instead view it as another stage of being. He shows that the inferno described by Dante is an optional nightmare caused by thought projections that overwhelm the newly transitioned soul, and he reveals that the bardos are where souls who are beset with fear and false beliefs spend time learning and recovering. 

Providing profound relief from the fear of death, as well as exercises to prepare you for navigating and communicating in spirit, Jordan’s message reveals how love is the bonding element that holds all of consciousness--and the afterlife--together. McKay also documents the unbreakable bond between the living and the dead and teaches the skill of channeling, allowing you to connect to loved ones who have passed.

      <title>Bigfoot Analysis: The Sighting of A Legend </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is Bill Munns who's worked in Hollywood during the 1970's as a top creator of monster costumes and has study the Patterson-Gimlin Film for years.
The Patterson-Gimlin Film, the Hominid seen in it, the remarkably intense debate it has provoked, and the solution to the mystery. This book offers a truly unique analysis of the famous Patterson-Gimlin Film (the “Bigfoot” film, as it is also known), addressing the question of hoax or fraud from the perspective of a professional makeup and creature effects designer, as well as the perspective of a vintage filmmaker. The film itself is truly the best evidence, far superior to any testimony, recollections and similar descriptive accounts, and this analysis relies upon that best evidence only, for the definitive analysis in the 47 year history of this mysterious piece of film footage. This book is primarily written for the people who have not made up their minds, people who are simply curious about this mysterious film and have not yet formed an opinion as to its authenticity. Hopefully as well, this book will be of value to scholarly people who are willing to evaluate this film with an academic and factual approach. The film is a remarkable mystery, and the controversy surrounding it is a fascinating commentary on human nature. The truth of the Patterson-Gimlin Film is quite an extraordinary story.

        <![CDATA[<p>My special guest is Bill Munns who's worked in Hollywood during the 1970's as a top creator of monster costumes and has study the Patterson-Gimlin Film for years.</p><p>The Patterson-Gimlin Film, the Hominid seen in it, the remarkably intense debate it has provoked, and the solution to the mystery. This book offers a truly unique analysis of the famous Patterson-Gimlin Film (the “Bigfoot” film, as it is also known), addressing the question of hoax or fraud from the perspective of a professional makeup and creature effects designer, as well as the perspective of a vintage filmmaker. The film itself is truly the best evidence, far superior to any testimony, recollections and similar descriptive accounts, and this analysis relies upon that best evidence only, for the definitive analysis in the 47 year history of this mysterious piece of film footage. This book is primarily written for the people who have not made up their minds, people who are simply curious about this mysterious film and have not yet formed an opinion as to its authenticity. Hopefully as well, this book will be of value to scholarly people who are willing to evaluate this film with an academic and factual approach. The film is a remarkable mystery, and the controversy surrounding it is a fascinating commentary on human nature. The truth of the Patterson-Gimlin Film is quite an extraordinary story.</p><p><strong>Wanna get creeped out?

      <title>Apollo 1 - The Tragedy That Put Us On The Moon</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is author Ryan Walters who's here to discuss his book Apollo 1: The Tragedy That Put Us On The Moon.
On January 27, 1967, astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee climbed into a new spacecraft perched atop a large Saturn rocket at Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a routine dress rehearsal of their upcoming launch into orbit, then less than a month away. All three astronauts were experienced pilots and had dreams of one day walking on the moon. But little did they know, nor did anyone else, that once they entered the spacecraft that cold winter day they would never leave it alive. The Apollo program would be perilously close to failure before it ever got off the ground.

But rather than dooming the space program, this tragedy caused the spacecraft to be completely overhauled, creating a stellar flying machine to achieve the program’s primary goal: putting man on the moon.

Apollo 1 is a candid portrayal of the astronauts, the disaster that killed them, and its aftermath. In it, readers will learn:

How the Apollo 1 spacecraft was doomed from the start, with miles of uninsulated wiring and tons of flammable materials in a pure oxygen atmosphere, along with a hatch that wouldn’t open

How, due to political pressure, the government contract to build the Apollo 1 craft went to a bidder with an inferior plan

How public opinion polls were beginning to turn against the space program before the tragedy and got much worse after


Apollo 1 is about America fulfilling its destiny of man setting foot on the moon. It’s also about the three American heroes who lost their lives in the tragedy, but whose lives were not lost in vain.

Amazon #1 Best Seller in Unexplained Mysteries AND #1 in Parapsychology Category
**GET BOOK #1: The Secret War: A True Story About A Real Alien War and Shadow People
** #1 BESTSELLING: Jesus Is No Joke: A True Story of an Unlikely Witness Who Saw Jesus &amp;
** NEW BOOK SERIES: Diary Blog of the Fickle Finders: Investigates-The Other "F" Word

“Have you seen this man?” It was a simple image and question posted online that sparked a worldwide awareness that—HE IS REAL! From the author who discovered him and told you about The Shadow People—now learn of the new THREAT!

Victims worldwide have reported seeing this man peering into their homes, their bedrooms, their cribs, their cars, their lives and even—into their souls!

It starts with the feeling of not being alone, only to look to the foot of your bed and find that you are right. There’s a stranger in your room and you KNOW that you see him, worst of all, you KNOW that he sees you, too!

You try to scream or run, only to find that you are paralyzed!

Terror then reaches new levels as he approaches you, leans within inches of your face and lets you know that he is indeed—your worst nightmare!

This is the true story of the beginning of unthinkable horror that you have never heard of before! 

Not many authors can say that they named two paranormal realities like Heidi Hollis! With her personal story and almost 50 encounters detailed inside this book, you’ll soon find that darkness can hide, but the light always wins!

Is there an afterlife? Are such things as Angels and Spirit Guides real? Does God exist? Medium, Philip Kinsella takes the reader on a personal, psychic journey of discovery, revealing that there does indeed appear to be hidden forces assisting mankind in all areas of life. He also demonstrates how communication can be achieved through a variety of means and reveals how consciousness works. The human brain is the conduit which allows such alternate realms of awareness into this third-dimensional matrix we call Earth. Consciousness is the real essence of what we represent on a spiritual nature of reality, and not the flesh-and-blood we occupy. Death, he hypothesises, is not the end, but a process whereby our souls are liberated beyond all the known laws of creation. Angels and Spirit Guides are here to remind us of our inherent greatness; that we are more than we could ever dream. ‘Guardians of the Dead’ also takes into consideration reincarnation and the soul’s ability in recalling past-lives. This warm and honest book reveals the author’s struggles in ascertaining a truth that has been hidden from us – that we ALL survive death!

Then this controversial hard-hitting book of shocking revelations is for you!
What Does the Bible Really Say about the End Times? 
There are so many Christians teaching outrageous speculation about End Times Bible prophecy these days. It’s enough to frustrate the serious Bible student.
What if you found out most of it is simply mistaken?
What if you found out that everything that modern prophecy pundits are looking for -- the Rapture, the Tribulation, the Antichrist, The Beast -- was not what they told you it was, but something different?
What Jesus Himself Said About the End of the Age
Here are a few of the things you’ll be astounded to read about in this book:

You’ll hear Godawa’s own personal journey in changing his understanding of the End Times.

You’ll find out how hyperliteralism corrupts Bible Prophecy interpretation.

Godawa focuses on Jesus’ own predictions about the End of the Age in Matthew 24. 

You’ll discover the dirty little secret behind the so-called Rapture. 

The truth about the Last Days. It’s not what they told you. 

Just what is the Great Tribulation and when did it happen? 

What the heck are those cosmic catastrophes in the heavens? 

The shocking truth about Antichrist and the Abomination of Desolation

You’ll be amazed when you see how the coming of Christ on the clouds has been completely misunderstood by well-meaning but misinformed prophecy pundits. 

This is not newspaper exegesis, but intense Bible study. Guaranteed to inspire your love for God’s Word and His promises to His people

In the late hours of July 22, 1991, Detective Patrick "Pat" Kennedy of the Milwaukee Police Department was asked to respond to a possible homicide. Little did he know that he would soon be delving into the dark mind of one of America's most notorious serial killers, the "Milwaukee Cannibal" Jeffrey Dahmer.
As the media clamored for details, Kennedy spent the next six weeks, sixteen hours a day, locked in an interrogation room with Dahmer. There the 31-year-old killer described in lurid detail how he lured several young men to his apartment where he strangled, sexually assaulted, dismembered, and in some cases, cannibalized his victims.
In GRILLING DAHMER: The Interrogation of "The Milwaukee Cannibal" the reader is taken on a horrifying tour into the mind of evil as Kennedy patiently, meticulously, listened to unspeakable horrors so that a monster would be taken off the streets forever.

The spellbinding true story of an American family of seven tormented by poltergeist activity beyond imagination.
In 2010, The Pennsylvania Paranormal Association (The PPA) was requested to investigate claims of a severe haunting in Upper Darby, PA. Reports of encounters by the family far exceeded those of typical ghostly activity. Following an initial interview, investigators had some skepticism regarding the frequency and magnitude of the activity, as reported. They were wrong!
This true story chronicles events that took place during a comprehensive paranormal investigation, spanning more than two years, with four different visits to a suburban home, just outside of the City of Philadelphia. What was uncovered through the investigation, were angry ghosts, occult spells, entity attachments, and an incredible amount of poltergeist activity.
Readers will learn of the successes and failures of The PPA as the investigation continued and hear about some of the struggles that this family of seven endured for so long.
Mark Allan Keyes, a retired State Police Detective, is currently working as a private investigator. He is a speaker and instructor on paranormal investigation and as a parapsychologist, has been involved in over 200 resolution cases. Keyes is an expert commentator on Travel Channel’s Haunted Hospitals and Paranormal 911. Numerous PPA investigations have been highlighted on Travel Channel’s Paranormal Survivorand Destination America’s The Haunted. Author may be contacted through: www.theppa.net

      <title>The Strange Case of Dr. Doyle: Jack the Ripper </title>
      <description>My special guest is Dr. Daniel Friedman who's here to discuss his book The Strange Case of Dr. Doyle: A Journey Into Madness and Mayhem.
London. 1910. A procession of well-attired gentlemen and ladies are clearly out of place among the stalls and pushcarts of the Whitechapel District. As the group makes its way through the crowded streets, the tour guide stops now and then to point out various places where the mutilated bodies of the women had been found. Although the murders occurred twenty-two years prior, the man leading the group seems to know every detail and aspect of each slaying. Of those things he does not know, he offers freely his own insightful conjecture. This is, however, no average tour of brutal acts. It is a close look at infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper's trail of blood. And the man leading the group is none other than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - famous creator of fictional character Sherlock Holmes, the world’s greatest detective. In The Strange Case of Dr. Doyle, we learn what draws one famous Englishman to another in ways that are as fascinating as they are shocking.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle actually led a tour group to the sites of the Whitechapel Murders in the year 1905. While we do not have an existing description of that tour, authors Daniel Friedman, MD, and Eugene Friedman, MD, have meticulously pieced together Doyle’s own words to create a riveting account of his publicly stated beliefs on each of these horrific murders. As Doyle takes the group on his tour, the reader learns about the victims and the way each died. The authors have also included new pieces of evidence to understand better the murderer known to history only as Jack the Ripper.
Interspersed throughout the tour is the Friedmans’ unique and well-researched account of the life of the young Conan Doyle, which was shrouded in more mystery than any of his own works of fiction. The authors have uncovered facts about which few, if any, Doyle biographers have ever been aware. A work of deep scholarship, mystery, and controversy. Elementary, indeed!

The mainstream media has misinformed us for years about UFO studies conducted by highly regarded scientists associated with some of the finest universities in the country. There is significant evidence that the US government has covered up the alien presence through misinformation, distortion, obfuscation, and ridicule. Some prominent, politically connected scientists have engaged in the cover up. And a few professional writers have helped to successfully label any scientists who have been persuaded by the evidence and brave enough to take a stand as unscientific charlatans, fanatics, and kooks. 
Fact, Fiction, and Flying Saucers examines the wealth of archival documents that clearly demonstrate this cooperative disinformation effort and refute the false claims made by these professional scoffers. Stanton T. Friedman and Kathleen Marden set the record straight by examining politically motivated misinformation and presenting compelling evidence that separates fact from fiction.

In the winter of 1982, a young man of thirteen was abducted from his bedroom, his captors being strange and apparently not of this world. Prior to this, he, along with his twin brother and grandmother, were observed by an otherworldly sphere, which hung over their heads as a soundless electronic eye.It has taken Ronald Kinsella many years to finally document these bizarre events, and in doing so he has drawn some very interesting parallels with these things we call ‘Aliens,’ along with their super-advanced ships. His testimony questions the validity of a paradox that, he reflects, can swiftly change faces to suit what’s in vogue.From his humble beginnings, to the trauma of a solo snatching, Ronald searches for answers as to ‘Why;’ questioning the hogwash so many alleged abductees ramble, in that these strange visitors often proclaim a concern for ‘World Peace,’ when, he reiterates, there has not been one solitary scrap of evidence to support it.This spurred him to research the subject.Ronald contests the validity of these things people call ‘Greys,’ along with observing the disquieting rise of an agenda that will not benefit mankind (The Herd,) in as much as ‘The Powers That Be’ may well be working with something far more sinister than ‘Aliens.’Was the Roswell Crash of 1947 a true saucer in the ‘Spaceman’ sense? Or was it something else? Was it, as Ronald speculates, a clever deception, engineered by minds much darker than we can conceive, and of which was expected to crash in a spectacular and dramatic fashion; aimed at effectively ensnaring the human race in a ploy for ultimate technological subjugation? A thing which has pulled wool over our eyes for long enough, and of which may well have calculated its rise to physicality, once the populace has been fooled and conditioned by its ambiguous intervention.

In the winter of 1982, a young man of thirteen was abducted from his bedroom, his captors being strange and apparently not of this world. Prior to this, he, along with his twin brother and grandmother, were observed by an otherworldly sphere, which hung over their heads as a soundless electronic eye.It has taken Ronald Kinsella many years to finally document these bizarre events, and in doing so he has drawn some very interesting parallels with these things we call ‘Aliens,’ along with their super-advanced ships. His testimony questions the validity of a paradox that, he reflects, can swiftly change faces to suit what’s in vogue.From his humble beginnings, to the trauma of a solo snatching, Ronald searches for answers as to ‘Why;’ questioning the hogwash so many alleged abductees ramble, in that these strange visitors often proclaim a concern for ‘World Peace,’ when, he reiterates, there has not been one solitary scrap of evidence to support it.This spurred him to research the subject.Ronald contests the validity of these things people call ‘Greys,’ along with observing the disquieting rise of an agenda that will not benefit mankind (The Herd,) in as much as ‘The Powers That Be’ may well be working with something far more sinister than ‘Aliens.’Was the Roswell Crash of 1947 a true saucer in the ‘Spaceman’ sense? Or was it something else? Was it, as Ronald speculates, a clever deception, engineered by minds much darker than we can conceive, and of which was expected to crash in a spectacular and dramatic fashion; aimed at effectively ensnaring the human race in a ploy for ultimate technological subjugation? A thing which has pulled wool over our eyes for long enough, and of which may well have calculated its rise to physicality, once the populace has been fooled and conditioned by its ambiguous intervention.

What do modern multiverse theories and spiritualist séances have in common? Not much, it would seem. One is an elaborate scientific theory developed by the world’s most talented physicists. The other is a spiritual practice widely thought of as backward, the product of a mystical world view fading under the modern scientific gaze.

But Christopher G. White sees striking similarities. He does not claim that séances or other spiritual practices are science. Yet he points to ways that both spiritual practices and scientific speculation about multiverses and invisible dimensions are efforts to peer into the hidden elements and even the existential meaning of the universe. Other Worlds examines how the idea that the universe has multiple, invisible dimensions has inspired science fiction, fantasy novels, films, modern art, and all manner of spiritual thought reaching well beyond the realm of formal religion. Drawing on a range of international archives, White analyzes how writers, artists, filmmakers, televangelists, and others have used the scientific idea of invisible dimensions to make supernatural phenomena such as ghosts and miracles seem more reasonable and make spiritual beliefs possible again for themselves and others.

Many regard scientific ideas as disenchanting and secularizing, but Other Worlds shows that these ideas—creatively appropriated in such popular forms as C. S. Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia, the art of Salvador Dalí, or the books of the counterculture physicist “Dr. Quantum”—restore a sense that the world is greater than anything our eyes can see, helping to forge an unexpected kind of spirituality.

What do modern multiverse theories and spiritualist séances have in common? Not much, it would seem. One is an elaborate scientific theory developed by the world’s most talented physicists. The other is a spiritual practice widely thought of as backward, the product of a mystical world view fading under the modern scientific gaze.

But Christopher G. White sees striking similarities. He does not claim that séances or other spiritual practices are science. Yet he points to ways that both spiritual practices and scientific speculation about multiverses and invisible dimensions are efforts to peer into the hidden elements and even the existential meaning of the universe. Other Worlds examines how the idea that the universe has multiple, invisible dimensions has inspired science fiction, fantasy novels, films, modern art, and all manner of spiritual thought reaching well beyond the realm of formal religion. Drawing on a range of international archives, White analyzes how writers, artists, filmmakers, televangelists, and others have used the scientific idea of invisible dimensions to make supernatural phenomena such as ghosts and miracles seem more reasonable and make spiritual beliefs possible again for themselves and others.

Many regard scientific ideas as disenchanting and secularizing, but Other Worlds shows that these ideas—creatively appropriated in such popular forms as C. S. Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia, the art of Salvador Dalí, or the books of the counterculture physicist “Dr. Quantum”—restore a sense that the world is greater than anything our eyes can see, helping to forge an unexpected kind of spirituality.

World-renowned psychic medium and Oxford-educated attorney Mark Anthony bridges the divide between faith and science in this fascinating afterlife exploration, taking you around the globe, from the cosmic to the subatomic, and into the human soul itself. Combining physics, neuroscience, and riveting true stories, this book:


reveals how our “electromagnetic soul” is pure eternal energy that never dies.

takes spirit communication, near-death experiences, and deathbed visions out of the shadows of superstition and into the light of twenty-first-century science.

presents Anthony’s RAFT technique to recognize contact with spirits, accept it as real, feel it without fear, and trust in the experience.

provides hope for recovery from grief, PTSD, survivor’s guilt, or a loved one’s suicide or homicide.

illuminates how contact with spirits is a powerful instrument of healing and love.

From the author of FIRST DEGREE RAGE: The True Story of ‘The Assassin,’ An Obsession, and Murder comes the ongoing and chilling true crime saga of L. C. Underwood, the obsessively jealous police officer from North Carolina. Underwood shocked an entire city with his reign of terror in the lives of his ex-fiancé Kay Weden, a woman he refused to let go, her son Jason whom he despised, and her mother Catherine Miller who got in his way.
In FIRST DEGREE RAGE, Underwood arrogantly evaded justice for his heinous crimes until Detective Paula May and her investigative team uncovered who he really was. Because of their efforts, he was convicted for First Degree Kidnapping and Murder of Viktor Gunnarsson, Kay’s new boyfriend. But was Underwood also responsible for the brutal murder of Catherine Miller that occurred mere days after Gunnarsson’s demise?
Sentenced to life in prison plus forty years, Underwood has no intention of staying in prison and vows not to stop until he exacts revenge on those he blames for his current predicament. His thirst for revenge will not be quenched until more blood is shed. Underwood rages on, plotting his next move, enlisting others to perform the evil deeds he imagines. Wreaking havoc in the lives of Kay, Jason, Detective May, and others, he sends them all on an emotional roller coaster ride that never seems to end. Will they ever find peace? Will Catherine Miller’s murderer ever be brought to justice? Will Underwood’s reign of terror ever be stopped?

Goliath. You know the story. But why is it in the Bible? Is it just to give us a little moral pick-me-up as we seek to emulate a small shepherd boy who defeated a giant? Have you ever wondered where Goliath came from? Did you know he had brothers, one with 24 fingers and toes? Did you know their ancestry is steeped in unimaginable horror?

Genesis 6. The nephilim. The first few verses of this chapter have long been the speculation of supernatural events that produced demigods and a flood that God used to destroy the whole world. The whole world remembers them. Once upon a time, all Christians knew them. But for many centuries this view was mocked, though it was the only known view at the time of the writing of the New Testament. Today, it is making a resurgence among Bible-believing scholars, and for good reason. The nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward...

This book delves deep into the dark and ancient recesses of our past to bring you rich treasures long buried. It is a carefully researched, heavily footnoted, and selectively illustrated story of the giants of the Bible. There is more here than meets the eye, much more. Here you will learn the invisible, supernatural storyline of the Bible that is always just beneath the surface, lurking like the spawn of the ancient leviathan. It is a storyline no person can afford to ignore any longer. 

Unlike other more sensational books on the topic, there is no undue speculation to be found here. The author is a Bible-believing Christian who refuses to use such ideas to tell you the end of the world is drawing nigh. Once you discover the truth about these fantastic creatures, you will come to see the ministry and work of Jesus Christ in a very new and exalting light. Come. Learn the fascinating, sobering, yet true story of real giants who played a significant role in the bible … and still do so today.

Goliath. You know the story. But why is it in the Bible? Is it just to give us a little moral pick-me-up as we seek to emulate a small shepherd boy who defeated a giant? Have you ever wondered where Goliath came from? Did you know he had brothers, one with 24 fingers and toes? Did you know their ancestry is steeped in unimaginable horror?

Genesis 6. The nephilim. The first few verses of this chapter have long been the speculation of supernatural events that produced demigods and a flood that God used to destroy the whole world. The whole world remembers them. Once upon a time, all Christians knew them. But for many centuries this view was mocked, though it was the only known view at the time of the writing of the New Testament. Today, it is making a resurgence among Bible-believing scholars, and for good reason. The nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward...

This book represents over two years of research by a dedicated team of investigators who have taken dozens of reports of a weird, winged humanoid seen around Lake Michigan. Author and investigator Tobias Wayland has collected these reports for the first time in one volume, along with his analysis and insider perspective as a member of the investigative team. The phenomena described within represent the continuation of a decades-long series of events first recorded in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, in the late '60s, but that has likely been with humanity since our advent, and seems just as likely to be with us until our end.

      <title>Spirit Guides, Automatic Writing and Reincarnation</title>
      <description>My special guest is author Susan Starkey who's here to discuss her book called Life After Death Beyond Doubt and you can get it now on Amazon.

Pre-order Kim's new book 'Say This, Not That: When Someone You Know Is Grieving on Amazon
Follow Kim's Page on Facebook

There is one universal question to which there seems to be no definitive answer: what happens to us when we die? Many people have their own individual theories; different faiths have different beliefs. The rest of us we can merely shrug and resign ourselves to the fact that we can never know the unknowable. Just a few years ago, Susan Starkey would have felt the same way. But following a move to Spain, a sequence of astonishing events changed her life dramatically, turning her scepticism on its head, especially regarding the question of what happens to us when we die. Starkey is now convinced that there is a life after death; this book reveals her personal experiences and shares the verifiable evidence of her discoveries. In this profound story, Susan Starkey explains how she uncovered the roots to her past life, along with a vast family network that had been lost to her for centuries. She shares her ability to contact the Spirit World through a new-found ability to communicate through automatic writing. Life After Death Beyond Doubt is a remarkable and insightful guide to the afterlife, one which will bring comfort to others who may be searching for the answers that Susan Starkey has been given. Her work may prove beyond doubt that there is an existence after death and that we never truly die.

A fascinating look into the history of the American sideshow and its performers. Learn what's real, what's fake, and what's just downright bizarre.

You've probably heard of Tom Thumb. The Elephant Man. Perhaps even Chang and Eng, the original Siamese twins. But what about Eli Bowen, the legless acrobat? Or Prince Randian, the human torso? These were just a few of the many stars that shone during the heyday of the American sideshow, from 1840 to 1950. American Sideshow chronicles the lives of truly amazing performers, examining these brave and extraordinary curiosities not just as sideshow performers but as people, delving into the lives they led and the ways they were able to triumph over and even benefit from their abnormalities.

American Sideshow discusses the rise and fall of the original sideshows and their subsequent replacement by today's self-made freaks. With the progress of modern medicine, technological advancements, and the wonderful world of body modification, abnormalities are being overcome, treated and even prevented: Siamese twins can now be separated, and in addition to this, tongues can be forked, horns surgically implanted, and earlobes removed. There are also, of course, modern-day giants, fire eaters, sword swallowers, glass eaters, human blockheads, and oh, so much more. 

These fascinating personalities are celebrated through intimate biographies paired with stunning photographs. Approximately two hundred performers from the past one hundred and sixty years are featured, giving readers a comprehensive and sometimes astonishing look into the history of the American sideshow

A fascinating look into the history of the American sideshow and its performers. Learn what's real, what's fake, and what's just downright bizarre.

You've probably heard of Tom Thumb. The Elephant Man. Perhaps even Chang and Eng, the original Siamese twins. But what about Eli Bowen, the legless acrobat? Or Prince Randian, the human torso? These were just a few of the many stars that shone during the heyday of the American sideshow, from 1840 to 1950. American Sideshow chronicles the lives of truly amazing performers, examining these brave and extraordinary curiosities not just as sideshow performers but as people, delving into the lives they led and the ways they were able to triumph over and even benefit from their abnormalities.

Unlike other books on epidemics, which either focus on the science behind how microbes cause disease or tell first-person accounts of one particular disease, Epidemics: The Impact of Germs and Their Power over Humanity takes a holistic approach to explaining how these diseases have shaped who we are as a society. Each of the worst epidemic diseases is discussed from the perspective of how it has been a causative agent of change with respect to our history, religious traditions, social interactions, and technology. In looking at world history through the lens of epidemic diseases, readers will come to appreciate how much we owe to our oldest and smallest parasites.
Adults and students interested in science and history―and especially anyone who appreciates a good story and has a healthy curiosity for the lesser-known facts of life―will find this book of interest. Health-care workers will also benefit greatly from this text, as will college students majoring in biology or a pre-health field.

"Enthralling; it is well worth the trip.” --New York Journal of Books
Conceived as the most modern, humane incarceration facility the world had ever seen, New York’s Blackwell’s Island, site of a lunatic asylum, two prisons, an almshouse, and a number of hospitals, quickly became, in the words of a visiting Charles Dickens, "a lounging, listless madhouse." Digging through city records, newspaper articles, and archival reports, Stacy Horn tells a gripping narrative through the voices of the island’s inhabitants. We also hear from the era’s officials, reformers, and journalists, including the celebrated undercover reporter Nellie Bly. And we follow the extraordinary Reverend William Glenney French as he ministers to Blackwell’s residents, battles the bureaucratic mazes of the Department of Correction and a corrupt City Hall, testifies at salacious trials, and in his diary wonders about man’s inhumanity to his fellow man. Damnation Island shows how far we’ve come in caring for the least fortunate among us—and reminds us how much work still remains.

"Enthralling; it is well worth the trip.” --New York Journal of Books
Conceived as the most modern, humane incarceration facility the world had ever seen, New York’s Blackwell’s Island, site of a lunatic asylum, two prisons, an almshouse, and a number of hospitals, quickly became, in the words of a visiting Charles Dickens, "a lounging, listless madhouse." Digging through city records, newspaper articles, and archival reports, Stacy Horn tells a gripping narrative through the voices of the island’s inhabitants. We also hear from the era’s officials, reformers, and journalists, including the celebrated undercover reporter Nellie Bly. And we follow the extraordinary Reverend William Glenney French as he ministers to Blackwell’s residents, battles the bureaucratic mazes of the Department of Correction and a corrupt City Hall, testifies at salacious trials, and in his diary wonders about man’s inhumanity to his fellow man. Damnation Island shows how far we’ve come in caring for the least fortunate among us—and reminds us how much work still remains.

Book Description:
If there had been no cover-up of Robert Kennedy's complicity in the murder of Marilyn Monroe in 1962 and he had been prosecuted based on compelling evidence at the time, the assassination of JFK by Bobby's enemies would not have happened - changing the course of history and preventing the murder of media icon Dorothy Kilgallen. 

In a breakthrough book that is sure to be relevant for years to come, best-selling author (The Reporter Who Knew Too Much) and distinguished historian Mark Shaw investigates the connection between the mysterious deaths of motion picture screen siren Marilyn Monroe, President John F. Kennedy, and What's My Line? TV star and crack investigative reporter Dorothy Kilgallen. A former noted criminal defense attorney and network legal analyst, Shaw provides an illuminating perspective as to how Robert Kennedy's abuse of power during the early 1960s resulted in the murders of Marilyn, JFK, and Dorothy.

A radical new history that rediscovers the remarkable freak performers whose talents and charisma helped define an era.

On March 23, 1844, General Tom Thumb, just 25 inches tall, entered the Picture Gallery at Buckingham Palace and bowed low to Queen Victoria. On both sides of the Atlantic, this meeting marked a tipping point in the nineteenth century, and the age of the freak was born.

Bewitching all levels of society, it was a world of curiosities and astonishing spectacle—of dwarfs, giants, bearded ladies, Siamese twins, and swaggering showmen. But the real stories—human dramas that so often eclipsed the fantasy presented on the stage—of the performing men, women and children, have been forgotten or marginalized in the histories of the very people who exploited them.

In this richly evocative account, John Woolf uses a wealth of recently discovered material to bring to life the sometimes tragic, sometimes triumphant, always extraordinary stories of people who used their (dis)abilities and difference to become some of the first international celebrities.

Through their lives we discover afresh some of the great transformations of the age: the birth of show business, of celebrity, of advertising, and of “alternative facts” while also exploring the tensions between the power of fame, the impact of exploitation, and our fascination with “otherness.”

A cold case investigation of a notorious serial killer who terrorized 1970s Washington D.C. by the New York Times bestselling true crime coauthors.

In 1971 and 1972, a deadly predator stalked the streets of the nation’s capital. His targets were young girls whose fates included rape and torture before their brutalized corpses were left in plain view along busy roadways. Seven victims raging from the ages of ten to eighteen died in his hands.

On one victim he left a note, taunting police and claiming the media’s name for him: The Freeway Phantom. Then, as abruptly as he started, the Freeway Phantom stopped.

Decades later, Washington DC’s oldest unsolved serial killing spree is pried open with the suspects, the liars, and the evidence laid bare. Father-daughter true crime investigators Blaine Pardoe and Victoria Hester shed new light and provide tantalizing new clues as to who the Freeway Phantom may be.

Father-daughter true crime investigators Blaine Pardoe and Victoria Hester shed new light and provide tantalizing new clues as to who the Freeway Phantom may be.

Fully Revised and Expanded -The Saturn Death Cult is an investigation into ancient planetary upheavals that heralded the birth and destruction of a fabled Golden Age. It attempts to trace how, following the demise of this Golden Age, mankind then degenerated into the obsessive pursuit of wealth and power through the perverted horrors of slavery, child sacrifice and mass-murder rituals.

This 2nd edition is pack full of new information, graphics and images. A better placement and explanation for the last great Ice Age is offered and more detailed graphical analysis on the Saturn system of planets is provided. Occult Saturnian symbolism is delved into more deeply and new evidence for the existence of a Saturn cult within the Italian Renaissance elite is discussed.

The author poses a solution for why the planet Saturn is portrayed in mythology as our original sun where it was said to be fixed in the heavens at Earth’s celestial north and from where it watched over the ancients like the All-seeing Eye of god.

An explanation is then forwarded explaining why today’s frightening sex-murder cults and secret societies are nothing more than a twisted, yet deadly legacy of a time when people yearned for the rebirth of the planet Saturn as our original sun and source of life and light. This is linked to the ancient practice of money lending and the consequences of this practice for today’s international financial crisis.

The conclusion is reached that there is a disturbing occult connection to the planet Saturn and its influence over a perceived worldwide collective march towards fulfilling a terrifying elitist agenda of ‘justifiable’ global genocide.

      <title>The Dead Travel Fast: Vampire Communities Around The World</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/the-dead-travel-fast/</link>
      <description>My special guest is author Eric Nuzum who's here to discuss his world travels to discover what's really behind the fascination for vampires. Get his book The Dead Travel Fast: Stalking Vampires from Nosferatu To Count Chocula on Amazon.
The undead are everywhere. They're not just in movies and books, but in commercials, fetish clubs, and even in your breakfast cereal. Bloodsuckers have become some of the most recognizable bad guys in the modern world, and Eric Nuzum wanted to find out why. He was willing to do whatever it took —even drinking his own blood—in his quest to understand the vampire phenomenon. And he found the answer in Goth clubs, darkened parks, haunted houses, and . . . chain restaurants.

In this amazing book are hundreds of unbelievable examples of The Fire Within, culled from long-forgotten obscure medical journals and never-before-published interviews with witnesses to the impossible.
What is the evidence? How do firemen react to mounds of human ashes found inside unburned buildings, even inside unscorched clothing?
Are these merely "smoking mishaps" as coroners claim, or deaths far less easily explained away? Why do facts crying out for answers meet with suppression of evidence; denial; debunking?
If no other explanation can resolve these human fireballs, then SHC must be added to the growing catalog of mystery ailments that plague mankind.
Thus more questions are raised. Can the human body cremate itself biochemically? Or by its own electrical energy within? Is there a new form of energy (energies) being revealed that may herald limitless non-polluting power? What is the role of geography, quantum physics, and - indeed - human consciousness in outbreaks of SHC?

This international true crime anthology reveals more than a century of classy crooks and principled pirates from East Chicago to the South China Sea.

Sometimes the nicest people make the best criminals. This volume introduces real-life characters who broke the law for all the right reasons—or committed devious acts with the friendliest of faces. It features incredible stories from across the globe, written by award-winning crime writers, true-crime podcasters, and journalists such as Tom Larsen, David Blumenfeld, and Anthony Ferguson.

You’ll meet Freddie Brenman, the fearsome Chicago street-fighter and trusted friend of John Dillinger; Naún Briones, the Ecuadorian Robin Hood whose outlaw exploits are the stuff of legend; Ching Shih, the nineteenth-century lady pirate who fought Imperial China; and many others.

Born as a highly aware psychic child in Chester, England, Christopher Mackiln is one of five Melchizedek beings on the planet today. He was often visited by negative ETs as a young child in his room at night. His screams brought his parents to his side but not believing him, they felt that Christopher was only experiencing nightmares. This left young Christopher to learn early on how to deal with the presence of negative ETs in his life. He began to use his psychic abilities and the power inherent in his Melchizedek Soul to understand why they were visiting him, how to remove them from the planet and how to heal the manipulations and violations that he eventually understood they were inflicting on an unsuspecting humanity. These early experiences would form the basis of Christopher’s life work.

Today Christopher is an internationally known energy healer who specializes in healing people from all forms of illness, especially those created through ET technologies such Morgellons, Lyme, etc. He specializes in healing abductees and others who have suffered related negative ET trauma. He assists people in removing negative ET presences from their lives, clearing homes and land and closing multidimensional portals.

Born as a highly aware psychic child in Chester, England, Christopher Macklin was able to perceive energy fields, spirit activity and multi-dimensional phenomena from a very young age. He initially took the more traditional route through life and tried to fit in best as he could, but his career as a successful aviation industry engineer came to an abrupt end when a failed real estate venture caused a series of financial difficulties that resulted in Christopher living out of the back of his car, homeless on the streets of Manchester, England.

Born as a highly aware psychic child in Chester, England, Christopher Mackiln is one of five Melchizedek beings on the planet today. He was often visited by negative ETs as a young child in his room at night. His screams brought his parents to his side but not believing him, they felt that Christopher was only experiencing nightmares. This left young Christopher to learn early on how to deal with the presence of negative ETs in his life. He began to use his psychic abilities and the power inherent in his Melchizedek Soul to understand why they were visiting him, how to remove them from the planet and how to heal the manipulations and violations that he eventually understood they were inflicting on an unsuspecting humanity. These early experiences would form the basis of Christopher’s life work.

Today Christopher is an internationally known energy healer who specializes in healing people from all forms of illness, especially those created through ET technologies such Morgellons, Lyme, etc. He specializes in healing abductees and others who have suffered related negative ET trauma. He assists people in removing negative ET presences from their lives, clearing homes and land and closing multidimensional portals. He also works tirelessly with “illuminati fall out children” who have been mind-controlled and physically tortured by ET influenced governmental agencies and institutions. In addition, he works very closely with the Pleadians and Arcturians to help heal and rebalance humanity. He has a new book and protocol out that addresses the negative ET presence and how it has affected humanity.

An accessible, concise primer on the neurological trait of synesthesia―vividly felt sensory couplings―by a founder of the field.
One in twenty-three people carry the genes for the synesthesia. Not a disorder but a neurological trait―like perfect pitch―synesthesia creates vividly felt cross-sensory couplings. A synesthete might hear a voice and at the same time see it as a color or shape, taste its distinctive flavor, or feel it as a physical touch. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, Richard Cytowic, the expert who returned synesthesia to mainstream science after decades of oblivion, offers a concise, accessible primer on this fascinating human experience.
Cytowic explains that synesthesia's most frequent manifestation is seeing days of the week as colored, followed by sensing letters, numerals, and punctuation marks in different hues even when printed in black. Other manifestations include tasting food in shapes, seeing music in moving colors, and mapping numbers and other sequences spatially. One synesthete declares, “Chocolate smells pink and sparkly”; another invents a dish (chicken, vanilla ice cream, and orange juice concentrate) that tastes intensely blue. Cytowic, who in the 1980s revived scientific interest in synesthesia, sees it now understood as a spectrum, an umbrella term that covers five clusters of outwardly felt couplings that can occur via several pathways. Yet synesthetic or not, each brain uniquely filters what it perceives. Cytowic reminds us that each individual's perspective on the world is thoroughly subjective.

      <title>Hidden History: Ancient Aliens and the Suppressed Origins of Civilization </title>

      <description>Enjoy the AD-FREE versions of our latest episodes and our archives right now.


Joining me tonight is Jim Willis who's here to discuss his research into where humans really originated from. Get his book now on Amazon.

Investigates and questions the scientific consensus on the origins of civilization
Do we, the human species, really know who we are or where we came from or how we originated or our place in the cosmos? Or is much of what we have been taught wrong or misguided or possibly even blatant lies intended to keep people in power and everyone else in line? 
Exploring alternative theories on the establishment of society and civilization, Hidden History: Ancient Aliens and the Suppressed Origins of Civilization looks at a variety of dissenting, suppressed, and forbidden accounts of history and the origins of humanity. It takes a broad and inclusive survey of historical documents, various theories, and a wide array of perspectives to explore what conventional wisdom might have gotten right and wrong. 
The book serves as a useful introduction into the suppressed accounts of the origins of modern civilization. It combines cutting-edge science with metaphysical, spiritual, and even paranormal views, daring to ask whether there might be a better explanation for humanity’s existence and the origins of civilization than the current scientific consensus. 
Hidden History looks at the multiverse and parallel dimensions, the ancient alien theory, metaphysics, and hypotheses beyond physical perception, the eleven dimensions of string theory, radio telescopes that penetrate to the event horizon of our universe, mathematical equations that take us where no one has gone before, and the world-wide sharing of experiences old and new that speak of long forgotten ancient mythologies that reveal historical truths. 
With more than 120 photos and graphics, this tome is richly illustrated. Its helpful bibliography provides sources for further exploration, and an extensive index adds to its usefulness. This fascinating book is a thorough investigation and examination of the mysteries surrounding early civilizations, their myths, legends, histories, monuments—and lasting legacies.

It combines cutting-edge science with metaphysical, spiritual, and even paranormal views, daring to ask whether there might be a better explanation for humanity’s existence and the origins of civilization than the current scientific consensus. </p><p><em>Hidden History</em> looks at the multiverse and parallel dimensions, the ancient alien theory, metaphysics, and hypotheses beyond physical perception, the eleven dimensions of string theory, radio telescopes that penetrate to the event horizon of our universe, mathematical equations that take us where no one has gone before, and the world-wide sharing of experiences old and new that speak of long forgotten ancient mythologies that reveal historical truths. </p><p>With more than 120 photos and graphics, this tome is richly illustrated. Its helpful bibliography provides sources for further exploration, and an extensive index adds to its usefulness. This fascinating book is a thorough investigation and examination of the mysteries surrounding early civilizations, their myths, legends, histories, monuments—and lasting legacies.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>BECOME A PLUS PASS MEMBER TO ACCESS ARCHIVED EPISODES AND MORE!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mysterious-radio-paranormal-ufo-lore-interviews/id1145222943"><strong>APPLE IPHONE USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PLUS PASS MEMBER ON APPLE PODCASTS</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://mysteriousradio.supercast.com/"><strong>ANDROID USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PASS MEMBER AND LISTEN FROM MOST PODCAST APPS</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>PLUS PASS MEMBER BENEFITS:</strong></p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO<strong> MYSTERIOUS RADIO</strong> <strong>PLUS:</strong></p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO PARANORMAL FEARS!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO SEVEN!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO <strong>OVER 150 HOURS </strong>OF ARCHIVED EPISODES!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS</strong> TO CONTROVERSIAL EPISODES!</p><p><strong>AD-FREE ACCESS </strong>TO <strong>BONUS EPISODES </strong>FOR MEMBERS ONLY!</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://themysteriousradiocollective.mn.co/"><strong>Request To Join Our Private Community</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p><br></p><p>Visit our home on the web: <a href="https://www.mysteriousradio.com/">https://www.mysteriousradio.com</a></p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mysteriousradio/">@mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Follow us on TikTok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mysteriousradio?lang=en">mysteriousradioTikTok</a></p><p>Follow us on Twitter<a href="https://www.twitter.com/mysteriousradio"> @mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Follow us on Pinterest <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/mysteriousradio">pinterest.com/mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Like us on Facebook<a href="http://www.facebook.com/mysteriousradio"> Facebook.com/mysteriousradio</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want All Paranormal Episodes?

      <title>Haunted Hollywood </title>
      <description>My special guest is author and researcher Tom Ogden who's here to discuss the famous spirits Hollywood that remain after death.


Mysterious Radio is starting a spin off podcast called Paranormal Fears! If you love to hear a sh*t load of in-depth interviews that are ONLY about supernatural phenomena this is your home! New shows are being produced now and will start releasing at the end of this month! Follow 'Paranormal Fears' on any podcast app or Apple Podcasts.


Are phantoms “alive” and walking the streets of Tinseltown and beyond?
Hollywood. Film capital of the world. Haunted Hollywood brings together twenty-five stories that capture both the spirit—and the spirits—of Tinseltown. These tales concern historic landmarks, theaters, watering holes, hotels, and houses that are haunted by movie stars, television personalities, and other celebrities. You will be shivering in your seat as you read about all these and more:

• Film siren Jean Harlow died at only twenty-six, but many believe she's still “living” in her old home outside Beverly Hills.

• Elke Sommer, the German-born actress and artist, is convinced a ghost saved her life by waking her after her house caught fire. Who's to say?

• John Wayne has ridden off into the Final Sunset, but he apparently misses his private yacht. He's been known to come aboard from time to time. . .

The US government has spent half the time covering up conspiracies as it has spent helping the American people. In Hidden History, you will see the amount of effort over the past fifty years that our government has dedicated to lying and covering up the truth to the world. 
Starting with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Don Jeffries chronicles a wide variety of issues that have plagued our country's history. Whether it's the assassinations of MLK and RFK, Iran-Contra, the Oklahoma City bombing, TWA Flight 800, voting fraud, or 9/11, every major disaster or war that we've witnessed has somehow been distorted by those who are supposed to be protecting us. 
Jeffries also delves into extensive research on the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., and you'll be shocked by what he finds out. 
So whether you've only heard bits and pieces of these stories or have read several books on the topics, Hidden History is the book that belongs in every conspiracy theorist's library, as the information included in this encyclopedia has never been collected together in any other published work available. So sit down, strap in, and get ready to be shocked and awed by how much has been hidden from you by our government over the past fifty years. 
Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history - books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.

Whether it's the assassinations of MLK and RFK, Iran-Contra, the Oklahoma City bombing, TWA Flight 800, voting fraud, or 9/11, every major disaster or war that we've witnessed has somehow been distorted by those who are supposed to be protecting us. 
Jeffries also delves into extensive research on the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., and you'll be shocked by what he finds out. 
So whether you've only heard bits and pieces of these stories or have read several books on the topics, Hidden History is the book that belongs in every conspiracy theorist's library, as the information included in this encyclopedia has never been collected together in any other published work available. So sit down, strap in, and get ready to be shocked and awed by how much has been hidden from you by our government over the past fifty years. 
Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history - books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.

Activate the raw power of your subconscious to create the life you've always wanted, using six essential lessons from one of the world’s most renowned hypnotherapists in this “nourishing and healing book” (Michael Bernard Beckwith, author of Spiritual Liberation). 
Unsatisfying careers. Volatile, unhealthy relationships. Unfulfilled dreams. Too many of us are living lives that fall short of what we truly desire. But as celebrity hypnotist Kimberly Friedmutter explains in this life-changing audiobook, not only is it possible to design the life of your dreams, but the power to do so already lies within you, in your subconscious mind.
The subconscious is the root of your true power and desire; it's your inner child, your authentic self. It is the honest compass that will lead you to a life of happiness, so long as you are able to follow its direction. We all have the power to access it, but as we grow up, we’re taught to stop daydreaming and to follow society’s rules, which makes us disconnect from our subconscious, often with tragic results.
In Subconscious Power, Kimberly guides you through six principles that bring your conscious mind in line with your subconscious desires. She shares practical three-minute exercises that will help you transform your relationships, find true love, lose weight after years of struggling with the scale, overcome addictions, and achieve new career successes and heights. Featuring inspiring success stories and the practical tools you need to make meaningful change, Subconscious Power gives “you a pathway to achieve your goals and dreams in an effective and easily understandable manner. This book will improve your life in ways you never thought of” (David Zelon, producer of Soul Surfer).

I'm a 64-year-old retired lawyer and former Assistant Attorney General with an unusual story to tell. Every word of it is true. It happened in a state park known as Devil's Den. For fear of losing my job and damaging my reputation in the legal community, I never spoke about the incident. If it hadn't happened to me, I'd be skeptical too. 
In 1977, I was an active duty NCO in the USAF. A friend and I planned a two-night camping trip to explore the wilderness. Hoping to photograph eagles we sought a remote area on high ground. We drove deep into the forest until we came to a high plateau. It was the perfect location. We had forest to our back and a large open meadow in front of us. The view was amazing. We made camp and settled in for an evening around the campfire. 
Late in the evening I noticed the forest sounds of crickets and tree frogs we'd heard just an hour earlier had all stopped. The silence unnerved me but my friend Toby assured me our laughter and chatter had quieted them and they'd soon return. I still felt unsettled. Looking to the west Toby asked, Where those lights there before? I turned to look. There on the horizon sat a perfect triangle of three very bright stars. We studied them for a few minutes and were speculating what they might be...when they suddenly moved. They rotated once as if on an axis and began a slow ascent into the night sky. 
The three points of light remained equidistant to one another, gaining altitude and speed. The lights on each point of the triangle grew brighter too, as the triangle expanded. The area inside the triangle was solid black, much darker than the surrounding night sky. As it moved past stars they would blink out for a moment and then blink back on once it had passed. I recall the uneasiness I felt a half-hour earlier was gone. I asked my friend, Hey, Tobe...are you afraid? He didn't r

When it comes to spontaneous healing, skepticism abounds. Doctors are taught that “miraculous” recoveries are flukes, and as a result they don’t study those cases or take them into account when treating patients.

Enter Dr. Jeffrey Rediger, who has spent over 15 years studying spontaneous healing, pioneering the use of scientific tools to investigate recoveries from incurable illnesses. Dr. Rediger’s research has taken him from America’s top hospitals to healing centers around the world―and along the way he’s uncovered insights into why some people beat the odds.

In Cured, Dr. Rediger digs down to the root causes of illness, showing how to create an environment that sets the stage for healing. He reveals the patterns behind healing and lays out the physical and mental principles associated with recovery: first, we need to physically heal our diet and our immune systems. Next, we need to mentally heal our stress response and our identities.

Through rigorous research, Dr. Rediger shows that much of our physical reality is created in our minds. Our perception changes our experience, even to the point of changing our physical bodies―and thus the healing of our identity may be our greatest tool to recovery.

Ultimately, miracles only contradict what we know of nature at this point in time. Cured leads the way in explaining the science behind these miracles, and provides a first-of-its-kind guidebook to both healing and preventing disease.

Through rigorous research, Dr. Rediger shows that much of our physical reality is created in our minds. Our perception changes our experience, even to the point of changing our physical bodies―and thus the healing of our identity may be our greatest tool to recovery.

Ultimately, miracles only contradict what we know of nature at this point in time. Cured leads the way in explaining the science behind these miracles, and provides a first-of-its-kind guidebook to both healing and preventing disease.

During the first half of the twentieth century, the Peoria State Hospital was the premiere mental health facility of its day. Dr. George Zeller instituted the eight-hour workday for his staff, removed patient restraints, and made the asylum into a model for the care of the mentally ill. Today, there are only a few buildings of the hospital left. Some of them are still in use, others are inhabited only by ghosts. Our guide to these ghosts -- and the history they represent -- is Sylvia Shults. In Fractured Spirits: Hauntings at the Peoria State Hospital, she brings a passion for paranormal investigation to her adventures at this haunted hotspot. The spirits come to life once more as Shults explores their former home. Other voices help her tell the story: this is a collection of people's experiences at the Peoria State Hospital. Ghost hunting groups, sensitives, former nurses, and ordinary people share their stories with us, their voices resonating to create a panoramic view to rival the vista of the Illinois River. To visit the remaining buildings of the Peoria State Hospital today is to visit a small piece of history. A ghost story over a hundred years in the making, Fractured Spirits is narrative nonfiction at its finest.

      <title>American Sherlock </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/american-sherlock/</link>
      <description>My special guest is Kate Winkler Dawson here to discuss her new book American Sherlock about America's first and greatest forensic scientist. Get her book on Amazon.

From the acclaimed author of Death in the Air ("Not since Devil in the White City has a book told such a harrowing tale"--Douglas Preston) comes the riveting story of the birth of criminal investigation in the twentieth century.

Berkeley, California, 1933. In a lab filled with curiosities--beakers, microscopes, Bunsen burners, and hundreds upon hundreds of books--sat an investigator who would go on to crack at least two thousand cases in his forty-year career. Known as the "American Sherlock Holmes," Edward Oscar Heinrich was one of America's greatest--and first--forensic scientists, with an uncanny knack for finding clues, establishing evidence, and deducing answers with a skill that seemed almost supernatural.

Heinrich was one of the nation's first expert witnesses, working in a time when the turmoil of Prohibition led to sensationalized crime reporting and only a small, systematic study of evidence. However with his brilliance, and commanding presence in both the courtroom and at crime scenes, Heinrich spearheaded the invention of a myriad of new forensic tools that police still use today, including blood spatter analysis, ballistics, lie-detector tests, and the use of fingerprints as courtroom evidence. His work, though not without its serious--some would say fatal--flaws, changed the course of American criminal investigation.

Based on years of research and thousands of never-before-published primary source materials, American Sherlock captures the life of the man who pioneered the science our legal system now relies upon--as well as the limits of those techniques and the very human experts who wield them.

      <title>A 50 Year Journey Into Madness and Murder </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/a-50-year-journey-into-madness-and-murder/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is a foreign correspondent Ivor Davis who's here to discuss his research into the twisted mind of Charles Manson and his heinous crimes. Get his book Manson Exposed: A Reporter's Fifty-Year Journey into Madness and Murder on Amazon.

American based Foreign correspondent Ivor Davis, delivers a gripping, “I was there” eye witness, inside story about the most notorious murder spree of the 20th century. 
In Manson Exposed: A Reporter’s Fifty-Year Journey into Madness and Murder,Davis is the brutally honest guide to this true crime horror story.
In this mix of personal memoir, criticism, and investigative journalism, Davis delivers a truly original take on the byzantine case that terrified and mesmerized the nation, including his new conclusion that THE BEATLES DIDN’T MAKE THEM DO IT.
Davis was on the front lines of the story and offers vivid, personal accounts, interviews and hitherto unknown details from the very beginning right up to the death of the blue collar psycho named Charles Manson.
He charts the tragic inside stories not only of the those murdered but of the long list of Collateral Damage victims: the rock star, the Oscar winning director and the entertainment legends, whose lives were also destroyed by Charles Manson and his crackpot acolytes.

      <itunes:summary>My special guest tonight is a foreign correspondent Ivor Davis who's here to discuss his research into the twisted mind of Charles Manson and his heinous crimes. Get his book Manson Exposed: A Reporter's Fifty-Year Journey into Madness and Murder on Amazon.

American based Foreign correspondent Ivor Davis, delivers a gripping, “I was there” eye witness, inside story about the most notorious murder spree of the 20th century. 
In Manson Exposed: A Reporter’s Fifty-Year Journey into Madness and Murder,Davis is the brutally honest guide to this true crime horror story.
In this mix of personal memoir, criticism, and investigative journalism, Davis delivers a truly original take on the byzantine case that terrified and mesmerized the nation, including his new conclusion that THE BEATLES DIDN’T MAKE THEM DO IT.
Davis was on the front lines of the story and offers vivid, personal accounts, interviews and hitherto unknown details from the very beginning right up to the death of the blue collar psycho named Charles Manson.
He charts the tragic inside stories not only of the those murdered but of the long list of Collateral Damage victims: the rock star, the Oscar winning director and the entertainment legends, whose lives were also destroyed by Charles Manson and his crackpot acolytes.

New Hampshire couple Betty and Barney Hill provided Americans with what is essentially the original alien abduction story. Since their story became public in the early 1960s, many thousands of Americans have likewise come forward with similar stories of traumatic experiences. Sometimes the abductee has little conscious recollection of these events, but through nightmares, dreams, flashbacks and hypnosis they eventually learn more. Sometimes the participants are bewildered. To get a better understanding of the opposing viewpoints of skeptic and believer, the Betty and Barney Hill case is used to examine the wider context of such encounters, their historical origins, media influences and the latest extraterrestrial, psychological, paranormal, conspiracy and sociological theories that surround them.

      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is psychic medium Nicky Alan who has successfully rebounded after suffering from a chronic illness and thoughts of suicide. Get her book M.E. Myself and I - Diary of a Psychic on Amazon.
'This book is a refreshing and real story. Horrific, but real. Her sufferings have made her the strong, compassionate woman she now is, a shining light, a beacon of hope to the world. This is her unique contribution to humanity, timeless in its strong message of hope to us all. You will not be able to put this book down, guaranteed!' Eileen McCourt, 'Living the Magic - Connecting the physical and Spiritual Worlds'


M.E. Myself and I follows the story of a woman struck down with M.E and Fibromyalgia in the prime of her life as a successful TV psychic medium. Left with nothing but two dustbin bags, demons from the past and her two dogs, she embarks on an incredible journey. Grieving her old life and begrudgingly accepting guidance from angels and spirit guides after losing her faith, she finds a reason to live from the brink of suicide by experiencing celestial miracles and a passion to write.

This inspirational self-help spiritual memoir highlights a chronic illness pandemic sweeping through the world that society has shamefully neglected. Her esoteric voice representing the ‘millions missing' brings hope, faith and a definitive strength of the human spirit during the injustice of one life altering episode after another.

      <title>The Power of Energy Healing </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Dr. Susana Stoica who's here to discuss energy healing and her life as a healer. Dr. Stoica has healed many people over the years including her mother as a young child. Get her book Healing with a Loving Heart: Discover the Power of Energy Healing on Amazon!
Healing with a Loving Heart: Discover the Power of Energy Healing is filled with true stories of healing when all hope was lost. It addresses a wide range of diseases, shows why ALS does not have to be a terminal illness and gives insights into the autism spectrum, delayed brain trauma, the use of energy healing to help the body accept a newly transplanted organ, and how some illnesses respond well to alternative solutions when mainstream medicine has no effect. This encouraging book also discusses the process of healing, healer-doctor interactions, and how to stay healthy, as well as what you can do to help yourself if given a certain diagnosis. 

David Brownstein, MD, author of 16 books on alternative healing, has the following to say about this book: "Susana has helped countless patients in my practice and many others. She has a gift that is special. Her book, Healing with a Loving Heart, is written with her heart. I find her description of what she feels [when doing her healing work] correlates with my conventional medical paradigm... This book is more than worth the read. It should be part of your library.”

By looking backward at the course of great extinctions, a paleontologist sees what the future holds.
More than 200 million years ago, a cataclysmic event known as the Permian extinction destroyed more than 90 percent of all species and nearly 97 percent of all living things. Its origins have long been a puzzle for paleontologists. During the 1990s and the early part of this century, a great battle was fought between those who thought that death had come from above and those who thought something more complicated was at work.
Paleontologist Peter. D. Ward, fresh from helping prove that an asteroid had killed the dinosaurs, turned to the Permian problem, and he has come to a stunning conclusion. In his investigations of the fates of several groups of mollusks during that extinction and others, he discovered that the near-total devastation at the end of the Permian period was caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide leading to climate change. But it's not the heat (nor the humidity) that's directly responsible for the extinctions, and the story of the discovery of what is responsible makes for a fascinating, globe-spanning adventure. 
In Under a Green Sky, Ward explains how the Permian extinction as well as four others happened, and describes the freakish oceans—belching poisonous gas—and sky—slightly green and always hazy—that would have attended them. Those ancient upheavals demonstrate that the threat of climate change cannot be ignored, lest the world's life today—ourselves included—face the same dire fate that has overwhelmed our planet several times before.

      <title>Haunted Burial Mounds</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is archaeologist Fritz Zimmerman who's here to discuss the paranormal activity around burial mounds that contained the remains of ancient giants.
This is a compilation of historical accounts that contradict everything we have been taught about ancient America. The accounts are substantiated by the testimony of the Native Americans who lived in the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley regions of North America. American Indians speak of a people who were skilled in arts and engaged in trade whose remains could be found in the burial mounds. These legends are validated by the hundreds of miles of canals extending into the Mississippi River and the extensive copper and lead mines. Early settlers in the Ohio Valley described ancient cities with well-defined evidence of streets laid out at regular intervals and intersected at right angles with other streets. Stone macadamized roads were also evidence of an industrious people engaged in commerce.

New information from the British Isles places the Celtic peoples on the Island earlier than previously believed. The Celtic pagan religion is superimposed on ancient sites in the Ohio Valley with indistinguishable characteristics. Ancient ceremonial sites in the Ohio Valley are re-examined under the looking glass of the Celtic Gods and Goddesses.

The ancient mound builders practiced a cult of the dead and buried their deceased in burial mounds to act as portals to connect the living with the dead. These portals remain open today and are the gateways for much of the paranormal activity found in the Great Lakes region. While not the focus of the stories presented, many of the skeletons discovered at the ancient sites were of gigantic size. The connection to the paranormal is elaborated in the Book of Enoch

      <title>Cannabis in Spiritual Practice </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is author Will Johnson who's here to tell you how cannabis can help you get closer to the Divine.
An exploration of the use of cannabis as a sacrament in spiritual practice 

• Provides instructions for using marijuana for the spiritual practices of spontaneous movement, ecstatic dance, sitting meditation, and gazing meditation, allowing you to open the body’s energies more fully and get closer to the Divine or your higher self 

• Includes a new translation of the Five Moral Precepts of Buddhism, adapted to include energetic practices and the judicious use of entheogenic substances as a legitimate support for spiritual growth 

• Includes access to 9 audio meditations 

With the end of marijuana prohibition on the horizon, people are now openly seeking a spiritual path that embraces the benefits of cannabis. Drawing upon his decades of experience as a teacher of Buddhism, breathing, yoga, and embodied spirituality, Will Johnson examines Eastern spiritual perspectives on marijuana and offers specific guidelines and exercises for integrating cannabis into spiritual practice. 

The author explains how the great Hindu god Shiva enjoyed consuming bhang, a marijuana mixture that would cause his body to make spontaneous movements. From these cannabis-inspired movements, Shiva brought the body-focused practices of dance and yoga to the world. Examining the spiritual path of Shiva, including the Sadhu tradition, Johnson provides specific instructions and protocols for using marijuana as a sacrament as Shiva did. He explores how to embrace cannabis for the practices of spontaneous movement, ecstatic dance, sitting meditation, and gazing meditation. He reveals how the ecstatic surrender to the feeling energies of the body in these practices is enhanced through the ingestion of Shiva’s herb, allowing you to open the body’s energies more fully and get closer to the Divine or your higher self.

      <title>Killer Triggers w/ Homicide Hunter Lt. Joe Kenda </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/killer-triggers-w-homicide-hunter-lt-joe-kenda/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Lt. Joe Kenda who starred in Homicide Hunter: Lt. Joe Kenda, an American true-crime documentary series that ran for nine seasons on the Investigation Discovery network and was aired in sixty-nine countries and territories worldwide. He's here to discuss his new book called Killer Triggers that's available now on Amazon!
The most common triggers for homicide are fear, rage, revenge, money, lust, and, more rarely, sheer madness. This isn't an exact science, of course. Any given murder can have multiple triggers. Sex and revenge seem to be common partners in crime. Rage, money, and revenge make for a dangerous trifecta of triggers, as well.
This book offers my memories of homicide cases that I investigated or oversaw. In each case, I examine the trigger that led to death. I chose this theme for the book because even though the why of a murder case may not be critical in an investigation, it can sometimes lead us to the killer.
And even if we solve a case without knowing the trigger, the why still intrigues us, disrupting our dreams and lingering in our minds, perhaps because each of us fears the demons that lie within our own psyche -- the triggers waiting to be pulled.



Lt. Joe Kenda, a twenty-three-year veteran of the Colorado Springs Police Department, spent twenty-one years chasing killers as a homicide detective and commander of the major crimes unit. Kenda and his team solved 356 of his 387 homicide cases.

      <title>Chasing Bill Cosby </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is Nicole Weisensee Egan who is an award-winning journalist, former senior writer for People Magazine and Bill Cosby's worst nightmare. Get her book Chasing Cosby to read what she uncovered about American's pudding pop hero.

Bill Cosby's decades-long career as a sweater-wearing, wholesome TV dad came to a swift and stunning end on April 26, 2018, when he was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand. The mounting allegations against Bill Cosby - more than 60 women have come forward to accuse him of similar crimes - and his ultimate conviction were a shock to Americans, who wanted to cleave to their image of Cosby as a pudding-pop hero. 
Award-winning journalist and former People Magazine senior writer Nicki Weisensee Egan was the first reporter to dig into the story when Constand went to the police in 2005. Other news organizations looked away, but Egan doggedly investigated the case, developing ties with entrenched sources and discovering incriminating details that would ultimately come to influence the prosecution. 
In her debut audiobook, Chasing Cosby, Egan shares her firsthand account of Cosby's 13-year run from justice. She tells us how Cosby planned and executed his crimes and how Hollywood alliances and law enforcement knew what Cosby was doing but did nothing to stop him. A veteran crime reporter, Egan also explores the cultural and social issues that influenced the case, delving into the psychological calculations of a serial predator and into the psyche of a nation that fervently wanted to put their faith in the innocence of "American's Dad".

      <title>44 Years in Darkness</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Tonight, Sylvia Shultz joins me to discuss how a woman spent 44 years of her life locked away in a utica crib to the point of scratching her eyes out, pulling her teeth, loosing the ability to speak and resembling a skeletal figure...covered in rags. The mindset of care takers in those early days was truly bizarre!
Lost in the shadows of Illinois asylums in the nineteenth century is the strange story of Rhoda Derry. Left at the Adams County Poor Farm when her family could no longer care for her, she spent the next 40 years confined in a wooden box. Abandoned, ignored, and traumatized, she had clawed out her own eyes, pulled her own teeth, and her legs were atrophied to the point that she could not stand on her own, or even sit in a wheelchair. She spent four decades locked away from the world. Her crime? Falling in love.

Rhoda suffered a mental breakdown after being "cursed" by the mother of a boy to whom she was engaged to marry. Committed to the poor farm because of her violent insanity, she was eventually rescued by pioneering alienist Dr. George A. Zeller. She was taken to the Peoria State Hospital in Bartonville, Illinois, where she spent the remainder of her days in comfort. Rhoda died in 1906, but her spirit lives on at the former asylum where she found peace. 

The chilling story of Rhoda Derry is one of the great tragedies of mental health care in Illinois, but one of the great success stories of the Peoria State Hospital. Sylvia Shults, author of Fractured Spirits: Hauntings at the Peoria State Hospital, returns to the hilltop to tell the story of Rhoda's life -- and her mysterious afterlife.

      <title>Hollow Moon, UFO's and Disapperances </title>
      <description>My special guest tonight is author Rob Shelsky who's here to discuss theories about aliens occupying the moon. Get his book.
Is there a “No Trespassing” sign on the Moon? Have we been warned away from there by an alien intelligence? Is the Moon hiding a hollow core, one with an alien civilization? Do aliens take to hollowed out worlds out of a very real fear?

If anyone DID NOT BELIEVE our Moon might be hollow, it was UFO Investigator and Author, Rob Shelsky. However, after researching the facts, the author did something he rarely does. He made a complete about-face on his views regarding The Hollow Moon Theory! 

Just why did he do this? For a good reason: because the evidence to support the idea of our Moon being hollow was far greater than he had ever suspected and comes from a wide variety of scientific disciplines and sources. The Author discovered there is also a veritable avalanche of evidence for the existence of aliens being on or in a hollow Moon.

If you have ever wondered if the Moon might just be hollow, after reading this book, For The Moon Is Hollow And Aliens Rule The Sky, you will wonder no more. This book includes evidence for:

-- Recorded historical evidence for our Moon not always having been in our skies.
-- Discusses the truth of the Spaceship Moon Theory (Hollow Moon Theory).
-- Names the five main theories of our Moon’s origin and what’s wrong with them.
-- Shows evidence for not just one, but possibly two hollow moons!
-- Develops a new theory, that of the Diaspora of alien civilizations to the stars.
-- Bizarre physical oddities about our Moon.
-- Strange evidence for alien structures on the Moon.
-- Weird events show evidence for aliens in space, in our skies, and on the Moon.
-- Convincing evidence and arguments as to just why the Moon is hollow.
-- Documented account of aliens and our

      <description>My special guest tonight is Dr. Scott Kolbaba who's here to discuss his experiences with the supernatural surrounding his patients. Get his book.
Doctors work in life-and-death situations every day. But what happens when they encounter something even they can’t explain scientifically?
Dreams foretelling future events, apparitions, and other miraculous experiences fill this book, as practicing doctors recount the most unusual moments of their careers.
Meant to awe, instruct, and inspire, these tales will convince even the harshest skeptic that there are things beyond this physical world and that sometimes, all we need to do is believe.
Physicians’ Untold Stories doesn’t stop at chronicling these occurrences. Scott J. Kolbaba, MD, provides a glimpse into the lives of doctors that few get to experience. Learn their agonies and joys. In their own words, doctors reach out to you and show you how faith in the divine has shaped their lives. Even in the darkest of times, as they comfort terminally ill patients and make impossible choices, moments of light shine through. 
Like the popular Chicken Soup for the Soul series, Kolbaba has catalogued inspiration moments into small stories perfect for bite-size reading—or maybe for gobbling up all at once!

Enjoy the AD-FREE versions of our latest episodes and our archives right now from anywhere in the world.

Our forests seem to be hiding something much more complex than an undiscovered gorilla. Bigfoot may be howling from a lonely mountaintop, but the bigfoot phenomenon is whispering secrets... if we will only listen.
Eyewitnesses, investigators, and cryptozoologists worldwide contend ample evidence exists supporting the survival of large, hairy, apelike creatures alongside mankind today, lurking in the wilderness. By all appearances, these beings seem wholly natural, interacting with their surroundings and leaving behind hair, blood, droppings, and, of course, footprints.
Yet despite their apparently physical nature, bigfoot and its hairy hominid kin consistently appear mired in High Strangeness—the peculiar, ineffable, and nonsensical absurdities so often encountered in paranormal phenomena.Some sightings seem more consistent with mythology than biology. Bigfoot often present supernatural attributes, like luminescent eyes or the ability to pass, ghostlike, through structures. Anomalous lights are regulalry seen in areas of frequent sasquatch activity. Footprints persistently, if rarely, display odd numbered toes, and—most bafflingly—bigfoot trackways suddenly terminate in the middle of open, untouched terrain.
In Volume 1 of Where the Footprints End: High Strangeness and the Bigfoot Phenomenon, authors Joshua Cutchin and Timothy Renner carefully examine not only the intersection of hairy apemen with global folklore—of poltergeists, faeries, extraterrestrials, magic, witches, ghosts, and archetypal women-in-white—but also question the fundamental assumptions underlying contemporary cryptozoological beliefs surrounding bigfoot.
"Impressively, even exhaustively researched, Where the Footprints End should give all students of the anomalous serious pause for thought. By documenting both the high strangeness that surrounds Bigfoot sightings, and the deep folklore in which they are

      <description>Joining me again tonight is author Lee Austin who's here to discuss more about The Book of Enoch and what it says about this perceived planet we live on. We also discuss what Lee says are the real reasons for using the Cern Collider. 
Recently, the Light Bearer disclosed the mysteries of his occultic kingdom, including the physical and spiritual laws that govern the universe. Knowing the vast majority of humans would reject his uncomfortable truth, the father of lies proceeded to write a book revealing the hidden secrets of antiquity. When asked about his motivation for such an endeavor, Lucifer scornfully laughed and replied it was an experiment for his own twisted amusement. As he predicted, the reception for Morning Star’s Tale was met with universal scorn, ridicule, and derision. Summarily dismissed as the rantings of a madman. Ironically, his only honest revelation was relegated to the dustbin of failed novellas. Morning Star was delighted. Get the book

      <title>A Life With UFO's </title>
      <description>Ray Groschen joins me tonight to discuss his book 'A Life With UFO's: An Incredible True Story'.
 
The sensational true story of one person who has had 20 UFO sightings! More than most people on Earth. The remarkable tale follows Ray Groschen, no matter where he lived or with whom, the UFOs followed.
Below is what's included in this fantastic true story:
The author has had 20 incredible UFO sightings over 45 years.
He has seen 74 total UFO ships of various designs such as:
 

16 dull silver UFO ships flying in V formation over authors house

1 Black triangular UFO above neighbors’ roof

A silver bell-shaped UFO hovering above a 7-11

2 UFOs hovering above the author and his son while fishing

2 Enormous Fireball UFOs witnessed on separate occasions

27 Orb UFOs witnessed by the author and his wife

Many star-like UFOs doing U-turns &amp; other unusual movements

And if that wasn’t enough, the author also witnessed a UFO going into a WORMHOLE!
Also, witness accounts explaining what they saw with the author.
Images of all the UFOs and the wormhole the author witnessed.
MUFON reports and the correlating investigator's statements.

      <title>Adventures in Cryptozoology</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is author and researcher Richard Freeman who's here to discuss his quest to study and possible find creatures of the most monstrous kind.
Cryptozoology, the study of hidden, monstrous, and legendary animals, is truly the art of discovering the unknown. Richard Freeman, Zoological Director of Centre for Fortean Zoology, has explored the corners of the five continents in search of creatures that many people believe are non-existent. In this book, he shares the exciting stories of his investigations of the Yeti, Mongolian Deathworm, Loch Ness Monster, Orang-Pendak, Ninki-Naka, and more.

Cryptozoologists throughout the years have studied unknown species of reptiles, lake and sea creatures, apes, and hominins. The science and history of this field of study includes examples of creatures that were once thought to be mythological, but that have since been proven to exist. If you’re ready to begin your search for Sasquatch and learn to hunt monsters, Adventures in Cryptozoology is your guide. In these pages you’ll find:
· Tales of mythical, extinct, and out-of-place creatures
· Hints about Bigfoot and other ape-men
· And tips for equipping your own cryptozoology adventure, including all the gear, field craft, and resources you’ll need to record your findings.

Explores evidence for the theory of directed panspermia--that life on Earth and the landscape of Earth itself was engineered by extraterrestrials

• Details how the Earth was terraformed through a sophisticated geo-engineering program, providing clear examples such as the precise mathematical longitude configurations of the Great Pyramid of Giza with the major rivers on Earth

• Shows how our spectrum of blood types supports the theory of panspermia while directly contradicting the conventional “out of Africa” theory of evolution

• Examines the strongest modern UFO accounts, including the Russian Roswell case, as well as the suppressed UFO sightings of NASA astronauts

In the early 1970s, Nobel Prize-winning DNA co-discoverer Sir Francis Crick and his colleague Leslie Orgel proposed that in the distant past, an extraterrestrial race sent a spacecraft loaded with microorganisms to seed the Earth with life. Now, more than 40 years later, the fields of space research and biotechnology have advanced to the point where they can back up Crick and Orgel’s claims about our ancient alien ancestors.

Sharing scientific evidence of alien involvement with life on our planet and with the very landscape of Earth itself, Will Hart refines the theory of directed panspermia--that life was intentionally seeded on Earth by extraterrestrials--to reveal that the same ET agency also created humans and generated civilization. He shows how the Earth was terraformed through an engineering program so sophisticated and vast that it has escaped our attention so far--for example, the major rivers on Earth are precisely aligned through geo-engineering with the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Revealing the Great Pyramid as an alien message in stone, the author explains how the Giza pyramids could not have been built by the ancient Egyptians and examines the extraterrestrial energy technologies used to move t

      <title> Conquer Your Karma</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Tracee Dunblazier who's here to discuss her book Conquer Your Karmic Relationships: Heal Spiritual Trauma to Open Your Heart and Restore Your Soul. 
 Your karma got you down? 
Claim your history. Own your power. Change your life!
In this groundbreaking book, Tracee Dunblazier takes an in depth look at your karmic relationships: the spiritual imprints and repetitive patterns that position you in life. The restoration of every soul, and the systems that govern them, get an overhaul!
Karma is not punishment and reward; it is the reassurance that we will inevitably experience all we are—and all we have created for others—through reincarnation and spiritual patterning. This wisdom will inspire change on every level. 
You will understand what karma is and learn all the ways to reveal, accept, forgive, and transform your connections in every dimension. Not only to your soulmate beloveds and romantic entanglements, but how you relate to food, money, family, culture, religion, sex, death, and your environment. 
Conquer Your Karmic Relationships: Heal Spiritual Trauma to Open Your Heart and Restore Your Soul, will help to unearth the very core of what drives you, showing how to direct its power into usable, life-giving resources for you and all your relations. 
This book will:
Teach you how to recognize your karmic relationships and set boundaries within them.
Encourage self-love through radical acceptance.
Reveal what your spiritual patterns are and how to use them to your benefit or change what no longer serves you.
Show you how to create the life you want through accepting others as they are, releasing shame, and finding tolerance.

      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/dowsing-the-dead-1/</link>
      <description>Tonight, I have with me Dan Baldwin who's dedicated his life to help find missing people and investigate the paranormal using a dowsing method.
The Paranormal Pendulum is a must read for anyone wanting to sharpen their psychic tools. Dan Baldwin has an amazing way of taking a complex topic and turning it into an easy-to-understand guidebook for learners. Pendulum dowsing is one of the most effective tools for spirit communication the dedicated paranormal investigator can employ. Each chapter contains not only instructions and insights into pendulum dowsing, but also includes transcripts of actual paranormal investigations.

      <title>A Shocking True Story of Internet Stalking</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest is Susan Fensten who's here to recount her frightening true story of being stalked by way of the internet. Get her book 'You Have a Very Soft Voice Susan' on Amazon.
A firsthand look at a notorious Internet stalking campaign that the FBI described as a case “in a category by itself”—in the words of the victim herself.

After her father died in 2003, Susan Fensten turned to a genealogy message board to search for surviving relatives. Days later, she was delighted to receive an email from someone claiming to be a distant cousin. In fact, Susan had just been ensnared by a relentless sociopath.

She soon became the target of an elaborate cyber-hoax involving dozens of frightening characters, including known sex offenders, who made threats of kidnapping, murder, rape, torture, and cannibalism. Remarkable in its complexity, this story of Internet stalking is also a harrowing tale of courage in the face of madness.

This is a story about the search for family, the Internet Age, and a journey into the underbelly of American crime. Beyond raising questions about safety online, it forces us to question our perceptions of reality.

"Quite possibly the most twisted and surreal case of stalking I have ever encountered. Well written and gripping. Just when you think it can't get any more bizarre, it does." —Patrick Quinlan, Los Angeles Times–bestselling author of All Those Moments and Sexbot

      <title>The MEDUSA File - Part Two </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/the-medusa-file-part-two/</link>
      <description>Returning to the show is my special guest author Craig Roberts who discusses his research into the Oklahoma City Bombing that killed 168 people.
Get Craig's Book


Craig Roberts was the only Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer who was assigned to the tragic Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in April of 1995. At first he was assigned to assist the FBI in the case, but after seeing what really went on behind the scenes, and how the case was being politically motivated, and the real reasons for the bombing, Roberts decided to do his own investigation aside from the "official" version. After months of work, working with a few other individuals who were determined to get to the real facts of the case, the end result was Roberts building case files that filled four file boxes. This book exposes the real John Doe 2s and others that the US Government refuses to acknowledge exists, and the real reasons the Murrah Building was bombed--and by who. Anyone who thinks that McVeigh and Nichols acted by themselves also must believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone shooter in the JFK assassination. This book follows the author's first expose of government coverups, "The Medusa File: Crimes and Coverups of the U.S. Government." Journey through the maze of lies, falsifications, and misdirections of the case in the chapters that expose details left out by the media. The Oklahoma City bombing case is a mystery, wrapped up in a puzzle, inside an enigma. The Medusa File II takes the reader beyond the curtain and the media smoke screen with a demand that now justice be done for the 168 victims of the horrible event.

      <title>Ghosts of GreyStone</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/ghosts-of-greystone/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Clete Keith who's here to discuss the paranormal activity experienced inside one of Beverly Hill's most beautiful mansions.
Clete Keith never had thoughts of writing a book, let alone one on the paranormal. He was not someone totally convinced in the existence of ghosts or spiritual hauntings-until he started working at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. After twenty-two years and retirement looming, he woke up one night at three o'clock with the idea of writing a book about all the stories he has heard as well as his own experiences. Ghosts of Greystone - Beverly Hills is not just a collection of ghost stories, but a landmark exposé of eyewitness accounts detailing supernatural activity associated with this extraordinary location. Having been approached by many guests, patrons, and employees over the years, Keith has heard it all. "Two tourists walked up to me and asked how they could get inside the mansion for the tour. When I told them the interior is closed to the public one replied, 'Oh, because we saw a man in period clothing staring out the window and we thought he was part of the tour.'" This marks just one encounter of 237 paranormal stories documented at Greystone Mansion. Keith spent nearly three years interviewing and researching the supernatural activity at the estate. With 86 interviews, including guests of the park, City staff, police officers, movie crew personnel, and janitorial services, Ghosts of Greystone - Beverly Hills promises you a riveting history and ghostly encounters. For more than two decades, the mystery surrounding the strange events taking place in and around Greystone Mansion have been suppressed, ignored, and disbelieved... until now. "From a paranormal perspective, the estate is extremely active," warns author and investigator Clete Keith. "Until now, witnesses to unexplained phenomena have been reluctant to come forward fearing ridicule, as well as accusations that their experiences are nothing more than junk science. I believe it's time to open the lid on this Pandora's Box, one shrouded in secrecy, and finally reveal the mystery inside." Along with rare photographs and intriguing details about the landscape and architecture, Keith delves into the family of Ned and Lucy Doheny, including the fateful murder/suicide on the night of February 16, 1929, and other unfortunate deaths that surround these enigmatic grounds that may have stoked the paranormal fire of active.

      <itunes:summary>My special guest tonight is Clete Keith who's here to discuss the paranormal activity experienced inside one of Beverly Hill's most beautiful mansions.
Clete Keith never had thoughts of writing a book, let alone one on the paranormal. He was not someone totally convinced in the existence of ghosts or spiritual hauntings-until he started working at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. After twenty-two years and retirement looming, he woke up one night at three o'clock with the idea of writing a book about all the stories he has heard as well as his own experiences. Ghosts of Greystone - Beverly Hills is not just a collection of ghost stories, but a landmark exposé of eyewitness accounts detailing supernatural activity associated with this extraordinary location. Having been approached by many guests, patrons, and employees over the years, Keith has heard it all. "Two tourists walked up to me and asked how they could get inside the mansion for the tour. When I told them the interior is closed to the public one replied, 'Oh, because we saw a man in period clothing staring out the window and we thought he was part of the tour.'" This marks just one encounter of 237 paranormal stories documented at Greystone Mansion. Keith spent nearly three years interviewing and researching the supernatural activity at the estate. With 86 interviews, including guests of the park, City staff, police officers, movie crew personnel, and janitorial services, Ghosts of Greystone - Beverly Hills promises you a riveting history and ghostly encounters.

      <description>My special guest tonight is author and researcher Craig Roberts who's here to share some some of the most heinous crimes ever committed by the U.S. Government. 
From World War II to present, there has been hidden within the highest levels of government secrets that you are not supposed to discover. During the period of 1940 to this day the power brokers, working from their positions of trust, have committed and then covered up the most heinous of crimes known to mankind. Investigative journalist Craig Roberts, author of "Kill Zone--a Sniper Looks at Dealey Plaza", now provides us with the results of his ten -year investigation regarding the secret crimes and coverups of the U.S. Government. You will read his case files on such subjects as the Japanese "Devil Unit 731" who experiments on American POWs in WWII with germ warfare weapons--and what happened when the war ended and the commanding officer was hired by the government instead of hanged for war crimes; Operation Paperclip in WWII when the U.S. brought Nazi scientists to America to work for us on our weapons programs instead of standing trial as war criminals; CIA and military mind control experiments on unsuspecting citizens--including children--without our knowledge; Secret drug and bacteriological weapons experiments on the American population; Atomic guinea pigs, Agent Orange, and the Gulf War Syndrome; what really happened to over 30,000 U.S. POWs after World War II, Korea and Vietnam; International assassinations, drug smuggling and money laundering; What the media did not tell you about the shoot down of TWA 800, the bombing of Pan AM 103, the Oklahoma City bombing, the crash of Arrow Air in Gander, Newfoundland, the derailment of the Sunset Limited in Arizona, the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, and much more….

      <title>Did Aliens Part The Red Sea?</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/did-aliens-part-the-red-sea/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is Rev. Barry Downing who's here to discuss why he believes aliens pulled off some miracles mentioned in the Bible.
CHRISTIAN MINISTER MAINTAINS – MIRACLES OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS ARE MANIFESTATIONS OF AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE 
The Reverend Barry Downing’s credentials are impressive, adding scholarly weight to his theories regarding anomalous and miraculous events as portrayed in the Old and New Testaments. Downing holds a Ph.D. in the relation between religion and science from the University of Edinburgh of Scotland. He also has a bachelor’s degree in physics from New York’s Hartwick College as well as a degree from Princeton Theological Seminary. Dr. Downing has studied the Bible most of his life. . . 
Not unusual for a pastor, but what makes his evangelistic career unique is that he has also studied the UFO phenomena since the mid-1950s. The combination of both pursuits resulted in the 1968 publication of his controversial book, “The Bible and Flying Saucers,” which would lay important groundwork regarding the blending of the divine with the theory that earth has been visited by extraterrestrials in ancient times and that these visitations continue to this day. This work is his long awaited sequel in which he expands upon the polemic issues previously put forth, including that the – 
** Parting of the Red Sea in the Bible’s Exodus was accomplished by a cylindrical UFO, a cigars haped ship whose kind is still reported. 
** That Jesus was an extraterrestrial sent to earth to rid the world of sin and wickedness, quoting Biblical text to support his claim. 
** That Jesus left earth in a spaceship to another planet, or perhaps another spatial dimension. 
** That angels were actually aliens and that the “angelic aliens” spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai where he boarded a UFO to receive the Ten Commandments and specifications for the construction of the Tabernacle. It was aliens who guided the ancient Israelites, providing them with manna in the wilderness. 
** In the modern world, Downing contends with mainstream religion’s refusal to take the subject seriously. Christian liberals don’t want to hear the miracles of the Bible were real and Christian conservatives don’t want the miracles credited to simple aliens in flying saucers.

      <title>Most Haunted Library in North Carolina </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guests tonight are paranormal investigators Joey and Tonya Madia who spent two year investigating what's believed to be the most haunted library in North Carolina.

Welcome to a library where the ghosts aren’t in the books – they are right next to you in the halls and rooms, looking over your shoulder as you pick a title from a shelf. This is the Earle W. Webb Jr. Memorial Library, built on haunted ground with a legacy of pirates and German U-boats, and is jam-packed with spirits.

Join veteran paranormal investigators Joey and Tonya Madia as they take you on a mind-bending tour of every shadowy corner of the library and its spooky and colorful spectral residents who do not hesitate to let visitors know they are around. 
The Madias present a textbook case for how to conduct a paranormal investigation, involving observation, equipment, psychic mediumship and historical research.

Read about:
•Close encounters with craft that defy explanations
•Face-to-face experiences with aliens, including abductions

      <title>The Truth About UFO's &amp; The White House </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is the UFO Hunter Bill Birnes here to discuss what U.S. Presidents really know about the White House.

The author team that wrote the upcoming Skyhorse title Edison vs. Tesla, as well as The Haunting of the Presidents and other titles about the weird, the supernatural, and the unexplained, turn their attention to the oval office for a unique view of UFOs in America and more specifically, what America's presidents--from Washington to Obama--have witnessed and believed.


Most of us know that George Washington was heavily involved with the secret society the Freemasons. But how many of us know about George Washington's UFO sighting during the terrible winter at Valley Forge, and how the experience guided his future?

Marilyn Monroe is rumored to have had UFO intel that she gained via pillow-talk from JFK.

Under Nixon's presidency we orbited and walked upon the surface the moon while almost at the same time the Air Force was exploiting the Air Force as scientific cover for its decision to terminate Project Blue Book. 

Jimmie Carter was visited by UFOs multiple times. 

UFOs and the White House is an oft-overlooked glimpse at history that will appeal to historians as well as advocates of the paranormal.

      <title>The Bell Witch - Part 2 </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>Part two of my interview with special guest tonight is author and researcher Pat Fitzhugh here to talk about the infamous true haunting of The Bell Witch. Get his book.

From the image of a lifeless body hanging from a tree to the relentless torture of a rural Tennessee family, all-powerful Kate was the personification of evil. She tortured children, sang hymns, cursed like a sailor, and predicted the future. Kate's missions were to break off Elizabeth Bell's engagement and kill her father, John Bell. She accomplished both. Even today, almost 200 years later, people still report mysterious happenings in the area. After more than two decades of exhaustive research, Bell Witch researcher Pat Fitzhugh for the first time shares everything. This 406-page literary work includes not only the epic tale of terror, but pictures of the area, footnotes that document the author's sources, thought-provoking discussion notes, appendices, an index, and detailed biographical sketches of those who figured into the legend. Pleasant dreams.

      <title>Channeling The Life of Jesus</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is author Barry Strohm who's here to discuss how he says he was able to channel the what Jesus and other disciples did in their lifetime.
Jesus Christ came to the world as the universal energy of God. For twenty-eight years he lived a normal life, experiencing emotions, observing the suffering of people, and even having a married life with children. He was sent to Earth to inform humanity of the one God—but was crucified. Here find in-depth commentary on the life of Christ through the channeled messages of Jesus, the Saints, disciples, and others of that volatile time. Find out how the gospels were selected and how and why the words of Jesus were altered by the church. Learn about soul families and those with his ancestry who are walking the Earth today. Hear warnings that reflect current and dangerous trends, including our political systems, religious beliefs, and interactions with each other. Jesus taught love, and through these messages, we find that his words are still vital to our personal and collective lives in the world today.

The Pleiadians are moving into a new era. Through the opening of a new multidimensional timeframe, a pure light frequency has activated the sacred timing of an important aspect of their commitment to us as a human race.

This is what the Pleiadians refer to as fulfilling the Promise that was set in place lifetimes ago. Now is the time for them to reveal to us as a human race the sacred aspects of who we are and what we need to do to become fully realized and fulfill our role on our Earth plane.

The energy of this Promise holds the key to our further awakening and the unfolding of our self-realization process on a multidimensional level. This Promise activates the revelations of understanding and knowledge to be given to all those who are seekers of Truth―information that will help us to understand this transition and the role we need to play to fully open ourselves to our magnificence.

A series of blessed revelations align you to a deeper natural aspect of your own humanness and spirituality. The Pleiadian Promise also includes 13 channeled audio files that give you a direct experience with the Pleiadians through multidimensional levels of light initiations.

      <title>Stringing Up Witches - The Salem Witch Trials</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/stringing-up-witches-the-salem-witch-trials/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest returning to the show is author Rebecca F. Pittman to discuss the infamous Salem Witch Trails.
In 1692, a small village in Salem, Massachusetts, was suddenly attacked by the specters of flying witches and all manner of evil. A group of young girls began "crying out" against their neighbors and family members. By the time it was over, nineteen people were hanged, one man crushed to death, and five succumbed to the ordeal of imprisonment. Today, despite the plague of witchcraft that had inflicted England, we still look at this one isolated incident of hysteria and madness, and ask "How did this happen?" This book offers answers to that question, along with exclusive interviews with the Salem Witch Trial's top experts. The book includes never-before-seen photographs and information about Proctor's Ledge from the experts and historians who located the actual site of the hangings. A focus on the paranormal activity happening in Salem is offered in The Haunting section. You will also find a nod to Hocus Pocus and other movies. Spotlights on the best lodging, restaurants, and tourist attractions are also listed, along with maps, and websites for further study. Rebecca F. Pittman is a best-selling author of 13 books, including The History &amp; Haunting of Lizzie Borden, The History and Haunting of Salem, and many more. Her love of mysteries has found her on multiple TV and radio programs. Her website is www.rebeccafpittmanbooks.com, where you can sign up for her free Ghost Writings newsletter.

      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/pets-in-the-afterlife/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is psychic medium Rob Gutro here to discuss how our loving pets can communicate long after they have crossed over. Get his book.
To a pet parent, to lose a pet means to lose a child. The love we share with our pets never dies, and the author proves our pets do communicate with us from the other side. Learn how dogs, cats, horses and some birds have the intelligence and ability to send signs to the living after they pass. Take comfort in knowing our pets are around us from time to time and recognize the signs they give. Learn how they wait for us when it’s our time, what a pet’s ashes can do, and the difference between ghosts and spirits. Learn how and why living pets can sense entities. Follow one of the author's dogs on a ghost investigation. Read how spirits of the author’s 2 dogs and dogs from three other mediums communicated with them from the other side. Read about spirit cats and how a ghostly dog rescued a girl. The author also volunteers for Dachshund and Weimaraner rescues and has several dogs.

        <![CDATA[<p>Tonight, my special guest is psychic medium Rob Gutro here to discuss how our loving pets can communicate long after they have crossed over. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pets-Afterlife-Rob-Gutro/dp/1497378613/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=rob+gutro&amp;qid=1609979500&amp;sr=8-4">Get his book.</a></p><p>To a pet parent, to lose a pet means to lose a child. The love we share with our pets never dies, and the author proves our pets do communicate with us from the other side. Learn how dogs, cats, horses and some birds have the intelligence and ability to send signs to the living after they pass. Take comfort in knowing our pets are around us from time to time and recognize the signs they give. Learn how they wait for us when it’s our time, what a pet’s ashes can do, and the difference between ghosts and spirits. Learn how and why living pets can sense entities. Follow one of the author's dogs on a ghost investigation. Read how spirits of the author’s 2 dogs and dogs from three other mediums communicated with them from the other side. Read about spirit cats and how a ghostly dog rescued a girl. The author also volunteers for Dachshund and Weimaraner rescues and has several dogs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mysteriousradio/">@mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Follow us on TikTok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mysteriousradio?lang=en">mysteriousradioTikTok</a></p><p>Follow us on Twitter<a href="https://www.twitter.com/mysteriousradio"> @mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Follow us on Pinterest <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/mysteriousradio">pinterest.com/mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Like us on Facebook<a href="http://www.facebook.com/mysteriousradio"> Facebook.com/mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Visit our website: <a href="https://www.mysteriousradio.com/">https://www.mysteriousradio.com</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.mysteriousradio.com/">Check Out Mysterious Radio!</a> (copy the link to share with your friends and family via text)</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Playing Dead: A Memoir of Terror and Survival</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/playing-dead-a-memoir-of-terror-and-survival/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is Monique Faison Ross who's here to discuss how she narrowly escaped her obsessed ex-husband and his jealous rage.
This domestic abuse survivor’s memoir shares an “engaging, powerful, and ultimately shocking story" of a bad marriage that ended in attempted murder (Lundy Bancroft, author of The Joyous Recovery).
 
Monique Faison, the daughter of San Diego Charger’s football great Earl Faison, married her high school sweetheart soon after she discovered she was pregnant with his child. Her relationship with Chris had always been shaky, but his verbal abuse only increased—and then gave way to physical attacks. Eventually, Monique took their children and left. That was when the stalking and serious threats began.
 
Nothing stopped him—not protection injunctions, police warnings, or even arrests. One fateful Monday morning, Chris kidnapped Monique in front of her children. After a nightmarish car ride that involved car crashes and rape, Chris beat her on the head with a shovel and abandoned her brutalized body in the woods, presuming she was dead. But playing dead was what saved her life.

      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/the-unseen-realm/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Karl Petry who has extraordinary abilities beyond most psychic mediums. Get his book Absent Witness.
Karl Petry was born with an unusual ability to see and communicate with the dead, see into the past, and touch the troubled hearts of the living. Throughout his life, he has helped people reconnect with loved ones who have passed and resolve their grief. He has also given a voice to the dead who wish to be heard and who have urgent messages and stories to tell. He is the “Absent Witness.”

In his own words, Karl tells the story of his amazing gift, from shocking experiences in childhood to deeply moving experiences in today’s times. He has worked with renowned psychics and paranormal researchers, including remote viewer Ingo Swann and New York City psychic Paula Roberts.

Karl shares some of his most interesting cases, such as the soul-eating house, the victims of 9-11, the dead who do not want to be forgotten, and lost souls in a mass pauper’s grave. Some of his true stories are amazing, some are heart-warming, and some are funny—and all of them will keep you turning the pages from beginning to end.

      <title>Ancient Alien Empire </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/ancient-alien-empire/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Rob Shelsky who's here to talk about a worldwide empire that existed before the dawn of our civilization.
Ancient Aliens -- did a worldwide empire, Megalithia, once exist at the dawn of civilization? Who were these aliens? Why were they here? Was the Earth a colony existing for the good of the "mother country?" Were humans created by aliens as a perpetual slave race? This is the first book to take all the information on Ancient Aliens, put it together, and find answers. And the answers may astonish you! The authors, using the available evidence, promote new theories regarding Ancient Aliens. They cite evidence to bolster these theories. Among the questions they try to answer are: -- Were aliens responsible for the Great Flood? -- Was the Younger Dryas Period, the "Big Freeze," in reality a nuclear winter? -- Were the aliens responsible for the extinction of the mega-fauna of the late Ice Age? -- Did aliens use Earth as if they were a colonial power? -- Did humans rebel against their alien masters? -- Was there a nuclear war at the dawn of civilization? -- Was the Empire of Megalithia responsible for all the megalithic monuments we find around the world today? -- Were the Ancient Aliens exercising brutal population control over humanity? Ancient Alien Empire Megalithia, draws on available evidence to recreate the type of government, economy, social order, technology, and even geography of Megalithia, the first evil empire on Earth. It recounts the rise and fall of that Empire. Authors Rob Shelsky and George Kempland have finally done what has been needed doing for a long time. They are the first to put all the information of Ancient Aliens together, create a remarkable new synthesis that explains much, and then they find solutions with exciting new theories. The authors back their theories with evidence from a variety of intriguing sources.

      <title>Ghosts Of Mississippi's Golden Triangle</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/ghosts-of-mississippis-golden-triangle/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Dr. Alan Brown returning to discuss haunted Mississippi.
Mississippi’s Golden Triangle is a major modern hub—but restless spirits of Native Americans, Civil War soldiers, and slaves also wander this region. Tales of a mysterious watchman who patrols the railroad tracks between Artesia and Mayhew haunt curious locals. Ed Kuykendall Sr. is rumored to manage Columbus’s Princess Theater from beyond the grave. A young girl who died while attempting to free her head from a stair banister is said to still walk the halls of Waverly. In this fascinating tour, author Alan Brown uncovers the eerie thrills and chills that are part of local history.

      <title>Lost Civilization of Lemuria</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/the-lost-civilization-of-lemuria/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is Frank Joseph returning to discuss the original motherland of humanity and the incredible technology of the day.
A compelling new portrait of the lost realm of Lemuria, the original motherland of humanity

• Contains the most extensive and up-to-date archaeological research on Lemuria

• Reveals a lost, ancient technology in some respects more advanced than modern science

• Provides evidence that the perennial philosophies have their origin in Lemurian culture

Before the Indonesian tsunami or Hurricane Katrina’s destruction of New Orleans, there was the destruction of Lemuria. Oral tradition in Polynesia recounts the story of a splendid kingdom that was carried to the bottom of the sea by a mighty “warrior wave”--a tsunami. This lost realm has been cited in numerous other indigenous traditions, spanning the globe from Australia to Asia to the coasts of both South and North America. It was known as Lemuria or Mu, a vast realm of islands and archipelagoes that once sprawled across the Pacific Ocean. Relying on 10 years of research and extensive travel, Frank Joseph offers a compelling picture of this mother­land of humanity, which he suggests was the original Garden of Eden.

Using recent deep-sea archaeological finds, enigmatic glyphs and symbols, and ancient records shared by cultures divided by great distances that document the story of this sunken world, Joseph painstakingly re-creates a picture of this civilization in which people lived in rare harmony and possessed a sophisticated technology that allowed them to harness the weather, defy gravity, and conduct genetic investigations far beyond what is possible today. When disaster struck Lemuria, the survivors made their way to other parts of the world, incorporating their scientific and mystical skills into the existing cultures of Asia, Polynesia, and the Americas. Totem poles of the Pacific Northwest, architecture in China, the colossal stone statues on Easter Island, and even the perennial philosophies all reveal their kinship to this now-vanished civilization.

It was known as Lemuria or Mu, a vast realm of islands and archipelagoes that once sprawled across the Pacific Ocean. Relying on 10 years of research and extensive travel, Frank Joseph offers a compelling picture of this mother­land of humanity, which he suggests was the original Garden of Eden.

Using recent deep-sea archaeological finds, enigmatic glyphs and symbols, and ancient records shared by cultures divided by great distances that document the story of this sunken world, Joseph painstakingly re-creates a picture of this civilization in which people lived in rare harmony and possessed a sophisticated technology that allowed them to harness the weather, defy gravity, and conduct genetic investigations far beyond what is possible today. When disaster struck Lemuria, the survivors made their way to other parts of the world, incorporating their scientific and mystical skills into the existing cultures of Asia, Polynesia, and the Americas. Totem poles of the Pacific Northwest, architecture in China, the colossal stone statues on Easter Island, and even the perennial philosophies all reveal their kinship to this now-vanished civilization.

      <description>Tonight, my special guest is Paul Gambino to discuss the very creepy taste for collecting human body parts. Get his book. Morbid Curiosities is an insight into the strange world of collectors of the macabre. Centred on 15 collections, with extensive interviews with each collector and specially shot imagery detailing their objects, this is a fascinating showcase of bizarre and intriguing objects. Included are collections of skulls, mummified body parts, occultic objects, and various carnival, side-show and criminal ephemera. Detailed captions tell the curious stories behind each object, many of which are being shown outside the private world of their collections for the first time.

      <title>Secrets of The Crystal Skulls </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/secrets-of-the-crystal-skulls/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is Dr. Jaap Van Etten who's here to discuss the book about the power of Crystal Skulls. Get his book.
Crystal skulls invoke a sense of mystery. What was their role in ancient times? Are they important for us in current times? Can they assist us on our spiritual journey? How? Although much has been written about them, many questions still linger. This book addresses many of these lingering questions on practical, subtle-energy, and spiritual levels. 
This long-awaited sequel to Crystal Skulls: Interacting with a Phenomenon weaves practical information on crystal skulls with meditations to provide a deeper understanding of the role of crystal skulls in expanding the consciousness of individuals and humankind as a whole. 
Filled with useful guidance for both beginners and those who have worked with crystal skulls for long periods of time, Crystal Skulls: Expand Your Consciousness addresses essential issues: what material crystal skulls should be made from, what size to choose, how to clean them, and what to do with them. The most important part of the book addresses awakening the potential of a crystal skull. Learn about the energies of these awakened crystal skulls and the effects they have on the spiritual development of individuals and the collective consciousness of humanity. 
This book invites you on a journey of awakening the potential of your crystal skulls -- and consequently awakening yourself. Several meditations are given to support this journey along with descriptions of the known ancient and old crystal skulls, making this book a "must have" for anyone interested in crystal skulls and in the journey of spiritual development.

      <title>Spirit Walker </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/spirit-walker/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Sonja Grace who's here to discuss the wisdom of the natural world. Sonja says she has many different abilities to gather this knowledge such as spirit communication, healer and time traveling. Her book is called Dancing with Raven and Bear.

Original tales inspired by Native American and Norwegian folklore that highlight the wisdom of the divine natural world 

• Shares unique stories about Earth Medicine and animal magic, inspired by the author’s unusual Native American (Hopi) and Norwegian upbringing 

• Interwoven with ancient teachings and everyday practical applications of Earth Medicine, such as grounding and dream interpretation 

• Each tale is beautifully illustrated with the author’s original art, which promotes spiritual understanding and the power of the Earth’s healing properties 

• Paper with French flaps 

Drawing on both her Native American (Hopi) heritage and her Norwegian upbringing, renowned mystic and intuitive healer Sonja Grace shares original wisdom tales, received through her heart and soul, to take you on a journey into the magic of Raven and Bear and the healing power of Earth Medicine. 

Featuring Sonja’s distinctive and beautiful artwork, each story is embedded with ancient teachings to inspire you to live closer to the Earth. The fables include powerful examples of animal magic and everyday, practical applications of Earth Medicine, such as simple energy exercises, dream interpretations, Earth Medicine prayers and meditations, and using medicinal plants to manage negative energies. As background to the stories, Sonja reveals parallels between Norse mythology and Native American traditions and explores the symbology of animals and the recurring central theme of the tension between light and darkness. In Norse myth, the great god Odin, for instance, is often accompanied by Ravens. These birds are considered manifestations of the Valkyries, the goddesses who brought brave soldiers to Valhalla, while in Native American traditions, the Raven is viewed as a trickster or messenger, a magical creature with the ability to shapeshift into a human or animal, yet also portrayed as a hero overcoming adversity. The Bear on the other hand can embody the healer who grounds our energy and removes illness or can represent the inner part of us that has faith. In one fable, Sonja brings Bear to life as a mythical creature singing songs to bring in the light, reflecting the powerful lesson that by using our voice and speaking the truth we can hold darkness at bay. Throughout all of the stories, Raven and Bear teach us to be responsible for our actions and develop spiritual accountability.

“Author Stacy Horn dissects all the things that go bump in the night—ghosts, poltergeists, your ex-boyfriend Klaus—in [her] macabre book.”
 —Marie Claire

A fascinating, eye-opening collection of “Investigations into Ghosts, Poltergeists, Telepathy, and Other Unseen Phenomena, from the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory,” Unbelievable by Stacy Horn explores science’s remarkable first attempts to prove—or disprove—the existence of the paranormal. A featured contributor on the popular NPR program “All Things Considered,” Horn has been praised by Mary Roach, bestselling author of Spook, for her “awe-fueled curiosity [and] top-flight reporting skills.” Horn attacks a most controversial subject with Unbelievable—a book that will appeal to armchair scientists as well as fans of TV’s Medium, The Ghost Whisperer, and Crossing Over with John Edward.

Now an Amazon #1 Bestseller inspired by TRUE EVENTS.

On an American college campus in 1987, three students began playing a seemingly innocent game of contacting the dead. Word spread fast around campus and curiosity grew, expanding the group to more than forty people. Spirits were summoned almost daily, and the dark world's influence began to take its toll as one student fell gravely ill and relationships began to crumble. Months later, the dead would be resurrected, and this time there would be Hell to pay.

This is their story...
Rachel Thomas was more than happy to leave the haunted house she had lived in for the last decade. She had every reason to be excited about her future as a college freshman entering Riverside Community College. But she had no way of knowing that she would find herself in the terrifying grips of the paranormal again when her new roommate, Josie Norton and her friends began using the Ouija Board.

In spite of Rachel's reluctance to join the group's nocturnal ritual of contacting the dead, she finds herself sucked into the drama and a witness to the spirit's malevolent nature as strange phenomena begins happening. Weeks turn into months as Amber Simmons becomes obsessed with the game and her "ghost" friend who assumes the identity of a human being now in the afterlife. As the malevolent spirit continues to control and manipulate Amber, the close-knit friends are terrorized until the Ouija spirit makes one final show of force determined to kill them all!
_________________________________________________________________
Note from the author: The Devil's Board is based on true events that happened in the Fall/Spring year of 1987-88. The college campus is located in small town, USA. To this day, the story of Ryan Banks still remains a haunting mystery.

All names and locations have been changed to protect the privacy of the institution and the characters of the story. Some parts of The Devil's Board have been dramatized for the sake of storytelling.

New evidence and photos! On August 4, 1892, the brutal murders of Andrew and Abby Borden were committed within the walls of their modest home, in broad daylight, on a busy street in Fall River, Massachusetts. It is today, 124 years later, still considered America's biggest unsolved murder mystery. Their youngest daughter, Lizzie, was accussed, and the bizarre case of how she did it, and why she did it, still baffles. But now, just in time for the 125th Anniversary of the Borden murders, comes new evidence: What if...there was proof of two murder plots the week of the murders? What if...for the first time...the identity of the two men the police and attorneys searched for, who were seen on the Borden property the day of, and three days prior to, the murders, are now revealed? What if...the police sent off the wrong items to be tested for poison? And, what was it Bridget saw from her attic window that had to be hushed up? It's all here. After five years of exhaustive research, Rebecca F. Pittman presents new evidence and photos, based on trial testimony, police reports and interviews. Never-before-seen photographs of Lizzie's Maplecroft mansion, and her bizarre behavior within its walls, are documented. Also included, are reports of the paranormal activity happening at the Lizzie Borden B&amp;B today.If you think you know the story of Lizzie Borden and the events leading up to the murders of Andrew and Abby Borden...think again! Other books in Ms. Pittman's History and Haunting Series include: The History and Haunting of the Stanley Hotel, The History and Haunting of the Myrtles Plantation, The History and Haunting of Lemp Mansion, The History and Haunting of Salem: The Witch Trials and Beyond, and coming July 2020, The History and Haunting of the Palace of Versailles. www.rebeccafpittmanbooks.com where you can also sign up for her Ghost Writings newsletter.

Who said that Hitler did not die in the bunker in April 1945? Josef Stalin told President Harry Truman that Hitler did not. Marshall Zhukov said "We have found no corpse that could be Hitler's." This book not only tells of the escape of Adolf Hitler, Eva Braun and others of the Third Reich; it includes photographs, files from the FBI, CIA and OSS that show the US knew they escaped, interviews and much more. You will also read the reason that no government went after Hitler even though they knew where he was. This book will change the history you were taught in 5th grade.

Bye Bye Blue Sky is a dedicated global public environmental movement who seeks to be a voice for all living creatures and ecosystems, to protect human health and safeguard the natural environment, air, water and land, which our sustenance depends.
We use education, peaceful protest and creative communication to expose one of the world’s largest and most significant ecological threats and pre imminent disasters, commonly known as Climate Engineering or “Chemtrails”.
These programs are done under “National Research” wherein plausible deniability can always ensue. This is the toxic spraying of nano particulate metals which are further amplified by ionospheric heaters to steer, direct and control our weather for military purposes and global domination. Programs which have no publicly disclosed oversight and which have been conducted for decades. Chemtrails are the means, electromagnetic frequencies are the method; a spray and zap effect shredding our atmosphere and unraveling our ecosystems.
Bye Bye Blue Sky is an independent movement that any one person or group can join.
We are a global collective of dedicated and like-minded individuals, whose core values are reflected in our environmental campaign work. From the smallest community to the largest multinational organization, we seek to educate and inspire others to create awareness of these spraying programs so they can be exposed and eradicated.
We seek to apply the wealth of our knowledge, passion and talents to end the illegal spraying of our planet, and create a world wealthier in spirit, life, nature and harmony for all.
Suzanne Maher – Founder of Bye Bye Blue Sky

Reveals the parallels between the rise and fall of Atlantis, cultures in ancient Mesoamerica, and our modern civilization 

• Links the demise of Atlantis with the birth of the Olmec civilization in Mexico, the beginning of the first Egyptian dynasty, and the start of the Mayan Calendar 

• Reveals the Atlantean and Mayan prophecy of an eternal cycle of global creation, destruction, and renewal and how we are headed into a destructive phase 

• Shows how ancient prophecies correlate precisely with the latest climatology studies, the rising incidence of solar flares, and papers from Pentagon and NASA analysts 

With the passing of the Mayan Calendar’s end date we can now focus on the true significance of what the Maya and their predecessors were trying to convey to future civilizations. Frank Joseph reveals how the Mayan prophecy, symbolized by their calendar, was created through the combined genius of Atlantis and Lemuria and predicts an eternal cycle of global creation, destruction, and renewal. He shows how this cycle correlates precisely with scientific studies on glacial ice cores and predictions from the Hopi, the Incas, and the Scandinavian Norse as well as the visions of Edgar Cayce. He links the demise of Atlantis with the birth of the Olmec civilization in Mexico (the progenitors of the Maya), the beginning of the first Egyptian dynasty, and the start of the Mayan Calendar. 

Drawing on the latest climatology studies and papers from Pentagon and NASA analysts, he reveals that we are on the brink of a destructive phase in the global cycle of change as predicted by the Atlanteans and the Maya. The world’s current political, economic, and cultural deterioration is paralleled by unprecedented storms and record temperatures, massive solar flares, tectonic disturbances, and fissuring sea floors that could release dangerous reservoirs of methane gas into the environment--all of which signals we are headed into another ice age. 

Despite the Atlanteans’ greater understanding of the cyclical nature of catastrophes and of the human role in them, Joseph reveals the mistakes they made that played a crucial role i

A complete guide to the theory, practice, and history of Mazdan magic, the first organized system of magic

• Provides a complete curriculum of magical study and initiation centered on exercises keyed to the sacred Zoroastrian calendar

• Details advanced magical rituals and practices based on archaic Persian formulas, including fire rituals and divine invocations

• Explores the history and lore of Persian magic, explaining how the author reconstructed the original Mazdan system of magic

Stephen Flowers explores the history, theory, practice, rituals, and initiations of the Mazdan magical system practiced by the Magi of ancient Persia, who were so skilled and famed for their effectiveness that their name came to mean what we today call “magic.” The prestige and reputation of the Magian priests of Mazda is perhaps most iconically recorded in the Christian story of the Three Wise Men who visited newborn Jesus.

The author explains how the religious branch of the Mazdan magical system, founded by the Prophet Zarathustra, is known in the West under the name Zoroastrianism. He reveals how the Zoroastrian religion, which acts as a matrix for the symbols and formulas of the original form of magic, has existed for almost four thousand years with roots going back even deeper into the Indo-European past. The author reveals how all other known systems of magic have borrowed from this tradition, providing the clues that enabled him to reformulate the original Mazdan system. He reviews what the Greeks, Romans, Hebrews, Christians, and Chinese said about the Iranian-Persian tradition of the Mazdans and their invention of a magical technology. He explains how the ultimate aim of the original form of magic was not only individual wisdom, self-development, and empowerment, but also the overall betterment of the world.

Outlining the theoretical principles of this method, which can be applied in practical ways to deepen the effectiveness of these magical operations, the author details a complete curriculum of magical study and initiation based on a series of graded exercises keyed to the sacred Zoroastrian calendar. He then offers a series of more advanced magical rituals and practices based on archaic Persian formulas, including fire rituals and divine invocations. Providing a manual for the original magical system used by the members of the Great Fellowship, this book guides you toward the comprehensive practice of the Mazdan philosophy, the ultimate outcome of which is ushta: Happiness.

A guide to creating miracles in your own life through the power of thought

• 2019 Coalition of Visionary Resources Gold Award

• Offers a concise, clear formula of focused exercises and concrete tools to lay out a specific path to manifest your deepest desires

• Presents the first serious reconsideration of New Thought philosophy since the death of William James in 1910

• Draws on the work of New Thought pioneers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Napoleon Hill, Neville Goddard, William James, Andrew Jackson Davis, Wallace D. Wattles, and many others

Following in the footsteps of a little-known group of esoteric seekers from the late-nineteenth century who called themselves “the Miracle Club,” Mitch Horowitz shows that the spiritual “wish fulfillment” practices known as the Law of Attraction, Positive Thinking, “the Secret,” and the Science of Getting Rich actually work. Weaving these ideas together into a concise, clear formula, with real-life examples of success, he reveals how your thoughts can impact reality and make things happen.

In this “manual for miracles,” Horowitz explains how we each possess a creative agency to determine and reshape our lives. He shows how thinking in a directed, highly focused, and emotively charged manner expands our capacity to perceive and transform events and allows us to surpass ordinary boundaries of time and physical space. Building on Neville Goddard’s view that the human imagination is God the Creator and Ralph Waldo Emerson’s techniques for attaining personal power, he explores the highest uses of mind-power metaphysics and explains what works and what doesn’t, illuminating whyand how events bend to our thoughts. He encourages readers to experiment and find themselves “at the helm of infinite possibilities.” 

Laying out a specific path to manifest your deepest desires, from wealth and love to happiness and security, Horowitz provides focused exercises and concrete tools for change and looks at ways to get more out of prayer, affirmation, and visualization. He also provides the first serious reconsideration of New Thought philosophy since the death of William James in 1910. He includes crucial insights and effective methods from the movement’s leaders such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Napoleon Hill, Neville Goddard, William James, Andrew Jackson Davis, Wallace D. Wattles, and many others. Defining a miracle as “circumstances or events that surpass all conventional or natural expectation,” t

He encourages readers to experiment and find themselves “at the helm of infinite possibilities.” </p><p><br></p><p>Laying out a specific path to manifest your deepest desires, from wealth and love to happiness and security, Horowitz provides focused exercises and concrete tools for change and looks at ways to get more out of prayer, affirmation, and visualization. He also provides the first serious reconsideration of New Thought philosophy since the death of William James in 1910. He includes crucial insights and effective methods from the movement’s leaders such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Napoleon Hill, Neville Goddard, William James, Andrew Jackson Davis, Wallace D. Wattles, and many others. Defining a miracle as “circumstances or events that surpass all conventional or natural expectation,” t</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

In July 1996, during an extraordinary out-of-body journey through the Milky Way and other galaxies, Patricia Cori was reconnected and attuned to a group of interdimensional light beings that she and her many readers came to know, through the first Sirian Revelations transmissions, as The Sirian High Council. During her remarkable mission as their Scribe, she has shared the insights of six-dimensional Sirian Light Emissaries through the books and teachings that have transformed readers over the past decades. Now, twenty years from the date of the first transmission, Cori shares new revelations that affirm the veracity of past prophecies and transmit new visions for the human race as we ascend through the outer reaches of the fourth dimension into new levels of conscious awareness and parallel realities as we prepare for our imminent emergence.
 
Called a "real-life Indiana Jones" by fans and readers around the world, Cori is one of the most well-known and established authorities on multidimensional realities that challenge the status quo. Her messages from distant realms empower readers to look at the dark side, to understand it, but to focus on the light for all humankind and the earth. In this new book, the Sirians once again hold us to our responsibility as guardians of this planet, with sound direction and advice for how to get through these shifting sands of our transition. Their discussions delve into many of the most crucial issues of our time, including the merging of human mind and artificial intelligence, exoplanetary migration from the earth and what that means to planets that will receive us, coming clean about cloning, the care and feeding of the human being, and the slipping of time as we know it. As the struggle between darkness and light is being fought at every level, Cori reminds us to take comfort in the fact that the Sirian High Council foresaw and told us how this time of immense upheaval would be the last phase of our passage out of the darkness and into the light of far more illuminated states of being.

An innovative guide to applying the strategies of a bodyguard to create a Buddhist “security plan” for protecting ourselves from suffering

• Presents the unique concept of the “bodyguard” and its protection tactics as a metaphor for explaining and implementing Buddhist teachings

• Recasts the Four Noble Truths as the Four Noble Tactical Truths, the Eightfold Path as the Eight Tactics Plan, and the notion of Interbeing in the Buddhist world as the Tactics of Interdepending

• Offers a new, modern understanding for the new generation of Buddhist practitioners intrigued by a more Western take on Buddhism

Drawing from his extensive experience as a professional protection agent, Jeff Eisenberg uses the tactics and strategies that a bodyguard employs in protecting a client from a threat as a blueprint for creating a Buddhist “security plan.” This plan provides the practical tools to protect one’s self from the threat of suffering in our world. Using the metaphor of being the Buddha’s bodyguard to understand the Buddhist teachings, the book details how to protect our inner “Buddha nature” and secure our mental and emotional wellbeing.

We all have the chance to train ourselves to be more proactive in our own safety and avoid becoming a victim. And if we are victimized, this training will prepare us to take appropriate actions that will aid in our ability to survive with much less injury and trauma. As the author affirms: “It is vital to realize that a physical altercation is the last thing that happens in a chain of events. And while we must never blame the victim, our safety is our responsibility. Many situations can be avoided, or their severity greatly lessened, if we pay attention during the chain of events that leads up to it and respond appropriately.” 

While this book is not about personal protection per se, it applies personal protection theory and specific tactics utilized by bodyguards to Buddhist practice, laying out strategies to protect our inner Buddha from attack. Thus the Four Noble Truths are applied to the concept of “threat” in the form of Four Noble Tactical Truths, the Eight Tactics Plan echoes the Eightfold Path, and the Tactics of Interdepending embrace the notion of Interbeing in the Buddhist world. 

With “paying attention” and mindfulness being key concepts of both a bodyguard’s profession and Buddhist practice, this pioneering book speaks to Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike

A teenage girl’s suicide raises questions of culpability for internet bullies in this investigation by the criminologist and true crime author.

On September 5, 2015, in a public park in LaVergne, Tennessee, fourteen-year-old Sherokee Harriman drove a kitchen knife into her stomach as other teens watched in horror. The coroner ruled it a “suicide.” But was it? Or was it a crime perpetuated by other teens who had bullied her?

Sherokee’s tragic death created a media frenzy focused more on sensationalism than finding the truth. Meanwhile the community of LaVerge sought answers to questions about who, if anyone, should be held criminally responsible for bullying.

Criminologist Judith A. Yates peels back the distorting layers of social media and news coverage to examine a timely question with far-reaching implications: was Sherokee Harriman bullied to death?

Coral Castle is the first book to take an objective, journalistic look at one of America's most intriguing places, Coral Castle, located in Homestead, Florida. Edward Leedskalnin, an eccentric Latvian immigrant, built Coral Castle in the 1920s and '30s. Working alone with primitive tools, he quarried, carved, and set in place more than 1,100 tons of coral rock, creating what is commonly known as the American Stonehenge. How he accomplished this amazing feat remains a mystery. Some believe he was simply a talented stonemason and engineer. Many others believe he had somehow harnessed anti-gravity powers. Several books have been written on Ed's otherworldly powers and he has become a cult figure to those who believe in extra-terrestrials and the magnetic grid theory. In Coral Castle, Rusty McClure and Jack Heffron survey the theories and tell the story through journalistic investigation and interviews with experts on all sides of the argument.

      <title>Pursued by The Greatest Posse of All-Time</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/pursued-by-the-greatest-posse-of-all-time/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is author and historian Chris Enss who's here to discuss the Wild West and what was considered to be the greatest possse of all time.
Future legends of the Old West, Charlie Bassett, Bat Masterson, Wyatt Earp, and Bill Tilghman were the lawmen who patrolled the unruly streets. When a cattle baron’s son fled town after the shooting of the popular saloon singer named Dora Hand, the four men--all experts with a gun who knew the harsh, desertlike surrounding terrain--hunted him down like "Thunder Over the Prairie." The posse's ride across the desolate landscape to seek justice influenced the men's friendship, their careers, and their feelings about the justice system. This account of that event is a fast-paced, cinematic glimpse into the Old West that was.

Paracoustics: Paranormal Acoustics From the chain-rattling ghost of Pliny's first century Athens to things that go bump in the night and 21st century electronic voice phenomena sound has always fascinated paranormal researchers. This unique book examines that fascination and presents a selection of the leading research in paranormal acoustics together with an in-depth review of the equipment and techniques that are used by researchers and investigators. It explores the physics and the psychology of sound and its association with the paranormal. Contributed chapters by leading experts in Infrasound, electronic voice phenomenon (EVP), séance tapping and other ghostly sounds encourage a multidisciplinary approach to the subject.

      <title>Occult Influences in Modern Culture</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/occult-influences-in-modern-culture/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is Carl Abrahamsson who's here to discuss magic and occultism in the development of our modern culture. His book. 

Examines key figures behind esoteric cultural developments, such as Carl Jung, Anton LaVey, Paul Bowles, Aleister Crowley, and Rudolf Steiner 

Explores the history of magic as a source of genuine counterculture and compares it with our contemporary soulless, digital monoculture

Reveals how the magic of art can be restored if art is employed as a means rather than an end and offers strategies to rekindle intuitive creativity

Art, magic, and the occult have been intimately linked since our prehistoric ancestors created the first cave paintings some 50,000 years ago. As civilizations developed, these esoteric forces continued to drive culture forward, both visibly and behind the scenes, from the Hermetic ideas of the Renaissance to the ethereal worlds of 19th-century Symbolism to the occult interests of the Surrealists. 
In this deep exploration of “occulture” - the liminal space where art and magic meet - Carl Abrahamsson reveals the integral role played by magic and occultism in the development of culture throughout history, as well as their relevance to the continuing survival of art and creativity. Blending magical history and esoteric philosophy with his more than 30 years’ experience in occult movements, Abrahamsson examines the phenomena and people who have been seminal in modern esoteric developments, including Carl Jung, Anton LaVey, Paul Bowles, Aleister Crowley, and Rudolf Steiner. 
Revealing how art and magic were initially one and the same, the author explores the history of magic as a source of genuine counterculture and compares it with our contemporary soulless, digital monoculture. He reveals how the magic of art can be restored if art is employed as a means rather than an end - if it is intense, emotional, violent, and expressive - and offers strategies for creating freely, magically, even spontaneously, with intent unfettered by the whims of trends, a creative practice akin to chaos magic that assists both creators and spectators to live with meaning. He also looks at intuition and creativity as the cornerstones of genuine individuation, explaining how insights and illuminations seldom come in collective forms. 
Exploring magical philosophy, occult history, the arts, psychology, and the colorful grey areas in between, Abrahamsson reveals the culturally and magically transformative role of art and the ways the occult continues to transform culture to this day.

As civilizations developed, these esoteric forces continued to drive culture forward, both visibly and behind the scenes, from the Hermetic ideas of the Renaissance to the ethereal worlds of 19th-century Symbolism to the occult interests of the Surrealists. </p><p>In this deep exploration of “occulture” - the liminal space where art and magic meet - Carl Abrahamsson reveals the integral role played by magic and occultism in the development of culture throughout history, as well as their relevance to the continuing survival of art and creativity. Blending magical history and esoteric philosophy with his more than 30 years’ experience in occult movements, Abrahamsson examines the phenomena and people who have been seminal in modern esoteric developments, including Carl Jung, Anton LaVey, Paul Bowles, Aleister Crowley, and Rudolf Steiner. </p><p>Revealing how art and magic were initially one and the same, the author explores the history of magic as a source of genuine counterculture and compares it with our contemporary soulless, digital monoculture. He reveals how the magic of art can be restored if art is employed as a means rather than an end - if it is intense, emotional, violent, and expressive - and offers strategies for creating freely, magically, even spontaneously, with intent unfettered by the whims of trends, a creative practice akin to chaos magic that assists both creators and spectators to live with meaning. He also looks at intuition and creativity as the cornerstones of genuine individuation, explaining how insights and illuminations seldom come in collective forms. </p><p>Exploring magical philosophy, occult history, the arts, psychology, and the colorful grey areas in between, Abrahamsson reveals the culturally and magically transformative role of art and the ways the occult continues to transform culture to this day.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mysteriousradio/">@mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Follow us on Pinterest <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/mysteriousradio">pinterest.com/mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Like us on Facebook<a href="http://www.facebook.com/mysteriousradio"> Facebook.com/mysteriousradio</a></p><p>Website: <a href="https://www.mysteriousradio.com/">https://www.mysteriousradio.com</a></p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>Tonight, my special guest is Bob Cranmer who's family suffered through one of Pittsburg's most frightening hauntings. Get his book.
October 1988: Bob Cranmer buys a house in the Pittsburgh suburb he grew up in. He has no idea that his dream home is about to become his worst nightmare…

The Cranmers seemed fated to own the house at 3406 Brownsville Road. As a young boy, Bob had been drawn to the property, and, just when the family decided to move back to Brentwood, it went up for sale. Without a second thought, they purchased the house that Bob had always dreamed of owning.

But soon, the family began experiencing strange phenomena—objects moving on their own, ghostly footsteps, unsettling moaning sounds—that gradually increased in violence, escalating to physical assaults and, most disturbingly, bleeding walls. Bob, Lesa, and their four children were under attack from a malicious demon that was conjuring up terrifying manifestations to destroy their tight-knit household. They had two choices: leave or draw on their unwavering faith to exorcise the malicious fiend who haunted their home.

Now, Bob Cranmer recounts the harrowing true story of the evil presence that tormented his family and the epic spiritual war he fought to save everything he held dear…

After surviving the horrors of the Holocaust—in ghettos, on death marches, and in concentration camps—a young couple seeks refuge in Canada. They settle into a new life, certain that the terrors of their past are behind them. They build themselves a cozy little cottage on a lake in Muskoka, a cottage that becomes emblematic of their victory over the Nazis. The charming retreat is a safe haven, a refuge from haunted memories.

That is, until a single act of unspeakable violence defiles their sanctuary. Poking around the dark crawl space beneath their cottage, they discover a wooden crate, nailed tightly shut and almost hidden from view. Nothing could have prepared them for the horror of the crate’s contents—or how the peace and tranquility of their lives would be shattered. 

Now, their daughter, Deborah Vadas Levison, an award-winning journalist, tells the extraordinary account of her parents’ ordeals, both in one of the darkest times in world history and their present-day lives. Written in searing, lyrical prose, The Crate: A Story of War, a Murder, and Justice examines man’s seemingly limitless capacity for evil . . . but also, his capacity for good.

“An impressive and important piece of work. I’m glad it was written, and I’m glad I read it.”—Lee Child, #1 New York Times bestselling author

“A gut-punch, hitting you broadside with such harrowing moments that you have to put the book down and take a breath.”—James Rollins, #1 New York Times bestselling author

This book was featured on Fox News. Did President Clinton know the 9-11 attack was coming? After reading this book, many will conclude he did. If you don't believe in government conspiracies, this book will change you forever. Throughout the book, the governments own top-secret documents details their conspiracies to commit assassinations and much more. New York Times Bestselling author and former LAPD Intelligence Detective Mike Rothmiller has spent decades painstakingly scouring various governmental archives in the United States and England to obtain these shocking and sometimes appalling pieces of history which are virtually unknown to the masses. When his analysis is combined with these formerly top-secret documents the book presents a startling, eye-opening encyclopedia of secrets, lies and deception carried out at the highest levels of government. Here’s a small sample of what is disclosed in this book: Did you know there are top-secret telephone transcripts of President Bill Clinton discussing Iraq’s WMDs and Usama bin Laden’s planned attacks on the United States years before 9/11 occurred? Did you know about the CIAs top-secret search for Noah’s Ark? Do you know what Hitler’s bizarre sexual practices were? Did you know about the plot to assassinate the President of Mexico? Did you know that President Abraham Lincoln had a gay lover? Did you know that within hours of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, President Lyndon Johnson and others were secretly conspiring to dictate the outcome of the official investigation before it started? Did you know of the multi-nation assassination team which murdered people in Washington DC? Or, that the Vietnam War was waged for the prestige and influence of the president and the CIA never believed the war could be won? How about the top-secret plan to use nuclear bombs in Vietnam? Did you know that nuclear bombs have been lost? Did you know that the CIA stole a Soviet satellite for examination and the Soviets never knew? And, the Top-Secret 9/11 commission 28 page document implicating Saudi government officials in the attack. And never before revealed is the shocking conspiracy involving the DEA, FBI, DOJ, CIA and Dept. of State to ignore the United States federal indictment of a major Mexican cocaine trafficker and allow him to freely travel throughout the United States and continue his smuggling operation.

Did President Clinton know the 9-11 attack was coming? After reading this book, many will conclude he did. If you don't believe in government conspiracies, this book will change you forever. Throughout the book, the governments own top-secret documents details their conspiracies to commit assassinations and much more. New York Times Bestselling author and former LAPD Intelligence Detective Mike Rothmiller has spent decades painstakingly scouring various governmental archives in the United States and England to obtain these shocking and sometimes appalling pieces of history which are virtually unknown to the masses. When his analysis is combined with these formerly top-secret documents the book presents a startling, eye-opening encyclopedia of secrets, lies and deception carried out at the highest levels of government. Here’s a small sample of what is disclosed in this book: Did you know there are top-secret telephone transcripts of President Bill Clinton discussing Iraq’s WMDs and Usama bin Laden’s planned attacks on the United States years before 9/11 occurred? Did you know about the CIAs top-secret search for Noah’s Ark? Do you know what Hitler’s bizarre sexual practices were? Did you know about the plot to assassinate the President of Mexico? Did you know that President Abraham Lincoln had a gay lover? Did you know that within hours of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, President Lyndon Johnson and others were secretly conspiring to dictate the outcome of the official investigation before it started? Did you know of the multi-nation assassination team which murdered people in Washington DC? Or, that the Vietnam War was waged for the prestige and influence of the president and the CIA never believed the war could be won? How about the top-secret plan to use nuclear bombs in Vietnam? Did you know that nuclear bombs have been lost? Did you know that the CIA stole a Soviet satellite for examination and the Soviets never knew? And, the Top-Secret 9/11 commission 28 page document implicating Saudi government officials in the attack.

Tom and Jackie Hawks loved their life in retirement, sailing on their yacht, the Well Deserved. But when the birth of a new grandson called them back to Arizona, they put the boat up for sale. Skylar Deleon and his pregnant wife Jennifer showed up as prospective buyers, with their baby in a stroller, and the Hawkses thought they had a deal. Soon after a sea trial and an alleged purchase, however, the older couple disappeared and the Deleons promptly tried to access the Hawkses’ bank accounts.

BOOK COVER
As police investigated the case, they not only found a third homicide victim with ties to Skylar, they also uncovered an unexpected and unusual motive: Skylar had wanted gender reassignment surgery for years. By killing the Hawkses with a motley crew of assailants and plundering the couple’s assets, the Deleons had planned to clear their $100,000 in debts and still have money for the surgery, which Skylar had already scheduled.
Now, in this up-to-the-minute updated edition, which includes extensive new material, New York Times bestselling author Caitlin Rother presents the latest breaking developments in the case. Skylar, who was ultimately sentenced to death row for the three murders, transitioned to a woman via hormones while living in the psych unit at San Quentin prison. Recently, she legally changed her name and gender to female, apparently a strategic step in her quest to obtain taxpayer-subsidized gender confirmation surgery and transfer to a women’s prison. Combined with Governor Gavin Newsom’s recent moratorium on executions, this only adds insult to injury for the victims’ families, who want Skylar to receive the ultimate punishment for her crimes.

      <title>Creatures Lie Here </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/creatures-lie-here/</link>
      <description>My special guest tonight is author and cryptozoologist Lyle Blackburn who's here to discuss an upright walking creature that resembles a lizard terrorizing a town in South Carolina.
From the swamplands near Bishopville, South Carolina, come reports of a seven-foot-tall, scaly humanoid creature the locals call the "Lizard Man." Over the years, the creature has been seen by numerous witnesses, including a teenager who claimed it attacked him one night near a remote area called Scape Ore Swamp. The young man's testimony and physical evidence was so compelling, it not only launched a serious investigation by the local sheriff's office but an all-out monster hunt that drew hundreds of people to the small town. 
This real-life "creature from the black lagoon" has inspired major national news coverage, even a call from the famous CBS news anchor, Dan Rather, as he and the rest of the world clamored to know more about Bishopville's elusive monster. The case is often mentioned in books, websites, and television shows, but the full story has never been told... until now. This book provides unprecedented documentation for one of the most bizarre and hair-raising cases of an unknown creature. The witnesses are convinced they've seen it, and the local law officials are backing them up. This is their story. 
Follow Lyle Blackburn, author of the bestselling book "The Beast of Boggy Creek," as he and his partner, Cindy Lee, revisit the sighting locations, speak to the living eyewitnesses, and consider all possible theories in their search for the truth behind the legendary Lizard Man.

Without question, this is a classic by one of the most exciting new authors in the UFO field today. After reading it, your view of reality will never be the same.
The owl has held a place of reverence and mystique throughout history. And as strange as this might seem, owls are also showing up in conjunction with the UFO experience.
Mike Clelland has collected a wealth of first-hand accounts in which owls manifest in the highly charged moments that surround alien contact. There is a strangeness to these accounts that defy simple explanations. This book explores implications that go far beyond what more conservative researchers would dare consider.
But the owl connection encompasses more than the UFO experience. It also includes profound synchronicities, ancient archetypes, dreams, shamanistic experiences, personal transformation, and death. From the mythic legends of our ancient past to the first-hand accounts of the UFO abductee, owls are playing some vital role.
This is also a deeply personal story. It is an odyssey of self-discovery as the author grapples with his own owl and UFO encounters. What plays out is a story of transformation with the owl at the heart of this journey.

Reveals the origins and history of the New England witch hysteria, its continuing repercussions, and the multilayered practices of today’s modern witches 

• Shares the stories of 13 accused witches from the New England colonies through interviews with their living descendants 

• Explores the positive role witches played in rural communities until the dawn of the industrial age, despite ongoing persecution 

• Includes in-depth interviews with 25 modern witchcraft practitioners, interwoven with practical information on the sacred calendar, herb lore, spells, and magical practices 

New England has long been associated with witches. And while the Salem witch trials happened long ago, the prejudices and fears engendered by the witchcraft hysteria still live on in our culture. What forces were at work that brought the witch hysteria quickly from Europe to the new American colony, a place of religious freedom--and what caused these prejudices to linger centuries after the fact? 

Weaving together history, sacred lore, modern practice, and the voices of today’s witches, Ellen Evert Hopman offers a new, deeper perspective on American witchcraft and its ancient pagan origins. Beginning with the “witch hysteria” that started in Europe and spread to the New World, Hopman explores the witch hunts, persecutions, mass hysteria, and killings, concluding that between forty and sixty thousand women and men were executed as witches. Combining records of known events with moving interviews with their descendants, she shares the stories of 13 New England witches persecuted during the witch trials, including Tituba and Mary Bliss Parsons, the Witch of Northhampton. Despite the number of false accusations during the witch hysteria in the New England colonies, Hopman reveals how there were practicing witches during that time and describes the positive role witches played in rural communities until the dawn of the industrial age.

Embracing the revival of psychedelic research and the discovery of new therapeutic uses, clinical psychologist Dr. Richard Louis Miller discusses what is happening today in psychedelic medicine--and what will happen in the future--with top researchers and thinkers in this field, including Rick Doblin, Stanislav Grof, James Fadiman, Julie Holland, Dennis McKenna, David Nichols, Charles Grob, Phil Wolfson, Michael and Annie Mithoefer, Roland Griffiths, Katherine MacLean, and Robert Whitaker. 

Dr. Miller and his contributors cover the tumultuous history of early psychedelic research brought to a halt 50 years ago by the U.S. government as well as offering non-technical summaries of the most recent studies with MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, and ayahuasca. They explore the biochemistry of consciousness and the use of psychedelics for self-discovery and healing. They discuss the use of psilocybin for releasing fear in the terminally ill and the potential for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of PTSD. They examine Dr. Charles Grob’s research on the indigenous use and therapeutic properties of ayahuasca and Dr. Gabor Mate’s attempt to transport this plant medicine to a clinical setting with the help of Canada’s Department of National Health. 

Dr. Miller and his contributors explore the ongoing efforts to restore psychedelic therapies to the health field, the growing threat of overmedication by the pharmaceutical industry, and the links between psychiatric drugs and mental illness. They also discuss the newly shifting political climate and the push for new research, offering hope for an end to the War on Drugs and a potential renaissance of research into psychedelic medicines around the world.

As the sun rises over the quiet city of Kingston, New York on July 12, 1988, a local transient discovers the remains of 19-year-old Anna Kithcart. She was strangled and beaten to death, with the letters “KKK” carved into her thighs.

While her heartbroken family mourns, and the police work around the clock to uncover the truth, the investigation is complicated by the entrance of the Reverend Al Sharpton who insists that a racist killer is responsible. As investigators struggle to find evidence, Sharpton and his supporters denounce the entire area as a “Klan den” and make public pronouncements that a “racist cult” is operating throughout the area. 

Then, as if things can’t get any worse, the transient who found the body confesses to an unspeakable sexual act against the corpse. Almost immediately after the media reports his alleged depravity, he changes his story and accuses the police of making him a patsy and a scapegoat. To add to the expanding circus, he tells the world he is really an undercover agent for the CIA, FBI, and Interpol.

Only solving the crime can quell the chaos that threatens to ignite a powder keg of racial tension and get past the rumors to catch the real killer. But can investigators overcome the outside forces that repeatedly sidetrack their efforts? Find out in this great new true crime from Richard T. Cahill, the author of HAUPTMANN’S LADDER.

The terrifying life of a rampaging Indiana killer is vividly chronicled in this true crime book by the co-authors of Race to Justice.

Maybe the youngest son of a violent criminal named Hoggy Thompson was born a beast. Maybe rage was beaten into him. One thing was certain, by the time he reached manhood, Jerry Thompson was a savage killer. He had no conscience about rape, child molestation, or thrashing a dozen men in a prison fight. Once he got his hands on a gun, any target would do. He didn't leave witnesses.

When he terrorized an entire courtroom and threatened to rip deputy prosecutor Larry Sells apart, people wondered if there would ever be a way to stop his viciousness. In Beast of New Castle, Sells and co-author Margie Porter take a deep dive into the life and crimes of this unrelenting violent offender, and the desperate quest by law enforcement to stop him for good.

The shroud of Turin is one of history’s most controversial and perplexing relics. Many believe it to be the genuine burial shroud of Jesus Christ. Some hypothesize the image on the shroud was created through a rare scientific phenomenon. Still others think the shroud is a fake, proven—through carbon tests in 1988—to be a clever forgery. In The Truth About the Shroud of Turin , investigative reporter Robert K. Wilcox applies his investigative eye and compelling writing style to this mysterious artifact. Featuring new evidence, The Truth About the Shroud of Turin offers new insight into this baffling mystery and offers compelling evidence that the shroud is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus Christ.

"There was no brown in his eyes at all. They were just two black buttons. I looked in his eyes. All I saw was solid black against the whites. It wasn’t natural. It was… creepy, unnerving, demonic." - Detective Paula May
Terrifying things are happening to Kay Weden, a forty-something single mom and high school teacher in Salisbury, North Carolina. Despite having no known enemies, Kay’s home, car, and peace of mind are under attack throughout 1993. Most chilling of all are the senseless attacks on her only son and the shot fired in the night through a wall of her house, which narrowly misses his head as he sleeps. 
Kay’s new love interest is the charming Viktor Gunnarsson. He’s a handsome Swede who left his home country to seek political asylum in the U.S. after being charged with the 1986 assassination of Sweden’s Prime Minister Palme. Viktor was briefly held in custody but subsequently released due to a lack of evidence. 
The romantic connection between Kay and Viktor is immediate and intense until Viktor disappears without warning, leaving Kay baffled and sad. Kay leans on her loving, elderly mother, Catherine Miller, for solace until Catherine is brutally murdered inside her home by an unknown intruder. 
With nowhere else to turn, Kay reconnects with her ex-fiancé L.C. Underwood, a seasoned police officer, particularly adept at criminal investigations. L.C. assures Kay he will get to the bottom of the incessant and tormenting occurrences.
When Viktor’s nude body is found two hours away in the snowy Appalachian Mountains, local Sheriff’s Detective Paula May is assigned to investigate his murder. What follows is an intense, hair-raising investigation that will shock you from the bitterly cold beginning to the unthinkable end.

Hospitals are supposed to be places of healing, places of birth, and places of hope. But with all of the varying highs and lows that are experienced in these buildings, is it any wonder when echoes linger indefinitely? How about asylums, which house some of society’s worst offenders and troubled inmates, or sanatoriums, places where the mentally and physically ill find themselves trapped, even after death?

Journey inside the history of these macabre settings and learn about the horrors from the past that live on in these frighteningly eerie tales from Canada, the United States, and around the world.

"Wrong Numbers is an intriguing and well-researched crime story detailing the intersection of big money and quick sex in the city that contains a lot of both." - Jack Sheehan, author of Skin City

Was a hacker diverting phone calls meant for Las Vegas escort services? The FBI wanted to know, and so did associates of a New York Mafia family. 
In one of the most unusual undercover operations ever, the FBI had an agent acting as a manager in a real Las Vegas escort service. 
Federal agents expected to find prostitution and drugs in the Las Vegas escort industry. What their investigation uncovered was even more serious.


"Wiseguys and wannabes are on the hunt for a shadowy hacker who may hold the keys to control of Las Vegas’ multi-million dollar call girl racket, while FBI agents are hunting them. The result is a gripping true-life crime story that reads like a collaboration between Elmore Leonard and Williams Gibson told with the knowing savvy of two longtime chroniclers of Sin City’s hidden underbelly." - Kevin Poulsen, author of KINGPIN: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime Underground"In ’90s Vegas, call girls worked for “entertainment” services that were little more than phone numbers, dispatchers, and drop safes. When a mystery hacker started diverting customer’s calls to one service’s number, it launched a series of dangerous events that involved the Mob, feds, hackers, service owners, and the phone system itself. This slice of Sin City history is as little-known as it is thrilling, and it’s well-told by investigative journalist Glen Meek and crime writer Dennis Griffin." - Deke Castleman, author of Whale Hunt in the Desert: Secrets of a Vegas Superhost

...Over twenty years ago, a group of individuals from several different worlds gathered at a discreet location in our solar system near earth for the purpose of observing the alien intervention that is occurring in our world. From their hidden vantage point, they were able to determine the identity, organization and intentions of those visiting our world and monitor the visitors' activities. This group of observers call themselves the "Allies of Humanity." This is their report.

No other legend invoked as much fear, panic, and dread as the Wendigo. For hundreds of years people in Canada and the United States have told stories of a giant cannibalistic monster that could devour an entire community- or worse yet, possess you and turn you into a Wendigo. Almost everything that has previously been written about the Wendigo comes from an anthropological or sociological perspective, often failing to even address the supernatural component of the lore. Not this book! The result is one of the most comprehensive explorations of the Wendigo legend ever written. While not for the faint of heart, Wendigo Lore is a treasure trove of information for those seeking to learn more about this unique legend of the Northwoods.

The world’s only non-denominational exorcist tells her astonishing true story: a riveting chronicle of wrestling entities from infected souls, showing how pain and trauma opens us to attachment from forces that drain our energy . . . and can even destroy our humanity.
As a secular exorcist, Rachel H. Stavis has cleansed thousands of tormented people, from small children and Hollywood moguls to stay-at-home moms and politicians. But for many years, the horror screenwriter and novelist denied her gift. As a little girl, she began to see "monsters" floating around her bedroom or attached to other children. Told it was only her imagination, Rachel learned to ignore the things she saw. 
But a series of events in adulthood forced her to acknowledge her unique ability and embrace her power to heal. Since then, Rachel has dedicated her life to helping others cast off the forces feeding off of us. Performing her services pro-bono, she quietly worked in the shadows, until she unknowingly revealed her work to a journalist, who told her story to NPR.
A unique look at demonology removed from religious dogma, Sister of Darkness recounts Rachel’s journey to becoming an exorcist and chronicles some of her most extreme cleansings cases, including those that put her and her clients in peril. Going deep into her world, we meet the diverse range of people she has helped—young, old, famous and not—in gripping stories of danger and sometimes sadness, that are ultimately about redemption. Rachel teaches us that there are a diverse range of "entities" surrounding us—some of these are playful or misguided, while some are dangerous and harmful. She introduces each of them and explains their power, helping us understand what is attacking and hurting us, and what we can do to protect ourselves.
Frightening, eye-opening, and utterly enthralling, Sister of Darkness brings to light a world ruled by destruction, chaos and fear, and the woman who bravely fights to protect those who seeks her out.

The discovery of giant humans in North America is the result of pouring through over 10,000 State, County and Township histories at one of the largest genealogical libraries in America. Hundreds of additional accounts were also found within newspaper archives. The result is the 
   The Encyclopedia of Ancient Giants in North America chronicles two distinct waves of giant humans migrating to North America. As early as 7,000 B.C., strange people arrived on the North American shores of gigantic size with Neanderthal looking skulls. Their spread across the American landscape is documented not only by their massive skeletons but by an identical material culture that was found buried with their remains. Double rows of teeth and skulls with protruding horns make them one of America's most intriguing mysteries. At the advent of the Bronze Age another migration of giant humans found their way to North America. A persistent legend exists with Native Americans of a people who came to trade and mine the copper from the Upper Great Lakes. They left an indelible mark upon the landscape of the Ohio Valley with their large burial mounds and earthworks aligned to solar, lunar and stellar events. The measurements of these works reveal that they were constructed with the knowledge of advanced mathematics

In August 1945, Gladys Lincoln of Sacramento contacted prosperous Dr. W. D. Broadhurst of Caldwell, Idaho, and rekindled a romance from twenty years earlier. After many passionate letter exchanges and several sexually-charged meetings, they were married in Reno, Nevada on May 20, 1946. After a passion-filled three-day weekend together, the doctor returned to his home in Idaho, and Gladys returned to Sacramento … and to her husband, Leslie Lincoln! But Gladys was much more than a bigamist.
Gladys needed something even she didn’t understand. She married her first husband when she was 20, and her second husband only 14 months later. The second marriage lasted only two years, the third less than 16 months. Leslie Lincoln was her fifth, and Dr. Broadhurst became her sixth. But what desperate need drove her to go from marriage to marriage?
Then what dark mindset moved her and her young cowboy chauffeur to commit murder? Find out in ‘TIL DEATH DO US…’ the gripping new true crime from WildBlue Press author Patrick Gallagher, whose grandfather was Gladys’ lead defense attorney during her sensational trial.

Now published in five languages, Strange Medicine casts a gimlet eye on the practice of medicine through the ages that highlights the most dubious ideas, bizarre treatments, and biggest blunders. From bad science and oafish behavior to stomach-turning procedures that hurt more than helped, Strange Medicine presents strange but true facts and an honor roll of doctors, scientists, and dreamers who inadvertently turned the clock of medicine backward:

* The ancient Egyptians applied electric eels to cure gout.
* Medieval dentists burned candles in patients' mouths to kill invisible worms gnawing at their teeth.
* Renaissance physicians timed surgical procedures according to the position of the stars, and instructed epileptics to collect fresh blood from the newly beheaded.
* Dr. Walter Freeman, the world's foremost practitioner of lobotomies, practiced his craft while traveling on family camping trips, cramming the back of the station wagon with kids--and surgical tools--then hammering ice picks into the eye sockets of his patients in between hikes in the woods.

Strange Medicine is an illuminating panorama of medical history as you've never seen it before.

UNDER A FULL MOON: The Last Lynching in Kansas tells of the tragic abduction and death of an eight-year-old girl at the hands of a repeat offender in 1932. This crime stands apart as the last mob lynching in Kansas. Based on true events, this account takes a deep dive into the psycho-social complexities of pioneer times and their impact on this particular crime and the justice meted out to the perpetrator. 
Beginning in the year 1881, and written in a chronological narrative non-fiction format, author Alice Kay Hill vividly weaves the stories of the victims and the families involved. She reveals how mental and physical abuse, social isolation, privations of homesteading, strong dreams and even stronger personalities all factored into the criminal and his crimes. 
Spanning the years of settlement to the beginnings of the Dust Bowl, historic events are lived as daily news by the seven families whose lives become intertwined. Historically accurate and written with an intimate knowledge of the area, UNDER A FULL MOON is as personal as a family diary, as vivid as a photo album found in an attic trunk, and will remain with the reader long after the book is closed.

It is difficult to believe that our planet has been weaponized before our very eyes, but that is exactly what has happened. First, we were seduced by the convenience of a wireless world; then, atmospheric weather experimentation in the guise of carbons “climate change” converted the air we breathe into an antenna. Now, the geo-engineering we’ve been subjected to for two decades is being normalized as the “Star Wars” Space Fence rises around and within us. Is this the Space Age we were promised?

My special guest tonight is Andrew Collins who's here to discuss the astonishing evidence of an previously unknown ancient human population of humans and the of Gobekli Tepe.

New evidence showing that the earliest origins of human culture, religion, and technology derive from the lost world of the Denisovans 

• Explains how Göbekli Tepe and the Giza pyramids are aligned with the constellation of Cygnus and show evidence of enhanced sound-acoustic technology 

• Traces the origins of Göbekli Tepe and the Giza pyramids to the Denisovans, a previously unknown human population remembered in myth as a race of giants 

• Shows how the ancient belief in Cygnus as the origin point for the human soul is as much as 45,000 years old and originally came from southern Siberia 

Built at the end of the last ice age around 9600 BCE, Göbekli Tepe in southeast Turkey was designed to align with the constellation of the celestial swan, Cygnus--a fact confirmed by the discovery at the site of a tiny bone plaque carved with the three key stars of Cygnus. Remarkably, the three main pyramids at Giza in Egypt, including the Great Pyramid, align with the same three stars. But where did this ancient veneration of Cygnus come from? 

Showing that Cygnus was once seen as a portal to the sky-world, Andrew Collins reveals how, at both sites, the attention toward this star group is linked with sound acoustics and the use of musical intervals “discovered” thousands of years later by the Greek mathematician Pythagoras. Collins traces these ideas as well as early advances in human technology and cosmology back to the Altai-Baikal region of Russian Siberia, where the cult of the swan flourished as much as 20,000 years ago. He shows how these concepts, including a complex numeric system based on long-term eclipse cycles, are derived from an extinct human population known as the Denisovans. Not only were they of exceptional size--the ancient giants of myth--but archaeological discoveries show that this previously unrecognized human population achieved an advanced level of culture, including the use of high-speed drilling techniques and the creation of musical instruments. 

The author explains how the stars of Cygnus coincided with the turning point of the heavens at the moment the Denisovan legacy was handed to the first human societies in southern Siberia 45,000 years ago, catalyzing beliefs in swan ancestry and an understanding of Cygnus as the source of cosmic creation. It also led to powerful ideas involving the Milky Way’s Dark Rift, viewed as the Path of Souls and the sky-road shamans travel to reach the sky-world. He explores how their sound technology and ancient cosmologies were carried into the West, flowering first at Göbekli Tepe and then later in Egypt’s Nile Valley. Collins shows how the ancient belief in Cygnus as the source of creation can also be found in many other cultures around the world, further confirming the role played by the Denisovan legacy in the genesis of huma

A collection of twenty two supernatural tales about the old seaport of Whitby on England's beautiful and mysterious North East Coast.

Stories include tales about ghosts, vampires, the fairy folk and ancient customs and superstitions, all of which paint a suitably spectral sketch of the ghostly goings on in this famous old town over the centuries.

The origins of creatures and spectres from the imaginations of Bram Stoker and Wilkie Collins feature in this book, put together by the former Collector of Dues of Whitby Harbour, Paul McDermott. He was able to prise some spectral gems and first hand reports from the citizens and old salts he dealt with at the harbour on a day-to-day basis.

Also included is the research he carried out on some of the more ancient tales of this one time Viking, Norman and in particular, eighteenth Century ship building port, these carried out in the famous and fascinating archives of The Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society, of which he was a member.

Are we "safe" in this universe? Is our reality fixed? Can we rely on what seems "real" and solid? Is the Mandela Effect an actual phenomenon or just the result of false memories? In Rob Shelsky's new book, Shattered Reality The Mandela Effect, he discusses all this and much more. He even tries to provide answers and some of these just might surprise you. Author Rob Shelsky discusses in-depth the possible nature of the Mandela Effect, if it is even real, or just false memories. He provides evidence, tangible evidence included, for the idea the Mandela Effect is a real "happening." If it is, then what are the consequences? The author discusses these, as well. Moreover, Rob offers a number of possible causes for the Mandela Effect, some of which are chilling in nature. Can we rely on our memories? Is the past changing? Is "someone" interfering with our timeline, and if so, who and why? Rob Shelsky delves into all these issues and many more in his latest book, Shattered Reality The Mandela Effect. A word of warning; if you prefer to believe in a safe, unchanging reality, then this book might not be for you!

You've just laid down for the night when suddenly doors slam and the curtains shift. The lights begin to flicker and a white mist forms in front of you. You shut your eyes and keep muttering, "ghosts aren't real." But then you open your eyes and realize that "harmless" mist has shifted into the form of a man, staring intensely at you, as he floats above your bed. 
What causes ghostly experiences? 
Are ghosts real? 
Why do certain people report numerous ghostly encounters and others none? 
For centuries these questions have intrigued, puzzled, and bedeviled science, skeptics, and even believers. Based on cutting-edge research and new theories, The Ghost Studies provides insight into some of life's greatest mysteries. 
This fascinating book is far more than a compilation of ghost stories. The Ghost Studies provides scientific explanations for paranormal occurrences, including: 


New and exciting scientific theories that explain apparitions, hauntings, and communications from the dead. 

The latest research on the role of energy and electricity in hauntings. 

The role that emotions, bioenergetics, and the environment play in supernatural phenomena. 

New research into why some individuals are more prone to ghostly encounters.

Reverse speech is another form of human communication that is automatically generated by the brain as we speak. It occurs backwards in speech and can be heard if human speech is recorded and played backwards. Mixed amongst the gibberish at regular intervals can be heard quite clear grammatically correct sentences that detail what is happening in the unconscious mind of the speaker. If a person is lying in forward speech, their reverse speech may reveal the truth. At deeper levels reverse speech can reveal psychological causes for current issues, whether they be mental emotional or physical.

In 1970, the Bean family moved into a modest three bedroom house located in Glen Burnie, Maryland.Bill recalled his first memories of the house were frightening ones. "it had a very foreboding and ominous feel from the start," he said. What the family didn't know is that a demonic force already occupied their new home.

Bill stated, "My family was literally torn apart by an evil force that co-existed among us. The activity began as noises and gradually escalated into violent physical attacks on us by the entities."

Bill Bean painfully describes in terrifying detail the events that tormented his family. As disturbing as some of the content in Dark Force is, there's a very powerful message of hope and faith that has affected many readers in a positive way.

An exploration of animal spirituality and the ability of animals to communicate with humans even in the afterlife.
Looking for companionship after a near-fatal car crash, Elena Mannes, an award-winning television journalist and producer, decided to get her first dog. But what she found with her dog, Brio, shook the foundations of her physical and spiritual worlds, sending her on a quest to discover the nature of his spiritual origins and to contemplate and seek out the possibility of interspecies communication - even after death.
Soon after bringing her puppy home, Mannes realized the master-companion relationship would not be possible with Brio, who quickly showed he had a mind - and a spirit - of his own. Mannes' growing curiosity about the intelligence, emotions, and consciousness of Brio and other dogs led her to contact an animal psychic in California who described, with amazing accuracy, Brio's favorite walks and the author's apartment from the dog's point of view. Mannes' skeptical journalist background compelled her to investigate further. She delved into the world of animal communicators, psychics, and scientists studying animal intelligence, including Rupert Sheldrake, to find answers to her multiplying questions: Do animals have thoughts and feelings? Consciousness? Souls? Is interspecies communication possible? Can animals reincarnate?
Spanning the entire life and afterlife of Brio, including his last days and his messages to the author after he passed on, this audiobook also explores Mannes' investigations into the spiritual life of animals, offering a new understanding of the unbreakable bond between humans and animals. Mannes invites listeners to move beyond the owner-pet relationship and shows us how to see animals as thinking, feeling, spiritual beings whose connections with us extend far beyond life and death.

      <description>Returning to the show tonight is my special guest author Dr. Bruce Solheim who's here to talk about his new book called 'Timeless Trinity - An Extra-Terrestrial and Paranormal Personal History.
Timeless Trinity is the completion of Solheim's paranormal trilogy of true stories. Trinity goes beyond the first two Timeless books as it details the authors continuing contact with Anzar, an ancient alien mystic, UFO sightings, alien abductions, animal spirits, ghosts, hauntings, demons, an encounter with the infamous original American mass murderer Dr. H.H. Holmes, and concludes that the spirit world, the alien world, and the quantum world are all the same. Dr. Solheim's Timeless Trinity is a personal glimpse into a truly paranormal life. Gary Dumm again provides the illustrations and world renowned hypnotherapist Yvonne Smith provides a foreword.

      <title>The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers</title>

The World Encyclopedia of Serial Killers is the most comprehensive set of its kind in the history of true crime publishing. Written and compiled by Susan Hall, the four-volume set has more than 1600 entries of male and female serial killers from around the world.
Defined by the FBI as a person who murders 3 or more people over a period of time with a hiatus of weeks or months between murders, serial killers have walked among us from the dawn of time as these books will demonstrate. While the entries to these volumes will continue to grow—the FBI estimates that there are at least fifty serial killers operating in the United States at any given time—The World Encyclopedia of Serial Killers is as complete as possible through the end of 2017.
In June 2020, the set begins with Volume One, Letters A-D. The entries include Ted Bundy, the Candyman Dean Corll, Angel of Death killer Donald Harvey, the ABC Killer, and the Bodies in the Barrels Murders. You will find these killers and approximately 500 others in this first book in the series of The World Encyclopedia of Serial Killers.

Each of us has a vision for our lives, our soul’s purpose awaiting release in our hearts. The most important task we have is to learn what that purpose is and then bring it into the world. In our world of endless busyness and “hurry sickness,” many people are experiencing soul loss as they live out dreams of endless motion, empty tasks, anxiety, and negative thoughts. But you can change your world and discover the shamanic heart path that activates your wildness, your power, and your soul’s purpose. 

Blending earth-honoring shamanic practices and modern depth psychology, Jeff Nixa explains how to practice the lost art of heart navigation to help you find your life purpose and spiritual identity, conquer the fear, doubt and criticism that stand in the way of that vision, and become a shamanic shapeshifter of your life. Providing heart-opening exercises to slow your mental racing and detect your heart’s navigational guidance system, he shows how to awaken your wild and free heart, access your spiritual core directly, deactivate trauma-based emotional patterns, retrieve vital energy, work with your dreams, and become an artist of the soul. You will learn how to meet your power animals and consult with spirit guides, embark on shamanic journeys in the spirit world for help and information, slay your inner dragons of self-sabotage, find your personal spirit song, and create the joyful life that your heart is attuned to seek out.

Each of us has a vision for our lives, our soul’s purpose awaiting release in our hearts. The most important task we have is to learn what that purpose is and then bring it into the world. In our world of endless busyness and “hurry sickness,” many people are experiencing soul loss as they live out dreams of endless motion, empty tasks, anxiety, and negative thoughts. But you can change your world and discover the shamanic heart path that activates your wildness, your power, and your soul’s purpose. 

Blending earth-honoring shamanic practices and modern depth psychology, Jeff Nixa explains how to practice the lost art of heart navigation to help you find your life purpose and spiritual identity, conquer the fear, doubt and criticism that stand in the way of that vision, and become a shamanic shapeshifter of your life. Providing heart-opening exercises to slow your mental racing and detect your heart’s navigational guidance system, he shows how to awaken your wild and free heart, access your spiritual core directly, deactivate trauma-based emotional patterns, retrieve vital energy, work with your dreams, and become an artist of the soul. You will learn how to meet your power animals and consult with spirit guides, embark on shamanic journeys in the spirit world for help and information, slay your inner dragons of self-sabotage, find your personal spirit song, and create the joyful life that your heart is attuned to seek out.

      <title>Toxic Rage: When One Doctor Murders Another </title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/toxic-rage/</link>
      <description>Enjoy the AD-FREE versions of our latest episodes and our archives right now from anywhere in the world.

My special guest tonight is author A.J. Flick who's where to discuss her book call Toxic Rage about the shocking plans of one doctor to murder another.



Brian Stidham fell in love with Tucson, Arizona, the minute he came to town. A young and talented eye surgeon, he accepted a job with an established eye surgeon to take over his pediatric patients. 

“It’s a beautiful place,” Stidham told a friend. “I can live right there by the mountains and go hiking. It’s a great deal for me there. The partner I’ll be working with is ultracool. He’s giving me the keys to the kingdom.”

Brad Schwartz, the doctor who hired Brian, was ambitious and possessed surgical skills few others had. But he was a troubled man.

Within a year of Stidham’s arrival in Tucson, the medical relationship would be severed by Schwartz’s personal troubles. Stidham broke away to start his own practice. Rumors abounded within the medical community that Schwartz was incensed and considered the departure a betrayal. His rage grew, even driving a wedge between him and his fiancée, Lourdes Lopez, a former prosecutor.

Three years after Stidham moved to Tucson, his life ended in an empty, darkened parking lot. But who would murder such a nice man in such a violent manner? Lourdes, who had witnessed Schwartz’s toxic rage toward his former partner, feared she knew. But would her suspicions be enough to catch the killer? Find out in Toxic Rage.

      <title>The Omniverse &amp; Reptilian Agenda</title>
      <link>https://www.mysteriousradio.com/the-omniverse-reptilian-agenda/</link>
      <description>Tonight, my special guest is Alfred Labremount Webre who's here to discuss the different layers of The Omniverse and the heinous manipulation within it. We also discuss time travel, alien technology, and the reptilians that exist in our society.

Emergence of the OmniverseUniverse - Multiverse - OmniverseAccessing Spiritual Freedom in the Omniverse on New Earth by Letting Go of the Transhumanist Agenda,AI Artificial Intelligence Singularity, and False Afterlife/Interlife Reincarnation MatrixEmergence of the Omniverse (2020) is one important tool of liberation from our presumed status as a prison planet for Souls in an enforced, unconscious reincarnation birth-death cycle that cosmologist Wes Penre and Futurist Webre document, providing us with powerful strategies to exit the false Afterlife/Interlife Reincarnation Matrix into the larger Omniverse.The Omniverse Equation is: Omniverse = Multiverse + Spiritual Dimensions [Intelligent Civilizations of Souls + Spiritual Beings + Source (God)]Alfred Lambremont Webre's book Exopolitics founded the science of relations among civilizations in the multiverse. Webre's ground-breaking initial book on the Omniverse integrated empirical data from intelligent civilizations in the multiverse and from the intelligent civilization of souls in the Interlife, demonstrating a functioning ecology of intelligence in the dimensions of the Omniverse.Futurist Alfred Lambremont Webre’s principal social contributions have been (1) founding the science of Exopolitics through his 2000 book Exopolitics, (2) the 2014 discovery of the Omniverse as the 3rd major cosmological body [after the Universe and the Multiverse] through which humanity understands the cosmos, and (3) the development of the Positive Future Equation that describes Soul development in our Universe &amp; Omniverse.
