      <description><![CDATA[<p>For more than two decades, Kelly Ripa has been welcomed into millions of people’s homes, kitchens, and even bedrooms, as the co-host of ABC’s daytime talk show “Live!” And it’s easy to see why: she’s funny, warm, and perpetually self-effacing. And those same endearing qualities come through in her writing, too. Her first book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Live-Wire-Long-Winded-Short-Stories/dp/0063073307">Live Wire: Long-Winded Short Stories</a>,” is a collection of hilarious, revealing, and tender memoirish essays that highlight moments of transition in her life — from meeting her husband on a soap opera set, to her awkward tryout for “Live!”, to dropping her youngest child off to college and facing an empty nest. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and Kelly talk about it all, including their shared frustrations working in the male-dominated media industry and what it was like for Kelly to set the record straight on a few false headlines. </p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Elizabeth Banks and Phyllis Nagy on ‘Call Jane’ and the sisterhood of abortion activism</title>
      <itunes:title>Elizabeth Banks and Phyllis Nagy on ‘Call Jane’ and the sisterhood of abortion activism</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The new movie “Call Jane” is a period piece about abortion and reproductive activism in the years before Roe vs Wade was enacted. But given our post-Roe world and the very real consequences of abortion bans across the country, the plot — about a suburban housewife who desperately needs an abortion but can’t get one in her state — sounds like it could be ripped from our 2022 headlines. What can a story about our past struggles teach us about our present circumstances? Why is levity a convincing tool in the fight for bodily autonomy? Can a movie like “Call Jane” affect the fast-approaching midterms? On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks with the movie’s director, Phyllis Nagy, and its star, Elizabeth Banks, about the movie’s poignancy, some of its blood-boiling scenes, and why the movie’s not just preaching to the choir. “Call Jane” is in select theaters starting Oct. 28.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We are just a few weeks out from the 2022 midterms and there is a lot to unpack — makeup of the House, will the Senate flip, the very future of our democracy! To help us understand what is truly at stake this Nov. 8, Katie brings on three political strategists to break it all down. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie is joined by her former podcast co-host (and current Democratic political and media strategist) Brian Goldsmith, as well as Lis Smith, who is a 20-year veteran of Democratic political campaigns -- from Barack Obama 2012 to Pete Buttigieg 2020 -- and Republican political consultant Mike Murphy who, with David Axelrod, hosts the political podcast “<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hacks-on-tap/id1467297559">Hacks on Tap</a>”. The group walks through the biggest issues driving voters to the polls, the impact of <em>Roe</em>, the races that could change up Congress and how all of this affects what’s to come in 2024. Check out Lis Smith’s new memoir, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Any-Given-Tuesday-Political-Story/dp/0063084392">Any Given Tuesday: A Political Love Story.</a>”</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>Behind the scenes of Katie’s cancer diagnosis and treatment</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Katie has always been vigilant about her health. Ever since her husband Jay died of stage four colon cancer in 1998, Katie has been a cancer screening advocate, sharing information about and helping to normalize seemingly intimidating procedures that can detect cancer early and save lives (you might recall Katie’s on-air colonoscopy?). When Katie realized she had missed a mammogram, she decided to take listeners into the procedure room with her to understand why it’s important for women like Katie, who has dense breasts, to get not only a mammogram but also an ultrasound. But then, Katie gets the news that no one wants to get. On this very personal episode, Katie — with the help of her doctors and daughters — takes listeners behind the scenes of her cancer diagnosis, treatment and long term plan. Katie also introduces listeners to cancer survivor and activist, Michele Young, who beat the odds and is changing the breast cancer screening system.<strong> </strong>Also, check out Ellie and Carrie Monahan’s podcast, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/all-each-other-has/id1629994072">All Each Other Has</a>, wherever you get your podcasts. </p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

Michelle also shares her decades-long journey to entrepreneurship and what it was like to create a “clean,” unisex fragrance line, <a href="https://henryrose.com/">Henry Rose</a>.</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <itunes:title>Abortion: The Body Politic - The Storytellers [Bonus]</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Katie’s special series, Abortion: The Body Politic, has wrapped, but we wanted to give the very last word to a special group of people — people who have had abortions. These first-person stories reveal the lengths people have always had to go through to get an abortion — enduring unnecessary waiting periods, lengthy travel, parental consent needs, manipulative partners, unsupportive family members, shame, guilt, and more. These abortion stories span decades, cultures, race, faiths and gender. They reveal how common abortion is and yet how consistently stigmatized. This episode is dedicated to abortion storytellers everywhere whose voices and personal experience help normalize abortion for all.  This episode includes stories from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/busyphilipps/?hl=en">Busy Philipps</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GloriaSteinem?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Gloria Steinem</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PramilaJayapal">Rep.

      <itunes:title>Abortion: The Body Politic, Part 6</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Abortion: The Body Politic started on the ground, visiting two abortion clinics 15 minutes away from each other in two very different states: Missouri and Illinois. On this last episode, we check back in with someone who works in those two clinics to understand the immediate impact the Supreme Court decision had on their patients. Then we consider, what now? Katie interviews Rep. Jayapal (D-WA) who has been a legislative leader in the fight for reproductive rights to understand what lawmakers can do to protect abortion now and in the future. Finally, we hear from a new generation of activists, actors (like Busy Phlipps), musicians (like MILCK and Amanda Shires), and TikTokers about how they are using their platforms, social media and art to not only normalize abortion but also share information (when that information could be criminalized), and, perhaps, change hearts and mind one person at a time. </p>

      <itunes:title>Abortion: The Body Politic, Part 5</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In Part 5 of Abortion: The Body Politic, Katie looks abroad for models of progress — and regress — when it comes to reproductive rights and abortion access. What are the trends and how does the U.S. now compare? We check in with the Center for Reproductive Rights to find out. Perhaps no region has seen more progress than Latin America. Human Rights lawyer and one of the founders of the Green Wave movement, Paula Ávila-Guillén, shares her experiences on the front lines of the decades-long fight for reproductive justice and what Americans can learn from our sisters to the South. We also hear from an activist in Mexico who is helping people across the border access abortion care they can no longer get in the United States. And academic, Lina-Maria Murillo gives us context for the unique relationship the United States and Mexico share when it comes to abortion access. There’s no denying the fact that many of the countries we are highlighting are largely conservative and Catholic. What does the progress these Catholic countries have made say about our own complicated assumptions about religion and abortion. We hear from several leaders of faith from a Jewish Rabbi to a Baptist Reverend and leaders from organizations like, Catholics for Choice and SACRED, about how they have worked reproductive rights and abortion access into their faith practice.</p>

      <title>Abortion: The Body Politic, Part 4</title>
      <itunes:title>Abortion: The Body Politic, Part 4</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In Part 4 of Abortion: The Body Politic, Katie examines how abortion is explored and reflected in popular culture and Hollywood. Because whether we realize it or not, the movies we have loved and the TV shows we watch represent the collective imagination of our culture at particular moments in time. And for much of the past 50 years, that collective imagination was riddled with problematic abortion tropes that perpetuates stereotypes about the procedure and the people who seek it out. But the good news is that in the past decade, more showrunners and filmmakers — and even studios — telling more abortion stories and even taking some risks. Katie takes listeners to the front row of a new comedy show about abortion, aptly named, “Oh God A Show About Abortion,” from comedian Alison Leiby. Filmmakers Gillian Robespierre (“Obvious Child,” 2014), Rachel Lee Goldenberg (“Unpregnant,” 2020), and Dawn Porter (“Trapped,” 2016) share the origin stories of their narrative-busting movies and what more Hollywood and creatives need to do in the long fight toward reproductive rights. </p>

      <itunes:title>Abortion: The Body Politic, Part 3</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On Part 3 of Abortion: The Body Politic focuses on <em>Roe</em> and its unraveling. The last living <em>Roe</em> prosecutor, Linda Coffee, shares her recollections of that historic Supreme Court case and how she found out she had won. We learn of  the immediate failings of Roe, especially for Black women, and the birth of the Reproductive Justice movement. Experts trace the politicization of abortion, the belated moral-issue grab by evangelicals,  the violence that hit abortion doctors and clinics in the 1990s, and the anti-abortion strategy that forever altered American politics. We hear first-person experiences of long-time abortion doctors as well as fresh medical students who share why they felt inspired to join the cause. We also hear from two abortion storytellers about their experiences navigating a convoluted system that can be particularly apathetic to the needs of those seeking later abortions.</p>

      <itunes:title>Abortion: The Body Politic, Part 2</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In Part 2 of Abortion: The Body Politic, we step into the past, long before <em>Roe</em>, and trace the roots of today&rsquo;s abortion&rsquo;s debate to understand&nbsp; &mdash; if abortions have always happened and the majority of Americans have always believed they should be legally accessible &mdash; why is abortion such a contentious, even volatile, issue in this country. In this journey, a new narrative of reproductive resistance comes to the surface. Women, particularly Black, brown and indigenous, have always made choices that are best for their bodies, families, and lives &mdash; no matter the obstacles men have placed before them. In these stories of resistance we also hear first-hand accounts of surprising allies in underground abortion access, courage in the face of limited reproductive choices, and a relentless push for bodily autonomy. The illegal period before <em>Roe</em> is a mirror to our impending, post-<em>Roe</em> future. It&rsquo;s vital that we pay attention.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Part 2 of Abortion: The Body Politic, we step into the past, long before <em>Roe</em>, and trace the roots of today&rsquo;s abortion&rsquo;s debate to understand&nbsp; &mdash; if abortions have always happened and the majority of Americans have always believed they should be legally accessible &mdash; why is abortion such a contentious, even volatile, issue in this country. In this journey, a new narrative of reproductive resistance comes to the surface. Women, particularly Black, brown and indigenous, have always made choices that are best for their bodies, families, and lives &mdash; no matter the obstacles men have placed before them. In these stories of resistance we also hear first-hand accounts of surprising allies in underground abortion access, courage in the face of limited reproductive choices, and a relentless push for bodily autonomy. The illegal period before <em>Roe</em> is a mirror to our impending, post-<em>Roe</em> future. It&rsquo;s vital that we pay attention.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In Part 1 of Abortion: The Body Politic, we explore the current state of abortion access. Katie Couric visits who abortion clinics that straddle the Missouri-Illinois border. They are only 15 minutes but &mdash; because of Missouri&rsquo;s state-imposed restrictions &mdash;&nbsp;worlds apart. We also find out what types of abortion are available today, how people access them, and what it is like to&nbsp; get an abortion in today&rsquo;s charged climate. We hear from abortion fund organizers, doctors in restrictive and progressive states, and people from all over the country, many of whom are already living in a post-<em>Roe</em> world. We also find out what is at stake for the upcoming Supreme Court decision that is expected to reverse the landmark 1973 decision that guaranteed the right to a safe and legal abortion.&nbsp;</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Forty-nine years ago, the landmark <em>Roe v Wade</em> decision guaranteed women the right to a safe, legal abortion. This June, the Supreme Court is expected to gut that historic ruling, triggering restrictive abortion laws in at least 23 states. While the United States is on the precipice of stepping back this women&rsquo;s health right, the rest of the world has seen a trend of liberalizing abortion laws over the past 25 years. In this limited, narrative series from Next Question with Katie Couric, we explore the history &mdash; and future &mdash; of abortion in this country. In this 6-episode series, Katie takes listeners inside abortion clinics, front row at an abortion comedy show, and shares intimate, first-person experiences of people &mdash; from the illegal period to now &mdash; who have had abortions and the stories of those who have cared for them.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You probably know Melissa Gilbert best from her time playing Laura Ingalls for nine seasons on the classic NBC television show, &ldquo;Little House On the Prairie.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s done a lot since then &ndash; she&rsquo;s continued to act, tried her hand at directing, served as the president of the Screen Actors Guild, and even briefly ran for Congress. But a dozen or so years ago, she left her native Los Angeles to live with her husband, the actor and director Timothy Busfield, in rural Michigan and eventually ended up settling in a rustic, fixer-upper cottage in the Catskills Mountains. It was a pretty radical lifestyle change for Melissa and it sparked a number of realizations about her old life &ndash; and the way she wants to live now. For this episode of Next Question, she sits down with Katie to talk about this new phase of her life, the challenges &ndash; and rewards &ndash; of growing older, and her new book, &ldquo;Back to the Prairie.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>Unpacking the Roe draft bombshell with Mary Ziegler</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Something major happened this week: A leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court indicated the court will strike down <em>Roe</em> <em>versus Wade</em>. The landmark 1973 decision ruled that the Constitution protects a pregnant person&rsquo;s liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. While that protection has been chipped away almost relentlessly for decades, resulting in abortion access that is very much dependent on your zip code, the overturning of Roe could be the most consequential opinion in decades. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks with abortion law expert Mary Ziegler about the leak, the draft&rsquo;s damning language, and the impact of the conservative court on rights beyond abortion. Katie also takes the opportunity to tease an upcoming, in-depth and intimate series on abortion &mdash; something she has been working on for months in anticipation of the official ruling expected in late June.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

There&rsquo;s so much more to her story though. From losing her mom and sister in a tragic car accident at the age of 4 and growing up with her adventurous, fun-loving dad to coming into her own as a comedian and actor and becoming a mother herself, her life is proof positive that humor and joy can comingle with pain and sorrow. She shares it all in her new memoir, &ldquo;Hello, Molly!&rdquo; and in this week&rsquo;s episode of Next Question.

      <itunes:title>‘Addiction is a spectrum’: Meet the women centering themselves and rewriting the recovery narrative</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There have been some scary headlines going around about the climbing rates of alcohol use, particularly among women, during the pandemic. <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP68312.html">One study found</a> that heavy drinking among women increased 41 percent! What&rsquo;s behind these numbers and how do women find the help they need? On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie invites her friend and award winning broadcast journalist Elizabeth Vargas to co-host and help find some understanding about why women are drinking more than ever, why women drink, and what recovery looks like.. Elizabeth knows about this first hand and wrote about her issues around alcohol, addiction and anxiety in her memoir, Between Breaths: A Memoir of Panic and Addiction. Elizabeth and Katie talk to two women &mdash; <a href="https://soberblackgirlsclub.com/author/khadijato-ko/">Khadi Oluwatoyin</a> and <a href="https://www.emilylynnpaulson.com/">Emily Paulson</a> who hit their own rock bottoms and not only found their way out, but also made recovery spaces for people like them &mdash;&nbsp;Black Girls Sober Club and the Sober Mome Squad, respectively. Katie and Elizabeth also talk to long-time clinical social worker and interventionist, <a href="https://www.allaboutinterventions.com/">Dr. Louise Stanger</a>, on how to help someone you love who may be suffering through addiction. If you or anyone you love is struggling with alcohol use, you can call the national drug and alcohol treatment hotline at 1-800-622-HELP (4357).</p>

      <itunes:title>Julia Haart’s unbelievable journey from communist Russia, to strict Orthodox community, to jet-setting fashion designer</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve binged much TV this pandemic, you might have happened upon a new reality TV show on Netflix called &ldquo;My Unorthodox Life.&rdquo; The show is centered around Julia Haart, a high-powered CEO and fashion designer with a penchant for short skirts and sky-high heels. In between design meetings and runway shows, Julia is also seen managing her growing &mdash; and grown up &mdash; kids, in a straight-talking, cool-mom kind of way. Their lives appear glitzy, fashionable, busy, and champaign-filled. But it&rsquo;s a far cry from the world Julia left in 2013. Until she was 40 years old, Julia lived in an extreme ultra Orthodox Jewish community in upstate New York. If you&rsquo;ve ever watched the show and wondered how this all happened, Julia is finally sharing her full story in her memoir, Brazen, which is out now. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie finds out how Julia went from a communist Russian childhood, to married off at 19 and living under the strict rules of her Orthodox community, to jet-setting, designing shoes and dresses for celebrities and, up until a few months ago, being the head of Elite World Group, one of the largest global modeling agencies. It&rsquo;s a journey you really have to hear for yourself.</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>Mackenzie Fierceton: ‘Abuse can happen across all income levels and races and professions’</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Katie shares an intimate conversation with Mackenzie Fierceton, the 24-year-old subject of a lengthy, riveting and much-shared profile in the New Yorker written by Rachel Aviv. Mackenzie grew up as a star student in a St. Louis suburb where she lived with her mother, a prominent local radiologist. Behind the facade of her seemingly privileged life though, Mackenzie was allegedly being abused by her mother and her mother&rsquo;s boyfriend. After one particularly violent episode, she ended up in the hospital for 22 days and was placed in foster care. Mackenzie eventually won a full scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania and a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford&hellip;and that&rsquo;s when her story took yet another turn. After facing accusations that her depiction of her past was inaccurate, Mackenzie lost her Rhodes scholarship and is now in the midst of a legal battle with Penn. Beyond the specifics of Mackenzie&rsquo;s harrowing story though, her experience raises a lot of questions about the thorny politics of higher education, our assumptions about race and class regarding abuse, and so much more. A word of caution to our listeners &ndash;&nbsp; Katie&rsquo;s conversation with Mackenzie touches on themes of physical and sexual abuse, which may be difficult for some listeners.</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>Bonus: Digging deep on the war in Ukraine with The Daily co-host Sabrina Tavernise</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>For this bonus episode, I&rsquo;m excited to share my conversation with New York Times journalist and The Daily co-host, Sabrina Tavernise. Sabrina recently spent three weeks in Ukraine and has delivered a series of dispatches offering a searing glimpse of what life is like there right now on the frontlines. Her time in the region actually extends all the way back to the 1990s when she first made her way to Russia as a freelance journalist and then as a foreign correspondent for the New York Times based in Moscow. So much of the coverage of the war in Ukraine concentrates on the day to day, but I really wanted to take advantage of Sabrina&rsquo;s rich perspective and sophisticated understanding of the region. So, for this conversation, we<em> dug deep</em> and covered everything from what life was like in Russia just after the wall came down and Putin&rsquo;s rise to power to how Russians today perceive this war and how things might play out in the months ahead. I hope you enjoy our talk as much as I did&hellip;.(oh, and if you hear barking, Sabrina&rsquo;s dog Clementine also made an appearance!)</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Next Question, Katie is sharing some interviews from her whirlwind, nine-city book tour, where she brought her memoir, “Going There,” to life and also shared the stage with some very special guests. On Oct. 30, Katie traveled down to Washington, D.C. and was joined at The Anthem theater by Kara Swisher — tech journalist, podcast host, nuisance to all of Silicon Valley. Katie and Kara talk about the future of media, the public’s disintegrating trust in journalism, and all of those Facebook documents. Katie and Kara reference an interview Katie did with Sheryl Sandberg in 2019, where Katie held the Facebook COO’s feet to the flame.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Next Question, the last of the season, Katie is sharing some moments from her whirlwind book tour. After “Going There” came out in late October, Katie criss-crossed the country to bring the book — and her personal and professional life — to in-person audiences (such a novelty!) in nine different cities. Katie shared parts of her childhood, her rise to “Today Show” host, the journey to media entrepreneur, as well as the loss of her husband Jay and her second chance at love. She also brought some famous friends along, from Ina Garten and Kim and Brad Paisley, to Kara Swisher and Leslie Jordan (more on those interviews in special bonus episodes to come). But on today’s episode, Katie is bringing conversations with some people you may not know, but should. These are people who Katie met along the way who were at the center of some of the biggest news stories of her career, from 9-11 and the Boston Marathon bombing, to the country’s gun violence epidemic. These are ordinary people who responded to extraordinary events in inspiring and life-changing ways. </p><p><br></p><p>Find out more about the organizations mentioned in this podcast:</p><p><a href="https://50legs.org/">50 Legs</a></p><p><a href="https://purposeoverpain.net/">Purpose over Pain</a></p><p><a href="https://aimeecopelandfoundation.org/">Aimee Copeland Foundation</a></p><p><a href="https://oralleebrownfoundation.org/">Oral Lee Brown Foundation</a></p><p><br></p><p>Get your copy of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Going-There-Katie-Couric/dp/0316535869">Going There,” by Katie Couric</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re not familiar with Huma Abedin, that was her intention. For two decades, Huma has been mostly in the background, as the long-time trusted aide of Hilary Clinton. She was reluctantly wrenched from the shadows thanks to the public downfall of her (now ex) husband Congressman Anthony Weiner who was embroiled in multiple sexting scandals, one of which sent him to jail. Now, Huma is choosing to step into the spotlight and tell her own story with the release of her memoir, “Both/And.” “When I started writing this book, my researcher said the two most common articles out there in the world about you, Huma, are, number one, what is wrong with her and, number two, what is she thinking?,” Huma tells Katie. “And so I chose to put exactly what I was thinking into this book.” On this bonus episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks with Huma about her career, her history, her intimate relationship with Hillary Clinton, and the heartache and humiliation of her first love.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

Now, Huma is choosing to step into the spotlight and tell her own story with the release of her memoir, “Both/And.” “When I started writing this book, my researcher said the two most common articles out there in the world about you, Huma, are, number one, what is wrong with her and, number two, what is she thinking?,” Huma tells Katie. “And so I chose to put exactly what I was thinking into this book.” On this bonus episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks with Huma about her career, her history, her intimate relationship with Hillary Clinton, and the heartache and humiliation of her first love.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This Thanksgiving week, just a few days shy of what would have been Matthew Shepard’s 45th birthday, Katie considers his lasting legacy. In 1998, Matthew, a college freshman at the University of Wyoming, was the victim of a brutal hate crime. His death quickly became a national story and a clarion call for gay rights that inspired a whole new generation of LGBTQ activists. “Matthew Shepard was a huge turning point,” says Alan Cumming. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie revisits the interviews she has done with Matthew’s parents, Judy and Dennis, over the years and examines the impact they have had on gay rights legislation as well as the huge cultural shift society, in general, has experienced over the decades. Jeff Mack, a friend of Matt’s from university, who is now the executive vice president of the Matthew Shepard Foundation guides us through Matt’s impact, explains why his death is considered the “second Stonewall,” and why his friend changes the course of his life forever. “It just means so much to be doing what I’m doing,” Mack says, “life has come full circle for me.” </p><p>Find out more about the <a href="https://www.matthewshepard.org/">Matthew Shepard Foundation</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

In this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie looks back at the big weather events she has reported on and talks to her friend and weather forecaster Dave Price about how coverage of and interest in climate change has shifted over the years.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Twenty-one years ago, Katie Couric aired her first colonoscopy on the ‘Today Show.' It was an up-close and personal experience that helped demystify a still-taboo health procedure. A study would later find that colonoscopies increased by 20 percent as a result of Katie airing her personal business on national television. It was called “The Couric Effect.” And it turns out, the Couric Effect is still rolling. “Using you as a model,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar tells Katie, “I’ve tried to really talk about this.” On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and the Minnesota Democrat talk about the Senator’s recent disclosure of her breast cancer diagnosis and treatment and how it could have gone another way. “I should have gone in a year earlier.” They also talk about Capitol Hill, the Jan. 6 insurrection, what to do about Big Tech, and the outlook for 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Going-There-Katie-Couric/dp/0316535869?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=katiecouric07-20&amp;linkId=56eae1af0296e6a316322528f3a84170&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Pre-order Katie Couric’s memoir, “Going There</a>,” to learn more about her cancer advocacy, televised colonoscopy and so much more.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie has another delightful excuse to talk to Stanley Tucci, this time about his memoir, “Taste: My Life Through Food.” They dive into the deep impact food has had on Stanley’s life and the bitter irony of his recent cancer diagnosis that very nearly killed his ability to eat. The conversation also gets very personal as the pair talk about their shared experience of losing their partners and co-parents to cancer and the loneliness of caring for a loved one who is dying. “If you give up what happens,” Stanley says. “What happens to the kids? What happens to the person who’s sick? You can’t. You have to keep trying.” But don’t worry, they end on a high note. Stanley reads a passage from his book and shares some of his culinary how-tos that will help you in the kitchen and at the dinner table. </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Going-There-Katie-Couric/dp/0316535869?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=katiecouric07-20&amp;linkId=56eae1af0296e6a316322528f3a84170&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Pre-order Katie Couric’s memoir, “Going There</a>” now to learn more about the most impactful news stories she covered as well as the making of her life and career.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This fall marks the 30th anniversary of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings and the testimony of Anita Hill. It was an historic moment and one that brought sexual harassment into the public consciousness and conversation. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie revisits that moment 30 years ago and what it was like to cover it as the newly minted co-anchor of the Today Show. She also sits down with Anita Hill to talk about her new book, “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671557/believing-by-anita-hill/">Believing: Our Thirty-Year Journey to End Gender Violence</a>,” and how far we have — and haven’t — come since Anita shared her story with the world and changed her life — and ours.

      <itunes:title>Summer book series: Sharon Stone</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sharon Stone is known for portraying a certain type of brash, cunning villain, like Catharine Tramell in “Basic Instinct,” Lori Quad in “Total Recall,” or, more recently, Lenore Osgood in the Netflix series “Ratched.” In reality though, Sharon Stone is shy and introverted and, despite her fame, has led a very private life. But now, the actor is in the midst of a very public and personal re-examination of that life in her memoir, “The Beauty of Living Twice.” On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and Sharon talk about the trauma she has endured, from being molested as a child, to the sexual harassment in Hollywood, to the stroke that nearly killed her in 2001 (and the interview Katie did with Sharon nearly 20 years ago). They also talk about the memoir writing process, life under the glare of the spotlight, and finding a new sisterhood — and inspiration — in the movie industry, post #MeToo.

      <itunes:title>Summer book series: Justin Baldoni</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Justin Baldoni is a producer, director and actor who is probably best known for his long-running character on “Jane the Virgin.” Across the show’s five seasons, Justin played Rafael Solano, the sensitive, reformed playboy who fell in love with the titular Jane, a virgin. But the actor, whose acting work tends to embody a certain type of shirtless machismo masculinity, is on a new mission to help change the way men — and society — think about masculinity. It’s an idea he first explored on social media, and then in a Ted Talk in 2017, and then in a web series and now in a memoir-ish book called “Man Enough: Undefining My Masculinity.” On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and Justin discuss the often toxic grip masculinity has on our society and what Justin thinks we can all do to change that. They also talk about Justin’s personal exploration — as a son, husband and father — of what it means to be a man.

      <itunes:title>Summer book series: Ursula Burns</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ursula Burns has had an impressive career that is often summarized by an historic achievement: that when she became the CEO of Xerox in 2009 she was the first every Black woman to head a Fortune 500 company. But there is so much more to Ursula’s career and life story, which is movingly detailed in her memoir, “Where You Are is Not Who You Are.” In it, Ursula gets very personal, sharing her childhood growing up in public housing in New York City, her Catholic-school days, her marriage, and, yes, her 30-year ascent to the tippy top of Xerox’s ladder. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and Ursula talk about why writing that life journey was one of the most difficult things she has ever had to do, how she lead Xerox at a time when no one needed Xeroxing, and why we all need to continue to push the business world to diversify their ranks (and what corporations are missing out on if they don’t).

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re going to have a summer series on memoirs, there is truly no better person to begin with than the boss of memoir herself, Mary Karr. In 1995, Mary Karr published her debut memoir, “The Liar’s Club,” an engrossing, tragicomic telling of her childhood in a poor, industrial East Texas town. “The Liar’s Club” took the publishing world by storm and inspired a wave of confessional memoirs. Mary then followed it up with “Cherry” in 2000 and “Lit” in 2009. She also wrote a how-to book about the genre called “The Art of Memoir” and is now working on her fourth memoir. In addition to her memoir career, Mary is also the author of five celebrated volumes of poetry and is a longtime professor of English at Syracuse University. And on this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and Mary dive into it all: the writing process, books that impacted her life and career, her faith, aging gracefully (or not), even cherished Winnie-the-Pooh poems. It’s such a fun, hilarious and absorbing conversation and a real treat to kick off the summer. Enjoy and make sure to check out Mary Karr’s oeuvre.

New episodes start July 1.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Ibram X. Kendi is one of the country’s leading anti-racist scholars. And, in fact, everything that Dr. Kendi does — as a professor, an author, a researcher, a podcast host, a human — attempts to reframe how we think about racism and how we fight it. In this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks with Dr. Kendi about his prolific anti-racism work, which encompasses his academic leadership and Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University, his multiple books, including “Four Hundred Souls: A Community History of African America, 1619-2019,” which he co-edited with Keisha N. Blain, the forthcoming online publication he’s launching with the Boston Globe called “The Emancipator,” and his new podcast, “Be Antiracist,” coming out June 9. They also touch upon the solemn anniversary of George Floyd’s murder and how far we have and haven’t come in this year of racial reckoning, as well as why it’s so important to start anti-racist discussions early, and how his devastating 2018 cancer diagnosis propels him.</p><p>Find out more about Dr. Kendi’s work:</p><ul>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>“This is never going to be on TV,” says Bowen Yang, reflecting on the now-viral Saturday Night Live sketch where he plays the iceberg that sank the Titanic. “It’s such a big swing.” It turns out, if anyone can knock an unexpected pitch out of the park, it’s the 30-year-old comedian who has quickly risen to fan-favorite in his short time on the show. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie gets the full Bowen picture, digging into his cross-national childhood, understanding what it was like to come out to his parents, going behind the scenes of his SNL audition process and getting the anatomy of some of his favorite sketches. Katie and Bowen also talk about the cult-favorite podcast he co-hosts, “Las Culturistas,” and where the talented and endearing young star goes from here. If you weren’t smitten with Bowen Yang before, you will be after this podcast. </p><p>Check out some of the Saturday Night Live sketches mentioned in the episode:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeoxg8hx-lc&amp;t=1s">Sara Lee</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP5bu9hLH9E">The Iceberg on the Sinking of the Titanic</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Best-selling author Michael Lewis has a knack for extracting page-turning drama out of otherwise mundane and complicated subjects (hello, bond trading and baseball stats). Several of those books have been so good they’ve been turned into award-winning dramas starring half of Hollywood (hello, “The Big Short” and “Moneyball). And now, Lewis takes a crack at the pandemic realty still unfolding. His new book is called “The Premonition: A Pandemic Story.” In it, Lewis uses the first-hand accounts of three main characters to unravel the government’s gross mismanagement of the COVID response, which lead to nearly 600,000 deaths (among the world’s worst outcomes). On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and Michael Lewis talk about the CDC’s shocking downfall, the gaping holes in the public health system and the secret group of doctors (the so-called “Wolverines) helping to single handedly patch that system together. We also get to hear from one of those doctors, Dr. Joe DeRisi, a biochemistry professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and co-president of the Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This past (very long) year, Dr. Sanjay Gupta has been immersed in all things COVID-19, as CNN’s Chief Medical Correspondent reporting on the front lines of this novel virus. “All I think about is COVID,” he told Katie, “Viral transmission, how people evaluate risk, social behavior. There’s no part of our society that hasn’t been touched in some way.” But Sanjay is also a neuroscientist and in addition to his on-air work and a daily podcast (Coronavirus: Fact vs Fiction), Sanjay has somehow found the time to write a new book called “Keep Sharp: Building a Better Brain at Any Age,” which is out now. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and Sanjay talk about how to keep the brain healthy with tips you can use right now to protect and improve your brain. But Katie starts the conversation by asking the COVID about the status of the pandemic and if we’re truly out of the woods. </p><p><strong>Find out more from this episode</strong></p><p><strong>Read:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Keep-Sharp/Sanjay-Gupta/9781501166730">Keep Sharp: Building a Better Brain at Any Age</a>, by Dr. Sanjay Gupta</p><p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805073690">Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers, The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping</a>, by Robert M.

      <itunes:title>Bonus: The making of 'Nomadland' with director Chloé Zhao</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Oscars are on the horizon and though it’s been a strange year for the movie industry, the race for the golden statue is nothing short of historic. Notably, there is not one but two women nominated for best director: Emerald Fennell, for “Promising Young Woman,” starring Carrie Mulligan, and Chloé Zhao for “Nomadland,” starring Frances McDormand. “Nomadland” was also written by Zhao who based her screenplay on the non-fictional book, “Nomadland: Surviving America in the 21st Century,” by journalist Jessica Bruder. Frances McDormand’s Fern — a fictionalized amalgam of people in Bruder’s book — is a woman living out of her van, traveling the country working seasonal jobs and meeting a community of like-minded itinerant Americans along the way. On this special bonus episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie gets to go behind the scenes of this extraordinary, beautiful and strangely prescient film in a roundtable discussion with the director Chloé Zhao as well as three producers, Peter Spears, Mollye Asher and Dan Janvey. <a href="https://www.hulu.com/nomadland-movie">Stream “Nomadland” on Hulu</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Bonus: Colon cancer awareness: ‘I should have gotten my colonoscopy, that’s the lesson’</title>
      <itunes:title>Bonus: Colon cancer awareness: ‘I should have gotten my colonoscopy, that’s the lesson’</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this special episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie dives into a subject very close to her heart: colon cancer awareness. After Katie’s first husband Jay died 23 years ago, she’s been a fierce advocate for early screening and regular colonoscopies — she even, you might recall, got one on live TV. There’s a reason Katie goes to such lengths: early screening saves lives. In this episode, we first hear from a stage 4 cancer fighter who is living that lesson. Then, Dr. Edith Mitchell of the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, helps to answer the question, why are Black people, Black men in particular, so much more likely to get colon cancer and also die from it (hint: it’s systemic). Finally, Katie talks with oncologist Dr. Charlie Fuchs about the state of colon cancer detection and treatment today. </p><p><strong>LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS EPISODE:</strong> </p><p>Visit <a href="https://standuptocancer.org/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SU2C_Brand&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwmIuDBhDXARIsAFITC_6jo6yiHymNY9nVB-i0MvoawmlihSmcaDaZrp7n5svV8ZVZrFEdZusaAuBqEALw_wcB">Stand Up To Cancer</a>, Katie’s cancer-fighting non-profit, for reliable resources and institutions.</p><p><a href="https://pledge.getscreened.org/?c_src=MAR2021search_google&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Pledge2021_REV&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwmIuDBhDXARIsAFITC_4z9fuWRPrz38FpMV6hLoNm3hn3GpblWi-suuERe87y86NvHOU2T7saAmciEALw_wcB">Take the pledge to get screened for colon cancer</a></p><p>Read more about some of the health disparities Dr. Mitchell mentioned, <a href="http://healthlibrary.brighamandwomens.org/Wellness/Smoking/NewsRecent/6,1650177634">here</a> and <a href="https://www.jtocrr.org/article/S2666-3643(20)30155-7/fulltext">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/understanding_healthcare_disparities_in_colorectal_cancer">Watch a video</a> on understanding healthcare disparities in colorectal cancer.</p><p><strong>GUESTS FEATURED IN THIS EPISODE:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.thebridgesrsf.com/contact">Donna Otis</a>, CCM, CCE Chief Executive/General Manager of the Bridges at Rancho Santa Fe, California.</p><p><a href="https://sidneykimmelcancercenter.jeffersonhealth.org/?article=2016-dedicating-a-career-to-diversity-and-disparities-dr-edith-mitchell-featured-in-medpage-today">Dr. Edith Mitchell</a>, MD, MACP, FCPP, FRCP, is Board Certified in Internal Medicine and Medical Oncology and is Clinical Professor, Department of Medicine and Medical Oncology at Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University and Associate Director for Diversity Programs and Director of the Center to Eliminate Cancer Disparities for the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University.</p><p>Charles Fuchs, MD, MPH, Global Head of Hematology &amp; Oncology, Product Development, Genentech.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

Three Americans intimately involved with COVID-19 — an ER doctor, an epidemiologist, and a patient — share their experiences in those early, panic-stricken days and months of the spring 2020 to find out just how far we’ve come from and just how much we’ve learned about COVID-19, our healthcare system, science, and maybe even ourselves. </p><p><strong>Learn more about this week’s guests:</strong></p><p>Fiona Lowenstein, independent journalist and co-founder of the <a href="https://www.wearebodypolitic.com/covid19">Body Politic Covid-19 support group</a>. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyFaust">Dr. Jeremy Faust</a>, emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard medical school faculty and editor in chief of<a href="https://brief19.com/by/jeremy-samuel-faust"> Brief19</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2177/keri-n-althoff">Dr. Keri Althoff</a>, associate professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p><p><strong>Related links:</strong></p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/vg47ns4q">Sign up for the Body Politic Covid-19 Support Group here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/BodyPolitic/shop?asc=u">Body Politic Support Group shop</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/re-opening-how-families-can-reassess.html">A guide to assessing the risks of re-opening activities amid the pandemic</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>“You’ll Never Believe What Happened to Lacey,” is the title of the very funny, if completely horrifying, new book by comedian and late-night host Amber Ruffin. The book, which Amber co-wrote with her sister Lacey Lamar, is a collection of essays about all the racist sh*t Lacey has to put up with as a Black woman living and working in Omaha, Nebraska. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks with the sisters about growing up in Omaha, their different trajectories and experiences with racism and how humor can be used to expose and talk about the hard stuff. Katie also explores Amber’s career, her new show (The Amber Ruffin Show, on Peacock) and her incredible ability to skewer the kind of everyday racism she and her siblings have always put up with.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This series began in the past, to better understand the origin and history of our ongoing fight for voting rights. And as Turnout comes to a close, we consider its future. Where do we go from here? What lessons can we take with us, and what impact might this election have on our ongoing push for a more inclusive democracy and a more perfect union. In this last episode of Turnout with Katie Couric, we hear from some of our previous guests — including Wendy Weiser, Gilda Daniels, and Tyler Okeke — about the biggest takeaways from the 2020 election and their impact on our democracy. But first, an interview with someone whose job it is to lay a civics foundation for the next generation of voters. Greg Cruey is a middle school social studies teacher in War, West Virginia — a one-time coal mining center that is now one of the poorest areas in the country. Because Mr. Cruey explains our voting system, our elections, and our democracy to his 6th, 7th, and 8th graders each year, we wanted to hear how he might put our 2020 experience into context.</p><p><strong>Read more about the people and organizations mentioned in this episode:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/teaching-election-west-virginia/2020/11/29/b8e40a38-2b3a-11eb-92b7-6ef17b3fe3b4_story.html">What it’s like to teach children about the election, and its results, in deep-red Trump country</a>, by Hanna Natanson (Washington Post)</p><p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/experts/wendy-r-weiser">Wendy Weiser </a>is the Vice President for Democracy at the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School</a></p><p><a href="http://www.gildadaniels.com/">Gilda Daniels</a> is an associate professor at the <a href="http://law.ubalt.edu/faculty/profiles/daniels.cfm">University of Baltimore School of Law</a>, as well as litigation director at <a href="https://advancementproject.org/staff/gilda-daniels/">Advancement Project</a> national office and author of ‘<a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479862351/uncounted/">Uncounted: The Crisis of Voter Suppression in America</a>.’</p><p>Tyler Okeke is a Vote at 16 Youth Organizer with <a href="https://powercalifornia.org/">Power California</a> and a second-year student at the University of Chicago.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For the last nine months, as the coronavirus swept across the world, devastating so many lives in its wake, scientists have been working around the clock to develop a safe and effective vaccine in record time. And now the results from all of that hard work are starting to come in and it’s good news. Like, really good news. On this bonus episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks with Dr. Stephen Hoge, a doctor, scientist and president of Moderna, one of the biotech firms leading the COVID-19 vaccine race. Moderna is remarkable in that it is, compared to the Pfizer behemoths of the world, a tiny biotech firm. But that hasn’t stopped it from cracking the vaccine code using a novel approach. In this wide-ranging interview, Katie and Dr. Hoge talk about the company, the pandemic, and the logistics of these vaccines — who gets them and when. Let’s call it, vaccines for dummies.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You’ve no doubt heard that the 2020 election welcomed historic turnout. But what do those high numbers of voters mean for our democracy, for future elections, and for the warring political parties as they conduct their post-mortems? On this episode of Turnout with Katie Couric, we hear from a data journalist who is starting to comb through the numbers. Neal Rothschild, director of audience and political data reporter for Axios, shares the four big takeaways that help explain the 2020 election. Then, Katie talks with her friend, the best-selling author Mitch Albom about the state of our divisiveness, the media’s problem, how we can find ways to reconnect and start to move forward as a country together.  </p><p><strong>More about the episodes and guests featured in this episode:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/election-biden-trump-demographics-639b6c8e-6e5c-43c8-962f-dca6a127c4ef.html">Four demographic trends that explain Biden’s victory</a> (Axios)</p><p>Read more from <a href="https://www.axios.com/authors/neal/">Neal Rothschild</a> or find him on <a href="https://twitter.com/nrothschild3">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.mitchalbom.com/">Mitch Albom</a>: <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/sports/columnists/mitch-albom/2020/11/01/mitch-albom-2020-presidential-election/6102179002/">The election will be meaningless if we don’t change our ways</a> (<a href="https://www.freep.com/">Detroit Free Press</a>)</p><p>Find more about Mitch Albom’s books <a href="https://www.mitchalbom.com/">at his website.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>All eyes are on Georgia this week as it wraps up its manual recount of nearly 5 million ballots. On Friday, November 13, when the recount began, several news outlets had declared Joe Biden the state’s winner. If that still holds when the recount is complete, Biden will be the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since 1992. If that weren’t enough, control of the Senate now hinges on two critical Georgia runoff elections, which will happen in early January 2021. At the center of this national political storm is Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. On this episode of Turnout with Katie Couric, an interview with the secretary, who gives us a peek behind the recount curtain, and talks about the high-pressure stakes of being the Republican in charge of President Trump’s recount: tweets, calls for resignation, and, yes, even death threats. For Brad Raffensperger, it’s all in a day’s work.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve always said that this series was about so much more than <em>this</em> election. As we’ve shown in the first four episodes, the voting issues of our past — and how we respond to them — pave the way forward, shaping future elections, including the history-making moment we are living in today. But now that we’re face-to-face with the 2020 presidential race, it’s time to start diving into it. On this episode of Turnout with Katie Couric, Katie sorts through some of the week’s big election stories. Then, an interview with newly retired top GOP election lawyer Benjamin Ginsberg about his blunt and public rebuke of President Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud. Ginsberg talks about the inherent difference between Republican and Democratic election policy, the impact of the 2000 Florida recount, and why Democrats’ worst fears about what could happen after November 3 may be unfounded. </p><p><strong>Read Benjamin Ginsberg’s Washington Post op-eds:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/08/republicans-have-insufficient-evidence-call-elections-rigged-fraudulent/"><strong>Republicans have insufficient evidence to call elections ‘rigged’ and ‘fraudulent’</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/29/how-trumps-evidence-free-attacks-elections-damage-republican-party/"><strong>How Trump’s evidence-free attacks on elections damage the Republican party</strong></a></p><p><strong>Stream Recount on </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Recount-Kevin-Spacey/dp/B003URYMY0"><strong>Amazon Prime</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GVU3SLggUVVFvjSoJAXmm"><strong>HBO Max</strong></a><strong>, or </strong><a href="https://www.hulu.com/movie/recount-8ec94808-847a-4d5a-baa3-c3d90e326a10"><strong>HULU</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sheyann Webb-Christburg was eight years old when she first met Martin Luther King, Jr. It was late 1964 and Dr. King was in Selma, Alabama, to organize a voter registration campaign to draw attention to the need for legislation that would ensure Black Americans could safely and freely vote, because in the 1960s, particularly in Southern states like Alabama, that was certainly not the case. “Black folks couldn’t vote,” Sheyann’s father said when asked if he had ever cast a ballot. On this episode of Turnout with Katie Couric, Katie explores the historic struggle of Black enfranchisement — from the moments of brief political prosperity during Reconstruction, to the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, the election of President Barack Obama, and the ongoing fight to restore voting rights to people with past convictions. Woven throughout the episode is Sheyann’s story of being Martin Luther King’s smallest Freedom Fighter and what she witnessed on that Bloody Sunday in Selma in 1965. Katie also interviews Desmond Meade, President and Executive Director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, about his inspiring life story as a formerly homeless returned citizen who in 2018 helped restore voting rights to 1.4 million Floridians.</p><p><strong>More about the guests and organizations featured in this episode:</strong></p><p><a href="http://sheyannwebb.com/">Sheyann Webb-Christburg</a>, civil rights activist, youth advocate and co-author of the book and movie “Selma, Lord, Selma.”</p><p><a href="http://www.gildadaniels.com/home.html">Gilda Daniels</a>, law professor at the University of Baltimore law school, litigation director at the Advancement Project, and author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Uncounted-Crisis-Voter-Suppression-America/dp/1479862355">Uncounted: The Crisis of Voter Suppression in America</a>.”</p><p><a href="https://www.professorcarolanderson.org/">Dr. Carol Anderson</a>, the Charles Howard Candler Professor of African American Studies at Emory University, author of several books including, “<a href="https://www.professorcarolanderson.org/one-person-no-vote">One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression is Destroying Our Democracy</a>.”</p><p>Desmond Meade, president and executive director of the <a href="https://floridarrc.com/">Florida Rights Restoration Coalition</a> and author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Let-My-People-Vote-Returning/dp/0807062324">Let My People Vote: My Battle to Restore the Civil Rights of Returned Citizens</a>.”</p><p>Annette Scott, a volunteer with <a href="https://www.lwv.org/">The League of Women Voters</a>, working primarily with the <a href="https://www.njreentry.org/">New Jersey Reentry Corporation</a> leading voter registration education.</p><p><strong>*Content warning: This episode contains descriptions of violence that some listeners might find disturbing.*</strong></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this special episode of Back to Biz with Katie and Boz, Katie takes the mic solo and shares her conversation with Disney Executive Chairman, Bob Iger. Early on, Iger dreamed of becoming the next Walter Conkrite and landed a job as the local weatherman for a small upstate New York TV station. He soon realized he was better suited behind the camera and began working his way up the corporate ladder at ABC, eventually leading the network’s sports and entertainment divisions. In 2005, he was named Disney’s CEO, ultimately transforming the beloved brand into a global powerhouse through a series of bold acquisitions -- Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm all joined the Disney family during Iger’s tenure. Along the way, he built a reputation for his kindness, integrity, and enthusiastic appreciation of creative talent. He stepped down as CEO in February of this year, assuming the role of Executive Chairman. Soon after, the pandemic hit and the world changed seemingly overnight -- particularly for Disney, a company built on in-person experiences like theme parks, movies, sports, and cruise lines. As Iger helps lead the company through perhaps the most challenging time of its nearly 100-year history, he speaks with Katie about this unprecedented moment along with all the other twists and turns of his remarkable life and career.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

While Schmidt might not be a household name, his reputation looms large in the GOP universe -- he’s helped run campaigns for everyone from President George W. Bush to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and he was the senior campaign strategist and advisor to Sen. John McCain during his 2008 presidential bid. But then, in June 2018, he walked away from the Republican party, citing it as “fully the party of Trump” and “a danger to our democracy and our values.” Now he’s channeling.all of his energy into defeating President Trump in November as co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a political action committee formed by current and former Republicans. In this urgent and timely conversation, Schmidt shares with Katie what led him to renounce the party he had pledged loyalty to for 30 years, what to expect during this final sprint to election day, and how he thinks Trumpism will impact our political system for many years to come.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You don’t have to be a parent to recognize that parenting during COVID is a struggle. When the coronavirus shut down daycare facilities and schools across the country in March, parents became not only full time caretakers, but also teachers, coaches and playdates for their suddenly isolated kids. And working parents — those lucky enough to be able to keep their jobs or work remotely during the shutdown — have had to also find time in the day to do the job that pays the bills. For single working parents, or black or brown parents, that impossible situation, that non-existent work-life balance, is an even heavier burden to bear. But this isn’t new for Christine Michel Carter. In fact, the marketing strategist, working-mom advocate and best-selling author has been “Chicken Little” for the past five years, running around telling everyone the work-life balance sky was falling. COVID just exacerbated the reality. “The world is exposed to the fact that even in married two-income households — unlike mine — women are three times more likely to be the spouse who carries the additional burden of the mental load of just everything that’s going on,” she says. On this episode of Back to Biz with Katie and Boz, co-host Bozoma Saint John talks with Christine about about how to build a better employer-employee relationship, one that doesn’t compartmentalize mothers and fathers, but allows people to bring their whole selves — kids, school mishaps, doctor appointments, birthday parties and all — to the office (or the zoom meeting). Christine and Boz share their own struggles of being a parent in the corporate world, how communities of color are disproportionately affected, and what that so-called work-life balance could look like on the other side of this pandemic. </p><p>Check out Christine Michel Carter’s book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/MOM-AF-Christine-Michel-Carter/dp/1734122706">Mom AF</a>.”</p><p>For more, subscribe to Katie Couric’s morning newsletter, “<a href="https://katiecouric.com/newsletter">Wake-Up Call</a>.”</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The multi-hyphenate talent Ashley Graham has innovated a career that has spread across fashion, beauty, television, and podcasting. Ashley started modeling when she was just 12, but it wasn’t long before she was breaking boundaries — and changing the face of — the size-obsessed industry, becoming the first curvy model to cover Vogue and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue (among others), to walk Michael Kors, and to land a major beauty contract (Revlon).

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The multi-hyphenate talent Ashley Graham has innovated a career that has spread across fashion, beauty, television, and podcasting. Ashley started modeling when she was just 12, but it wasn’t long before she was breaking boundaries — and changing the face of — the size-obsessed industry, becoming the first curvy model to cover Vogue and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue (among others), to walk Michael Kors, and to land a major beauty contract (Revlon).

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Back to Biz with Katie and Boz, Katie Couric is on book deadline! While she’s busy writing, Bozoma Saint John sits down for an intimate conversation with her good friend and all around entertainment renaissance woman La La Anthony. La La shares her career journey from radio personality to MTV VJ (hello, “Total Request Live”) to producer, actress, entrepreneur and activist. They touch upon the ups and downs of quarantine life, but also dive deep into the current state of social and racial unrest and its emotional toll. Although the country’s racial injustices are amplified now, it is a reality both women have dealt with their whole lives and now have to watch their children go through, too. La La shares how she is preparing her 13-year-old son Kiyan for the world he has to live in: “We have a 13-year-old Black son and we live in New York City,” La La says. “My son walks around with a hoodie … he plays basketball, he’s in the gyms, he’s on the courts outside. So we tell him ‘this at any moment could be you.’” It’s a deeply personal conversation about their struggles, as well as their hopes for what can change. “There’s still so much work to do,” La La says, “and you don’t stop just because a hashtag isn’t trending anymore." </p><p>For more, subscribe to Katie Couric’s morning newsletter, “Wake-Up Call,” at <a href="https://katiecouric.com/newsletter">KatieCouric.com</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

The interview's release was held as Katie shifted her attention to the coronavirus pandemic. But the conversation — which was done in front of a live audience in our Manhattan offices (another world, right?) — is surprisingly relevant to issues we are grappling with right now, like how to create more inclusive work environments, and the need for companies to lead with purpose.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Judd Apatow is a comedy powerhouse in Hollywood. From “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” to “Knocked Up” and “This is 40,” Judd has altered the comedy-making template, finding the funny in relatable and vulnerable (even cringeworthy) characters and situations. But what about the responsibility that comes with that power? In this moment of national reckoning on race, what are leaders like Judd doing to lift up black voices and stories? On this episode of “Back to Biz with Katie and Boz,” co-hosts Katie Couric and Bozoma Saint John talk to Judd about how Hollywood can bring diversity to the big screen, the future of moviemaking — and <em>going</em> — in a social-distanced world, as well as his new movie. “The King of Staten Island,” starring Pete Davidson, is an incredibly personal story (based on Pete’s own life) about loss, trauma, and mental health, which Judd says is perfect for this moment. The movie is available to watch on demand. </p><p>Sign up for Katie Couric’s morning newsletter, “<a href="https://katiecouric.com/newsletter">Wake-Up Call</a>.”</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

On this episode of “Back to Biz with Katie and Boz,” co-hosts Katie Couric and Bozoma Saint John talk to Judd about how Hollywood can bring diversity to the big screen, the future of moviemaking — and <em>going</em> — in a social-distanced world, as well as his new movie. “The King of Staten Island,” starring Pete Davidson, is an incredibly personal story (based on Pete’s own life) about loss, trauma, and mental health, which Judd says is perfect for this moment. The movie is available to watch on demand. </p><p>Sign up for Katie Couric’s morning newsletter, “<a href="https://katiecouric.com/newsletter">Wake-Up Call</a>.”</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <itunes:title>Back to Biz with Katie and Boz: Bishop T.D. Jakes and Opal Tometi</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, May 25, George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, accused of using a counterfeit $20 at a deli, was killed in police custody. The next day video captured by bystanders, and spread widely on social media, revealed how brutal and inhumane Floyd’s arrest and last living moments — at the hands of a white cop — really were. Since that video’s release, protesters have taken to the streets in at least 140 cities, demanding justice not only for George Floyd, but also for Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and all black lives. On this episode of Back to Biz with Katie and Boz, Katie Couric and Bozoma Saint John speak with Bishop T.D. Jakes, founder and senior pastor of The Potter’s House, and Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi about what that justice should look like. They discuss the desperate need to not only stop the harm against black people but also repair centuries of damage and why everyone has to step up and speak up for the benefit of all. “This is not a black people’s problem. This an American crisis,” Bishop T.D. Jakes says. “The choice you really have,” Opal Tometi says, “is to be a part of justice or know that you are impeding justice.”  </p><p><a href="https://medium.com/wake-up-call/a-detailed-list-of-anti-racism-resources-a34b259a3eea">Click here for a detailed list of anti-racist resources</a>.</p><p><a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/">Click here for more information or to support Black Lives Matter</a>.</p><p><a href="https://katiecouric.com/newsletter">Click here to sign up for Katie Couric’s morning newsletter “Wake-Up Call.”</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Katie Couric still has questions. But right now they're mostly focused on the future of business. Considering this unprecedented economic downturn brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, how will industries like tech, education, entertainment, travel, and fashion adjust and innovate to fit our new world order. Introducing "Back to Biz with Katie and Boz," a new interview series co-hosted by award-winning journalist Katie Couric and trailblazing marketing executive Bozoma Saint John. </p><p>On the premiere episode of "Back to Biz with Katie and Boz," the co-hosts set the stage for their forward-looking series with their first guest, tech and media journalist and podcaster Kara Swisher who offers a big-picture look at the ways the shuttered economy has made Big Tech even bigger — for better and worse. "Any trends that were present have been accelerated and then helped by tech," Kara says. "You could go around from industry to industry. Look at streaming entertainment that people have been using. Look at Netflix — [it's] never had more usage." Katie, Boz and Kara discuss what it means to be an essential worker and why all businesses will have to reassess what "gig work" means. They also talk about the future of education, why TikTok is having more than a moment, and the innovations that are bubbling up in tech right now.

      <itunes:title>America’s Maternal Mortality Crisis, Part 2</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, on “Next Question with Katie Couric,” we heard the devastating story of how one mother, Kira Johnson, became a part of a shameful statistic:​that between 700 and 900 American women die each year from pregnancy and childbirth-related causes. We learned that structural issues like racism as well as an increase in medical interventions during labor, have led to more women dying from pregnancy and childbirth today than they did 30 years ago. Today, in Part 2, Katie tackles her next question: What is being done to better protect American mothers, and particularly women of color? Katie talks to Olympic runner Allyson Felix who, in 2018, became one of the 50,000 women who <em>nearly</em> die from pregnancy-related complications. “Being a professional athlete,” Allyson says, “I just thought that will never happen to me.” Katie also hears from public health leaders like Dr. Debra Bingham and politicians like New Jersey’s First Lady Tammy Murphy who are actively trying to turn high maternal mortality rates around. Today, given the additional challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic and the existing racial health disparities COVID-19 has only exacerbated, this kind of work is more urgent and relevant than ever. </p><p>Guests and resources for this episode include:</p><ul>

      <title>America’s Maternal Mortality Crisis, Part 1</title>
      <itunes:title>America’s Maternal Mortality Crisis, Part 1</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Long before COVID-19 hit the U.S. in early 2020, the American health system was suffering another crisis: alarmingly high — and rising — rates of maternal mortality, particularly among black women. In this country, an estimated two women die every day from pregnancy and childbirth-related causes. And 60 percent of those deaths could have been prevented. And now, the coronavirus is forcing tens of thousands of women to give birth in unprecedented circumstances — sometimes alone, and often without the support networks they need to stay healthy. </p><p>In Part 1 of a special episode of “Next Question with Katie Couric,” Katie talks to Charles Johnson, whose wife Kira died in 2016 just hours after giving birth to their second son, Langston. “I thought that what happened to Kira was an isolated incident,” Charles tells Katie. “I thought, this doesn’t happen in 2016, in our country.” Why are women like Kira Johnson — healthy, prepared, and insured — dying? And how did the U.S. become one of the most dangerous places in the developed world to have a baby? </p><p>Guests and resources for this episode include:</p><ul>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In these unprecedented times, when tensions, anxieties and fears about the coronavirus are high, many people are finding comfort in a surprising source: Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 thriller “Contagion.” It’s about a mysterious and highly contagious virus that crosses continents, causes city-wide lockdowns, throws government protocols into chaos, upends daily life, and instills an almost universal state of dread across the globe. Sound familiar? Katie talks with “Contagion” screenwriter Scott Burns and one of the lead consultants on the film, <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.mailman.columbia.edu_people_our-2Dfaculty_wil2001&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=GC0NZZhaEw6GOQSjMHI2g15k_drElRoPmOYiK2k0eZ8&amp;r=7-MxQ18FieZ-Wwf79PaUBayArar-Ekc6ceTgLE2-5aE&amp;m=qKlRcX8S-_oJWhbc81GMWcnnRRJS5jArQjMinOX3-Ng&amp;s=Uva_8f6ps-7R3z1drCvxb3t8n2SDxqKHoAyVozHmzzU&amp;e=">Dr. Ian Lipkin</a>, the John Snow Professor of Epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, about why the movie is having such a moment, how they managed to create something so prescient, and ways our own pandemic nightmare might end. The pair also touch on their latest collaboration: With help from the original “Contagion” cast, Scott Burns and the Mailman School of Public Health have created PSAs to help spread the word about social distancing, hand washing, and other life-saving measures in the age of COVID-19.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie continues her special coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. First, Katie looks to New York City — now the national epicenter of this crisis — where the rate of positive COVID-19 cases is doubling ever three days. Which means the peak of coronavirus infections will be much higher and hit New York much sooner than expected, giving the city's vast network of hospitals — which are already under tremendous strain — less time to prepare for a deluge of patients. Katie talks to Dr. Robert Femia, the chair of emergency medicine at <a href="https://nyulangone.org/locations/virtual-urgent-care">NYU Langone</a> to find out how emergency rooms in New York City are faring now and how they are bracing for what's to come. Then, Katie speaks to Beth Cameron, the former head of the National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, about why the U.S. wasn't prepared for this pandemic. Beth Cameron is now the Vice President for Global Biological Policy and Programs at the Nuclear Threat Initiative, which has a new effort to help local officials during the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://covid-local.org/">You can find more information about that here</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What began as a distant and mysterious illness in China at the end of 2019 has now been declared an official global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The virus, now known as COVID-19, has spread to well over 100,000 people from Asia to the Middle East, Europe and the United States. On this episode of <em>Next Question with Katie Couric</em>, Katie asks experts like Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, Head of the Outbreak Investigation Task Force of the World Health Organization, to break down everything you need to know about this alarming outbreak — where it came from, how it spreads, and what you can do to protect yourself against it. Katie also speaks to Yulin Yin, a Minnesota man who shares his extraordinary journey out of the center of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, to a 14-day quarantine in San Diego and finally, home to his family. Katie also calls on Dr. Bill Schaffner, Medical Director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, to answer some of your burning questions.

The plant-based market is even conquering fast food, appearing nationwide on menus at major chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and White Castle. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks with one of the innovators behind the plant-based revolution — Ethan Brown, the CEO of Beyond Meat.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Some of life's fundamental questions include, 'who am I?' and 'where do I come from?'. As at-home DNA test kits become more and more popular, those philosophical musings have become big business. But what happens when the results are more than you bargained for? On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie sits down with podcast host and author Dani Shapiro, who shares her shocking story about finding out, in her 50s, that the beloved man who raised her was not her biological father. With direct-to-consumer DNA testing expected to reach 100 million people in just a few years, Dani’s experience is far from unique — millions of people are about to come face-to-face with some hard truths about their histories. So what are the hugely profitable companies behind these kits doing to support customers who receive life-altering news? Katie speaks to one woman who took matters into her own hands after the company who made her test wouldn’t even get on the phone with her, turning her DNA results into a global support network for people like her. </p><p>For more about Dani’s book, Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/554262/inheritance-by-dani-shapiro/">click here</a> or visit PenguinRandomHouse.com</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

Katie speaks to one woman who took matters into her own hands after the company who made her test wouldn’t even get on the phone with her, turning her DNA results into a global support network for people like her. </p><p>For more about Dani’s book, Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/554262/inheritance-by-dani-shapiro/">click here</a> or visit PenguinRandomHouse.com</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <itunes:title>Bonus: Next Question Live! With Allbirds CEO Tim Brown</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this bonus episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie debuts Next Question Live, an intimate, innovation-focused series featuring interviews with leaders, entrepreneurs and business trailblazers recorded (and taped) in front of a live audience in New York City.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Getting older should be something to celebrate. Instead, our youth-obsessed culture tells us we need to get rid of our wrinkles, dye our gray hair, and shave years off of our LinkedIn profiles, or risk becoming irrelevant—or worse, invisible. But why do we treat the very normal process of aging like it’s something to be ashamed of? On this episode of Next Question, Katie talks to an amazing group of women who refuse to apologize for acting (and looking) their age: Lyn Slater, a.k.a. the Accidental Icon; supermodel JoAni Johnson; anti-ageism activist Ashton Applewhite; and legendary advertising executive Cindy Gallop. Katie and her guests discuss the roots of our implicit biases against older people (especially older women), the social and economic costs of ageism, and why you should never say “thank you” when someone says you look good for your age.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Are you holding a smartphone or sitting down at your laptop right now? If so, you’re just a few clicks away from free, hardcore pornography. There are no explicit content warnings, and no age verifications to make you think twice about clicking "play”—which means kids as young as 9 and 10 are being exposed to sex for the first time via sites like PornHub. But what happens when porn becomes a form of sex education? On this special preview episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks to a young woman who believes porn led to her boyfriend’s scary behavior during sex, and gets real teens to open up about their experiences with porn. Later, she sits down with anti-porn activist Dr. Gail Dines and sex educator Al Vernacchio to tackle how parents can counteract the alarming messages their kids may be absorbing—not just about sex, but about consent, gender equality, and what a healthy relationship actually looks like. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>Looking Back at 2018 with Al Gore and Michael Barbaro (Part Two)</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>For part two of our look back at 2018, we’re reviewing the year in climate change and news/politics. Katie and Brian invite former Vice President Al Gore to reflect on the devastating forest fires and hurricanes that happened this year, how they’re connected to climate change, and why it’s important to address the climate crisis now. Next, Michael Barbaro, from The New York Times’s “The Daily” podcast, walks Katie and Brian through the biggest names and moments in the news this year — from the Mueller investigation and Brett Kavanaugh to the war in Yemen and mass shootings.




Plus, Katie and Brian have an announcement: This is the last episode of the podcast. Thank you so much to all of our devoted listeners, and stay tuned on Katie and Brian’s social media accounts for more information about what’s next for them!

Katie and Brian talk with Amy about what the results mean, what we’ve learned about the electorate, and how the elections might shape both parties’ strategies in 2020.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Palin Interviews, 10 Years Later is a two-part documentary series from the Katie Couric podcast. For this special series, Katie and Brian look back at Katie’s interviews with then vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and the impact those conversations had on the 2008 election. Plus, they consider the path Palin may have paved for the rise of Donald Trump. In Part One, Katie and Brian go behind the scenes with top officials from the McCain and Obama campaigns and cover Palin’s extraordinary emergence on the national stage: her selection as John McCain’s running mate (which almost didn’t happen) and her electrifying speech at the Republican National Convention. And of course, they examine the interviews heard round the world and consider why they struck such a chord.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>Silicon Valley's Toxic Bro Culture</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's no secret that Silicon Valley has a problem with women. In her new book, Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys' Club of Silicon Valley, journalist Emily Chang explores what the tech industry has been getting wrong when it comes to sexism and workplace bias.
