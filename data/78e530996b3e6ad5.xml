&#8226;	Ford Fund is donating $1M to be distributed to the American Red Cross, Team Rubicon, ToolBank USA , World Central Kitchen and local foodbanks. Each nonprofit specializes in disaster relief efforts and is already on the ground in the area providing meals, shelter and assisting with the clearing of roads for emergency personnel. 
&#8226;	Deploying and loaning F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid and F-150 Lightning vehicles, plus Transit and E-Transit vehicles for nonprofits to use and power their relief efforts.
