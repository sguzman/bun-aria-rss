      <title>Sohla El-Waylly’s Crisp &amp; Juicy Herb Roasted Turkey and Honey-Thyme Gravy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Cooking Up a Storm, we turn to a rising star of the culinary world, chef and writer Sohla El-Waylly, to offer her tips and tricks for making the crispiest and juiciest bird possible. She’ll share her turkey recipe, the aptly-named: Crisp & Juicy Herb Roasted Turkey, along with her recipe for a fresh take on gravy: Honey-Thyme Gravy.  Both are sure to make this year’s holiday extra savory. </p><p><strong>Crisp & Juicy Herb Roasted Turkey </strong></p><p>Serves 8 to 10</p><p>1/3-1/4 cup kosher salt</p><p>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</p><p>2 teaspoons MSG (optional)</p><p>thyme, sage and rosemary sprigs</p><p>1 (12- to 14-pound) whole turkey</p><p>6 tablespoons melted ghee or neutral oil (such as sunflower or canola)</p><ol><li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the salt, sugar and MSG (if using). Set a wire rack into a sheet tray. Line the rack with enough herb sprigs to cover.</li><li>Remove the neck and giblets from the turkey cavity and reserve for gravy. Place the turkey, breast-side down, on a cutting board. Using kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the backbone to remove it (reserve the backbone for gravy). Flip over the turkey and press firmly onto the breast until it flattens and you hear the breastbone crack.</li><li>Using paper towels, pat the turkey and cutting board dry. Evenly sprinkle the salt mixture all over the turkey, taking care to get into the wing and leg joints. You want to be sure to use all of the salt mixture — if some falls off, scoop it up and pat it on.</li><li>Place the turkey, skin-side up, onto the prepared sheet tray. Chill turkey, uncovered, for at least 24 hours and preferably 48 hours.</li><li>Remove from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours. Heat oven to 425 F. Brush or rub turkey evenly with melted ghee or oil.</li><li>Place the turkey into the oven and pour 1½ cups water into the sheet tray.</li><li>Roast turkey, rotating occasionally, until the skin is deep golden-brown, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the breast registers at least 150 F and the thighs register at least 165 F, about 90 minutes (if the skin is getting dark too quickly, reduce the heat to 375 F).

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Cooking Up a Storm, we turn to a rising star of the culinary world, chef and writer Sohla El-Waylly, to offer her tips and tricks for making the crispiest and juiciest bird possible. She’ll share her turkey recipe, the aptly-named: Crisp & Juicy Herb Roasted Turkey, along with her recipe for a fresh take on gravy: Honey-Thyme Gravy.  Both are sure to make this year’s holiday extra savory. </p><p><strong>Crisp & Juicy Herb Roasted Turkey </strong></p><p>Serves 8 to 10</p><p>1/3-1/4 cup kosher salt</p><p>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</p><p>2 teaspoons MSG (optional)</p><p>thyme, sage and rosemary sprigs</p><p>1 (12- to 14-pound) whole turkey</p><p>6 tablespoons melted ghee or neutral oil (such as sunflower or canola)</p><ol><li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the salt, sugar and MSG (if using). Set a wire rack into a sheet tray. Line the rack with enough herb sprigs to cover.</li><li>Remove the neck and giblets from the turkey cavity and reserve for gravy. Place the turkey, breast-side down, on a cutting board. Using kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the backbone to remove it (reserve the backbone for gravy). Flip over the turkey and press firmly onto the breast until it flattens and you hear the breastbone crack.</li><li>Using paper towels, pat the turkey and cutting board dry. Evenly sprinkle the salt mixture all over the turkey, taking care to get into the wing and leg joints. You want to be sure to use all of the salt mixture — if some falls off, scoop it up and pat it on.</li><li>Place the turkey, skin-side up, onto the prepared sheet tray. Chill turkey, uncovered, for at least 24 hours and preferably 48 hours.</li><li>Remove from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours. Heat oven to 425 F. Brush or rub turkey evenly with melted ghee or oil.</li><li>Place the turkey into the oven and pour 1½ cups water into the sheet tray.</li><li>Roast turkey, rotating occasionally, until the skin is deep golden-brown, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the breast registers at least 150 F and the thighs register at least 165 F, about 90 minutes (if the skin is getting dark too quickly, reduce the heat to 375 F). Allow turkey to rest, uncovered, for at least 20 minutes before carving.</li></ol><p><strong>Honey-Thyme Gravy</strong></p><p>Makes about 1 quart</p><ol><li>With a paper towel, pat giblets dry (if using). Cut giblets into 1/2-inch pieces.</li><li>In a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, heat ghee or oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add giblets, season lightly with salt and cook undisturbed until browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Toss and cook until opaque, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer giblets to a plate and refrigerate, leaving the fat behind.</li><li>Return the pan to medium heat.

      <title>Alexander Smalls’s Low Country Oyster Cornbread Dressing with Crispy Slab Bacon</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most beloved side dishes is also the most contested. Is it called stuffing or dressing? And what’s even the difference between the two? Quite a lot, according to chef, restaurant-owner, and cookbook author Alexander Smalls. From what kind of bread to use, to what kind of protein to add, this holiday dish can look vastly different depending on what part of the country you hail from. Smalls will walk us through how to make a special kind of dressing inspired by flavors from his own childhood: Low Country Oyster Cornbread Dressing with Crispy Slab Bacon.</p><p><strong>Low Country Oyster Cornbread Dressing with Crispy Slab Bacon</strong></p><p>Serves 8</p><p>4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for greasing</p><p>1 cup smoked slab bacon, cut into 1-by-1/3-inch pieces</p><p>2/3 cup finely chopped Vidalia onion</p><p>1 large red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped</p><p>1 cup grape tomatoes, halved</p><p>1 cup roasted corn kernels (optional)</p><p>2/3 cup finely chopped celery</p><p>1½ tablespoons rubbed fresh sage</p><p>1¼ teaspoon dried thyme</p><p>1/2 teaspoon celery seeds</p><p>5 cups crumbled day-old buttermilk cornbread </p><p>4 cups torn white bread, slightly dry toasted</p><p>18-20 fat oysters (1 pint), shucked with liquor reserved</p><p>2 cups chicken stock or low-sodium canned chicken broth</p><p>3 large eggs, well beaten</p><p>1 teaspoon sea salt</p><p>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p><p>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</p><p>1 teaspoon grated or ground nutmeg</p><ol><li>Preheat your oven to 375 F and grease a 9- by 13-inch baking dish generously with butter.</li><li>Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray, cover with a layer of aluminum foil, top with a cooking rack and spray that with non-stick cooking spray, too.</li><li>Arrange the bacon onto the rack in a single layer, leaving space in between each piece.</li><li>Roast until firm and crispy, about 45 minutes, then reduce the oven to 325 F.</li><li>Transfer the bacon to a cast-iron pan and sauté over medium heat until very crispy, about 20 minutes.</li><li>Meanwhile, in a large frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li><li>Add the onion, bell pepper, tomatoes, corn (if using), celery, sage, thyme and celery seeds, cover with a lid and cook, stirring once or twice, until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes; remove from the heat and cool.</li><li>In a large bowl, toss the cornbread and white bread to combine. Add the bacon and any renderings and toss to combine. Add the cooled vegetable medley and toss to combine.</li><li>Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth, place over a 4-cup liquid measuring cup and strain the oyster liquor through it. Add enough stock to equal 2 cups. Add the eggs and whisk to combine, then pour it into the bowl with the bread. Add the salt and pepper, cayenne and nutmeg, and stir to combine.</li><li>Spoon half of the dressing into the prepared baking dish. Space the oysters evenly over the dressing at least an inch away from the sides of the dish. Spoon the remaining dressing over the oysters, spreading it to the edges of the dish.</li><li>Bake until the dressing is steaming, and the top is lightly browned, about 1 hour.
