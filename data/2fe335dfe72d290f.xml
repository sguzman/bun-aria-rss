      <title>Episode #101: Bits of "Breaking Barriers": Fede Galizia (Season 12, Episode 2) </title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/101</link>
      <description>For this season of ArtCurious, I’m doing something a little bit different. I’m treating you to renditions of eight of my favorite segments from Breaking Barriers: Women Artists of Renaissance Europe, my online course found exclusively at avid.fm. Every other week through January, I’ll share selections from Breaking Barriers, and encourage you that if you like it, you can purchase the whole course. Today: She might not have had the backing of royal patrons or the fancy aristocratic connections that Levina Teerlinc and Sofonisba Anguissola had, but Fede Galizia still did well for herself with commissions. And she was an innovator, to boot, often noted as the first-known Italian artist to have completed a still life painting at a time where the genre was not yet fashionable. From Breaking Barriers: Women of Renaissance Europe, please enjoy “Fede Galizia: Early Still-Life Adopter.”

      <title>Author Interview: Hugh Eakin's "Picasso's War"</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/eakin</link>
      <description>We’re back on ArtCurious with another great interview episode for you today. Today’s episode features a conversation about Picasso’s War, a recent book by journalist Hugh Eakin. Today we think of New York as the center of the twentieth century art world, but it took three determined men, two world wars, and one singular artist to secure the city’s cultural prominence. Pablo Picasso was the most influential and perplexing artist of his age, and the turning points of his career and salient facets of his private life have intrigued the world for decades. However, the tremendous feat of winning support for his art in the U.S. has long been overlooked—until now.
 In PICASSO’S WAR: How Modern Art Came to America, Eakin details the never-before-told story of how a single exhibition, years in the making, finally brought the 20th century’s most notorious artist U.S. acclaim, irrevocably changed American culture, and in doing so saved dozens of the twentieth century’s most enduring artworks from the Nazis.

      <title>Episode #100: Bits of "Breaking Barriers": Lucia and Elena Anguissola (Season 12, Episode 1) </title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/100</link>
      <description>For this season of ArtCurious, I’m doing something a little bit different. I’m treating you to renditions of eight of my favorite segments from Breaking Barriers: Women Artists of Renaissance Europe, my online course found exclusively at avid.fm. Every other week through January, I’ll share selections from Breaking Barriers, and encourage you that if you like it, you can purchase the whole course. Today, I’m sharing a story about the family of one of the most well-known female artists of the Renaissance. You might know a bit about Sofonisba Anguissola--but how much do you know about her sister, Lucia? And how about another Anguissola daughter? From Breaking Barriers: Women of Renaissance Europe, please enjoy “Lucia Anguissola (and Elena Anguissola): In Their Sister’s Footsteps.”

Host Helen Molesworth revisits Mendieta’s death, taking a closer look at how she might have fallen out of the window of Carl’s 34th floor New York apartment, and the following trial which has divided the art world since 1985.

      <title>Author Interview: Eden Collinsworth's "What the Ermine Saw: The Extraordinary Journey of Leonardo da Vinci's Most Mysterious Portrait"</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/collinsworth</link>
      <description>I’ve got a great interview for you today— this time, I’m featuring a conversation with Eden Collinsworth on her fascinating book, What the Ermine Saw: The Extraordinary Journey of Leonardo da Vinci's Most Mysterious Portrait. This extraordinary work of narrative non-fiction traces the remarkable history of Leonardo da Vinci’s enigmatic portrait: The Woman with an Ermine, from its original creation, including the fascinating story of its subject, Cecilia Gallerani, and on to its mysterious disappearance for 250 years after which it emerged in the hands of an aristocratic Polish family. Now on display in Krakow, the painting was exiled in Paris, and kept hidden from the Nazis by a brave housekeeper. These defining moments in history comprise a portrait of Europe’s past as vivid and complex as the painting itself.

      <title>Episode #98: Cherchez La Femme, or The Woman Behind the Art--Rose Valland (Season 11, Episode 7)</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/98</link>
      <description>There’s a phrase in the French language that goes, “Cherchez la femme.” In translation, it means “find the woman,” or “look for the woman,” and typically it’s derogatory, a phrase used as an explanation for the reasons why a man may be behaving badly. Cherchez la femme, some say, meaning that “woman troubles” are assumed to be at the core of any man’s real problems. But I like the idea of appropriating the phrase “cherchez la femme” to mean that we’re going to look for the women who made things right in art history, who bolstered and brought attention to some big-name artists.
Welcome to season 11 of ArtCurious, where we’re highlighting the lives and work of the women who supported some of the world’s favorite artists. Today, I am so excited to share with you the life of Rose Valland, a great World War Two hero who personally helped save thousands of works of art from being destroyed or lost forever.

      <title>Author Interview: Kevin Townley's "Look, Look, Look, Look, Look Again: Buddhist Wisdom Reflected in 26 Artists"</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/townley</link>
      <description>Want a cool, fun, and funny book about art? How about one about Buddhism? Just want a great read? You’ve got all of it covered with Look, Look, Look, Look, Look Again: Buddhist Wisdom Reflected in 26 Artists.  In this book, Kevin Townley leads you to, invites you in, and sometimes springs upon you, the perennial wisdom in the worlds of artists from Artemisia to Hilma af Klint to Marilyn Minter. (All 26 artists are women.)  This book is a mad riot of interconnections: art, Buddhism, mandala principle, spiritual pursuits, growing up goth in the 90s, the theories of Marshall McLuhan, and a mongoose–to name but a few.
Meditation teacher, filmmaker, writer and art savant Kevin Townley turns his unique gaze upon 26 artists and magnifies the power and meaning of the five Buddhist wisdom energies through explorations of their work. Rather than trying to “explain” these energies, he reveals them to you in familiar visual language while, of course, pushing the boundaries of what you might have thought you saw at first glance. 
Beautifully written and hilariously disarming, Look, Look, Look, Look, Look Again vibrates with lucid insight into society, history, and establishment, while teaching you a lot about meditation and Buddhism along the way. In exploring the practice, life, and work of these through the lens of the five wisdom energies, you come away with a deeper understanding of yourself, the world, and the true dharma that transcends culture and religion—and a profound gratitude for anyone really willing to look.
Please enjoy this bonus episode, featuring my discussion, via Zoom, with Kevin Townley. Be sure to grab your copy of Look, Look, Look, Look, Look Again  from Bookshop.org. If you prefer Amazon, that link is here as well.

      <title>Episode #96:  Cherchez La Femme, or The Woman Behind the Art--Johanna Van Gogh (Season 11, Episode 5) </title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/96</link>
      <description>There’s a phrase in the French language that goes, “Cherchez la femme.” In translation, it means “find the woman,” or “look for the woman,” and typically it’s derogatory, a phrase used as an explanation for the reasons why a man may be behaving badly. Cherchez la femme, some say, meaning that “woman troubles” are assumed to be at the core of any man’s real problems. But I like the idea of appropriating the phrase “cherchez la femme” to mean that we’re going to look for the women who made things right in art history, who bolstered and brought attention to some big-name artists.
Welcome to season 11 of ArtCurious, where we’re highlighting the lives and work of the women who supported some of the world’s favorite artists. Today, I am so excited to share with you the life of Jo van Gogh-Bonger, the woman who single-handedly made Vincent van Gogh, her brother-in-law, a household name.

      <title>Author Interview: John Higgs's "William Blake vs. The World"</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/higgs</link>
      <description>What a great conversation I had recently with John Higgs about his new book, William Blake vs the World! Poet, artist, and visionary, William Blake is an archetypal misunderstood genius. His life passed without recognition, and he worked without reward, often mocked, dismissed and misinterpreted. Yet from his ignoble end in a pauper’s grave, Blake now occupies a unique position as an artist who unites and attracts people from all corners of society—a rare inclusive symbol of human identity. 
With 30 integrated illustrations throughout the book, William Blake vs the World is a beautiful, wild adventure into unfamiliar territory. John Higgs places the bewildering eccentricities of a most singular artist into fascinating context, and although the journey begins with us trying to understand Blake, we will ultimately discover that it is Blake who helps us to understand ourselves.

        <![CDATA[<p>What a great conversation I had recently with John Higgs about his new book, <strong><em>William Blake vs the World</em>! </strong>Poet, artist, and visionary, William Blake is an archetypal misunderstood genius. His life passed without recognition, and he worked without reward, often mocked, dismissed and misinterpreted. Yet from his ignoble end in a pauper’s grave, Blake now occupies a unique position as an artist who unites and attracts people from all corners of society—a rare inclusive symbol of human identity. </p><p>With <strong>30 integrated illustrations </strong>throughout the book, <strong><em>William Blake vs the World </em></strong>is a beautiful, wild adventure into unfamiliar territory. John Higgs places the bewildering eccentricities of a most singular artist into fascinating context, and although the journey begins with us trying to understand Blake, we will ultimately discover that it is Blake who helps us to understand ourselves.</p><p>Please enjoy this bonus episode, featuring my discussion, via Zoom, with John Higgs.

      <title>Episode #93: Cherchez La Femme, or The Woman Behind the Art--Berthe Weill (Season 11, Episode 2)</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/93</link>
      <description>There’s a phrase in the French language that goes, “Cherchez la femme.” In translation, it means “find the woman,” or “look for the woman,” and typically it’s derogatory, a phrase used as an explanation for the reasons why a man may be behaving badly. Cherchez la femme, some say, meaning that “woman troubles” are assumed to be at the core of any man’s real problems. But I like the idea of appropriating the phrase “cherchez la femme” to mean that we’re going to look for the women who made things right in art history, who bolstered and brought attention to some big-name artists.
Welcome to season 11 of ArtCurious, where we’re highlighting the lives and work of the women who supported some of the world’s favorite artists. Today, meet Berthe Weill, an art dealer who made many artists famous, including some of the biggest names of the 20th century.

      <title>Author Interview: Barbara Bloemink's "Florine Stettheimer: A Biography"</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/bloemink</link>
      <description>Recently I interviewed art historian, curator, and museum director Barbara Bloemink, who shared the backstory of one of the most fascinating artists of the early 20th century: American artist Florine Stettheimer.
Florine Stettheimer was a feminist, multi-media artist who documented New York City’s growth as the center of cultural life, finance, and entertainment between the World Wars. During her first forty years, spent mostly in Europe, Florine Stettheimer studied academic painting and was aware of the earliest modernist styles prior to most American artists. Returning to New York, she and her sisters led an acclaimed salon for major avant-garde cultural figures including Marcel Duchamp, the Stieglitz circle, and numerous poets, dancers, and writers. During her life, Stettheimer showed her innovative paintings in more than forty of the most important museum exhibits and salons. She also wrote poetry, designed unique furniture, and gained international fame for the sets and costumes she created for the avant-garde opera, Four Saints in Three Acts. Stettheimer’s work was also socially progressive: she painted several identity-issue paintings, addressing African American segregation, Jewish bigotry, fluid sexuality, and women’s new independence.
Florine Stettheimer: A Biography presents one of the first comprehensive readings of Stettheimer’s art. Barbara Bloemink establishes Stettheimer’s place as one of the twentieth century’s most significant and progressive artists and examines why her unique work remains relevant today.

      <title>BONUS: Jennifer on The Pickup Shot from Subgenre: Season 2 - The Thomas Crown Affair (1999)</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/thomascrown</link>
      <description>Hi listeners! If you’re into art and into movies, then I’ve got a special treat for you. I recently featured on a bonus episode, “The Pickup Shot,” for the Subgenre podcast, hosted by Josh Dasal (and truth be told, if the name wasn’t a dead giveaway: he’s my husband). In this episode, we chat about all the art in one of the artsiest films of the past two decades, The Thomas Crown Affair, from 1999.
Want more movies, and more of me and Josh? Be sure to subscribe to Subgenre, and I’ll be guest-hosting a full-length episode of Subgenre, releasing in April— the theme of this season is “Charming Thieves,” and the movie I’ve chosen is a personal (and Dasal Fam) favorite. And you can listen to me chat about a French submarine film NOW, on Subgenre’s Season 1, Episode 3: "Le chant du loup (The Wolf's Call).”

      <title>Author Interview: Claudia Fontaine Chidester's "Trusted Eye" </title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/chidester</link>
      <description>I recently had the good fortune to chat with Claudia Fontaine Chidester, whose latest book, Trusted Eye: Post-World War II Adventures of a Fearless Art Advocate, is available now. Trusted Eye is a compelling narrative of an American wife and mother finding her place amid the rubble of war-torn Germany. Virginia Fontaine fought continually for recognition—as a woman, a photographer, an art curator, and, perhaps most importantly, a liaison between beleaguered German artists and the outside world. Through journals, letters, and photographs, she recorded her uniquely intimate perspective on this period, amid an ever-changing constellation of artists and friends. Fontaine documented her life from a young age: her struggles at Yale Art School, her year as a newlywed in the British Virgin Islands, and her employment in a munitions factory. Later, she helped the Jewish underground in Europe; traveled with gallerists throughout Germany, Switzerland, and France; tangled with the Monuments Men; and experienced the international reach of Senator Joseph McCarthy's anticommunist pursuits. Essays by art experts Graeme Reid and Dorothea Schöne illuminate Fontaine's early years in Milwaukee and her impact on German art culture in the early postwar years. Trusted Eye is both a biography and a visual almanac for an intricate slice of the twentieth century. 
Please enjoy this bonus episode, featuring my discussion, via Zoom, with Claudia. New episodes of ArtCurious coming soon!

      <title>Live on Fireside: Lilianne Milgrom's "L'Origine"</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/fireside6</link>
      <description>Did you miss our LIVE bonus show on Fireside, the interactive storytelling platform? Don’t worry— you can catch the replay on Fireside, or enjoy the bonus audio here. In this conversation from January 2022, I spoke with Lilianne Milgrom, a Paris-born, internationally acclaimed artist and award-winning author. She holds two degrees from Melbourne University and an associate degree from the Academy of Art in San Francisco. She exhibits her artwork around the world and is the recipient of multiple awards and residencies. In 2011, she became the first authorized copyist of Gustave Courbet’s controversial painting L’Origine du Monde (The Origin of the World) which hangs in the Orsay Museum in Paris. Milgrom spent a decade researching and writing L’Origine, her debut novel, all about Courbet’s incredible painting—as well as Milgrom’s own personal experience of copying the work. L’Origine has snagged no less than six literary honors, including the Publishers Weekly 2021 US book award for Best Adult Fiction.

Milgrom spent a decade researching and writing <a href="https://amzn.to/3gWFxtH"><em>L’Origine</em></a>, her debut novel, all about Courbet’s incredible painting—as well as Milgrom’s own personal experience of copying the work. <em>L’Origine </em>has snagged no less than six literary honors, including the Publishers Weekly 2021 US book award for Best Adult Fiction.</p><p>Please <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/artcurious-podcast/id1142736861?mt=2">SUBSCRIBE and REVIEW our show on Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5wH1Xg5QIVxqNYMFo7oYpp">FOLLOW on Spotify</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/artcuriouspod?lang=en">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/artcuriouspod/">Instagram</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/artcuriouspod">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://firesidechat.com/jenniferdasal">Fireside</a></p><p>Don’t forget to show your support for our show by purchasing <a href="https://www.teepublic.com/stores/artcurious-podcast?ref_id=19823"><em>ArtCurious </em>swag from TeePublic!</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/24747/9781954854147">Buy <em>L'Origine </em>Here!</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>SPONSORS:</strong></p><p><a href="https://bombas.com/artcurious">Bombas</a>: get 20% off your first order with our link</p><p><a href="https://indeed.com/art">Indeed</a>: Listeners get a free $75 credit to upgrade your job post</p><p><a href="http://acorn.tv/">Acorn.TV: </a>Use promo code “<strong>artcurious</strong>”--all lowercase--to try Acorn free for 30 days</p><p><a href="https://sundancenow.com/">Sundance Now</a>: Try Sundance Now free for 30 days with promo code <strong>ARTCURIOUS</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Want to advertise/sponsor our show?</em></strong></p><p><em>We have partnered with AdvertiseCast to handle our advertising/sponsorship requests.

      <title>Live on Fireside: Jeffrey H. Jackson's "Paper Bullets"</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/fireside5</link>
      <description>Did you miss our LIVE bonus show on Fireside, the interactive storytelling platform? Don’t worry— you can catch the replay on Fireside, or enjoy the bonus audio here. In this conversation from early January, I spoke with professor Jeffrey H.

      <title>Live on Fireside: Laura Morelli's "The Stolen Lady"</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/fireside4</link>
      <description>Did you miss our LIVE bonus show on Fireside, the interactive storytelling platform? Don’t worry— you can catch the replay on Fireside, or enjoy the bonus audio here. In this conversation from early December, I spoke with Laura Morelli, a USA Today bestselling author and art historian who writes amazing historical novels involving the art world. We discussed her background in art history, how she writes and structures her novels, and get into some of the nitty gritty on her latest book, The Stolen Lady, a book about the Mona Lisa that takes place in both the Italian Renaissance and in france during WWII. It is not only a fascinating and engrossing read, but the conversation with Laura herself was absolutely lovely, too--and I hope you enjoy listening in. 
Want to join in on the fun next time? Join Fireside now and follow me for invites to each live recording, where you can participate in the audience and ask questions live! And who knows? Maybe we’ll even throw a trivia contest every now and again. The next one is coming up on January 12 at 2 PM eastern, when I’ll be speaking with author Jeffrey H. Jackson to discuss his latest book, Paper Bullets, about the incredible artists Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore--two women who risked their lives to defy the Nazis. It’s an awesome real-life tale of using subversive tactics to disrupt Hitler’s crew--and you’re not going to want to miss it.

Don’t worry— you can catch the replay on Fireside, or enjoy the bonus audio here. In this conversation from early December, I spoke with Laura Morelli, a USA Today bestselling author and art historian who writes amazing historical novels involving the art world. We discussed her background in art history, how she writes and structures her novels, and get into some of the nitty gritty on her latest book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3ETKxcX"><em>The Stolen Lady</em></a>, a book about the Mona Lisa that takes place in both the Italian Renaissance and in france during WWII. It is not only a fascinating and engrossing read, but the conversation with Laura herself was absolutely lovely, too--and I hope you enjoy listening in. </p><p>Want to join in on the fun next time?<a href="https://firesidechat.com/jenniferdasal"> Join Fireside now </a>and follow me for invites to each live recording, where you can participate in the audience and ask questions live! And who knows? Maybe we’ll even throw a trivia contest every now and again. The next one is coming up on January 12 at 2 PM eastern, when I’ll be speaking with author Jeffrey H. Jackson to discuss his latest book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3mmApT9"><em>Paper Bullets</em></a>, about the incredible artists Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore--two women who risked their lives to defy the Nazis. It’s an awesome real-life tale of using subversive tactics to disrupt Hitler’s crew--and you’re not going to want to miss it.</p><p><br></p><p>Please <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/artcurious-podcast/id1142736861?mt=2">SUBSCRIBE and REVIEW our show on Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5wH1Xg5QIVxqNYMFo7oYpp">FOLLOW on Spotify</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/artcuriouspod?lang=en">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/artcuriouspod/">Instagram</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/artcuriouspod">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://firesidechat.com/jenniferdasal">Fireside</a></p><p>Don’t forget to show your support for our show by purchasing <a href="https://www.teepublic.com/stores/artcurious-podcast?ref_id=19823"><em>ArtCurious </em>swag from TeePublic!</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>SPONSORS:</strong></p><p><a href="https://cms.megaphone.fm/organizations/eca2bba6-5eac-11e8-b750-a344e2023286/podcasts/fcaca72a-b9e9-11e9-9514-ab8fd258a7a5/episodes/891cf93a-0b82-11ec-a5ab-0f7d0ac93ba0/homedics.com/art">Ho</a><a href="https://homedics.com/art">Me</a><a href="https://cms.megaphone.fm/organizations/eca2bba6-5eac-11e8-b750-a344e2023286/podcasts/fcaca72a-b9e9-11e9-9514-ab8fd258a7a5/episodes/891cf93a-0b82-11ec-a5ab-0f7d0ac93ba0/homedics.com/art">dics</a>: receive a<strong> </strong>FREE PORTABLE PHONE SANITIZER<strong> </strong>when you buy $100 or more in massage products</p><p><a href="https://tischpro.smashcut.com/artcurious">NYU Tisch Pro/Online</a>: Register for spring 2022 film-making and screenwriting courses online with NYU’s Tisch Pro online</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Want to advertise/sponsor our show?</em></strong></p><p><em>We have partnered with AdvertiseCast to handle our advertising/sponsorship requests.

      <title>Episode #89: Art Fact and Fiction: The Problem of Michelangelo's Women (S10E06)</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/89</link>
      <description>In our tenth season, we’re going at art history with a  skeptical eye and a myth-busting attitude to uncover the fictions and facts about some of our favorite artists. We’re circling back to one of our earliest episodes, which we’ve updated and re-recorded, to discuss this controversial subject:  was Michelangelo a bad artist, unable to properly depict the female body?

      <title>BONUS: "Curious Talk" with Jennifer and Josh Dasal</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/curioustalk2021</link>
      <description>Wow, we haven’t done one of these in a while… Welcome to  a session of “Curious Talk,” a bonus episode recording between ArtCurious host Jennifer Dasal and her fellow podcaster/producer husband, Josh Dasal (Subgenre). It’s a chance to get a deep dive on the many goings-on, behind the scenes, with both ArtCurious and Jennifer. Topics include: Jennifer’s big career pivot; how the show comes together; some hints about upcoming episodes; traveling with Jennifer; and how podcasts sustain themselves financially. Come for the chatter, stay for the questions about… dinner? (And hopefully we’ll do these discussions more than once every three or four years.)

      <title>Live on Fireside: Thomas Negovan's Le Pater: Alphonse Mucha's Symbolist Masterpiece and the Lineage of Mysticism </title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/fireside2</link>
      <description>Did you miss our LIVE bonus show on Fireside, the interactive storytelling platform? Don’t worry— you can catch the replay on Fireside, or enjoy the bonus audio here. On our Oct. 25 live event, I had the great pleasure of speaking with author, artist, and musician Thomas Negovan about his new book, Le Pater: Alphonse Mucha's Symbolist Masterpiece and the Lineage of Mysticism. This gorgeous, swoon-worthy coffee table book uncovers the often-overlooked metaphysical elements of Mucha's Le Pater series and also delves into themes of the Divine Feminine and Mucha's own metaphysical practices.
Want to join in on the fun next time? Join Fireside now and follow me for invites to each live recording, where you can participate in the audience and ask questions live! And who knows? Maybe we’ll even throw a trivia contest every now and again. More Fireside chats are coming up this month and next. Watch our social media posts for further details.

      <title>Live on Fireside: Molly Peacock's "Flower Diary"</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/fireside1</link>
      <description>Did you miss our LIVE bonus show on Fireside, the interactive storytelling platform? Don’t worry— you can catch the replay on Fireside, or enjoy the bonus audio here. On our Oct. 11 live event, I had the great pleasure of speaking with author and poet Mary Peacock about her new book, Flower Diary--and what a delight she—and this book— are!

      <title>CURIOUS CALLBACK: Episode #17: The Casino of the Spirits </title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/ccvenice2021</link>
      <description>Venice-- it's the most serene and beautiful city in Italy, and possibly the whole world. But Venice at night-- all darkened and quiet-- takes up the most space in my imagination. I seriously love the depictions of Venice as enigmatic, shadowy, and even dangerous. All of this lends Venice this air of inscrutability and mystery. And over time, locals and visitors alike have reveled in this sensation as fodder for myth-making and storytelling. Some stories really stick, lasting for centuries and becoming embedded into the city itself, through its buildings, monuments, and specific locations. And there’s one building that has had plenty of legends built around it. This particular elegant structure had an illustrious past, having once been a meeting place where Italian Renaissance artists discussed their craft, caroused, and gambled. But it’s also the location where relationships soured, crimes were committed, and death inevitably followed. Today, some people won’t even enter this particular building because it is feared to be haunted, cursed… or both.
Today we're calling back to an episode of the first season of ArtCurious to talk about another potentially cursed locale in Venice, Italy: the so-called Casino of the Spirits.

      <title>A Little Curious #10: Are You A Little Curious... About "Breaking Barriers?"</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/alc10</link>
      <description>Are you a little curious about my audio course, “Breaking Barriers: Women Artists of Renaissance Europe”? You’re in luck! Here’s a little update and sneak-peek for those of you who want to know more— and a big thank you to those already registered!
About Breaking Barriers: This is a 21-day course, broken up into daily episodes that are no longer than 10-15 minutes. And naturally, there are no pesky term papers or final exams to worry about-- just cool art history content that you won’t find anywhere else. 
I’ve no doubt that the names Michelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and Leonardo already mean something major to you-- and not just as mutant reptiles with rad martial arts skills. You know these artists as some of the biggest names in Renaissance art who created some of the most iconic works of art of all time. Looking closer, though, and you’ll find another commonality: they are all male artists. What about the great female makers of the Renaissance -where, and who, are they? So I’ve created this 21-day course--and a course correction, really-- through Avid.FM, where you can explore the lives and works of 20 women artists, from the familiar (like the eye-opening stories Sofonisba Anguissola and Marietta Robusti), to the names you may have heard once or twice (like the highly-successful Levina Teerlinc and Properzia de’ Rossi), to the practically unknown-- who’s Anastasia, you may ask? 
Like the best episodes of ArtCurious, you’ll get the satisfaction of learning about the Renaissance in depth, and with a greater capacity for understanding the limits and barriers to women seeking to work professionally in one of the most colorful eras of western history. You’ll become familiar with artists you’ve probably never heard of, all of whom made an incredible mark on art history. 
Are you in? Sign up right now for “Breaking Barriers: Women Artists of Renaissance Europe” at avid.fm/jennifer for the low price of just $21.99.

      <title>Surprise! Join Our Audio Course!</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/bonusbb</link>
      <description>Today we’re thrilled to announce that I’ve created an audio course for those looking to explore the world of Renaissance Europe through the eyes of the women artists who thrived there. This course is called “Breaking Barriers: Women Artists of Renaissance Europe,” a 21-day course, broken up into daily episodes that are no longer than 10 minutes. And naturally, there are no pesky term papers or final exams to worry about-- just cool art history content that you won’t find anywhere else. 
In this course, you'll get the satisfaction of learning about the Renaissance in-depth and with a greater capacity for understanding the limits and barriers to women seeking to work professionally in one of the most colorful eras of Western history. You'll become familiar with artists you've probably never heard of, all of whom made an incredible mark on art, but unlike traditional ArtCurious episodes, you'll be getting more content on a more frequent basis. In fact, you'll be getting an episode every day for three weeks. But just because you're getting a daily influx of information doesn't mean that it will be overwhelming because each episode will only be up to 10 minutes in length. You'll get to enjoy fun, information-packed audio that won't take a big bite out of your day. 
We need to confirm there’s enough interest before production of this fantastic course starts, so if you’re a fan of ArtCurious and want to do something to support, sign up right now for “Breaking Barriers: Women Artists of Renaissance Europe” at avid.fm/jennifer. Register by June 7 for a special early buy-in price of just $21.99– and if we get enough interest the course will be available soon.

In this course, you'll get the satisfaction of learning about the Renaissance in-depth and with a greater capacity for understanding the limits and barriers to women seeking to work professionally in one of the most colorful eras of Western history. You'll become familiar with artists you've probably never heard of, all of whom made an incredible mark on art, but unlike traditional ArtCurious episodes, you'll be getting more content on a more frequent basis. In fact, you'll be getting an episode every day for three weeks. But just because you're getting a daily influx of information doesn't mean that it will be overwhelming because each episode will only be up to 10 minutes in length. You'll get to enjoy fun, information-packed audio that won't take a big bite out of your day. 
We need to confirm there’s enough interest before production of this fantastic course starts, so if you’re a fan of ArtCurious and want to do something to support, sign up right now for “Breaking Barriers: Women Artists of Renaissance Europe” at avid.fm/jennifer. Register by June 7 for a special early buy-in price of just $21.99– and if we get enough interest the course will be available soon.

      <title>Curious Callback-- Episode #48: Shock Art: Eakins' The Gross Clinic (Season 5, Episode 2)</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/cc12021</link>
      <description>Works that we take for granted today as masterpieces, or as epitomes of the finest of fine art, could also have been considered ugly, of poor quality, or just bad when they were first made. With the passage of time comes a calm and an acceptance. But that doesn’t change the fact that there are many works peppered throughout art history that were straight-up shocking to the public when they were first presented decades, or even hundreds of years ago.
Today's work of "shock art:" Eakins’ The Gross Clinic.

      <title>Episode #68: The Coolest Artists You Don't Know: Katsushika Ōi (Season 7, Episode 8)</title>
      <link>https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/68</link>
      <description>For most Americans, there’s a list of arts that they might be able to rattle off if pressed to name them off the top of their heads. Picasso. Michelangelo. Leonardo da Vinci. Name recognition does go a long way, but such lists also highlight what many of us don’t know-- a huge treasure trove of talented artists from decades or centuries past that might not be household names, but still have created incredible additions to the story of art. It’s not a surprise that many of these individuals represent the more diverse side of things, too-- women, people of color, different spheres of the social or sexual spectrum.
This season on the ArtCurious podcast, we’re covering the coolest artists you don’t know. This week: Katsushika Ōi.

Name recognition does go a long way, but such lists also highlight what many of us don’t know-- a huge treasure trove of talented artists from decades or centuries past that might not be household names, but still have created incredible additions to the story of art. It’s not a surprise that many of these individuals represent the more diverse side of things, too-- women, people of color, different spheres of the social or sexual spectrum.
This season on the ArtCurious podcast, we’re covering the coolest artists you don’t know. This week: Henry Ossawa Tanner.

      <title>CURIOUS CALLBACK Episode #51: Shock Art: Gericault's The Raft of the Medusa (Season 5, Episode 5)</title>
      <link>http://www.artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/cc2020x3</link>
      <description>Works that we take for granted today as masterpieces, or as epitomes of the finest of fine art, could also have been considered ugly, of poor quality, or just bad when they were first made. With the passage of time comes a calm and an acceptance. But that doesn’t change the fact that there are many works peppered throughout art history that were straight-up shocking to the public when they were first presented decades, or even hundreds of years ago.
Today's work of "shock art:" Gericault’s The Raft of the Medusa.

      <title>Episode #53: Shock Art: Courbet's The Origin of the World (Season 5, Episode 7)</title>
      <description>Works that we take for granted today as masterpieces, or as epitomes of the finest of fine art, could also have been considered ugly, of poor quality, or just bad when they were first made. With the passage of time comes a calm and an acceptance. But that doesn’t change the fact that there are many works peppered throughout art history that were straight-up shocking to the public when they were first presented decades, or even hundreds of years ago.
Today's work of "shock art:" Courbet’s The Origin of the World.

      <title>BONUS EPISODE: Banksy's Exit Through the Gift Shop LIVE Q&amp;A at the Alamo Drafthouse </title>
      <description>BANKSY! Love him or loathe him, he’s a contemporary art dynamo, an icon of street art success. He’s also an enigma, a playful mystery. Last week-- on April 30, 2019-- I was asked to participate in a special screening of the 2010 Banksy documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop at the Alamo Drafthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina. Exit was part of Alamo’s Film Club series, curated by Jackson Cooper, and after the film I sat down with Jackson to record a special conversation/Q&amp;A about the film, Banksy, and the legacy of street art. Enjoy— and we’ll be back next week with an all-new episode of ArtCurious.
Just a note that there are some spoilers in terms of the fact that we talk about the documentary in general, as well as Banksy himself and the other artist profiled in the doc, a man called Mr. Brainwash.

      <itunes:summary>BANKSY! Love him or loathe him, he’s a contemporary art dynamo, an icon of street art success. He’s also an enigma, a playful mystery. Last week-- on April 30, 2019-- I was asked to participate in a special screening of the 2010 Banksy documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop at the Alamo Drafthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina. Exit was part of Alamo’s Film Club series, curated by Jackson Cooper, and after the film I sat down with Jackson to record a special conversation/Q&amp;A about the film, Banksy, and the legacy of street art. Enjoy— and we’ll be back next week with an all-new episode of ArtCurious.
Just a note that there are some spoilers in terms of the fact that we talk about the documentary in general, as well as Banksy himself and the other artist profiled in the doc, a man called Mr. Brainwash.

      <title>Episode #49: Shock Art: David's The Death of Marat (Season 5, Episode 3)</title>
      <description>Works that we take for granted today as masterpieces, or as epitomes of the finest of fine art, could also have been considered ugly, of poor quality, or just bad when they were first made. With the passage of time comes a calm and an acceptance. But that doesn’t change the fact that there are many works peppered throughout art history that were straight-up shocking to the public when they were first presented decades, or even hundreds of years ago.
Today's work of "shock art:" David's The Death of Marat.

      <title>CURIOUS CALLBACK: Episode #2: Was Van Gogh Accidentally Murdered? (PART TWO)</title>
      <description>This is a rebroadcast of our first episode, which originally aired on August 29, 2016. We’ve updated it with new details, music, and our beloved ArtCurious theme— and, per your suggestion, we have split it into two parts for easier listening. If you haven't listened to part one, please go back and do so. Enjoy!

Vincent Van Gogh's suicide is a huge part of the mythology surrounding him: as much as the famous tale of the cut-off ear is. This so-called "tortured genius," it is said, was so broken down by life and failure that he had no choice but to end his life. Right? But in 2011, two Pulitzer Prize-winning authors published a book titled Van Gogh: The Life that stunned the art world. Therein, Gregory White Smith and Stephen Naifeh state that the artist didn't actually commit suicide.
No, they say: he was actually murdered.

      <title>CURIOUS CALLBACK: Episode #2: Was Van Gogh Accidentally Murdered? (PART ONE)</title>
      <description>This is a rebroadcast of our first episode, which originally aired on August 29, 2016. We’ve updated it with new details, music, and our beloved ArtCurious theme— and, per your suggestion, we have split it into two parts for easier listening. Enjoy!

Vincent Van Gogh's suicide is a huge part of the mythology surrounding him: as much as the famous tale of the cut-off ear is. This so-called "tortured genius," it is said, was so broken down by life and failure that he had no choice but to end his life. Right? But in 2011, two Pulitzer Prize-winning authors published a book titled Van Gogh: The Life that stunned the art world. Therein, Gregory White Smith and Stephen Naifeh state that the artist didn't actually commit suicide.
No, they say: he was actually murdered.

      <title>CURIOUS CALLBACK: Episode #1: Is the Mona Lisa a Fake? (UPDATED Season 1, Episode 1) PART TWO</title>
      <description>This is a rebroadcast of our first episode, which originally aired on August 10, 2016. We’ve updated it with new details, music, and our beloved ArtCurious theme— and, per your suggestion, we have split it into two parts for easier listening. If you haven’t already listened to part one, please go back and do so. Enjoy!

The inaugural episode of the ArtCurious Podcast explores the world's most famous work of art: Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. It is iconic, incredible, and unforgettable-- but is the work on view in Paris's Louvre Museum today the real deal? Host Jennifer Dasal uncovers the story of the Mona Lisa from its creation in the 16th century through its 1911 theft and to its current status as untouchable superstar, breaking down the strange stories and rumors swirling around it.

      <title>Episode #46: Shock Art: Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (Season 4, Episode 7)</title>
      <description>Works that we take for granted today as masterpieces, or as epitomes of the finest of fine art, could also have been considered ugly, of poor quality, or just bad when they were first made. With the passage of time comes a calm and an acceptance. But that doesn’t change the fact that there are many works peppered throughout art history that were straight-up shocking to the public when they were first presented decades, or even hundreds of years ago.
Today's work of "shock art:" Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.

      <title>Episode #45: Shock Art: Michelangelo's The Last Judgment (Season 4, Episode 6)</title>
      <description>Works that we take for granted today as masterpieces, or as epitomes of the finest of fine art, could also have been considered ugly, of poor quality, or just bad when they were first made. With the passage of time comes a calm and an acceptance. But that doesn’t change the fact that there are many works peppered throughout art history that were straight-up shocking to the public when they were first presented decades, or even hundreds of years ago.
Today's work of "shock art:" Michelangelo's The Last Judgment.

      <itunes:summary>Works that we take for granted today as masterpieces, or as epitomes of the finest of fine art, could also have been considered ugly, of poor quality, or just bad when they were first made. With the passage of time comes a calm and an acceptance. But that doesn’t change the fact that there are many works peppered throughout art history that were straight-up shocking to the public when they were first presented decades, or even hundreds of years ago.
Today's work of "shock art:" Gentileschi's Judith Slaying Holofernes.

      <title>Episode #39: Rivals- Picasso vs. Matisse (Season 3, Episode 8)</title>
      <description>This episode receives additional support from Reynolda House Museum of American Art, where you can find one of the nation's most highly regarded collections of American art on view in a unique domestic setting - the restored 1917 mansion of R. J. and Katharine Reynolds surrounded by beautiful gardens and peaceful walking trails. You can browse Reynolda's art and decorative arts collections and see what's coming next at their website,  reynoldahouse.org. 

The beginning of the Twentieth Century was a glittering time of hope and innovation. It was one of the golden ages of art, particularly in Paris, the glamorous capital of all things cultural, where writers such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein hobnobbed and debated ideas with painters like Salvador Dali, Georges Braque and many others who filled the bars, cafes, and salons, working and discussing politics and their idyllic fantasies about what art could be. Thinking and dreaming BIG was the norm-- and collaboration and sharing in each others’ concepts and victories was, too. But there was a shadowy side to such sharing, where friendships and support could morph into jealousy and competitiveness, as the drive to become the best took ultimate control. It is within this sparkling Parisian backdrop that what is possibly the greatest rivalry of art history played out-- what IS modern art, and what should it be?

There’s an old quote that I’m sure you’ve heard referenced in a million sitcoms or Looney Tunes cartoons- though it actually stems from a 1932 western-- where one character, all flinty-eyed, turns to another, and declares, “This town ain’t big enough for the both of us.” It’s an order meant to scare someone away, but it’s also a declaration of the feelings of rivalry, of jealousy, as if it shouldn’t be allowed that two people of similar stature could be functioning-- or even flourishing-- in the same place and time. After all, you couldn’t possibly have two star quarterbacks on the team, or two top valedictorians. Someone always has to be the best, or even more importantly, to be seen by the public as the best.  But was this true in the case of the two top female painters in Revolutionary-era France?

Anyone familiar with Abstract Expressionism will tell you that this art movement was one where all the insiders or practitioners were more closely involved than many other art movements.  Such close confines also made for some serious rivalries, too. But there were other artists who were more intimately involved with one another and their artistic process-- they were married, or were lovers. Such is the case with both Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning --both of whom married women who were incredible artists in their own right. Interestingly, and sadly, when these two spouses are mentioned, it’s very rare that we are treated to sincere commentary just about their works of art. More often than not, we are, instead, given explanations of how these women measure up to their (admittedly more famous) husbands, and are relegated either to a supporting role, or just plain seen as not good enough in comparison. Why is it that such talented women continue to have their posthumous careers and stories marked and shaped by their husbands?

This episode receives additional support from Reynolda House Museum of American Art, where you can find one of the nation's most highly regarded collections of American art on view in a unique domestic setting - the restored 1917 mansion of R. J. and Katharine Reynolds surrounded by beautiful gardens and peaceful walking trails. You can browse Reynolda's art and decorative arts collections and see what's coming next at their website,  reynoldahouse.org.

The art world is a man’s world- or, at least, it used to be entirely one. This shouldn’t be surprising to anyone who is a longtime listener of the ArtCurious Podcast, because we’ve touched multiple times on the difficulties that have faced women who have sought careers as artists.  Now, thankfully, in the age of #metoo, the male-heaviness of the art world is changing a bit, as it is in other facets of society. But turning back the clock to any other era in history, and the reality is that it was totally a man’s game. And the absolute manliness of it all was compounded intensely in one particular time and place: post-war America, where it was all about brusque machismo, the biggest innovations, and the biggest splash. It was a measuring contest like none other, and two larger-than-life characters were at the center of it all.

      <title>Episode #33: Rivals- Raphael vs. Michelangelo (Season 3, Episode 2)</title>
      <description>One pair of incredible Renaissance artists experienced a particularly epic rivalry. Both were vying for the same patrons, and their professional contempt very quickly got ultra-personal. Today, explore the intense conflict between Michelangelo and Raphael, both seeking approval and projects from one of the most innovative patrons: Pope Julius II.

      <title>Episode #31: Season Finale, Art and WWII- The Long Shadow (Season 2, Episode 11)</title>
      <description>World War Two was the bloodiest, biggest, and most destructive war of all time, decimating entire countries and taking the lives of millions. And as we have learned over the last 10 episodes of the ArtCurious Podcast this season, art was affected in many different ways due to the impact of the war. Art was used to document the experience of soldiers in battle; created to shape public opinion, values, and inspire the war effort; and to fight the enemy. It was a failed dream of Adolf Hitler, leading us to ask

We think of The Diary of Anne Frank or Elie Wiesel’s Night first and foremost when we think of how war has been creatively represented by those who survived it-- or didn’t survive it.

      <description>Ah, Hollywood. Nothing goes further than a big celebrity-studded movie to grab your pop-culture attention and to inspire countless articles and think-pieces about a particular topic. A really solid blockbuster can raise a niche book to bestseller status or inspire hopeful imitators. And it can lead to a renewed interest in a certain time period or subject matter. In the case of the 2014 film, The Monuments Men, all of this was certainly true. With superstar George Clooney directing and acting alongside Matt

      <description>This episode is sponsored by Audible: get a free audiobook download and a free 30-day trial here. Thank you for supporting our show!

This is a rebroadcast of our eighth episode, which originally aired on November 4, 2016.  It's a fan favorite, and it ties in rather nicely to the theme of our current season! Even if you've listened to this episode before, you're not going to want to miss this, as it updates our show based on new information.

One of the most awe-inspiring sights in and around St. Petersburg, Russia, is the Catherine Palace, a rococo summer residence for the imperial family of yore. Up until World War II, The Catherine Palace housed something so incredible, so coveted, and so gorgeous that for hundreds of years, travelers fro all over the world flocked to admire it, referred to as the "Eighth Wonder of the World." And then, in the early 1940s with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, this priceless creation was stolen. And to this day, it has still never been found.

      <description>This is a rebroadcast of our fifth episode, which was originally released on October 13, 2016. Death has always been a part of art history. And so much of the great art that we know and love today works in the capacity to stave off one of the terrible side effects of death-- being forgotten. Andy Warhol’s series, Death and Disaster, is one of the most well-known and polarizing of his career. But Warhol wasn't the first artist to focus on the everyday tragedy of death as a subject to quite this revealing

      <description>This is a rebroadcast of our third episode, which was originally released on September 12, 2016. Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, had an image problem: she was seen as frivolous, silly, and out-of-touch. In order to combat her poor press, the royal court commissioned a series of portraits of the queen to make her more relatable and sympathetic. Such images act as excellent propaganda machines, giving Marie Antoinette a much-needed positive spin. But what is even more marvelous is the backstory of the ar

      <title>Episode #20: Sofonisba Anguissola: Great (Woman) Artist (Season 1, Episode 20)</title>
      <description>Earlier this spring, I saw a hashtag making the rounds online, especially on Twitter and Instagram. Half the time, I only just vaguely pay attention to the trending terms on social media, but this one hit me right away. For a lot of people, including myself, it was like seeing an old beloved friend again- because this isn’t a new hashtag. It’s over a year old and was initiated originally by the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with Women’s History Month, celebrated every year in March.  It read #5WomenArtists and was meant as a kind of dare. As the museum’s digital editorial assistant, Emily Haight, posted on their blog, “Ask someone to name five artists and responses will likely include names such as Warhol, Picasso, van Gogh, Monet, da Vinci—all male artists. Ask someone to name five women artists, and the question poses more of a challenge.”
It’s a sad, but true, statement. Can many of us--especially those without in-depth artistic training or interest-- really name five or more women artists? Maybe, if you’re lucky, you can remember Frida Kahlo or Georgia O’Keeffe. And bonus points if you can recall our previous discussion on Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun. But especially in terms of artists who were around prior to the 20th century, the game grows much harder.
Why? What’s the problem of the woman artist? And how can we fix it?  Today, we’re talking about women artists-- the historical difficulties in becoming an artist, the challenges present therein, and the limitations and legacies of one very important Renaissance painter.
Today’s special episode of ArtCurious is the end result of a collaboration with art historian Ellen Oreddson and her excellent blog, How to Talk About Art History. Ellen has her own contribution to this topic on her site, where she lists five artists, inspired by the five women artists hashtag, and briefly discusses why each has been left out of the traditional art historical canon. Don't miss this insightful and fascinating post!

      <title>Episode #19: Conservation and Controversy (Season 1, Episode 19)</title>
      <description>Conservators are art heroes: they transform damaged or dirty works of art into beautiful, fresh works for public consumption. Then why is it that conservation has been at the center of some of the biggest art historical controversies of the last fifty years? What does a conservator really do, and what happens when conservation goes too far?

      <itunes:summary>Conservators are art heroes: they transform damaged or dirty works of art into beautiful, fresh works for public consumption. Then why is it that conservation has been at the center of some of the biggest art historical controversies of the last fifty years?

      <title>Episode #18: Diagnosis: Art History (Season 1, Episode 18)</title>
      <description>Over the centuries, there have been numerous examples of fine artists creating works of art that deliberately work with and within contemporaneous medical thought, portraying people with particular ailments or diseases. But what about if we turn that concept around a little bit? What happens when those in the medical field turn to paintings or sculptures from the past and retroactively investigate the health of the individuals depicted therein? What happens when art history turns into a diagnosis?

      <title>Episode #17: The Casino of the Spirits (Season 1, Episode 17)</title>
      <description>Venice-- it's the most serene and beautiful city in Italy, and possibly the whole world. But Venice at night-- all darkened and quiet-- takes up the most space in my imagination. I seriously love the depictions of Venice as enigmatic, shadowy, and even dangerous. Without cars or streetlights or other modern comforts, you might feel like you’ve stepped back in time and that around any given corner, you could find… anything. All of this lends Venice this air of inscrutability and mystery. And over time, locals and visitors alike have reveled in this sensation as fodder for myth-making and storytelling. Some stories really stick, lasting for centuries and becoming embedded into the city itself, through its buildings, monuments, and specific locations. And there’s one building that has had plenty of legends built around it. This particular elegant structure had an illustrious past, having once been a meeting place where Italian Renaissance artists discussed their craft, caroused, and gambled. But it’s also the location where relationships soured, crimes were committed, and death inevitably followed. Today, some people won’t even enter this particular building because it is feared to be haunted, cursed… or both.

      <title>Episode #16: The Muse (Season 1, Episode 16)</title>
      <description>Sometimes when I am looking at a particularly fascinating work of art, I find myself overwhelmed with awe-- for the creative act itself and the technical prowess that was needed to bring it to fruition. I’ve often had those moments where I have thought to myself, “Wow. How did this all come about? What is the inspiration behind this piece?” And any conversation about inspiration in the arts inevitably brings up a discussion about muses. This episode looks at the relationship--and occasional romance-- between artists and their muses, with a particular emphasis on one woman whose connection to two brothers illustrates this exchange in a compelling way.

      <title>Episode #15: Hans-Joachim Bohlmann and Serial Art Vandalism (Season 1, Episode 15)</title>
      <description>A few months ago, I began looking into occurrences of art vandalism-- the purposeful destruction or harm of works of art that have occurred consistently, especially throughout the 20th century. As I read up, I saw that most of these events were one-offs: single moments where one person made a rash and ridiculous choice to lash out at a particular work of art. But then, I began to notice one name popping up over and over again- a German man who, over his lifetime, damaged over fifty works of art, creating a name for himself and a lasting impression on the art world. This episode, in a continuation of our Bigger Picture series, digs deeper into art attacks and examine the life and legacy of the vandal Hans-Joachim Bohlmann.

      <title>Episode #14: Samuel F. B. Morse's Gallery of the Louvre (Season 1, Episode 14)</title>
      <description>How many know that the inventor of the telegraph and co-creator of Morse code--Samuel F. B. Morse-- was a successful artist, too? And crazily enough, one of his paintings in particular, foreshadowed his interest in communication tools, providing the impetus for revolutionizing communication--and, indeed, the world as we know it. Listen in for details on Morse's masterpiece, Gallery of the Louvre.

      <title>Episode #13: Diego and Frida, Part 2 (Season 1, Episode 13)</title>
      <description>Glamour. Curiosity. Excitement. A love story for the ages. Such are the types of descriptors that you hear when you ponder the life and love of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Truly, in the pantheon of great artistic relationships, they are one of the top couples out there. And they had the great fortune, or whatever you want to call it, of living their exciting lives in front of the camera, as well as on canvas. Google them, and all kinds of lovey-dovey images come up-- images of Diego nuzzling Frida, images of them kissing, of her embracing him around his wide middle section. But what some people neglect, or possibly even forget, is that their relationship was by no means perfect. There were great ups, of course, but the downs? Incredible. Even Diego Rivera himself was aware of this fact, later writing, quote, “If I ever loved a woman, the more I loved her, the more I wanted to hurt her. Frida was the most obvious victim of this disgusting trait.” Harsh words. But would they always be that way?

      <title>Episode #12: Diego and Frida, Part 1 (Season 1, Episode 12)</title>
      <description>There’s something a little strange about the pairing of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Certainly it’s the surprise of a pairing of seeming opposites, at least from a physical standpoint-- she the small, seductive, and somewhat frail painter whose subject matter referred to the most intimate sides of her own life; he, the large and somewhat brutish muralist whose large-scale works touched upon revolution and justice and larger issues of Mexican history. There’s almost a Beauty and the Beast quality there, and for many of us, the relationship between these two artists is just as intriguing as their creative output. And especially when it comes to Frida’s art, it’s very hard to separate their love from their artistic legacy. But how did it begin? And what is it about these two that makes them so fascinating, even 60 years later?

        <![CDATA[<p>There’s something a little strange about the pairing of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Certainly it’s the surprise of a pairing of seeming opposites, at least from a physical standpoint-- she the small, seductive, and somewhat frail painter whose subject matter referred to the most intimate sides of her own life; he, the large and somewhat brutish muralist whose large-scale works touched upon revolution and justice and larger issues of Mexican history. There’s almost a Beauty and the Beast quality there, and for many of us, the relationship between these two artists is just as intriguing as their creative output. And especially when it comes to Frida’s art, it’s very hard to separate their love from their artistic legacy. But how did it begin? And what is it about these two that makes them so fascinating, even 60 years later?</p><p>//SUBSCRIBE and review us on iTunes <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/artcurious-podcast/id1142736861">HERE</a>! </p><p> And follow us on Twitter and on Instagram for more artsy goodness:</p><p>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/artcuriouspod/">https://www.instagram.com/artcuriouspod/</a>                                                            Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/artcuriouspod">https://twitter.com/artcuriouspod</p><p></a></p><p>Looking for a transcription of this episode? <a href="http://www.artcuriouspodcast.com/episode-transcripts/2017/8/1/transcript-artcurious-episode-12">Check it out here</a>. <em>Not to be used for distribution or any other purpose without permission. </p><p></em></p><p>Want even MORE information?

      <title>Episode #11: Art Attack! (Season 1, Episode 11)</title>
      <description>Throughout art history, there have been multiple occasions where people have entered into a museum or gallery with the explicit intention of harming or outright destroying a work of art. And some of the most iconic and greatest works of art in the world have been the targets of these disastrous missions. The big question, though, is why? What motivates people into a full blown art-attack?

      <title>Episode #10: When Statues Cry (Season 1, Episode 10)</title>
      <description>Nearly ten years ago, my then-boyfriend, now husband, and I were backpacking through the Balkans region of Europe. After arriving in Bosnia, we opted to take a day trip to a small town called Medjugorje, in Herzegovina. We had heard that it was a popular place with tourists from all over the world, and we were eager to check it out. But what we didn't quite expect were the reasons why the town was so well-known. And the reasons are twofold: first, it was the location of a sighting in 1981 of the Virgin Mary, who was said to have appeared to a group of teenagers there. As such, the town became a holy pilgrimage site, particularly for Catholics around the world. Even though the vision of the Virgin hasn't been promoted or officially accepted by the Vatican, it hasn't stopped the flow of visitors clamoring for the chance to visit this seemingly holy place. In remembrance of the miraculous vision, a beautiful church was erected. And in the church’s garden, a bronze statue of the risen Christ was also placed.   But here's the further reason for the pilgrimage- since 2000, that statue has had a so-called weeping knee- miraculously producing a clear fluid each and every day for the last 16 years.
We saw this statue with our own eyes. We touched it, and we watched as dozens of people collected the clear fluid- not water, not oil, but something else- into souvenir bottles that were sold all over the town. Still, I didn't know what to think, or how to react. Was this statue for real? I think that belief and faith are beautiful, incredible things. But I also felt skeptical, too. I found myself torn in the middle- religious yet unbelieving, living in a gray area. But like Fox Mulder, I want to believe.
In honor of the holiday season, we are going to look into the phenomenon of the miraculous in art, focusing on weeping statues and bleeding icons.

      <title>Episode #9: The CIA/AbEx Connection (Season 1, Episode 9)</title>
      <description>If there is one thing that’s true in this world, it’s that there sure isn't a lack of conspiracy theories out there. Think about it: almost every big mystery or question has a slough of alternative explanations involving everything from Big Brother to the Illuminati to the Masons...and of course we can’t overlook aliens. Oswald wasn’t the lone gunman; the Apollo moon landing never happened and was filmed instead on a Hollywood sound stage; the government is hiding proof of alien life; the Mona Lisa on view at the Louvre is a fake.  Every day we might hear a new, wacky  theory, even in the art world, like how the CIA funneled money into the arts, towards revolutionary painters like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, in order to fight the Cold War. Crazy, right? I mean, what a bizarre way to attempt to covertly bring down the Russians?
Except that this last one isn't a crazy conspiracy theory at all. It’s actually a true story of propaganda, secrets, lies, and fine art. The pen is mightier than the sword, the saying goes. Well, it turns out that the same could be said about the paintbrush.

      <title>Episode #8: What Happened to the Amber Room? (Season 1, Episode 8)</title>
      <description>One of the most awe-inspiring sights in and around St. Petersburg, Russia, is the Catherine Palace, a rococo summer residence for the imperial family of yore. Up until World War II, The Catherine Palace housed something so incredible, so coveted, and so gorgeous that for hundreds of years, travelers fro all over the world flocked to admire it, referred to as the "Eighth Wonder of the World." And then, in the early 1940s with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, this priceless creation was stolen. And to this day, it has still never been found.

      <title>Episode #7: Was Walter Sickert Actually Jack the Ripper? PART TWO (Season 1, Episode 7)</title>
      <description>Back in 2002, I was browsing a new releases table at my local bookstore when a particular book caught my eye. It seemed like yet another crime novel, one among hundreds. And so, I moved on, until I saw the subtitle of the book: Jack the Ripper: Case Closed. In it, the author released a bombshell statement: she had purportedly solved the mystery of Jack the Ripper's identity, which had evaded researchers, historians, and police for over one hundred years. 
Jack the Ripper, she said, was the English painter Walter Sickert. 
If you are just tuning in to the ArtCurious Podcast for the first time, please stop and listen to Episode #6 to get the backstory on Jack the Ripper's crimes.

      <title>Episode #6: Was Walter Sickert Actually Jack the Ripper? PART ONE (Season 1, Episode 6)</title>
      <description>Much was made of crime in Victorian London. The Victorians were terrified of the lower-classes, particularly down-and-out men living in the crowded outskirts of the city who, they thought, were lurking in the shadows, just waiting for the opportunity to arise for a well-timed theft, brawl, or even worse. Life, for most, was hard. But in 1888, Londoners clamoring for a bit of excitement to spice up the drudgery of their lives got far more than they bargained for. They got weeks of abject terror surrounding a madman who slaughtered women in London's East End... who was never identified or caught. And more than 100 years later, we are still no closer to really identifying one of the most terrible killers of all time. 
Or are we?
In this first half of our special two-part Halloween episode, we are going to delve into a theory that identifies Jack the Ripper as the English painter Walter Sickert. And come back next week to hear the second half of our show and see images of Sickert's work.

      <title>Episode #5: Death and Disaster, Warhol and Weegee (Season 1, Episode 5)</title>
      <description>Andy Warhol's take on mortality wasn't about memorializing. He instead focused on the direct causes of death, or the aftermath of a terrible accident. His series, Death and Disaster, is one of the most well-known and polarizing of his career. But Warhol wasn't the first artist to focus on the everyday tragedy of death as a subject to quite this revealing and exploitative extend. That honor might very well belong to someone else: an immigrant photographer working in Manhattan in the 1930s and 1940s.

      <itunes:summary>Andy Warhol's take on mortality wasn't about memorializing. He instead focused on the direct causes of death, or the aftermath of a terrible accident. His series, Death and Disaster, is one of the most well-known and polarizing of his career. But Warhol wasn't the first artist to focus on the everyday tragedy of death as a subject to quite this revealing and exploitative extend. That honor might very well belong to someone else: an immigrant photographer working in Manhattan in the 1930s and 1940s.

      <title>Episode #4: The Problem of Michelangelo's Women (Season 1, Episode 4)</title>
      <description>There are lots of questions that come up in every art history classroom. We hear them over and over again. What is art, really, and how can you define it? Why is the Mona Lisa smiling? What happened to the Winged Victory's arms? And then there's one that you'll hear, or that you'll even think yourself, especially if you are a fan or scholar of Renaissance art.  Why, people ask. Why are Michelangelo's women so... un-womanly?

      <title>Episode #3: The Semi-Charmed Life of Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun (Season 1, Episode 3)</title>
      <description>Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, had an image problem: she was seen as frivolous, silly, and out-of-touch. In order to combat her poor press, the royal court commissioned a series of portraits of the queen to make her more relatable and sympathetic. Such images act as excellent propaganda machines, giving Marie Antoinette a much-needed positive spin. But what is even more marvelous is the backstory of the artist who created these portraits-- because the painter who was chosen to portray the highest woman in the land was… another woman.
Talk about a revolution. 
In the third episode of the ArtCurious Podcast, we'll look at the lucky and semi-charmed life of Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun, one of the most popular painters of 18th-century France and the official court painter of Marie Antoinette.

      <title>Episode #2: Was Van Gogh Accidentally Murdered? (Season 1, Episode 2)</title>
      <description>Vincent Van Gogh's suicide is a huge part of the mythology surrounding him: as much as the famous tale of the cut-off ear is. This so-called "tortured genius," it is said, was so broken down by life and failure that he had no choice but to end his life. Right? But in 2011, two Pulitzer Prize-winning authors published a book titled Van Gogh: The Life that stunned the art world. Therein, Gregory White Smith and Stephen Naifeh state that the artist didn't actually commit suicide.
No, they say: he was actually murdered.
