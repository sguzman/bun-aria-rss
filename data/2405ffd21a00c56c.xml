      <title>How to Restore Your Metabolism (Ft. Kori Meloy and Fallon Danae)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>With a society that’s obsessed with diet culture, even “healing” diets like Whole 30, Paleo, and Keto, we often love having easy-to-follow lists that tell us exactly what to eat and not eat in order to be healthy.</p><p>But this has led to nutrition becoming overly black and white, with people often demonizing certain foods. Unfortunately, this way of thinking can lead to restrictive dieting, food fear, and even malnutrition and worsening health conditions.</p><p>So how do we nourish and heal our bodies without succumbing to restriction and fear? How can we enjoy food freedom while also fueling our body with the appropriate nutrients that will help us thrive?</p><p>That’s what Jordan explores in this episode with Kori Meloy and Fallon Danae as they discuss what it really looks like to nourish your body, restore your metabolism, and experience food freedom.</p><p>Tune in to this powerful episode to learn about:</p><ul><li>Kori and Fallon’s own healing journey through endometriosis, Hashimoto’s, and restrictive eating</li><li>The importance of nourishing your body to support your metabolism</li><li>What it looks like to fuel your body with biologically available and restorative foods</li><li>The harm of diet culture and following popular diets</li><li>How many calories we really need and why most women aren’t getting enough</li></ul><p>For more information, visit <a href="http://rewildculture.com">rewildculture.com</a> and <a href="http://fallonstable.com">fallonstable.com</a>.</p><p>Links from the episode:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.realmilk.com/about-us/wapf/">Westin A.

      <title>Why You Don&apos;t Have to Do It All Right Now (Ft. My Mom!)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever felt like there’s an underlying message in society that you have to find your passion, build a great career, be a rockstar, and manage to have a family all at the same time (and all by the time you’re 30)?</p>

<p>If that sounds familiar, then this episode is just what you need.</p>
<p>Jordan brings her mom, Linda Wawrzyniak, on to the show for a candid conversation about the pressure to do it all, learning to navigate life’s seasons, the importance of taking your time, and how to adjust in the midst of uncertainty or change.</p>
<p>So, stretch those fingers and hit that play button to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to navigate life’s seasons and the importance of taking your time</li>
<li>The difference between doing it well vs. doing it all</li>
<li>How complacency and contentment are different</li>
<li>Why some people adjust to change differently </li>
<li>The secret of making successful adjustments in life</li>
</ul>

      <title>High Standards vs. Unrealistic Expectations</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been told that your standards are “too high” or that you have unrealistic expectations?</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, sometimes it can be really difficult to tell the difference between having high standards (whether they’re for relationships, work, or even your health) and having unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>While high standards can be great to have, if they start to turn into unrealistic expectations, you could be setting yourself up for a lot of unnecessary stress and pressure.</p>
<p>But, the question is: how do you know if you’re setting high standards or clinging onto unrealistic expectations? And what can you do about it if you start to realize that you do have some unrealistic expectations? </p>
<p>In this episode of the SHE podcast, Jordan answers all of those questions as she explores how to have high standards (without expecting perfection or adding unnecessary stress to your life). </p>
<p>Grab those headphones and tune in to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>The difference between having high standards and unrealistic expectations</li>
<li>How unrealistic expectations can set you up for disappointment and unneeded stress</li>
<li>Examples of high standards and when they can turn into unrealistic expectations</li>
<li>How to identify when you’re starting to have unrealistic expectations</li>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sustainability sounds great in theory, but it can feel impossible to put into practice.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Trigger Warning: The beginning of this episode contains a depiction of sexual assault. To skip forward, go to 19:26.</em></p>
<p>Most of us would probably say we fit into one of two categories when it comes to safety. We either feel like a paranoid mess 99% of the time (planning fire escape plans and accidentally spraying your friends with pepper spray) or we don’t give safety much thought (what even is pepper spray?).</p>
<p>At times it feels like there’s no happy middle ground, so we either live with needless anxiety or dangerous ignorance.</p>
<p>In today’s episode, Jordan hears from Robyn Warner, a sexual assault survivor and mother of four who has taught self defense and safety to women and girls for the past 13 years. Her passion is to equip and empower women so that they can be confident and more aware, while not living overcome by fear.</p>
<p>So get ready, because whether you’re hyper vigilant or blissfully neglectful of your safety, it’s time to get more prepared, and less scared. Tune in to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why you’re not the exception when it comes to safety</li>
<li>How to live prepared without being paranoid</li>
<li>Tips to stay safe while dating</li>
<li>How to yell the correct way</li>
<li>Ways to increase your awareness to deter predators </li>
</ul>

      <title>Get Outside of Your Comfort Zone (Ft. Liz Warner)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Would you quit your job to run 30 Marathons, in 30 countries, before your 30th birthday all with the goal of raising money for organizations committed to empowering women?</p>
<p>Sounds like a pretty BIG step outside a comfort zone, huh?</p>
<p>Look, if 2020 has taught us ANYTHING, it's that we need to be willing to get outside of our comfort zone, learn, listen, and take steps to impact the world outside of our own personal bubble.</p>
<p>In this episode, Jordan talks with Liz Warner who did JUST that. Liz combined her passions of change-making and adventure and launched Run to Reach, an 18-month marathon fundraising campaign with the goal of running 30 marathons in 30 different countries before turning 30 in June of 2020 - aiming to raise $100,000 to support local, women-empowerment organizations in each country visited.</p>
<p>She ventured to far-reaching destinations, like through the central highlands of Afghanistan, across turquoise waters in Yemen, into the depths of small villages in Somalia, and up the rolling foothills of Mt. Everest.</p>
<p>Beyond the highlighted mission, her Run to Reach journey also tells the story of a woman who left a comfortable, yet unfulfilling job to embark on an adventure that would exhaust every ounce of her potential.</p>
<p>Through her stories, she's been intentional to not only give back but also use social media as a tool to expose people to cultures they may otherwise not be exposed to (Yemen, Afghanistan, etc.).</p>
<p>Tune in to learn how we can take first steps outside our comfort zone for the purpose of having a greater impact, and what that may look like in your life. </p>

      <title>Take Charge of Your Finances (Ft. Jessi Fearon)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Money woes can slow us down. If you don’t have clarity or plan when it comes to your finances, it’s common to feel stressed and overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The uncertainty coupled with the common, underlying need to “keep up with the Jones’” only makes matters worse.</p>
<p>But sometimes hearing how other people just like us have navigated getting out of debt and found financial freedom is the kick in the pants we need to pave our own way to total financial freedom.</p>
<p>On this episode of SHE, we’re diving into this with Debt-Free Living Enthusiast,<a href="http://instagram.com/jessifearon"> Jessi Fearon</a>, and tackling big important questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are some mindsets to adopt to help us stick to a plan to getting out of debt?</li>
<li>What are some practical steps we can take when we’re just getting started on our own journey to financial freedom?</li>
<li>When growing a family and paying off debt simultaneously, what is the hardest sacrifice and how can we get through it?</li>
<li>How can living debt-free change our spending habits long term?</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, Jessi serves up some great advice for those wanting to take ownership of their finances and attain a debt-free life but struggle with commitment.</p>
<p>Sister, there is no better time to take control of your finances than right now. When you know your numbers and have a plan to complete financial freedom, you won’t just feel confident – you’ll be empowered to make better decisions for your future, too.</p>

      <title>How to Pursue Your Dreams in the Middle of Motherhood (with Megan Duke)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Calling all mamas, soon-to-be mamas, and hopeful, someday mamas! This one’s for you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you have a little (or big) dream that’s either buried deep inside your heart or something you’re already trying to pursue, but feeling a little unsure of how to make it all work, it's common to feel overwhelmed, and even to put it off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Or if you know that someday you want to be a mom but have a big career dreams and worry about how you’re going to be able to manage it all, you’re not the only one, sister. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And sometimes simply hearing from someone who's taken the first step and learning to navigate the journey can be enough to light a fire under us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this episode, Jordan sits down with friend, music artist, and mom of 3, Megan Duke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Megan knows what it’s like to wear a lot of hats. Not only is she an amazing wife and mother of 3 littles but she’s also fearlessly and relentlessly pursuing her dream of being a music artist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This episode really digs into how a woman CAN steward her gifts and passions in the middle of motherhood. </p>
<ul>
<li>The compromises and sacrifices that are made</li>
<li>The day to day challenges that come with juggling it all really look like (and how to handle them well)</li>
<li>How to create boundaries to guard the health of both your family life and careeR</li>
<li>What it looks like to teach your kids to dream, too</li>
<li>How building a great marriage fits into this whole equation</li>
<li>3 practical steps for any woman who wants to get started on her dreams in a busy season, too  </li>
</ul>
<p> So, whether you’re looking ahead feeling a little afraid of motherhood because you’re a big dreamer with massive career ambitions, or are already a mom and feeling that tug on your heart to go for your dreams but can’t quite figure out how to do that… you’ll want to soak in all the wisdom Megan offers in this episode. It’s honest, deep, and practical all at once.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>But while the rest of the world is running around like their hair is on fire, selling out the toilet paper and Costco shelves, wondering how their bills or team is going to get paid, unsure of whether or not to launch what they had planned, and freeeeaking out on what to do next…</p>

      <title>How to Start Before You&apos;re Ready- with Jess Ekstrom</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>EVERY EXPERT WAS ONCE A BEGINNER. </p>
<p>Let that sink in. No, really, let it sink in until you believe it. </p>
<p>It is so essential to understand this one thing: NO ONE started out knowing what they were doing. No one who's built something successful began with a clue of what it would turn into. And no successful person has avoided embarrassing themselves or failure. </p>
<p>But the one key to success they all have in common?</p>
<p>They STARTED. They started small. They rolled up their sleeves and got scrappy. </p>
<p>They were willing to get uncomfortable and put themselves out there. </p>
<p>THIS willingness (not skill or fancy connections) is the one differentiating factor between those who reach their dreams and those who don't.</p>
<p>Tune into this episode to learn keys to starting before you're ready from the one and only Jess Ekstrom, founder of Headbands of Hope, and author of Chasing the Bright Side. </p>
<p>Headbands of Hope is a brand Jess started in college that has grown into a multi-million dollar company in just 7 years. In this conversation, Jess shared her biggest small business mistakes (like wiring $10,000 to a company she never heard back from) and scrappy steps she took to make her dream happen before she had the finances (like convincing Jimmy Johns to sponsor a product photo shoot), and so many more moments that will put you at ease, make you laugh, and give you the courage to stop worrying and just start where you are! </p>
<p>Ready to stop putting your dreams off for a tomorrow that isn't guaranteed? </p>

Tune in to learn the steps you need to take to get to a healthier place when you’re stressed, questions you need to ask before pursuing something new, ways to move the needle in the right direction, and how you can move 1% closer to your dream even if your schedule is already full.</p>

      <title>How to Love Your Single (or Dating) Life - with Stephanie May Wilson</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>With the holidays just around the corner, we know that the site of mistletoe or sound of a Christmas love song can be enough to make a single girl cringe. We get it. The cute, snuggly photos friends share with their boyfriends/husbands and engagement announcements all over Instagram are nice but when you feel like the one who's still not having the best time in the dating scene, it can be HARD to really be happy with where we're at. So, Jordan called in the expert. Literally. Stephanie May Wilson's mission is to help women thrive in their single and dating lives and in this episode, she unpacks a beautiful middle ground between two equally destructive perspectives we tend to swing between when it comes to singleness and marriage, how to invest in your single life, and even how to intentionally prepare to become the right person more than just looking for the right person. If you're needing a little insight on how to thrive in your single or dating life this holiday season, look no further than this episode right here. <br />Thank you to our sponsors, Mejuri, ZipRecruiter, and Boll & Branch. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Maybe you just moved to a new city for a job opportunity you’ve been waiting years for... but find that struggling in the whole <em>making friends</em> department. Creating like-minded community with a busy schedule, as a grown up, and in a new place or new season is HARD. Or maybe you’re a small business owner or work from home and tend to feel a little isolated, like you’re on an island and your friends don’t quite understand “what you do.” Networking with others in your industry and connecting with people who GET YOU can be equally as hard.    So, in this episode, Jordan unpacks several lessons she’s learned when it comes effectively cultivating friendships and a few key steps you can implement right away to start building new relationships effortlessly (instead of awkwardly).    Grab a copy of <em>Own Your Everyday</em> <a href="Jordanleedooley.com/book">here</a>!   Thank you to our sponsors:    <a href="Grove.co/SHE">Grove Collaborative</a>   <a href="modsy.com">Modsy</a>: Use code &quot;SHE&quot; for 20% off</p>

      <title>A Chapter From &quot;Own Your Everyday&quot; - Overcoming Impostor Syndrome</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes when you start small, or begin something new, you can feel a bit like an imposter or a fraud. Like, why should someone trust or like something that YOU have created? That feeling can seem so strong and real, it’ll leave you thinking you’re stuck in your circumstances or have made all the wrong decisions. Can you relate? Truth is: we’ve all felt this way- and it’s just as untrue and false for all of us. In this episode, listen in as Jordan walks through Chapter 4 of Own Your Everyday and drops some some truth bombs on how to eradicate these lies and step into your purpose. You’ll learn how to identify the reasons you’re holding yourself back (ahem - expectations), the tangible steps to take to break through the mindset limitations, and how to kick your fear of embarrassment. Sister, it’s time to start envisioning your life as a path to walk on - not a as box to sit in - because your purpose is way too important to settle for anything less. </p>  <p>Get the book here: <a href="https://jordanleedooley.com/book" target="_blank">jordanleedooley.com/book</a></p> <p>Book tour info: <a href="https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour" target="_blank">https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour</a></p>  <p>Say hi on social!</p> <p><a href="https://instagram.com/jordanleedooley" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jordanleedooley/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p>

      <title>Slow Down, Take the Pressure Off, and Embrace Your Faith</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you fear being misunderstood by others? That if you are vulnerable, you’ll lose your strength and ultimately become more lonely? In a #liveauthentic world, it’s tough to decipher what living vulnerably looks like and how to execute that in a healthy way. But sometimes, it’s the questions that you ask, rather than the answers you’re given, that open the door to your peace and steadfastness. In this episode, listen in as Jordan invites on music artist, Amanda Lindsey Cook, as they dive into how rhythms of rest can feel like a crash landing, why social media isn’t necessarily the problem (spoiler: it’s our unconscious behaviors that are), and how to come to a place where your faith isn’t fantasy. Sister, if you’re walking through a season of grief or frustration and you’re ready to put yourself at the mercy of love, peace, patience, and kindness – this episode is for you.

      <title>Financial Tips for the Girl Who Is Stressed About Money</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>How’s your relationship with your finances? Let’s be straight – money is a tough topic for most. And with good reason. If we aren’t careful, the fear of money (or lack thereof) can squeeze its way into the back of our mind and just sit as a nagging reminder. Enter: anxiety mode. But no longer, sister. Listen into this episode as Jordan dives into finance freedom by shifting your mindset from money is ‘bad’ and something to be feared - to stepping into viewing money as a tool to create your (and your family’s) foundation. In this episode, you’ll learn questions to ask before making a purchase, where to include purchase swaps, and the creative way Jordan made a little extra money in college. Insider secret? You can do it, too. With a little creativity and a lot of heart, you can find unique ways to bring in a side bit of cashola. If you’re feeling unsettled about your financial situation or simply desire to adopt a healthier financial mindset, this episode is for you. </p>  <p>Pre-order the book:<a href="jordanleedooley.com/book" target="_blank"> jordanleedooley.com/book</a></p> <p>Grab your preorder bonuses! <a href="jordanleedooley.com/oye-freebies" target="_blank">jordanleedooley.com/oye-freebies</a></p> <p>Book tour info: <a href="https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour" target="_blank">https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour</a></p>  <p>Say hi on social!</p> <p><a href="instagram.com/jordanleedooley" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jordanleedooley/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p>

      <title>How to Stay Determined on Your Dreams When You Don&apos;t Feel Good Enough</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>How would you respond if someone simply straight up told you, ‘You’re not good enough’? Is your initial reaction to hide with embarrassment? Or cry from hurt? Both would be completely valid from these hurtful words – as long as those words didn’t cause you to give up on yourself. If you’ve ever received destructive and damaging feedback on the journey to your dreams, and could use a bit of fierce determination and fiery passion, you’re in for a treat with this episode. Listen in as Jordan brings on Broadway singer, solo artist, and Taylor Swift back up vocalist, Kamilah Marshall, as she shares her story of hope deferred, overcoming limiting beliefs, and how she responded when she was told ‘you’re just not good enough.’ Kamilah has one amazing story of remaining on the path where her internal drive outweighs the fear of trying something new. If you’re ready to cultivate internal confidence before you receive outside affirmation, this episode is for you.</p>  <p>Learn more about Kamilah here:</p> <p><a href="https://kamilahmarshall.com" target="_blank">https://kamilahmarshall.com</a></p> <p>and</p> <p>IG <a href="instagram.com/gypsymoonshine" target="_blank">@gypsymoonshine</a></p>  <p> <p>Pre-order the book:<a href="jordanleedooley.com/book" target="_blank"> jordanleedooley.com/book</a></p> <p>Grab your preorder bonuses! <a href="jordanleedooley.com/oye-freebies" target="_blank">jordanleedooley.com/oye-freebies</a></p> <p>Book tour info: <a href="https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour" target="_blank">https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour</a></p>  <p>Say hi on social!</p> <p><a href="instagram.com/jordanleedooley" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jordanleedooley/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p></p>

      <title>How to Stop Fear from Stopping You with Jessica Honegger</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Does the fear of ‘no’ keep you from creating something new? Are you afraid you may waste time pursuing the wrong things if you really go for it? It can be scary to step into a new opportunity, especially when you feel your path isn’t very ‘linear.’ Wouldn’t it be easier if everything made sense from the beginning?! In this episode, Jordan brings on award-winning social entrepreneur, CEO of the fashion impact brand, Noonday Collection, and author of Imperfect Courage, Jessica Honegger, to remind us all of what it means to make steps forward even when the fear is still present – and even when we don’t have a clear picture of what’s next. You’ll learn the importance of deciding right now that your 'why' is worth the risk, why you need to define what your end goal of success looks like for you, and the Sisterhood Effect mindset you need to adapt ASAP. Sister, if you’ve ever found yourself frozen by fear or paralyzed by the unknown, pull up a seat and borrow some courage from Jessica and Jordan to step into that open door built just for you.</p>  <p><a href="https://instagram.com/jordanleedooley" target="_blank">@jordanleedooley</a></p> <p><a href="https://instagram.com/shepodcast" target="_blank">@shepodcast</a></p>  <p>Episode Details:</p>  <p>Jordan's Book: <a href="https://jordanleedooley.com/book" target="_blank">https://jordanleedooley.com/book</a></p>  <p>Jessica Honegger Link: <a href="https://jessicahonegger.com" target="_blank">https://jessicahonegger.com</a></p>

      <title>7 Tips to Stay Motivated and Follow Through When You Don&apos;t Feel Like It</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever feel that you just lack the ‘motivation’ to hit your goal that remains unaccomplished? Or that your actions don’t always align with the priorities in your life to help move you forward? Sister, it can be tough to stay on track and follow through on those not-so-easy to achieve milestones.

      <title>An Open Conversation on Stress, Anxiety, and Burnout with Kat Harris</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Fear and anxiety stink. While there are other ways to phrase that more eloquently- that pretty much sums it up. If this uninvited guest (ahem fear, worry, overwhelm) has been a part of your narrative, Jordan is here to share that you are not the only one. In this special episode, Jordan brings on friend, speaker, digital content creator, female empowerment advocate, and Co-Founder of The Refined Woman, Kat Harris, as they share their own stories and experiences with overworking themselves and complete burnout. Listen in to learn how the women tackle their fear narratives, tangible tips to keep your feet on the ground when anxiety hits, and boundaries to set in order to lead the joyful life you were created for. In the wise words of Kat, sometimes we don’t know the lies we are believing until we look at the results of our actions.

      <title>Un-Figured Out Dreams? How a Small Idea Can Turn into Big Impact that Gives Back</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you long to make an impact or have a ton of ideas on ways to give back - but you aren’t sure if those ideas belong in the ‘good’ or ‘bad’ idea category? Or maybe your experienced skillset doesn’t overlap with your passion – what do you do now? Do you have to choose? Girlfriend, you’re not the only one with these cycling questions! Listen in as Jordan brings on powerhouse CEO/Founder of the Dressember Foundation, Blythe Hill, as they discuss how her small idea transformed into a dignity restoring non profit. In this conversation, you’ll learn how Blythe has raised over $5M for anti-human trafficking work, where her idea was surprisingly birthed in the first place, and why it’s vital that you believe in yourself – even before your dreams make sense. Gal, if you have a knack for business and heart for mission inspired impact, this episode is for you. Listen in to be encouraged to take action on that crazy idea, give back to those in need, and step into gratefulness this Thanksgiving week.</p>  <p>@jordanleedooley</p> <p>@shepodcast</p>  <p>Episode Link: <a href="http://jordanleedooley.com/how-a-small-idea-can-turn-into-big-impact" target="_blank">http://jordanleedooley.com/how-a-small-idea-can-turn-into-big-impact</a></p>  <p>The SHE Podcast is a part of the Lasting Media family of podcasts.
