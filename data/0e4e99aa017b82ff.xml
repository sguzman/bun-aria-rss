                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Alaina resurrects one of her old series: looking at the live-action feature films of the Walt Disney studio. Following the deaths of the studio's founding brothers, and the beginning of a long period of rocky financials, Disney's film output was, well, boring and bad. We look over their movies from 1970-1975 to point out the few bright spots, place people and trends into their contexts, and bring up the much better work these artists were capable of.</p>

<p>In less than two weeks, Mobile Suit Gundam Hathaway will reach a global streaming audience. A brand-new adaptation of a 30 year old novel from a 40 year old franchise with a reputation for dense lore can be an intimidating, so we're here to get through what you'll probably want to know before watching.

In this episode, we're looking back at the reality we experienced. We talk about the many highs, the few lows, and the constant battle against exhaustion. Time will tell when, and even if, the parks can be experienced again the way they were. But for now, please enjoy this walk through recent, happy memories.</p>

This year we're getting sub-tropical and talking about the Florida Keys. An island chain once rich from shipping and now a vacation destination, the Keys have been shaken by natural disasters and disease, as well as a few notably creepy individuals. Have these events left a psychic and spiritual stain on the land, or is that just a way to sell more t-shirts? Let's explore!</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Alaina returns to our Disney Parks series by going back to the beginning: Disneyland in Anaheim, California. In 1955, after a long time planning and a short time building, Walt Disney presented yet another dream to the world. It was the world's first fully-themed park, complete with a nationally televised opening, and following 10 months of televised previews in prime time. We cover its development, opening, and some stories behind certain Opening Day attractions.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Alaina continues marking anniversaries, and also talking about travel disasters. 1918 was in the middle of the Golden Age of Rail Travel, but behind the march of technology and luxury there were millions of travelers trying to get to work on time. Unfortunately, not all of them did. The day this episode goes live marks the 101st anniversary of the worst rail accident in American history, and the end of the year the worst accident in American urban transit history. What counts as "acceptable odds" for mass death and mayhem? Who bears responsibility for a systemic failure? How does the atomization of car travel affect our perception of train death tolls?</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Grant tells a familiar story from a less-popular angle. Venezuelan oil interests, for-profit media, and a right-wing coalition launched a coup against the early years of Hugo Chavez' presidency. It also had all the hallmarks of 21st Century American Imperialism, but with a veneer of deniability. Who planted the seeds of today's unrest? How can you see true intent through rhetoric? Why hasn't Elliott Abrams been tried for war crimes?</p>

Why were those dog teams so desperate to move their serum? Do you owe your health to a team of women in Michigan? So the rust DOESN'T matter in itself?</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Alaina is back after a birthday break to teach us the history behind something you're probably familiar with: Reading Rainbow. Over 21 seasons LeVar Burton and dozens of guests shared a love of reading with children inside their homes. Now a beloved memory, some people are trying to continue that mission in new media. How can innocuous-sounding parts of legislation have out-sized effects? What good is having a skill without a passion for using it? What effects does having a better-read society produce?</p>

Then, Grant tells the story of the Second Defenestration of Prague, and how a 1618 disagreement over building a pair of churches sparked the Thirty Years War.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year! Welcome to 2019, full of promise and hope. We send off the year that was with a pair of remembrances. First, Alaina teaches us about the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918, the deadliest disease known to mankind. Then, Grant tells the story of the Second Defenestration of Prague, and how a 1618 disagreement over building a pair of churches sparked the Thirty Years War.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>We've been spending a lot of time with US history and it's time to head abroad. Grant gets meta with an episode that does just that! Japan spent hundreds of years isolating itself (from a certain point of view) until an American fleet gave them the opportunity (from a certain point of view) to open their society to the colonial powers. What's the difference between diplomacy and coercion? How can you maintain tradition in a changing world? Is an equal exchange even possible?</p>

                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We've been spending a lot of time with US history and it's time to head abroad. Grant gets meta with an episode that does just that! Japan spent hundreds of years isolating itself (from a certain point of view) until an American fleet gave them the opportunity (from a certain point of view) to open their society to the colonial powers. What's the difference between diplomacy and coercion? How can you maintain tradition in a changing world? Is an equal exchange even possible?</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the 1980s a plague struck America, and because of who it hit hardest, America was happy to let it run its course and let them die. The arts are how we make sense of that, and point toward what comes next. Alaina takes us through the conception and reception of Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes, perhaps the most highly-regarded play of the 20th Century. We also learn more about the real person depicted in it, and share our personal connections to the work. Is it possible to separate the personal from the political, or the path of history from faith? Can a work revitalize its medium, or should credit go to the historical moment that produced it? Can something still be too long even if every part of it is brilliant?</p>

                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 1980s a plague struck America, and because of who it hit hardest, America was happy to let it run its course and let them die. The arts are how we make sense of that, and point toward what comes next. Alaina takes us through the conception and reception of Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes, perhaps the most highly-regarded play of the 20th Century.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Grant takes us back to mid-century America to talk about an emblematic episode of the Cold War. During the Second World War, a number of Americans went behind the government's back to aid an ally. Less than ten yers later, two of them were blamed for millions and millions of deaths, and sentenced to death on coerced and extremely tenuous testimony. Can the letter of the law stand against its use as a weapon? Did an act of state cruelty feed further cruelty, and could clemency have reduced fear? Is this just a game of chicken gone wrong?</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Grant talks about the United States' Public Broadcasting Service, the most trusted institution in the country. A need for non-commercial programming became a need for a federally-supported structure, which quickly became a national treasure. How does the profit motive shape content?

The fair also hosted the World’s Congress of Representative Women, a week-long convention on women's issues and a landmerk in early feminist history. Did it fulfill its purpose?

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>As Dada began to burn itself out in the 1920s, a splinter movement rose from within: Surrealism. What we know now as an art movement began as a mode of thought, a philosophy, a practice. In this episode Grant teaches us about their goals, their political program, and where they all went once the band broke up. Can you exercize control over a movement meant to break boundaries and hierarchies? Is the most famous surrealist the worst at Surrealism? Which art movement would win in a fight?</p>

After the (primarily women and immigrant) workers of the New York garment industry began winning better conditions and pay, one factory lagged behind. Then, it burned down, killing 146 people in under 20 minutes. In the end, the owners made a profit on the insurance as the victims' families were left without their income.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Grant helps us lighten up and have some fun for once! Cedar Point is one of America's oldest and greatest amusement parks, changing and growing along with, and then setting, the trends of family entertainment. Would Boeckling recognize what's happened to his summer resort, or feel pride at the continued reinvention? Is history cyclical no matter where you look? How many past episodes have connections to this one?</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Alaina's Disney series is back with an episode on the 4th and (so far) final theme park at Walt Disney World Resort: Disney's Animal Kingdom. Work began just after Hollywood Studios opened, and took 8 years and nearly a billion dollars to finish. Over a relatively short life this park has had it's own share of oddities and development, growing into one of the finest park experiences anywhere. Is the direct approach the best approach to make an attraction educational? Who really owns bones? Have we all been brainwashed by Happy Meals?</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Grant starts October with a creepy topic. In 1947 a rancher thought he may have found pieces of a flying disk, and a military press release agreed. Over the decades to come this story blossomed into a wide-reaching global conspiracy with bodies, buried treasure, and the keys to every mystery since. How do legends develop? How does fact intersect with belief? Who names their child Trudy Truelove?</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In 1899 two newspaper giants were fighting for control of the New York readership, and tried to squeeze their distributors for an extra advantage. Those distributors were self-employed child laborers, who organized themselves and halted the entire distribution system until their demands were met. This drama, a nearly forgotten footnote in US labor history, was dramatized in a commercial flop of a film, and re-dramatized in a successful Broadway musical. Can a success set a precedent if it's forgotten? Does an adaptation have a duty to be accurate; and what if the facts are lost? How can an unpopular work become more sucessful after being changed for the worse?</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In his short life, Jim Henson re-invented an art form, taught millions to read, and entertained the world. His life, career, and philosophy were even broader than that. Why does a work's intended audience devalue its creativity? How do you escape your image to break new ground? How would you make a children's show to end war? Happy Birthday, Alaina!</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy Valentine's Day! In this holiday special, Alaina talks about the most romantic thing she knows: gruesome murder.

Walt Disney's original idea for all that Florida land was a planned city so unique that the world would come to see how his people lived and worked.

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Alaina continues her Disney Parks series with an episode on Walt Disney World Resort's second gate: Epcot. Walt Disney's original idea for all that Florida land was a planned city so unique that the world would come to see how his people lived and worked. After his death, some of those ideas, and the name, were recycled to be a theme park that serves as a permanent World's Fair. Is high modernism the path to despotism? Even so, could it have worked? How can you hit a forever-moving target: the future? Who needs rides when you can visit 11 themed gift shops and drink?</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's the Holidays, and we'd like to share one of our traditions with you. Alaina tells us about the creation of a classic film, The Sound of Music. First, we delve into the creation of the fictional family Von Trapp, then look at their actual lives which inspired it. How much fidelity is owed to the truth in an adaptation? What lengths would you go to in resisting a fascist takeover? What unexpected benefits come with accepting refugees?</p>
<p>It's also been exactly six months since episode 1! Thank you for all the love and support!</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[America's founders have been immortalized, lionized, and mythologized; but one seems to have fallen through the cracks. Grant shares what he's learned about John Jay, the forgotten father. Was he instrumental to the birth of the United States, or did he just happen to be in the right place at the right time? Is he forgotten because he left things half done in his career, or because he used his retirement to rest? Why on Earth is this episode mostly about a horse Alaina made up?

Cryptids, ghost towns, and lake pirates make for a new perspective on America's north coast. How technical does the definition of "pirate" need to be? How many cult leaders have also been in Congress? What was wrong with people in the 19th Century?

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Alaina takes us on a tour of the Great Lakes, pointing out the strange and unusual on the way. Cryptids, ghost towns, and lake pirates make for a new perspective on America's north coast. How technical does the definition of "pirate" need to be? How many cult leaders have also been in Congress? What was wrong with people in the 19th Century?

                      <description><![CDATA[Grant takes a turn at Chicago tragedy with the Haymarket Affair. In May 1886 a bomb was thrown, igniting a shootout that killed over a dozen people and changed the fight for workers' rights forever. Can equality be gained in a system run by those who profit from inequality? Are the voices of the dead louder than those of the living? While we don't know who started the fight, can we even know who won in the end?

                      <description><![CDATA[Alaina brings us to the Most Magical Place on Earth, Magic Kingdom Park in the Walt Disney World Resort. We learn about the park's inception and development, and follow a number of notable attractions from opening day to the present. Does the Magic Kingdom have a unique identity, or is it just Disneyland 2? How does something so compelling come from the collision of family passion and profit-seeking? Is there really any hope they'll give us a free vacation for saying mostly nice things? This one went pretty long, so look out for deleted and extended conversations in a supplemental episode next Tuesday!

                      <description><![CDATA[Good morning! Today Grant goes for two and talks about the Anabaptists, a movement of related Protestant sects dating back to the early days of the Reformation. Are our civil liberties inspired by people who dropped out of the society they protect? How can small communities survive in isolation, and how could they survive without isolation? Why are people living in modernity fascinated by those who chose not to be?

In our fifth episode, Alaina teaches us about the fire that claimed Chicago's Iroquois Theatre in 1903, the deadliest single-building fire in history. It's a story with some similarities to the Eastland Disaster, and plenty to set it apart as well. When is a door not a door? Is rational self interest the deadliest force in history? What in this dang city hasn't burned down?

                      <description><![CDATA[Hello everyone! Here's the 4th episode of History Honeys! Alaina catches us up on Tuberculosis, then drills down to how the disease shaped fashion, then shares stories of how other diseases caused fads, and some stories of how fads caused illnesses. Is anything in history truly isolated? Is there any limit to what people will do for fashion's sake? Have we been using a loaded coin all along?

                      <description><![CDATA[
The third episode of History Honeys brings Grant to the hot seat to talk about The Comics Code Authority; its beginnings, its effects, and its legacy. If it seems like Alaina doesn't say much, it's because she was too busy trying to keep her composure in the face of the all-too familiar story of misplaced outrage and artistic repression. She made some incredible faces, though. Is scapegoating and censorship the path of least resistance? Can history remember anyone for more than one thing? How long of a shadow can one moment cast?

                      <description><![CDATA[Hello again and welcome to the second episode of History Honeys! Alaina will be teaching us all about the sinking of the Eastland, a passenger steamer whose sinking was the single greatest loss of life in Great Lakes history. How can a system give rise to terrible things and nobody at fault? Can a plan to promote safety actually create danger? If ghosts aren't real, can anyone actually "lie" about being haunted?
