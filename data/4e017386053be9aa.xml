And how much of what they think of you aligns with what you think of yourself?

NHTSA - Distracted driving is a serious problem on our roadways leading to the deaths of thousands of people and injuries in the hundreds of thousands each year. When you take your eyes and your focus off the road, even for a second, it can be deadly. Not just for you but for other drivers, pedestrians and bicyclists. Sadly, many Americans use their cell phones while driving. Whether it’s texting, checking emails, scrolling media feeds or any other form of distraction, drivers are putting themselves and others around them at great risk. It’s important to know that 48 states ban texting and driving. Also, 21 states prohibit all drivers from using cell phones while driving. Distracted drivers are not only putting people at risk; they’re also breaking the law. Remember U Drive. U Text. U Pay. Brought to you by NHTSA [NITS-uh]

NHTSA - Distracted driving is a serious problem on our roadways leading to the deaths of thousands of people and injuries in the hundreds of thousands each year. When you take your eyes and your focus off the road, even for a second, it can be deadly. Not just for you but for other drivers, pedestrians and bicyclists. Sadly, many Americans use their cell phones while driving. Whether it’s texting, checking emails, scrolling media feeds or any other form of distraction, drivers are putting themselves and others around them at great risk. It’s important to know that 48 states ban texting and driving. Also, 21 states prohibit all drivers from using cell phones while driving. Distracted drivers are not only putting people at risk; they’re also breaking the law. Remember U Drive. U Text. U Pay. Brought to you by NHTSA [NITS-uh]

Talkspace - I think all of us are dealing with stress right now, whether it’s the isolation, canceled summer plans or economic stress. We all have something on our minds, and it’s important to talk it out. Talking helps, plain and simple. Talkspace online therapy helps you do just that. Match with a licensed therapist from the comfort of your home and get the support you need on your own schedule. Talk to your therapist 24/7 from your computer or phone and hear back daily. One month on Talkspace costs about the same amount as a single in-person therapy session. But with Talkspace you can send unlimited messages to your therapist and they’ll engage with you at least five days a week. Talkspace therapists have experience treating depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and much more. It’s secure and private using the latest encryption technology to store client info. Use promo code ZONE to get $100 off your first month and help support the show. That’s https://www.talkspace.com promo code ZONE. 

Okay, Now Listen - Support for The Friend Zone comes from Okay, Now Listen, a new podcast from Netflix and Strong Black Lead – hosted by real-life friends and culture Queens, Sylvia Obell and Scottie Beam. Each episode drops bi-weekly and is a dose of what’s on their minds, what they’re binging, and what’s been blowing up the timeline. These queens cover everything from seeing your ex be a better partner to someone else, to handling grief and trauma during quarantine. They also have the best Netflix recommendations – from Peaky Blinders, to All-American, this duo has you covered. And every once and a while you’ll get the chance to listen to some exclusive celebrity interviews. New episodes drop every other Thursday anywhere you can get podcasts, so what are you waiting for? Subscribe now on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Pocketcasts or wherever else you listen to podcasts. And while you’re at it, follow @strongblacklead on social to stay up-to-date and find out more

NBC’s Good Girls - America’s favorite moms-turned-criminals are bringin’ the heat on the all-new season of Good Girls! Critics call it “audacious” and “addictive”. And Rotten Tomatoes certifies Good Girls “one hundred percent fresh”. Forget gangsters – these are momsters. And they’re not packing lunches – they’re packing heat. Christina Hendricks, Retta, and Mae Whitman star in the all-new season of Good Girls Sunday February 16th on NBC

Daily Harvest - If you’re someone who’s pretty health-conscious, you’ll love Daily Harvest. Daily Harvest makes it easy to eat more fruits and vegetables with thoughtfully sourced, chef-crafted foods that can be prepared in five minutes or less. They work directly with farms to harvest organic fruits and vegetables at their peak and then freeze them within 24 hours to lock in their nutrients. Everything stays fresh until you’re ready to enjoy it! Choose from more than 65 different options like, smoothies, hearty soups, harvest bowls, and overnight oats. Each recipe takes one step to prepare, with room to make them your own. Add your favorite milk to blend up a smoothie or heat up a Harvest Bowl and top it with avocado or a fried egg! Go to https://www.daily-harvest.com and enter promo code FRIENDZONE to get twenty-five dollars off your first box!

AUrate - Aurate [or-rate] makes the jewelry you’ve always wanted but could never find, with pieces ranging from classic, to statement, to completely original. They offer beautiful designs, amazing quality, and ethically sourced pieces that you can wear every day – all at affordable prices. Aurate uses real gold, which means you can wear it and never have to take it off – wear it while you shower, work out, sleep, cook, anything. It’s jewelry for life. And all Aurate pieces come with a lifetime warranty because they know it lasts. Aurate sells direct to you without the middleman markup, so they can offer the same quality as traditional 5th Avenue brands, but at a fraction of the cost. Their jewelry is ethically made in New York City, and for every piece sold, a child in need receives a book to further their education. For 15% off your first Aurate purchase, go to https://auratenewyork.com/friendzone and use promo code friendzone.

Talkspace - These days, everyone knows that your mental health is just as important as your physical health. But scheduling in-person therapy sessions can be inconvenient, not to mention expensive. Thankfully there’s Talkspace, the online talk therapy platform that’s with you 24/7. Talkspace matches you with one of their 5,000+ licensed therapists based on your preferences, because they know that therapy isn’t one-size-fits all (and it shouldn’t be! Their therapists are trained for every need—including depression, anxiety, LGBT-specific issues, and more). You can make your account right from your phone or computer and a matching agent will help you identify your therapy needs. Both messaging and video-based plans are available depending on the level of support you want and you get to choose a plan that fits your budget too. You’ll get 24/7 access from your phone or computer to a licensed therapist that fits your needs. That’s https://www.talkspace.com promo code ZONE.

Bombas - Bombas socks are SOFT. Like, “made-with-the-softest-cotton-in-the-world” soft. They’re built with extra cushioning, so whether you’re walking the dog, chilling at home, or playing drums, you’ll be comfortable. Bombas socks provide support in places you didn’t even know you needed it, like your arches. Each sock is built with a special arch-support system that feels like a nice hug for your foot. And they’re smooth across the top – no more annoying toe seam. Bombas makes all types of socks – dress socks for work, performance socks for working out, and limited-edition holiday socks. They even have a line of Merino Wool socks that are soft, warm, and naturally moisture-wicking. Bombas is the gift even that person will love…even that person who seems impossible to shop for. And for every pair you buy, Bombas donates a pair to someone in need. Go to https://bombas.com/friendzone today, and get twenty percent off your first purchase.

Aurate - Aurate [pronounced or-rate] is fine jewelry made in New York City, founded by women for women. Pieces range from classic, to statement, to completely original. It’s the jewelry you’ve always wanted, but could never find. Aurate was founded on the desire to shake up the jewelry market by offering modern women beautiful designs, amazing quality at affordable prices, and ethically sourced pieces they can wear every day. Because it’s all real gold, you can wear it and never have to take it off – shower, sport, sleep, cook, anything. It’s jewelry for life! And because Aurate sells direct to you without the middleman markup, they can offer the same quality as traditional 5th Avenue brands at a fraction of the cost. All Aurate pieces come with a lifetime warranty because they know it lasts. Give the gift of high-quality sustainable jewelry this holiday season without the killer price tags, with Aurate. For 15% off your first Aurate purchase, go to https://auratenewyork.com/friendzone and use promo code FRIENDZONE.

Talkspace - These days, everyone knows that your mental health is just as important as your physical health. But scheduling in-person therapy sessions can be inconvenient, not to mention expensive. Thankfully there’s Talkspace, the online talk therapy platform that’s with you 24/7. Talkspace matches you with one of their 5,000+ licensed therapists based on your preferences, because they know that therapy isn’t one-size-fits all (and it shouldn’t be! Their therapists are trained for every need—including depression, anxiety, LGBT-specific issues, and more). You can make your account right from your phone or computer and a matching agent will help you identify your therapy needs. Both messaging and video-based plans are available depending on the level of support you want and you get to choose a plan that fits your budget too. You’ll get 24/7 access from your phone or computer to a licensed therapist that fits your needs. That’s https://www.talkspace.com promo code ZONE.

Bombas - Bombas socks are SOFT. Like, “made-with-the-softest-cotton-in-the-world” soft. They’re built with extra cushioning, so whether you’re walking the dog, chilling at home, or playing drums, you’ll be comfortable. Bombas socks provide support in places you didn’t even know you needed it, like your arches. Each sock is built with a special arch-support system that feels like a nice hug for your foot. And they’re smooth across the top – no more annoying toe seam. Bombas makes all types of socks – dress socks for work, performance socks for working out, and limited-edition holiday socks. They even have a line of Merino Wool socks that are soft, warm, and naturally moisture-wicking. Bombas is the gift even that person will love…even that person who seems impossible to shop for. And for every pair you buy, Bombas donates a pair to someone in need. Go to https://bombas.com/friendzone today, and get twenty percent off your first purchase.

Aurate - Aurate [pronounced or-rate] is fine jewelry made in New York City, founded by women for women. Pieces range from classic, to statement, to completely original.

Aurate was founded on the desire to shake up the jewelry market by offering modern women beautiful designs, amazing quality at affordable prices, and ethically sourced pieces they can wear every day. Because it’s all real gold, you can wear it and never have to take it off – shower, sport, sleep, cook, anything. It’s jewelry for life! And because Aurate sells direct to you without the middleman markup, they can offer the same quality as traditional 5th Avenue brands at a fraction of the cost. All Aurate pieces come with a lifetime warranty because they know it lasts. Give the gift of high-quality sustainable jewelry this holiday season without the killer price tags, with Aurate.

We explore whether or not society should support such cultural shifts, by examining the factors and sharing stories of our challenges as teens with limited resources.

      <description>On this week’s episode of #TheFriendZone, we discuss a recent study claiming 24 year olds should still be considered teenagers by law, extending adolescence, due to the many factors contributing to their failure to launch into adulthood. According to the journal, teens are reaching major milestones a lot slower than teens of the past. We explore whether or not society should support such cultural shifts, by examining the factors and sharing stories of our challenges as teens with limited resources.
