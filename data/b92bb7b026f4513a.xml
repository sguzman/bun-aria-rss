      <title>Ep. 1056 - Democrats Double Down On Baby Killing Propaganda Heading Into Midterms </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, democrats double down on their abortion messaging heading into the mid-terms. This week they've offered pro-abortion propaganda that ranges from unintentionally hilarious to incredibly horrific. Also, Elon Musk begins to cull the herd over at Twitter. Early voting is already causing confusion and problems. A country star gets in trouble for publicly associating with Ron DeSantis. And the media worries that the World Series might be racist because there aren't enough US-born black players. An oddly specific complaint.

      <title>Ep. 1055 - Dwyane Wade Exposed For Exploiting His ‘Trans’ Kid</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, former NBA star Dwyane Wade has been parading his "trans kid" around like a pet for two years now. But a new report reveals that the boy's mother is not on board with this transition and she believes that Wade is doing it for money and attention. Imagine that. Also, the media comes up with its most absurd argument against voter ID yet. The White House tries to defend its secret social media censorship campaign. Caitlin Jenner and Dylan Mulvaney get into a fight and nobody wins. And a priest in Ireland is thrown under the bus by his own bishop when he dares to defend Catholic teaching during mass.

      <title>Ep. 1054 - Rappers Are Dying Left And Right From The Violence They Glorify</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, another rapper was shot and killed this week. More and more, the people making music glorifying violence are falling victim to it themselves. But while the Left warns about the dangers of "irresponsible speech," they seem to have a blind spot when it comes to the rap industry. I wonder why. Also, I am featured in yet another mainstream media hit piece. This one from NBC News. I'll tell you about some of the dirty tricks they pulled behind the scenes. And Anne Hathaway goes on the View to talk about why abortion is a woman's "destiny." What the hell does that mean?

      <title>Ep. 1053 - The COVID Tyrants Want Forgiveness. They Should Get Punishment Instead.</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left wants us to forgive and forget about the tyranny they inflicted on us during COVID. But we can't do that. I'll explain why. Also, new documents reveal how the government has been using Big Tech to squash the First Amendment. The Supreme Court possibly prepares to ban systemic anti-white racism in college admissions. The government begins its UFO cover up. And a woman on TikTok explains why white people are morally obligated to refrain from watching the new Black Panther film. I'm already one step ahead of her on that.

But we can't do that. I'll explain why. Also, new documents reveal how the government has been using Big Tech to squash the First Amendment. The Supreme Court possibly prepares to ban systemic anti-white racism in college admissions. The government begins its UFO cover up. And a woman on TikTok explains why white people are morally obligated to refrain from watching the new Black Panther film. I'm already one step ahead of her on that. </p><p><br></p><p>- - - </p><p><br></p><p>DailyWire+:</p><p><br></p><p>Stay informed by listening to Morning Wire and Election Wire on DailyWire+, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts</p><p><br></p><p>Become a DailyWire+ member to watch the brand new DailyWire+ series “Dr. Jordan B.

      <title>Ep. 1052 - Nudist Hippie Breaks Into Pelosi's Home. Media Blames Republicans. </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a hippie nudist with a hammer assaulted Nancy Pelosi’s husband inside their home in the middle of the night. But the most important thing the media wants us to know about this story is that it’s all the fault of Republicans, and also that we’re not allowed to ask any questions about it. Also, Elon officially takes the helm at Twitter, and immediately start instituting a number of important changes. And Barack Obama takes to the campaign trail to save the Democrats from the coming Red Wave. An NBA star shuts down a reporter in satisfying fashion. And another Starbucks employee has an emotional meltdown on camera. Is this a problem only at Starbucks, or is society-wide issue?

      <title>Ep. 1051 - Lots Of Twitter Employees Are About To Lose Their Jobs, Thank God </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, climate activists have been making a nuisance of themselves with increasing regularity in recent weeks. Besides the obvious — stupidity, a need for attention, etc — what is driving all of this? Also, Elon Musk prepares to take over Twitter and reportedly fire 75 percent of its staff. But Twitter employees have a plan to stop him: a strongly worded letter. And a male volleyball player who identifies as female severely injures a female opponent. In our Daily Cancellation we have a video that, in less than 60 seconds, perfectly captures race relations in America. And it’s not a pretty picture.

      <title>Ep. 1050 - Fetterman Humiliates Himself. Dems Cry ‘Ableism.’</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, John Fetterman delivers the worst debate performance in American history. But his self-destruction is not solely his own fault. The blame also lies with the Democrat Party, and also his wife. I’ll explain. Also, the governor of New York humiliates herself in her debate. Not quite as bad as Fetterman, but almost. And chest mutilation procedures on minors have risen by 400 percent in the last few years. Plus, we’ll hear from a Hungarian politician who explains why they don’t have to worry about this problem in their country. And Bono discovers, to his horror, that maybe free market capitalism isn’t so bad after all.

But his self-destruction is not solely his own fault. The blame also lies with the Democrat Party, and also his wife. I’ll explain. Also, the governor of New York humiliates herself in her debate. Not quite as bad as Fetterman, but almost. And chest mutilation procedures on minors have risen by 400 percent in the last few years. Plus, we’ll hear from a Hungarian politician who explains why they don’t have to worry about this problem in their country. And Bono discovers, to his horror, that maybe free market capitalism isn’t so bad after all.</p><p><br></p><p>- - - </p><p><br></p><p>DailyWire+:</p><p><br></p><p>Become a DailyWire+ member to access movies, shows, documentaries and more: <a href="https://bit.ly/3dQINt0">https://bit.ly/3dQINt0</a>  </p><p> </p><p>Tune into Daily Wire Backstage TONIGHT at 7pm Eastern at dailywireplus.com </p><p><br></p><p> - - - </p><p><br></p><p>Today’s Sponsors:</p><p><br></p><p>Epic Will - Use Promo Code 'WALSH' for 10% off your Will:<a href="https://www.epicwill.com/"> https://www.epicwill.com/</a></p><p><br></p><p>- - -</p><p><br></p><p>Socials:</p><p><br></p><p>Follow on Twitter: <a href="https://bit.ly/3Rv1VeF">https://bit.ly/3Rv1VeF</a> </p><p><br></p><p>Follow on Instagram: <a href="https://bit.ly/3KZC3oA">https://bit.ly/3KZC3oA</a> </p><p><br></p><p>Follow on Facebook: <a href="https://bit.ly/3eBKjiA">https://bit.ly/3eBKjiA</a> </p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe on YouTube: <a href="https://bit.ly/3RQp4rs">https://bit.ly/3RQp4rs</a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Ep. 1049 - They Are Waging A War Against Truth Itself </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, desperate Democrats are warning that voting Republican means the death of democracy. But the real threat to our democracy, in fact to our whole civilization, comes from somewhere else. It comes in part from the protesters at my event last night who were ripping pages out of the Bible and eating them. I’ll explain. Also, Ted Cruz bravely walks into the chicken coup and debates the squawking hens of the View. MSNBC tries to embarrass Trump voters in a focus group but it doesn’t work out how they intended. Sandy Hook families now want to sue Alex Jones for trillions of dollars. And one of the most prominent Native American activist in the country, who just died recently, wasn’t actually Native American at all.

      <title>Ep. 1048 - Our Successful Rally Sends Leftist Goblins Into Fits Of Satanic Hysteria</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, our big rally in Nashville was a major success, even in spite of the satanic leftist zombies who showed up to try and derail the event. We’ll recap it all for you today. Also, Joe Biden invites TikTok trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney to the White House where Biden claims, among other things, that states do not have the right to protect children from mutilation. And the University of Wisconsin-Madison denounces my event, despite having approved it weeks ago. Plus, the Biden Administration sends troops to Ukraine, even though we were told there would be no boots on the ground. In our Daily Cancellation, a man exposes himself on live television, but it’s okay — even heroic and beautiful, we’re told — because he identifies as a woman.

      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left claims that there is a right wing “book banning” movement growing across the country. But they’re lying as usual. Also, the CDC recommends that the COVID vaccine be added to your child’s regular immunization schedule. Elon Musk plans to fire the majority of Twitter employees. I’m taking my What Is A Woman tour to Berkeley, and expecting a very open and welcoming environment. And in our Daily Cancellation, a man faces the internet outrage mob after suggesting that men and women experience depression differently. The horror.

      <title>Ep. 1046 - The Left Ramps Up Its War On Human Life </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as prominent Democrats openly advocate for eugenics, and Canada drastically expands its euthanasia program, we’ll take a look at the origins and intentions of the Left’s war on human life. Also, some exciting updates on our rally tomorrow in Nashville. Plus, speaking of exciting, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez continues to be shouted down by angry constituents at her town hall events. And test scores have fallen dramatically in the public school system. They’re still blaming it on the pandemic. But I think there’s a lot more to the story. In our Daily Cancellation, a congressional candidate offers a bizarre defense of what she calls our “right to sex.”

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as prominent Democrats openly advocate for eugenics, and Canada drastically expands its euthanasia program, we’ll take a look at the origins and intentions of the Left’s war on human life. Also, some exciting updates on our rally tomorrow in Nashville. Plus, speaking of exciting, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez continues to be shouted down by angry constituents at her town hall events. And test scores have fallen dramatically in the public school system. They’re still blaming it on the pandemic. But I think there’s a lot more to the story. In our Daily Cancellation, a congressional candidate offers a bizarre defense of what she calls our “right to sex.”

      <title>Ep. 1045 - It's Time To Throw The Drag Queen Groomers In Prison</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the drag queen grooming events are only getting more outrageous and perverse, as two recent incidents show. So what can be done to put a stop to this? We’ll discuss today. Also, George Floyd’s family threatens to sue Kanye West for saying that Floyd died from an overdose. Someone plastered the gender studies department at the University of Wisconsin with posters advertising my upcoming event on campus. Students in the department say it’s a hate crime. I say if it’s a hate crime, it’s a hilarious one. Stacey Abrams has an idea for fixing the economy: kill more people. And late night host James Corden is exposed as yet another pompous Hollywood jerk. No big surprise there.

      <title>Ep. 1044 - Dismantling John Oliver's Ridiculous Trans Propaganda </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm  

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, John Oliver goes on the attack to defend so-called “trans rights.” His monologue on the subject is supposed to be a definitive takedown of the conservative position. We’ll go through it piece by piece today to see if it lives up the hype. Also, panel of non-binary and trans people on a college campus discuss my film What Is A Woman, and the conversation is as great as it sounds. Plus, “color blind” casting is apparently back in style again. As long as it excludes white people. In our Daily Cancellation, outrage and controversy erupt over my comments about anime. Will I backtrack, or spitefully double down on an issue that doesn’t really matter to me one way or another? We’ll find out today.

      <title>Ep. 1043 - Beauty Brands Use Males In Womanface To Sell To Women </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm  

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, yet another prominent beauty brand tries to sell its product to women by using men dressed in woman face. Also, garage door victim Bubba Wallace has a temper tantrum and tries to kill another driver during a race. But his victim status ensures he will face no serious consequences. Plus, a Daily Wire report reveals what sources inside Vanderbilt have to say about Vanderbilt’s pledge to pause gender transitions on minors. And don’t believe your lying eyes Joe Biden says that the economy is actually “strong as hell.” In our Daily Cancellation, an airline passenger is accused of fat shaming for complaining about being wedged between two morbidly obese people for a three hour flight.

      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm  

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a large Antifa mob attempts to derail my What Is A Woman event at University of Houston. It was the largest protest yet. And it had no effect at all. Also, the Parkland mass shooter escapes the death penalty. AOC is berated by hecklers at a sparsely attended town hall. Democrats in Virginia want to take your child away from you if you fail to “affirm” his gender confusion. And an NFL coach has no time or patience for race-baiting reporters.

      <title>Ep. 1040 - Woke Med Students Disavow Science, Biology, and Modern Medicine </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm  

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, med students participate in a bizarre incantation ritual where they pledge to reject the gender binary and show respect for primitive medical practices. This is what modern medicine has become. Speaking of modern medicine, Canada has expanded their euthanasia laws so that now physically healthy young people, even minors, can be victims of doctor assisted suicide. Plus, the unedited portions of Kanye’s interview with Tucker Carlson are leaked online. The Left is calling it a bombshell scoop, we’ll see if they’re overreacting again. And even MSNBC is now admitting that John Fetterman is mentally incompetent. But he’s not dropping out of the race.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a drag queen is invited on the altar during a church service. But the pastor’s justification for this satanic display tells us more than he intended to reveal. Also, Antifa mobilizes for my event at the University of Houston. Tulsi Gabbard leaves the Democrat Party. The Secretary of the Army says the Army isn’t woke, it’s just inclusive. In our Daily Cancellation, Michelle Obama is teaming up with an organization that just put out the worst get out the vote ad in the history of democracy.

      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm  

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Jon Stewart allegedly delivers the definitive smackdown to conservative bigots who believe that men are men and women are women. Today we’ll take a look at the viral clips from this much celebrated segment, and show just how easily and thoroughly it can all be debunked. Also, we achieve a major victory as Vanderbilt announces that it will be pausing all gender transition procedures on minors. And, the Biden Administration decides it must remind parents across the country that your sons and your family names can be ended anytime they feel like it. In our Daily Cancellation, a Christian pastor explains his problem with What Is A Woman. Namely, that I’m in it.

      <title>Ep. 1037 - Protesters Claim That My Speech Threatens Their Very Existence </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm  

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, protesters swarmed outside my speech on a college campus last night, screaming that my presence threatens their very existence. I want to talk about that claim today and what they really mean by it. Also, Tucker Carlson interviews Kanye West. Joe Biden releases from prison anyone convicted of simple marijuana possession, which is to say he released no one from prison. The media is perplexed that Republican voters in Georgia aren’t abandoning Herschel Walker following the media’ smear campaign. In our Daily Cancellation, we will deal with McDonald’s latest promotion: the adult happy meal.

      <title>Ep. 1036 - Media Matters Exposes My Dark And Sordid Past </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Media Matters exposes me sordid past as an obscure shock jock morning radio host. They believe that this will be the thing that finally brings me down, but that’s not going to happen. Also, Vox admits that kids are being transitioned but argues that we have to do it for their own sake. Joe Biden declares that debate over climate change “over” because of Hurricane Ian. And a mother shows up to a school board meeting dressed like a drag queen. But she’s trying to make a point, and doing it rather brilliantly I think.

      <title>Ep. 1035 - How Our Culture Teaches Kids To Hate Themselves </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on that Matt Walsh Show, my What Is A Woman college tour gets off to a roaring start. There are a few moments from last night that are worth further discussing. Also, the governor of Oklahoma pledges to ban child gender transitions. The movement is growing across the country. Plus, after lots of stops and starts, it seems that Elon Musk will finally take over Twitter. In our Daily Cancellation, a new dating app targeting conservatives earns derision from the Left.

Today on that Matt Walsh Show, my What Is A Woman college tour gets off to a roaring start. There are a few moments from last night that are worth further discussing. Also, the governor of Oklahoma pledges to ban child gender transitions. The movement is growing across the country. Plus, after lots of stops and starts, it seems that Elon Musk will finally take over Twitter. In our Daily Cancellation, a new dating app targeting conservatives earns derision from the Left.

      <title>Ep. 1034 - Medical Organizations Want Us Arrested For Criticizing Them </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, major medical organizations call on the DOJ to arrest and imprison those of us who criticize their medical practices. Also, female athletes at a school in Vermont are banned from the locker room because they don’t want to get naked in front of a boy. Candace Owens and Kanye West stir up trouble by wearing shirts with a very controversial message: white lives matter. Leftist activists make their counter insurgency battle plans for my What Is A Woman screening tour. And in our Daily Cancellation, two gay men say they have a right to be biological parents.

      <title>Ep. 1033 - Gay Romantic Comedy Bombs Hilariously. Hollywood Blames Homophobia. </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Hollywood released a historic, groundbreaking gay romantic comedy, that nobody went to see. Does this mean we’re all going to be accused of homophobia for not supporting the film? Yes of course it does. Also, an investigative report from the Daily Wire reveals that the pro-trans student walkout in Virginia last week was not exactly what it appeared to be. Plus, Kamala Harris wants to provide hurricane relief to all the people in Florida who need it, except the white ones. In our Daily Cancellation, at long last, David French finally pens the conservative case for transitioning minors.

      <title>Ep. 1032 - An Epidemic Of Lonely, Alienated Young Men </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, there is a crisis in our culture of lonely, disaffected young men. But anyone who speaks up for them, like Jordan Peterson, is villainized. Why? We’ll talk about that today. Also, a House hearing on abortion descends once again into anti-science nonsense. Vice has a puff piece about sex offenders that does not go according to plan. Kamala Harris is relatable, at least to me, for the first time. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with one of the great injustices and outrages of all time. It has to do with someone named Hailey Bieber and the color of her lipstick.

      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a half naked pop star desecrates a historical artifact while the Left looks on and cheers. We’ll discuss. Also, Biden is now at the point in his dementia decline where he is literally seeing ghosts. Plus, the Prime Minister of New Zealand says that “misinformation” is an act of war. In our Daily Cancellation, a major airline will now allow pilots to cross dress on the job. All in the name of inclusivity.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a half naked pop star desecrates a historical artifact while the Left looks on and cheers. We’ll discuss. Also, Biden is now at the point in his dementia decline where he is literally seeing ghosts. Plus, the Prime Minister of New Zealand says that “misinformation” is an act of war. In our Daily Cancellation, a major airline will now allow pilots to cross dress on the job. All in the name of inclusivity.

      <title>Ep. 1030 - Media Touts Fraudulent 'Study' To Justify Child Mutilation </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show we talk about lies, damned lies, and studies. The Left tells us to follow the science but often manipulates "the science" to fabricate the desired result. That's certainly the case with a new study "proving" that gender reassignment surgery is a wonderful thing for children. Also, some students in Virginia walk out in protest against policies that make them safer and protect their privacy. Don Lemon embarrassed himself gloriously on camera yet again. People seem to be very concerned about a sex scandal involving something called The Try Guys. And in our Daily Cancellation, Gen Z has found a new way to rebrand laziness.

      <title>Ep. 1029 - Frantic, Desperate Media Tries To Defend Vanderbilt </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media has been forced against its will to report on the Vanderbilt scandal. But their reporting has been less than honest. We have two especially egregious examples today. Also, as a hurricane bears down on Florida, Amy Klobuchar says that it could be stopped by electing Democrats. Even though Democrats are currently in charge and hurricanes are still happening. And an elderly pro-life volunteer is shot while canvassing a neighborhood. This is just a few days after a crazed leftist ran over and killed someone because he was a “Republican extremist.” In our Daily cancellation, Salon is having second thoughts about the gender neutral term “Latinx.”

      <title>Ep. 1028 - The Most Demonic And Depraved 'All Ages' Drag Show Yet</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, one "all ages" drag show was shut down in Tennessee over the weekend, but another one was still held and it's the worst we've seen yet. Also, Italy elects its first female prime minister but the media sadly cannot celebrate because she has the wrong opinions. Plus, the FBI sends 30 agents to raid a pro-life activist's home, despite the fact that he broke no laws at all. The former mayor of Atlanta who let BLM burn her city to the ground has now repositioned herself as an advocate of law and order. And in our Daily Cancellation, a TikTok feminist laughs at 1950s dating advice. But the advice is way better than anything you'll hear from a TikTok feminist.

      <title>Ep. 1027 - We Are Going To Make Child ‘Gender Transitions’ Illegal </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we have exposed Vanderbilt's child mutilation practices. Now it's time to do something about it. I'll explain the plan today. Also, Stacey Abrams says that the fetal heartbeat is a far right conspiracy, the Pentagon is panicking over their failed military recruitment efforts, an MSNBC host thinks he has the ultimate gotcha on Ron DeSantis, and in our Daily Cancellation, The Washington Post is the latest outlet to claim that there is a racist plot to keep black men out of NFL coaching positions. I will explain why those claims are completely wrong and stupid.

      <title>Ep. 1026 - Desperate Leftists Call For My Arrest After I Exposed Vanderbilt's Gender Clinic </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, my expose on Vanderbilt's gender clinic, which butchers and drugs kids, has sparked a massive reaction on both the right and the left. Best of all, there is now a push for legislation to finally put a stop to this. I'll give you the latest on this story today. Also, the White House walks back Biden's claim that the pandemic is over. Doctors will now start conducting regular screenings for anxiety. Why is that a bad thing? I'll explain. A therapist brags on TikTok about how he indoctrinates and manipulates kids. And in our Daily cancellation, a philosopher comes to the defense of that teacher in Canada with the giant fake breasts.

      <description>Is the GOP on the verge of blowing the predicted midterm red wave? Will the raid on Mar-a-Lago ultimately be another Mueller Report dud?

      <title>Ep. 1025 - We Investigated Our Local Hospital’s Gender Butchery Clinic. Here’s What We Found.</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Vanderbilt hospital is right next door here in Nashville, and so we decided that we would investigate their transgender clinic. Yes, they drug and mutilate children. But it gets worse, somehow. Also, Ron DeSantis is under criminal investigation for sending illegals to Martha’s Vineyard. What crime did he commit? None of course. And Don Lemon brings up slavery reparations and promptly gets embarrassed. Chrissy Teigen says that her miscarriage was actually an abortion and she’s just realizing it now. And in our daily cancellation, the Atlantic has discovered that sex segregation in sports actually doesn’t make any scientific sense.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Vanderbilt hospital is right next door here in Nashville, and so we decided that we would investigate their transgender clinic. Yes, they drug and mutilate children. But it gets worse, somehow. Also, Ron DeSantis is under criminal investigation for sending illegals to Martha’s Vineyard. What crime did he commit? None of course. And Don Lemon brings up slavery reparations and promptly gets embarrassed. Chrissy Teigen says that her miscarriage was actually an abortion and she’s just realizing it now. And in our daily cancellation, the Atlantic has discovered that sex segregation in sports actually doesn’t make any scientific sense.

      <title>Ep. 1024 - Public School Defends Male Teacher's Right To Wear Giant Fake Breasts </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a school teacher sexually harasses his students by wearing massive prosthetic breasts to class. But the school says that his gender expression is protected and only bigots would criticize him for it. Also, Joe Biden is asked whether he's running for re-election and he doesn't exactly say yes. Plus, Bill Maher is accused of defending slavery. In our Daily Cancellation, math teachers try to explain why basic arithmetic is racist.

      <title>Ep. 1023 - New Medical Guidelines Say Parental Consent Not Required For Child Gender Transition</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the leading “transgender health” organization has finally released its new guidelines recommending medical and surgical transition for kids. It also recommends going around the parents if they aren’t “affirming.” Parental consent is now optional, says WPATH. Also, in one of the best stories of the year, governor Ron DeSantis ships plane loads of illegals to the sanctuary city of Martha’s Vineyard. We’ll find out how this is just like the holocaust, according to the Left. And the treasury secretary says that the IRS is the foundation of our country. In our Daily Cancellation, a fat activist on Twitter says that she’s only fat because of white people. How does she connect those dots?

      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left and the media are enraged today because of my allegedly racist mermaid opinions. This is a very very important issue to them. Will I fall to my knees and apologize? Stay tuned to find out. Also, two videos went viral this week of brutal assaults in public schools. Why does this seem to be an increasing trend? And Chris Rufo has more information about that alleged bomb threat at Boston Children’s Hospital. Something isn’t quite adding up there. And Jill Biden says that children should have access to all books in their school libraries. In our Daily Cancellation, we must finally cancel Starbucks baristas. It’s been a long time coming.

      <title>Ep. 1021 - Public School Sex Ed Teaches 'Porn Literacy' </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, sex ed curricula in public schools now include lessons on “porn literacy.” Also, Lindsey Graham proposed a federal abortion ban right before the midterms. I’ll tell you why, as a diehard pro-lifer, I do not support this move. Plus, Dr. Phil takes on the abortion issue. Jimmy Kimmel is finally accused of racism, but not because of all the blackface he’s done. And in our Daily Cancellation, we have our most creative attempt yet to solve the What Is A Woman riddle.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, sex ed curricula in public schools now include lessons on “porn literacy.” Also, Lindsey Graham proposed a federal abortion ban right before the midterms. I’ll tell you why, as a diehard pro-lifer, I do not support this move. Plus, Dr. Phil takes on the abortion issue. Jimmy Kimmel is finally accused of racism, but not because of all the blackface he’s done. And in our Daily Cancellation, we have our most creative attempt yet to solve the What Is A Woman riddle.

      <title>Ep. 1020 - The Insane Racial Double Standards That Govern Our Society</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left celebrates when white characters in films and tv shows are turned black, but reacts with outrage in the reverse. This is yet another example of the blatant racial double standards that govern our society. And personally I've had enough of them. Also, CNN shocks the world by sort of acknowledging that the BYU racism story was a hoax. Though the race hustler on ESPN are sticking with their story, facts be damned. Dr. Oz comes out in favor of the federal government redefining marriage. And Brian Stelter loses his job at CNN only to immediately end up on the staff at Harvard. What does this tell us about the institutions that run our country? Quite a lot, actually.

      <title>Ep. 1019 - Hollywood Film Celebrates African Slave Traders</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Indiana University celebrates a psychopathic pedophile while Hollywood celebrates a gang of blood thirsty slave traders. These are our new historical heroes to replace the old and much better ones. Also, the regime uses the solemn occasion of 9-11 to further demonize their political opponents. Ron DeSantis upsets the Left and libertarians with his latest speech. BYU has completed its investigation into the invisible man who silently shouted the n-word at a volleyball game. In our Daily Cancellation, that new Hillary Clinton show on AppleTV is far worse than you could have ever imagined.

      <title>Ep. 1018 - Leftists Dance On Queen Elizabeth's Grave </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, with the death of Queen Elizabeth, the Left has taken the opportunity to rant about the evils of “colonialism.” But there is one form of colonialism still happening in the world today and it is left wing ideological colonialism. Also, Podcast Movement finally issues an apology for calling Ben Shapiro’s physical presence “harmful.” Local politicians in DC panic as illegal immigrants are shipped to their “sanctuary city.” Morning Joe tries its hand at Biblical exegesis and it doesn’t go well. In our Daily Cancellation we’ll deal with a few recent attempts by the Left to finally answer the great question of our time. All of that and more today on flannel Friday.

      <title>Ep. 1017 -  'What Is A Woman' Banned As Hate Speech</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, my film What Is A Woman has been deemed dangerous hate speech and banned by a major internet platform. But how can it be hate speech to simply ask a question? Also, Memphis is terrorized by a mass shooter who had just been let out of prison. A Democrat senate candidate’s absurdly racist rant is caught on tape. Peppa Pig goes woke. And with its latest addition, the Biden Administration continues to resemble more of a traveling circus than a presidential Administration.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, my film What Is A Woman has been deemed dangerous hate speech and banned by a major internet platform. But how can it be hate speech to simply ask a question? Also, Memphis is terrorized by a mass shooter who had just been let out of prison. A Democrat senate candidate’s absurdly racist rant is caught on tape. Peppa Pig goes woke. And with its latest addition, the Biden Administration continues to resemble more of a traveling circus than a presidential Administration.

      <title>Ep. 1016 - Innocent Victims Sacrificed On The Altar Of ‘Criminal Justice Reform’</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, recent tragedies both here and in Canada reveal the utter insanity of left wing “criminal justice reform” policies. Also, the White House Press Secretary is publicly called out for her own past comments questioning the integrity of our elections. A “gender affirming” doctor admits that kids who are put on puberty blockers will never have proper sexual function as adults. The media says that if you don’t like the new Lord of the Rings series it’s because you’re racist. And Jennifer Lawrence is worth 160 million dollars and lives in a mansion in Beverly Hills but, as she explained in an interview, that doesn’t mean she isn’t oppressed.

      <title>Ep. 1014 - 'Preferred Pronoun' Nonsense Reaches A Whole New Level Of Insanity</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Time Magazine takes virtue signaling to a whole new level by using and promoting so-called Neo-pronouns. At the same time they’re also promoting a phonographic children’s book, which is the real story. We’ll discuss. Also, the White House declares that half of the country are dangerous extremists, a threat to democracy, and should be incinerated in a missile strike. Paraphrasing slightly. An important Daily Wire report reveals just who is benefiting from student loan forgiveness. Winnie The Pooh gets the horror movie treatment. And a Duke volleyball player says she was the victim of racist harassment during a match. You’ll never guessed what happens next. Actually you will.

      <description>Is the GOP on the verge of blowing the predicted midterm red wave? Will the raid on Mar-a-Lago ultimately be another Mueller Report dud?

      <title>Ep. 1013 - The Gender Surgeon Who Will Butcher Children Of Any Age  </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we have reported on many doctors who butcher children but today I’ll tell you about the worst one yet. This one says he does not abide by any age limit at all. Also, Joe Biden tries to rewrite history and cast the Democrats as the party of law and order. The Democratic governor of Minnesota also tries to rewrite history, claiming that the school shutdowns never happened. We all imagined it, apparently. A brave young man shows up at a girl’s basketball tournament and completely dominates. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the pundit who has decided to die on the hill of defending gender surgeries for children.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we have reported on many doctors who butcher children but today I’ll tell you about the worst one yet. This one says he does not abide by any age limit at all. Also, Joe Biden tries to rewrite history and cast the Democrats as the party of law and order. The Democratic governor of Minnesota also tries to rewrite history, claiming that the school shutdowns never happened. We all imagined it, apparently. A brave young man shows up at a girl’s basketball tournament and completely dominates. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the pundit who has decided to die on the hill of defending gender surgeries for children.

      <title>Ep. 1012 - Diversity Seminars On The Moon </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, amid sky-high inflation, the Biden Administration wants us to take solace in the fact that the Federal Reserve is more diverse and gayer than it’s ever been. Today we’ll talk about diversity and whether it’s something really worth celebration. Also, Republicans are losing their grip on the midterms. Why is this happening and how can the trend be reversed? John Fetterman says that voter ID is racist because black people don’t know how to get driver’s licenses. A school in Wisconsin reintroduces corporal punishment. And the New York Times announces that maternal instinct is a myth invented by the patriarchy.

      <title>Ep. 1011 - A Cover Up To Protect Child Abusers</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we know that children’s hospitals across the country are drugging and mutilating kids. And now we’re seeing the lengths they’ll go to cover up this fact. Also, Lizzo wins big at the VMAs and uses the opportunity to complain about her oppression. The geniuses in Los Angeles have invented a new way to destroy their city: require expensive hotels to house the homeless. Apple TV has a new show coming out that will make you beg for the sweet release of death. Heterosexuals march for straight pride in California. And a TikToker explains why frolicking in the rain is, you guessed it, racist.

      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden officially announces a 300 billion dollar vote buying scheme with his student loan forgiveness plan. And yet the Administration has not been able to defend this morally and financially catastrophic policy. We’ll discuss. Also, Ron DeSantis provokes more outrage with his comments about Dr. Fauci. A woman sues her psychiatrist for signing off on a gender transition after just one meeting with him. George Foreman is accused of sexual assault 50 years ago. Is there no statute of limitations on accusations like this? And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with social media influencers who use their children for clout.

      <title>Ep. 1008 - When Far Left Activists Masquerade As Pediatricians</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, you want to be able to trust your child’s pediatrician, but the fact is that the entire pediatric field has been captured by the far left. You only have to do a little bit of digging in the American Academy of Pediatrics to see how bad the corruption is. Also, Biden prepares to make inflation significantly worse with his “loan forgiveness” plan. A scientist tries to explain the concept of human biology to students at Berkeley. The Democrat senate candidate in Pennsylvania has actual brain damage and can’t even speak. States move to abolish forced prison labor, but is that a good idea? And in our Daily Cancellation, we have a story so incomprehensibly stupid that you might think I’m making it up.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, you want to be able to trust your child’s pediatrician, but the fact is that the entire pediatric field has been captured by the far left. You only have to do a little bit of digging in the American Academy of Pediatrics to see how bad the corruption is. Also, Biden prepares to make inflation significantly worse with his “loan forgiveness” plan. A scientist tries to explain the concept of human biology to students at Berkeley. The Democrat senate candidate in Pennsylvania has actual brain damage and can’t even speak. States move to abolish forced prison labor, but is that a good idea? And in our Daily Cancellation, we have a story so incomprehensibly stupid that you might think I’m making it up.

Stop giving your money to woke corporations that hate you. Get your Jeremy’s Razors today at jeremysrazors.com.

      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media celebrates the “youngest trans model” in the country. The child is only ten and his story, far from inspirational, is tragic and terrifying. Also, after a disastrous career, Dr Fauci finally decides to go away. A university sets up black-only housing to protect black students from “white violence.” The Toronto police brag about seizing a firearm that was manufactured during the French and Indian war. Michael Jackson fans are mad at Harry Styles. And in our Daily Cancellation, can college students name our country’s capital? Do they even know we have a capital?

      <title>Ep. 1006 - Criminals Should Go To Prison, And Other Controversial Opinions </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a man who’d already been arrested 41 times in New York City is arrested again for violent assault. We know that Leftist DAs are allergic to punishing violent criminals, but why is the Left so determined to enable and spread crime and anarchy? I think I know why. Also, the Biden Administration mulls its options as the student loan pause nears its expiration date. A Christian private school causes outrage by instating Christian policies and rules. Brian Stelter haș his final, emotional show with CNN. And we’re told that a new trend is taking the workforce by storm. It’s called quiet quitting. What is it and is it as stupid as it sounds?

      <title>Ep. 1005 - Using Racism To Prevent Racism </title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Minneapolis school district instates a policy of laying off white teachers before black teachers. This is supposed to prevent systemic racism. But how do you prevent a thing from happening by doing that very thing? Also, the Democrats double down on their favorite strategy: emotional blackmail. Tragedy strikes CNN, and thus the entire nation. Sam Harris says that sometimes you have to subvert democracy in order to save it. Does that make sense? In our Daily Cancellation, the new feminist She-Hulk show premiers, and it’s about as insufferable as you expect.

      <title>Ep. 1004 - 'Inciting Violence' By Telling The Truth</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Big Tech has begun banning accounts who they say are inciting violence against medical clinics that butcher and castrate children. But if criticism is incitement, then aren’t we victims of it also? Plus, public health authorities finally admit that monkeypox is a sexually transmitted disease. This raises some extremely disturbing questions about the pets and children that have contracted it. Also, Mike Pence calls on conservatives to stop attacking the FBI. He’s missing the point and I’ll explain why. Pediatricians speak out anonymously against the transing of kids. In our Daily Cancellation, students at the University of Virginia want all mention of their school’s founder erased.

      <title>Ep. 1003 - The LGBT Cult Recruits The Dead</title>
      <description>Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm 

Today on The Matt Walsh Show, the LGBT cult is not satisfied to simply indoctrinate everyone living on the Earth today. Now they are setting out to posthumously recruit the dead. We’ll talk about that today. Also, Liz Cheney goes down in flames and humiliates herself. Dr. Oz goes to the grocery store and humiliates himself. The IRS trains agents to use deadly force, but based on the footage from this training session, I don’t think we have much to worry about. In our Daily Cancellation, Serena Williams announces her retirement and of course whines about sexism on the way out the door.

      <title> Ep. 1002 - I Am A Terrorist, According To The Left </title>
      <description>Click here to watch the member exclusive portion of my show:: https://utm.io/ueR8I   

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, according to the Left I am a literal terrorist for criticizing them, and so are you. But this is a special kind of terrorism they just made up. Also, Fauci declares himself a “symbol” of integrity and truth. More horrifying videos from Boston Children’s Hospital come to light describing the sorts of Frankenstein gender-affirmation procedures they inflict on their patients. The EU makes another pitch for eating bugs. In our daily cancellation, an author takes heat for criticizing the increasing trend towards remote work. But is there some merit to his criticisms?

      <title>Ep. 1001 - The Trans Militants Must Be Stopped</title>
      <description>Click here to join Member Block: https://utm.io/ueR8I

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, children’s hospitals around the country are butchering, mutilating, and sterilizing their young patients. New videos reveal just how widespread and depraved this practice is. And that brings us to an important question: what are we going to do about it? I have some ideas. Also, more information is released about the FBI’s fishing expedition at Mar A Lago. And CBS has figured out why kids these days are fat. It’s because of climate change. In our Daily Cancellation, Kamala Harris tries to explain the concept of equity. It doesn’t go well. But in fairness to her, there is no coherent way to explain it.

      <title>Ep. 1000 - The DOJ Declares War On The Right </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a fully weaponized FBI raids the home of a former president and future 2024 opponent. Is this totally unprecedented and shocking, as most on the right are saying? Or is it a totally predictable turn of events in a country where all of our institutions have been captured by the Left? Also, speaking of captured institutions, the Democrats are building an army of IRS agents to make your life miserable. Plus, a mom looks on and cheers as her child works the stripper pole at a Pride event. In our Daily Cancellation, a trans activist announces plans to break multiple federal laws by distributing prescription hormone pills to minors through the mail.

      <title>Ep. 999 - Arrested For Making Trans People Feel Sad</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, British police are now carting people away in handcuffs for the crime of causing trans people to feel anxiety. If you think this madness isn’t coming to the United States, you’ve got another thing coming. Also, Ron DeSantis proves yet again why he is the most effective Republican leader in the country. And a drag queen performed for kids at a church in New York. But the story only gets worse from there, somehow. In our Daily Cancellation, the saga of racist parade mascots continues.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, British police are now carting people away in handcuffs for the crime of causing trans people to feel anxiety. If you think this madness isn’t coming to the United States, you’ve got another thing coming. Also, Ron DeSantis proves yet again why he is the most effective Republican leader in the country. And a drag queen performed for kids at a church in New York. But the story only gets worse from there, somehow. In our Daily Cancellation, the saga of racist parade mascots continues.

      <title>Ep. 998 - 'Gender Identity' Is Narcissism By Another Name </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a “gender specialist” is caught on tape admitting that girls as young as 12 are having their breasts chopped off. One seemingly absurd and unimportant headline in the news today only further reveals the brutality and insanity of this practice. Also, voters in Kansas vote to protect the so-called constitutional right to abortion. How could this have happened in Kansas of all places? We’ll discuss. And Whoopi Goldberg laments that college graduates are starving to death because of their student loans. If that’s true, doesn’t it only further prove that college is a terrible investment? Plus, the LA Times promotes “death with dignity,” also known as suicide. The latest superhero film is so bad that the studio refuses to even release it. And in our Daily Cancellation, I respond to continued attacks from a conservative gun rights activist who claims that I’m hurting the conservative movement more than helping.

      <title>Ep. 997 - Public Health Experts Recommend Orgies During Monkeypox Outbreak</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, public health experts encourage gay men to continue having orgies and attending fetish festivals in spite of monkeypox. What exactly explains the incredible contrast between the monkeypox response and the covid response? I have a theory. Also, reptilian demon spawn George Soros pledges to continue funding and facilitating the violent chaos in our cities, more victims of alleged Sesame Street racism step forward (and demand cash), Gordon Ramsey faces backlash as TikTokers discover with horror where their food comes from, and in our Daily Cancellation, even Beyonce is not safe from the woke mob. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 996 - White Slaves, And Other Inconvenient Historical Facts</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the outrage mob is coming after me because I mentioned the forbidden historical fact that white people were slaves too. But why is this fact forbidden? And why does it matter? We’ll discuss. Also, the Biden Administration gears up to “forgive” student loans. And by “forgive” we mean “transfer to loans to people who didn’t take them out.” Plus, a Democrat congresswoman flips off her Republican colleague and then cries sexism to excuse herself. In our Daily Cancellation, an artist goes viral with dozens of comics bitterly complaining about her husband. We’ll talk about all of that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 995 - The Eco Friendly City Of The Future Is A Dystopian Hellscape</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a vision for an eco-friendly city of the future that resembles a human termite colony. The Powers That Be want us all crammed together, eating bugs, and hopped up on drugs. We’ll talk about that today. Also, Joe Biden prepares to declare monkeypox a public health emergency. But is it? Or is it an emergency only for people who engage in certain types of behavior? Plus a shocking poll from 1997 reveals just how far we’ve fallen with race relations. And in our Daily Cancellation, a reality show is under fire for not featuring enough ugly people. Are ugly people the new marginalized minority and favored victim group? I certainly hope so.

      <title>Ep. 994 - When Parents Lose Custody For Refusing To Trans Their Kids </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the trans cult has a powerful ally in the courts. More and more, we’re seeing courts take custody away from parents who will not affirm their children as trans. Today we’ll talk about one especially harrowing and tragic example. Also, Joe Biden continues his transition into a ventriloquist dummy. We’re starting to see some early primary polling data, and it’s a hilarious disaster for the democrats. Pete Buttigieg says his feelings are hurt that not everyone agrees with his definition of marriage. CNN claims that Biden can save all life on earth with an executive order. And in our Daily Cancellation, Kamala Harris unveils the latest, most cutting edge innovation in the field of virtue signaling.

      <title>Ep. 993 - Environmentalism Gets Even More Genocidal </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as climate change alarmists become more frantic about our alleged impending doom, they have also started to sound more and more genocidal. We’ll discuss. Plus, the Left now claims that abortion bans are a racist conspiracy to ensure that more white babies are born. Of course this claim completely contradicts all of the facts. And Tucker Carlson is criticized for urging young people to get married and have kids. In our Daily Cancellation, a tragic story of sexism and patriarchy. It’ll be hard to talk about, but we must. All of that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 992 - The Groomers Want To Ban You From Calling Them Groomers</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Big Tech is now hunting down and banning anyone who accuses LGBT activists of “grooming.” Why aren’t we allowed to say that? Well, because it’s true. Also, more fallout from the bombshell report revealing that Big Pharma has been lying for years about the anti-depressants it sells. Plus, we’ll check in on a local news segment with an “HR expert” about the correct approach to preferred pronouns in the workplace. And Democrats in the House pass the Right To Contraception Act, codifying our alleged God given right to birth control, and destroying religious religion, not to mention common sense, in the process.

      <title>Ep. 991 - Another Massive Big Pharma Scam Revealed</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Big Pharma has millions of people hooked on antidepressants but a bombshell new study reveals that everything they told us about the drugs is false. This is just the latest Big Pharma scam to be exposed. Also, speaking of Big Pharma fails, Joe Biden has been vaccinated three times and yet still contracted COVID. This was announced a day after the president seemed to say that he has cancer. What is that all about? Plus, AOC tries to defend herself against the charge that she faked being in handcuffs. Dave Chapelle’s upcoming show is moved to a different venue after trans activists complained. In our Daily Cancellation, a lesbian bar in Portland falls victim to the woke mob, in hilarious fashion.

      <title>Ep. 990 - Democrats Vote To Redefine Marriage, Republicans Obediently Agree</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, top HHS official Rachel Levine appears on TV again this week to push castration and sterilization on kids. But instead of being a high ranking federal official, Levine should be in prison. Also, 47 Republicans get on board with the federal government redefining marriage. Many people on the Right have changed their minds on the marriage issue in recent years. But why? What compelling argument convinced them? And the heroic Squad, led by AOC, are arrested and frog marched in front of cameras with invisible handcuffs. A harrowing scene. Plus, CNN discovers something known as “summer,” and blames it on climate change.

      <title>Ep. 989 - The Trans Cult Officially Rewrites The Dictionary</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as the Left continues to use 1984 as more of an instruction manual than a warning, trans activists have successfully bullied Webster’s dictionary into changing the definition of “female,” though the new definition makes no sense. And that’s not the most Orwellian thing happening this week. Gender activists are also pushing anthropologists to impose gender theory onto the corpses of our ancestors. Plus, congressional Democrats make the case for packing the court, the LA Times gets in trouble for acknowledging the solar power isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and in our Daily Cancellation mass hysteria and outrage as a Sesame Street character is accused of committing a hate crime against a black child.

      <title>Ep. 988 - BLM’s Latest Canonization Effort Falls Apart </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, BLM chooses its latest martyr but things don’t work out as they expect when his female victim shows up at the protest to speak out. Also, the CEO of Starbucks shuts down stores in a number of major cities, declaring that America is now “unsafe.” But is America unsafe or is it specifically Democrat-controlled cities that are unsafe? And Democrats declare that “we’re all going to die” after their latest global warming bill fails to pass. Plus, Marvel fans call for a trigger warning before the new Thor movie. And in our daily cancellation, the New York Times has a report about “hotness.”

      <title>Ep. 987 - The Tran-Age Community Now Demands Acceptance </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the trans-age adult baby community cries out for acceptance. On what basis can our culture deny them? Also, big fat booty gate takes more twists and turns. It has been revealed that AOC called the cops five times on the comedian who commented on her Latinx booty. Plus, confidence in the education system has fallen to a historic low, which is good news. Parents throw a gender reveal party for their eight year old. In our Daily Cancellation, Gwen Stefani is the latest white chick to offend the cultural appropriation police.

      <title>Ep. 986 - The Democrat Freak Show Hearings   </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, another congressional hearing about abortion. This one features liberals refusing to denounce infanticide, refusing to define the word woman, and once again claiming that men can get pregnant. It has been a very instructive spectacle, if nothing else. Also, AOC is the victim of an outrageous and violent attack after a comedian mildly heckles her for 10 seconds. And a parent at a school board meeting is told that it would be illegal to read out loud some of the material that the school board has approved for children in their district to read. Plus, Amazon bans me from advertising my book on its platform, again. And car companies are now charging you subscription fees to access the features in the vehicle that you already paid for.

      <title>Ep. 985 - A Nation Divided Over Pregnant Men  </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the chasmic divide between the two sides in the culture war was put on full display during a Senate hearing in which a college professor claimed that men can get pregnant. Also, JK Rowling officially disavows me and breaks my heart in the process. She says that I’m really no different from a trans activist. But today we’ll talk about why that charge could more rightly be leveled at left wing feminists like herself. And a disturbing video goes viral showing two very young children in the inner city assaulting two police officers. What hope do kids have when they’re raised like that? Plus, John Bolton admits to planning coups in foreign countries while a remarkably incurious Jake Tapper sits and nods along. In our Daily Cancellation, Gavin Newsom signs a law that will open gun manufacturers up to lawsuits.

      <title>Ep. 984 - Dr. Jill Biden, PhD Reaches Out To The Taco Community </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Jill Biden reaches out to Hispanic voters by comparing them to tacos. For some reason it didn’t go over well. Plus, JK Rowling continues to experience backlash for committing the sin of speaking to me. And the creator of Friends embarks on a global apology tour to atone for all of the un-woke sins her show committed all of those years ago. Also, do you remember that story about Border Patrol agents whipping Haitian immigrants? A 500 page report now confirms what was obvious to anyone with eyes: it never happened. In our Daily Cancellation, can a morbidly obese person still have thin privilege?

      <title>Ep. 983 - My Argument With JK Rowling </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a pop singer lasts about half a week after provocatively declaring that women are females. Her cave and surrender were pathetic and embarrassing and inevitable. Today we’re going to talk about why cowards like this are the real villains. Also, as the Biden Administration tries to recover from Biden’s Ron Burgundy moment, the contents of Hunter Biden’s iCloud are allegedly leaked on 4Chan. A female soldier openly questions her loyalty to her country after Roe is overturned. After years of bragging about all of its women priests and bishops, the Church of England now says that the word woman has no definition. And in our daily cancellation, the mainstream media finally acknowledged What Is A Woman while I was away on vacation. The resulting hit piece is even more disingenuous and ridiculous than you expect.

      <title>Ep. 981 - Biden Administration Rants About 'Women's Rights' While Erasing Women</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it went largely unnoticed but last week the Biden Administration officially proposed changes to Title IX that would legally erase women. They did this even as they scream about alleged attacks on women’s rights. Also, horror at the border as 50 people are left to die in the back of a truck after being smuggled across the border. This is what “compassionate” open borders policies gets you. And Kamala Harris launches into a transphobic rant in response to Roe. You have to hear this to believe it. Plus, more celebrities threaten us with a good time by promising to leave the country. And in our Daily Cancellation, we review the work of acclaimed best selling Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman.

      <title>Ep. 980 - Pro-Abortion Leftists Dissolve Into Delicious Puddles Of Rage And Sadness</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Leftists across the country are melting into puddles of sadness and rage over the overturning of Roe. Many major corporations are coming to their aide by promising to pay for their employees abortions. This is supposed to be empowering for women but it’s exactly the opposite. We’ll talk about why. Also, the Supreme Court is on a historic hot streak with another major and majorly correct decision coming down this morning, this one pertaining to prayer in schools. And Amazon employees protest Johnny the Walrus during the Seattle Pride Parade. In our daily cancellation, many pro-abortion women are pledging to practice abstinence in response to the Roe decision. I could not be a bigger fan of that idea. All of that, plus a very special treat for the Sweet Baby Gang that you’ll have to see to believe.

      <title>Ep. 979 - Roe Is Dead, Hallelujah</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Roe is no more. In one of the greatest moments in American history, the Supreme Court decision which codified the right to murder babies has been finally and officially overturned. I’ll have a lot to say about that today. Also, the Left continues to panic over the other great Supreme Court decision decided yesterday, this one affirming our right to carry firearms. Many very bad arguments have been made against that decision. We’ll review some of them today. Meanwhile, Eric Adams in New York says that he will ignore the Supreme Court’s decision and work to “undo” it. Is this an insurrection? Plus, Joe Biden accidentally shows off a note from his staff that shows just how bad his dementia has gotten.

      <title>Ep. 978 - Leftist Elites Want You To Stop Complaining About Our Economic Collapse </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Leftist elites have a message for average people suffering under these economic conditions: shut up and stop complaining. Also, the Supreme Court strikes down New York’s unconstitutional gun control law. Biden unveils his brilliant plan for driving gas prices down. 60 Minutes claims that a 6’2”, 230 pound male Rugby player has no physical advantage over the females he wants to compete against.

And in our Daily Cancellation, the TSA heroically saves lives by confiscating bottles of water and tubes of sunscreen, and then brags about it on Twitter.

      <title>Ep. 977 - Navy Prepares For Battle With Pronoun Training </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Navy puts out a new instructional video teaching sailors and other military members how to use and respect a person’s preferred pronouns. We have the actual instructional video, which you have to see for yourself. Also, Republicans sell out on gun control. But did they actually sell out or are they simply doing exactly what we expect them to do and what they always do? And a mother raises a quarter of a million dollars based on a horrific story of her son being bullied. The only problem is that the story doesn’t seem to be true. When will people stop falling for these scams? And in our Daily Cancellation, the Left is justifying child drag shows by comparing them to 90s cross dressing comedies like Mrs. Doubtfire. But this argument actually undermines and destroys their own premise. I’ll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 976 - Healing Racial Trauma With A 25-Foot Afro Pick</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, why did the city of New Orleans put a giant two story tall hair pick right outside city hall to honor Juneteenth? We’ll discuss. Also, the Washington Post profiles a young mother of twins in an effort to prove why abortion is good and necessary, but accidentally proves the opposite. Feminist Megan Rapino has a message for female athletes: stop complaining and just let males take over your support. That’s girl power for you, I guess. Plus, the airline industry comes up with a new and horrifying way to make your flying experience even more miserable. And in our Daily Cancellation, UC Irvine comes up with a new inclusive spelling of the word “woman,” but then worries that it’s not inclusive enough. This story is so insane that you’ll think I’m making it up, but I’m not.

      <title>Ep. 975 - Is Sanity Making A Comeback?</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, conservatives celebrate as the women’s swimming federation officially disqualifies men like Lia Thomas from competition in the future. Does this mark a return to sanity in our culture? Actually no, and I’ll explain why. Also, the new woke Toy Story film bombs at the box office and the media is perplexed. The governor of New York not so subtly encourages more violence against pro-lifers in the lead up to the Roe decision. A court declares that elephants are not people. Why was that necessary to establish? And a CNN comedian records a father’s day PSA pushing abortion. What does that have to do with father’s day?

      <title>Ep. 974 - The Appropriation And Degradation Of Womanhood </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the mayor of New York City is the latest high profile Democrat to come out in favor of drag queens at school. We’ve talked about how it’s harmful to kids to involve them in drag events. But today I want to discuss how drag attacks and demeans womanhood. Also, the CDC issues guidance for how to have sex while infected with monkeypox. Nancy Pelosi again proclaims herself a devout Catholic while shilling for abortion. A Hollywood actress explains why she chose surrogacy, and her explanation perfectly illustrates the problems with surrogacy. In our Daily Cancellation, a dog food company encourages millennials to become “pet parents” instead of real parents.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the mayor of New York City is the latest high profile Democrat to come out in favor of drag queens at school. We’ve talked about how it’s harmful to kids to involve them in drag events. But today I want to discuss how drag attacks and demeans womanhood. Also, the CDC issues guidance for how to have sex while infected with monkeypox. Nancy Pelosi again proclaims herself a devout Catholic while shilling for abortion.

      <title>Ep. 973 - Biden Wants To Make Sure More Children Are Drugged And Castrated</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Biden Administration celebrates Pride Month with executive orders meant to ensure that more children are drugged and castrated. Also, protestors interrupt a drag queen story hour and are now being investigated for a hate crime because of it. And Texas lawmakers send a letter to the White House asking for an official legal definition of the word “woman.” Based on my experience, they won’t get one. Ibram Kendi has a new book meant to indoctrinate children into the CRT cult. In our Daily Cancellation, George Washington University changes its “colonials” moniker for reasons that make no sense whatsoever.

      <title>Ep. 972 - The LGBT Cult Silences Dissent </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, detransitioners are speaking out to tell their horrifying stories revealing the reality of so-called “gender affirmation” surgery. But trans activists and Big Tech are conspiring to silence these voices. Also, pro-abortion terrorists are promising to ramp up their campaign of violence and intimidation. And Ben Shapiro causes controversy by claiming that Disney has a gay agenda, even though Disney admits that it has a gay agenda. Plus, a star NFL quarterback speaks out against the scourge of “crazy guns.” In our Daily Cancellation, a TikTok star complains after being turned away from a horse ranch because she exceeds the weight limit for horses. Well, whose fault is that?

      <title>Ep. 971 - The System Is Run By Perverts And Degenerates</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Christina Aguilera performs in a “family friendly concert” with a strap on dildo. This is just one example of extreme, over the top debauchery and degeneracy being totally normalized and institutionalized in our culture. We’re going to talk about where it all leads, and what we can do about it. Also, Karen Jean Pierre laughs off any concerns about her boss’s senility. The White House meets with Defund the Police advocates as crime ravages communities across the country. A twitter thread goes viral detailing the horrifying reality of “gender affirming surgeries.” And in our Daily Cancellation, Lizzo is forced to issue an apology and change and reissue her latest single due to controversy over the language in the song. But you’ll never guess which word has people so upset.

      <title>Ep. 970 - Fox News Celebrates Pride Month By Pushing Extreme Trans Propaganda  </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Fox News airs far left extreme trans propaganda. What is going on over at Fox, and how should we respond? We’ll talk about it. Also, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate agree on their new gun control plan which includes “red flag laws.” What could go wrong with red flag laws? I’ll explain. Plus, Justin Trudeau announces that Canadians no longer have a right to self-protection. His words exactly. In our Daily Cancellation, Rolling Stone publishes a hit piece on my film What Is A Woman. But did the writer of the piece actually watch the movie? The answer will shock you.

      <title>Ep. 969 - Journalist Tries To Debunk ‘What Is A Woman,’ Fails Miserably</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it finally happened. One brave left wing journalist watched and reviewed What Is A Woman. They didn’t like it, shockingly. Also, the January 6th hearings were held last night and nobody cares. I certainly don’t. More shocking and damning revelations about the law enforcement response, or lack thereof, in Uvalde. A former NBA star opens up about his “trans” child. Parents sue Instagram for the damage it did to their daughter. And in our Daily Cancellation, Old Navy tries to virtue signal to the body positivity crowd and it backfires in a major way.

      <title>Ep. 968 - The Leftist Plot To Destroy Childhood Innocence </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a proposed law in Texas has propelled the Left to openly defend child drag shows. One such defender says that childhood innocence is a myth and fueled by prejudice. A revealing admission. We’ll talk about it. Also, a crazed leftist tries to kill Brett Kavanaugh, but you’d never know it if you rely on corporate media for your news. Plus, Joe Biden disintegrates on live TV while talking to Jimmy Kimmel. Joy Behar claims that black people don’t have guns. We’ll fact check that claim. And a DisneyLand employee is feeling the heat for intervening in a marriage proposal. In our Daily Cancellation, a popular YouTuber debunks my film What Is A Woman. Or so I’m told. We’ll take a look and see how he did.

      <title>Ep. 967 - Stand And Salute The Pride Flag You Bigots</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it’s not enough to tolerate, accept, or even celebrate. The LGBT Left demands that you participate, which is why some Major League Baseball players are getting backlash for not wearing an LGBT pride flag on their uniforms. We’ll discuss. Also, a lawmaker in California now says he wants drag to be a mandatory curriculum requirement for children in school. These groomer freaks are officially out of control. And a Hollywood actor gives a speech about guns during the White House press briefing for some reason. Plus, the leftist DA of San Francisco is recalled for turning his city into a crime plagued wasteland. But will liberal voters actually learn their lesson? I doubt it. We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 966 - Trans Activists Want To Kill Me For Making A Documentary</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh show, trans-activists want to kill me for making What Is A Woman. They’ve told me this themselves. What does that say about gender ideology? Also, Texas legislators move to ban child drag shows. That’s a law that shouldn’t be needed, but it is. And AOC officially endorsed the term Latinx. In our Daily Cancellation, a college professor cancels pirates. Including fictional pirates. Apparently they weren’t woke enough. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh show.

      <title>Ep. 965 - It's Time To Confront And Shame The Groomers</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, horrifying footage of a drag show for children at a gay bar in Texas over the weekend. How is this happening? And how is it happening in Texas? We’ll talk about that, and the one bright spot in this story: the protesters outside confronting and shaming the groomers. Also, a criminal steals a car, runs over a mother and her child, tries to flee the scene, and will now spend all of five months in juvenile detention for it. And a mother who rushed into Robb Elementary to save her children while police stood outside is speaking out. Plus, another sneak peak of a scene from my film What Is A Woman, and in our Daily Cancellation, we sent screeners of the film to mainstream film critics. They responded and were not happy.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, horrifying footage of a drag show for children at a gay bar in Texas over the weekend. How is this happening? And how is it happening in Texas? We’ll talk about that, and the one bright spot in this story: the protesters outside confronting and shaming the groomers. Also, a criminal steals a car, runs over a mother and her child, tries to flee the scene, and will now spend all of five months in juvenile detention for it. And a mother who rushed into Robb Elementary to save her children while police stood outside is speaking out. Plus, another sneak peak of a scene from my film What Is A Woman, and in our Daily Cancellation, we sent screeners of the film to mainstream film critics. They responded and were not happy.

      <title>Ep. 964 - The Left Tries To Sabotage 'What Is A Woman' Premiere But Fail Miserably </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the premiere of my film What Is A Woman is an enormous success, no thanks to the cyberattack meant to shut the film down. The Left really doesn’t want you to see this movie. I’ll explain why. Also, NASCAR again bends the knee to the woke mob. Amber Heard officially puts the last nail in the Me Too coffin. Abusive parents explain how their two year old daughter chose her own gender. And in our Daily Cancellation, a trans activist explains why you are morally obligated to be sexually attracted to trans people. 

Yesterday, Daily Wire presented my new documentary “What Is A Woman?” Watch now at whatisawoman.com.

      <description>Is having a penis all that it really takes to be a modern woman? When scientists a hundred years from now dig up these modern women’s bones and determine they were in fact male based on DNA, will they be canceled and cast from society for their clearly bigoted findings? Are we ever going to be able to answer life’s most difficult question: What is a woman?

      <title>Ep. 963 - 'What Is A Woman' Arrives Just In Time For Pride Month</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the holy month of pride month begins today and we’re kicking it off by waging an all out assault on gender ideology with my new film, which premieres tonight. We’ll talk about it today. Also, the White House responds to the various crises plaguing the nation by inviting the Korean pop group BTS to the press briefing. Plus, a female inmate who fears for her life after being locked in prison with biological males speaks out. Her story is truly outrageous and terrifying. JD Vance earns ridicule from the Left for making some very correct observations about pornography. And in our Daily Cancellation, yet another Hollywood actress is traumatized because a few people online criticized her.

      <title>Ep. 962 - Dragging Kids Into The LGBT Cult</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, one day out from the premier of What Is A Woman? we’ll talk about a few stories that highlight why this film is necessary. Speaking of which, Lia Thomas was interviewed by Good Morning America where he defended his decision to steal opportunities from female swimmers. But in an exclusive clip from What Is A Woman?, which we’ll play today, a female swimmer on Thomas’s team reveals what it’s really like behind the scenes. Also, the mask comes off as the Left pushes for a ban on handguns. They just instated one in Canada, in fact. Meanwhile, new revelations about the Texas shooter show just how many red flags were ignored before he committed his massacre. 

Join us tomorrow at 8pm EST for the world premiere of my new documentary “What Is A Woman”: whatisawoman.com

      <title>Ep. 961 - Groomers Kick It Up A Notch With Public School Drag Shows</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the latest groomer innovation is sexually suggestive drag shows at high schools. There is more than one example of this kind of thing from just this month. We’ll talk about it today. Also, more questions about the law enforcement response to the shooting in Texas. Police officials have made some very damning statements in an effort to vindicate themselves. Also, the secretary of Education endorses gender transitioning children in school without parental consent. And in our Daily Cancellation, a school district bans the word “chief” because it appropriates from Native Americans.

      <title>Ep. 960 - Our Kids Need Fathers, Not 'Gun Control' </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, there is a common thread linking the mass shooting in Texas to so many other mass shootings and much of the crime and violence in our society: fatherlessness. This is the aspect of the problem that the media doesn’t want to talk about, but we will. Also, reports now suggest that cops on the scene at the shooting took upwards of 90 minutes to neutralize the shooter. How could that have happened? And does this disprove the “good guy with a gun” concept, as the Left is claiming? Of course not. I’ll explain. Plus, Barack Obama puts out what may be the worst tweet of the decade. Beto makes an ass of himself once again. Another teacher records herself grooming her students. And in our Daily Cancellation, is it true that we’re the only country where these kinds of mass shootings happen?

      <title>Ep. 959 - Biden Immediately Exploits And Politicizes Another School Shooting</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, horrific tragedy strikes in Texas as Democrats immediately exploit dead children to score political points. I have a lot to say about all of this. Also, Nancy Pelosi finally responds to the archbishop who banned her from taking communion. Her response only further demonstrates why she deserved the ban. And record turnouts for the Georgia primaries yesterday. Does that disprove the Democrats’ “voter suppression” narrative? Stacey Abrams says no. Plus, we have some exciting and fascinating space-related news whether you like it or not. And for our daily cancellation, what is a super fat and an infinifat? You’re going to find out today. All of that and much more on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 958 - Like A Creepy Neighbor, State Farm Grooms Children</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, State Farm is caught trying to sexualize and indoctrinate children. Just another groomer corporation to add to the list. Also, Ricky Gervais mocks gender ideology in his latest Netflix special, and the Left is not pleased. And a male teacher brags about wearing panties to school so he can come out to his students. Plus, Whoopi Goldberg tries to chime in on the Nancy Pelosi communion situation and humiliates herself in the process. In our Daily Cancellation, a white MLB player is suspended for making a racist comment. Except the only problem is that the comment was not even remotely racist and you’d have to be a lunatic to think otherwise.

Plus, Whoopi Goldberg tries to chime in on the Nancy Pelosi communion situation and humiliates herself in the process. In our Daily Cancellation, a white MLB player is suspended for making a racist comment. Except the only problem is that the comment was not even remotely racist and you’d have to be a lunatic to think otherwise.

      <title>Ep. 957 - You Can't Make Me Care About Monkeypox </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media has found a new virus to fear-monger over: Monkeypox. But the “public health” messaging around this disease has been quite a bit different from what we heard for COVID. I’ll explain why. Also, Nancy Pelosi is finally told that she has to stop receiving communion at church on account of her advocacy for baby butchery. A newly engaged AOC gives her thoughts on the life question, and her thoughts are as stupid as you’ve come to expect. A gender-affirming psychotherapist says that sex education in kindergarten is too late. It should really start at birth. And in our Daily Cancellation, a trans activist reacts to my What Is A Woman trailer, and is not too pleased.

      <title>Ep. 956 - Musk Gets MeToo'd</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Elon Musk gets the Me Too treatment. But any semi-intelligent person can see this smear campaign for what it is. Also, a new report says that well over 100 teachers have been arrested for sex crimes just this year alone. Are we finally going to start talking about the public school pedophilia epidemic? And a groomer tries to prompt her young son to promote cross dressing, but the conversation doesn’t go as she planned. And the New York Times introduces a new euphemism: Non-consensus realities. What does that mean? In our daily cancellation, the most prominent trans medical organization in the world is now calling for us to affirm eunuch as a valid gender identity. 

Tune in for Ben’s Sunday Special with Jonathan Isaac this weekend anywhere you listen to podcasts.

      <title>Ep. 955 - Biden Visits Buffalo. Still Has No Time For Waukesha.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden goes to Buffalo to exploit the dead for his own political gain. Also, a pro-abortion activist at a congressional hearing claims that men can get pregnant. There are several important clips from the hearing that we’ll watch and discuss today. The media is now panicking over a new virus, monkeypox. Should we join them in their hysteria? And MSNBC warns that homeschooling is a secret plot to destroy the public education system. They’re wrong. It’s not a secret. In our Daily Cancellation, a theologian says that it’s better for black babies to be aborted than adopted by white families. This is what passes for theology these days.

      <title>Ep. 954 - A Government-Funded Sex Workshop For Public School Teachers</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, teachers in Philadelphia were encouraged to attend an outrageously graphic and perverse sex workshop. You have to hear some of these details to believe them. Also, congress held the first public hearings on UFOs in over 50 years, but much to my great shock, dismay, and despair, nobody seems to care. Plus, we analyze the election results from last night to see what we can learn from them. Marvel announces its new feminist female Hulk. And in our Daily Cancellation, a sports writer complains that black athletes are the victims of white supremacy because white fans pay money to watch them play.

      <title>Ep. 953 - School District Threatens To Expel Students For ‘Malicious Misgendering’ </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, schools in Virginia will soon be expelling students as young as kindergarten for the crime of “malicious misgendering.” Also, the new White House Press Secretary is black and gay and expects to be applauded for it. She also happens to be terrible at her job. Democrats say it’s a racist “conspiracy theory” that they hate so-called “whiteness,” but we’ll listen to their actual words on the subject today.

      <title>Ep. 952 - A Women's March Where No One Knows What A Woman Is</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we hijacked the women’s march this weekend to let all of the attendees know about my new film What Is A Woman. Today I’ll play the full trailer for you and we’ll talk about why the film is needed and what we hope to accomplished with it. Also, speaking of why the film is needed, three middle school boys have been charged with sexual harassment for “misgendering” a classmate. And the media vultures immediately set to work politicizing a mass shooting in Buffalo. Plus, the mayor of Chicago poses for embarrassing photo ops in Texas while violence rips her city apart. And in our Daily Cancellation, an immigrant posts a sign in his Uber instructing passengers not to ask him where he’s from because that question makes him “uncomfortable” and “sick.”

      <title>Ep. 951 - Go Home And Get A Family</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Amy Coney Barrett’s neighbor has some great advice for the protesters who showed up at her house. Also, the pro-life organization whose office was burned and defaced now reveals the hateful messages that leftists have been leaving since the attack. And a self-professed “queer surgeon” defends his practice of chopping the breasts off of teenage girls. Plus, CPS shows up after parents enter their six year old into a marathon. Apparently you can’t run a marathon with your six year old, but you can change his gender. And in our Daily Cancellation, a popular Twitch streamer nearly burns down her house live on camera while trying to cook a steak. Maybe it’s time they start teaching basic life skills in school again.

      <title>Ep. 950 - If Only Babies Had The Same Rights As Sea Turtles</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Democrats attempt to legalize abortion through every stage of pregnancy up until birth, nationwide. Meanwhile, people are getting sent to prison for killing bald eagles and harassing turtle eggs. Our law — and Democrat policies — literally place animals and bugs above human beings. We’ll discuss. Plus, Handmaid’s Tale cosplayers show up at Amy Coney Barrett’s house and proceed to embarrass themselves. Because what else could they possibly do? And a Republican senate candidate is caught on a tape in shocking video claiming that the gender pay gap is a myth. This is a huge scandal. He’s also completely right. For our Daily Cancellation, we will attempt to make sense of the latest gender innovation: cake gender.

      <title>Ep. 949 - Sending Billions To Ukraine While Babies In Our Own Country Run Out Of Food</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, politicians in D.C. ship 40 billion dollars off to Ukraine while babies in our country don’t even have enough food to eat. The priorities here seem to be wildly out of whack. Also, the White House explicitly encourages more illegal protests outside of judge’s homes. The Treasury Secretary worries about the economic impact of killing fewer babies. Britney Spears fans are now worried about her mental health after mobilizing to get her freed from her conservatorship. Perhaps they should have been more careful what they wished for. And in our Daily Cancellation, a local weatherman is smeared by the national media as a racist because of something he tweeted about an NBA player. But was the comment actually racist?

But was the comment actually racist? </p><p><br></p><p>Join the Daily Wire and get 20% off your new membership with code WALSH: <a href="https://utm.io/uewvd">https://utm.io/uewvd</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a beloved LGBTQ+ and children’s author.

      <title>Ep. 948 - Target Celebrates Pride Month Early With Chest Binders For Girls</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Target gets a head start on Pride Month by announcing that they’ll now be selling chest binders for girls. What are chest binders? And how far have we slid down the slippery slope that now they’re on sale at a major big box retailer? We’ll discuss. Also, the pro-abortion pitchfork mob makes its way to Justice Alito’s house in Virginia, in spite of the fact that protesting outside of his home violates both federal law and Virginia state law. Plus, a protester gives the most honest (and also darkest and most depressing) argument for abortion that we've heard. And speaking of depressing, they’re now doing interpretative dances in the European Parliament. In our Daily Cancellation, a lawyer goes viral and is celebrated for not brushing her teeth in the morning. What is that all about?

      <title>Ep. 947 - Dems And Media Cheer While Pro-Abortion Terrorists Wreak Havoc</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, pro-abortion militants invaded churches, committed arson, harassed Supreme Court Justices at their homes, and did all of this with the implicit and sometimes explicit support of the most powerful Democrats in the country. We'll discuss. Also, we'll debunk some of the most outrageous anti-life propaganda we've heard from the media over the past week. Speaking of outrageous, a self-described "queer" teacher explains how she uses board games to sexually indoctrinate her kids. And Chet Hanks has an inspiring message for social justice warriors. Plus, we will fact check the fact checkers at NPR.

      <title>Ep. 946 - The Left Temporarily Rediscovers Biology</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left continues to struggle to find a compromise between their feminist pro-abortion talking points and their trans talking points. Also, the White House refuses to condemn “protesters” who are planning to hunt down conservative Supreme Court Justices and show up at their houses. The Johnny Depp and Amber Heard drama continues, but I think the lesson in this story is one that most people are ignoring. Trump allegedly suggested missile strikes against drug cartels. Sounds like a fine plan to me. Plus, the guy who physically assaulted Dave Chapelle on stage during a comedy show will not face felony charges, despite the fact that he was carrying a deadly weapon at the time. It’s almost like they want this kind of thing to happen more often.

      <title>Ep. 945 - ‘Pansexual’ Teacher Fired For Creepy Sexual Discussions With Kids</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a pansexual teacher is fired in Florida for discussing sexuality with her kids. Was the school justified? Of course it was, but we’ll discuss. Also, Joe Biden claims that the right to kill babies comes from God. Dr. Oz is called out for his pro-abortion views during the GOP primary debate in Pennsylvania. Dave Chapelle is assaulted on stage during a comedy show. This is becoming a trend. NASA scientists sexually harass ET with unsolicited nudes. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with what might be the dumbest and most morally debased argument in favor of abortion that we’ve heard from the left since the Supreme Court news broke. We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 944 - Dems Screech And Howl In Defense Of Baby Butchery</title>
      <description>Today on The Matt Walsh Show, we’re told that the impending decision on Roe v Wade will help the Democrats because it will galvanize their base around the abortion issue. But as we’ve seen over the past couple of days, abortion is actually the last issue Democrats want to talk about. We’ll talk about why that is. Also, Rachel Levine at HHS says that there is “no argument” against castrating children. Democrats actually want Trump back on Twitter. I wonder why? And in our Daily Cancellation, an obese woman fights for greater plus sized representation in the travel industry.

      <itunes:summary>Today on The Matt Walsh Show, we’re told that the impending decision on Roe v Wade will help the Democrats because it will galvanize their base around the abortion issue. But as we’ve seen over the past couple of days, abortion is actually the last issue Democrats want to talk about. We’ll talk about why that is. Also, Rachel Levine at HHS says that there is “no argument” against castrating children. Democrats actually want Trump back on Twitter. I wonder why? And in our Daily Cancellation, an obese woman fights for greater plus sized representation in the travel industry.

      <title>Ep. 943 - Leftist Death Cult Panics Over End Of Roe </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the baby killers are in a state of full on panic as the Supreme Court reportedly prepares to overturn Roe, abolishing the constitutional right to abortion, which was always fictional and never really existed. I have a lot to say about this, as you can imagine. Also, MSNBC warns that Nazis will take over because Elon Musk owns Twitter. Jen Psaki makes the lamest attempt yet to justify the Biden Administration’s new ministry of truth. The ruling class once again celebrates itself at the Met Gala. And in our Daily cancellation, we’ll discuss the story of a woman who left her husband after she met her “soul mate.” Not a great decision, as it turns out.

      <title>Ep. 942 - Discovery+ Goes Full Groomer With ‘Drag Kids’ Reality Show</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Discovery just announced a new show about cross dressing children called “Generation Drag.” The corporate media will continue grooming and sexualizing kids, no matter what it costs them. Also, Biden thinks the economic devastation he’s causing is hilarious. The DHS secretary tries to defend his agency's new Ministry of Truth. And in our Daily Cancellation, we meet a transqueer Latinx neurodivergent public theologian. What do any of those words mean? We’ll find out today, maybe.

      <title>Ep. 941 - The Biden Administration Uses ‘1984’ As An Instruction Manual</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Biden Administration takes its cue from Orwell, setting up its very own Ministry of Truth. We’ll discuss. And a judicial nominee admits during a confirmation hearing that her previous claims about police violence were untrue but made for “rhetorical purposes.” Plus Joe Biden continues to mentally decay on camera. Ilhan Omar speaks out for student loan forgiveness. A new film about Vikings is accused of racism because the vikings are white. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will examine a video which purports to scientifically prove the validity of transgenderism. I’m skeptical but I’ll hear them out.

      <title>Ep. 940 - Amazon's Censorship Fails To Defeat Johnny The Walrus </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Amazon pulls some dirty tricks to suppress and censor my children’s book, but it still managed to become the number one book in the entire country. Also, Joe Biden is considering a hail mary pass before the mid-terms: student loan forgiveness. We’ll talk about why that is a horrible idea. And speaking of horrible ideas, Joe Biden also tells a group of teachers that the kids in their classrooms are “their kids.” And Hollywood actress Megan Fox proudly discusses her satanic blood drinking rituals. But I was told satanism in Hollywood is a conspiracy theory.

      <title> Ep. 939 - Amazon Employees Are Traumatized By My Children’s Book</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, leaked internal videos show that my children’s book, Johnny the Walrus, has traumatized and triggered Amazon’s employees. They are literally in tears over it. It is the greatest moment of my career. We’ll talk about it today. Also, conservative accounts on Twitter see huge spikes in followers right as it’s announced that Elon Musk is buying the company. What’s going on there? And more disturbing information about the “children’s book” from the American Academy of Pediatrics that pushes chemical castration on nine year olds. Plus, a NASCAR driver is sent to sensitivity training for posting a “racist” meme. But was the meme actually racist? And in our Daily Cancellation, more leaked videos. This time it’s administrators and leftist activists meeting to game plan protests against my speech tonight at Wisconsin Superior. But why are school administrators helping to plan protests?

      <title>Ep. 938 - Terrified Leftists Cry Out In Despair As Elon Musk Takes Over Twitter </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, leftists scream out in abject terror as Elon Musks completes his purchase of Twitter. We will revel in their despair today. Also, as my children’s book Johnny the Walrus is finally released, we’ll take a look at the horrifying children’s book that is currently the best seller in the category. It’s written by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and if you’ve been paying attention, you know that’s a bad sign. Plus, a boy physically assaults a girl at a high school in Atlanta, but the students are taking the boy’s side because the girl used a naughty word. And in our Daily Cancellation, Rolling Stone has a glowing profile of “furries” who are sexually attracted to cartoon animals.

      <title>Ep. 937 - Disney Denies Grooming Accusation, But Promoted And Celebrated Child Drag Queens</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we will play the one clip that puts the debate over Disney grooming to rest and proves once and for all, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they do have an agenda to groom and indoctrinate children. Also, Elon Musk is now officially on the verge of becoming Twitter’s new owner. And Democrats move to legally bar Marjorie Taylor Greene from running for re-election. If you can’t beat them in the ballot box, just take them to court, apparently. Plus, Taylor Lorenz comes up with the lamest possible excuse to justify doxxing Libs of Tik Tok. And in our Daily Cancellation, a stay at home Dad weeps over the fact that his son is becoming “traditionally” masculine. What’s a gender-bending Dad supposed to do in that situation?

      <title>Ep. 935 - It's Time To Take Revenge On Disney</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, now that the anti-groomer bill has been passed in Florida, despite the pro-grooming efforts of Disney, Republicans in the state have moved on to punishing and exacting revenging on Disney. Some milquetoast conservatives are uncomfortable with this, but I think it’s great. Also, Jen Psaki tearfully defends the castration and mutilation of children. Piers Morgan deceptively edits an interview with Donald Trump. A public health expert recommends that you bring extra masks with you in public to hand out to strangers. And in our daily cancellation, a woman is concerned because her boyfriend has dedicated his life to digging a huge hole in the ground.

      <title>Ep. 934 - The Real Reason Why The Media Wants To Destroy Libs Of TikTok</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the leftist media tries its best to defend The Washington Post doxxing the creator of the Libs of Tik Tok account. We’ll talk about that, and also try to answer this question: Why are they bothering to go after Libs of Tik Tok at all? Also, cable news pundits are now shipping themselves off to go fight in Ukraine. A win/win perhaps? Elon Musk exposes the overpopulation hoax. A Democrat lawmaker earns props from the left for his theatrical, tearful speech protesting a bill to protect women’s sports. And as airline passengers tear off their muzzles and celebrate their freedom, the Biden Administration fights to muzzle them once again.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the leftist media tries its best to defend The Washington Post doxxing the creator of the Libs of Tik Tok account. We’ll talk about that, and also try to answer this question: Why are they bothering to go after Libs of Tik Tok at all? Also, cable news pundits are now shipping themselves off to go fight in Ukraine. A win/win perhaps? Elon Musk exposes the overpopulation hoax. A Democrat lawmaker earns props from the left for his theatrical, tearful speech protesting a bill to protect women’s sports. And as airline passengers tear off their muzzles and celebrate their freedom, the Biden Administration fights to muzzle them once again. </p><p><br></p><p>Get 30% off my collection in the Daily Wire online store using code SWAGSHACK: <a href="https://utm.io/ueuBl">https://utm.io/ueuBl</a>. </p><p><br></p><p>What is a Woman?

      <title>Ep. 933 - Paranoid Leftists Hilariously Panic As The Last Mask Mandate Falls</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, passengers rejoice as a judge strikes down the CDC mask mandate.

Also, Americans have wondered for the past two years who is really running the White House. Now we know. It’s the Easter Bunny. And a Washington Post reporter cried about being doxxed and harassed, and then proceeded to doxx and harass the anonymous person behind the Libs of Tik Tok account.

      <title>Ep. 929 - Award Winning Science Student Doesn’t Understand Basic Biology </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an award winning student of the sciences tries to debate Ben Shapiro about gender ideology, and the resulting footage shows us everything wrong with academia, the sciences, and gender ideology. Also, a black supremacist commits a terrorist attack on New York. There is a definite trend here that the media of course doesn’t want to talk about. Plus, a teacher puts on a drag show for students. And popular YouTubers face vicious backlash for comparing abortion to the holocaust. They’re right of course. But they weren’t right to apologize.

      <title>Ep. 928 - Separation Of The Leftist Church And State</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, what is the Left’s real problem with the anti-groomer efforts? It’s that we’re trying to get their religion out of the school system. A separation of the leftist church and state. Also, the Biden Administration is claiming that inflation is “Putin’s price hike.” We’ll take a look at the data and see if that claim holds up. Plus, DeSantis puts policies in place to support fatherhood in Florida, which has some leftists upset. And a male prisoner first identified as a woman and now identifies as a baby. And of course that self-identity is being respected by prison staff. In our Daily Cancellation, a libertarian magazine laments the lack of porn online. Apparently there isn’t enough of the stuff. We’ll talk about that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 927 - 'We Aren't Grooming Children,' They Cry As They Groom Children</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left insists that teachers absolutely aren’t sexually indoctrinating elementary schoolers. Yet there is video footage of teachers doing precisely that. Also, Pete Buttigieg says that children will die if he and his fellow groomers are not allowed to say whatever they want to our kids. The truth is that gender ideology, as professed by Buttigieg and others, is what will kill kids. Also, Donald Trump endorses pro-abortion, anti-gun, pro-trans Dr. Oz. And a jury refuses to convict three men entrapped by the FBI in a plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan. Plus, Sam Elliott issues the inevitable groveling apology for committing the sin of not liking a gay cowboy movie. In our Daily Cancellation, some libertarians on YouTube tried to debunk me. We’ll see how they did.

      <title>Ep. 926 - The Massive Government Coverup To Protect An Infanticidal Serial Killer</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the latest on the murder of five infants by an abortionist serial killer in DC. It’s a story that the corporate media, the local government, and the federal government has decided to completely ignore. Also, Judge Jackson is confirmed as the first black woman Supreme Court Justice, and also the first Supreme Court Justice who can’t define the word woman. A historic occasion, indeed. Plus mainstream media journalists hold a seminar on “disinformation,” but things don’t go as they planned during the Q&amp;A portion. And American Airlines has an exciting new aviation invention: buses. In our Daily Cancellation, what the hell is a bi-romantic asexual? It’s the latest LGBT innovation, and it makes no sense at all.

      <title>Ep. 925 - The Groomers Circle The Wagons Around Disney</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left circles the wagons to defend poor 100 billion-dollar Disney from the mean conservatives criticizing it. Also, the governor of Texas ships illegal immigrants to DC. And Kim Kardashian runs to the defense of a woman who beat her two year old daughter to death. Another example of twisted left-wing “compassion” looks like. Plus, a pastor at a church in Iowa offers a prayer to the “God of pronouns.”

      <title>Ep. 924 - They Hate When We Call Them Groomers, So Keep Doing It </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the people who’ve been calling us Nazis for decades are now concerned that “groomer” is a vicious, unfair label. After years of labeling everyone in sight, they are finally getting a taste of their own medicine and they don’t like it. The only difference is that, unlike Nazi, the groomer label is actually true. Also, the pro-life group that blew the whistle about illegal abortions in DC held a press conference yesterday. Some of the additional details they revealed are absolutely bone chilling. Plus, the only Joe Biden video that might actually make you feel sorry for him, if fleetingly. And if you thought Woke Oreos were bad, wait until you see what the latest virtue signaling snack company has come up with.

      <title>Ep. 923 - The Groomers Are Loud And Proud</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, New York City attempts to lure all of the groomers who are upset about Florida’s anti-grooming law. Meanwhile, the sexual indoctrinators in the public school system continue to out themselves in droves. Also, DC authorities continue to refuse to investigate the murder of five fully developed infants in the city. And you heard about Corn Pop, now Biden has a story to share about Big Mama. Plus, Oreos go woke. In our Daily Cancellation, Madonna has apparently turned into a lizard. But it’s better than looking old, she thinks.

Meanwhile, the sexual indoctrinators in the public school system continue to out themselves in droves. Also, DC authorities continue to refuse to investigate the murder of five fully developed infants in the city. And you heard about Corn Pop, now Biden has a story to share about Big Mama. Plus, Oreos go woke. In our Daily Cancellation, Madonna has apparently turned into a lizard. But it’s better than looking old, she thinks. </p><p><br></p><p>Order Andrew Klavan’s new book: <em>The Truth and Beauty</em> today: <a href="https://utm.io/uer2e">https://utm.io/uer2e</a> .</p><p><br></p><p>The magic has left the kingdom.

      <title>Ep. 922 - The Shocking Case That Reveals The True Horrors Of Abortion</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, horrific photographic evidence suggests that a prominent abortion clinic in DC is killing babies after they’re born. But the DC government is running cover for the clinic and refusing to investigate. We’ll discuss. Also, Elon Musk buys a big stake in Twitter. And liberal female journalists cry about being traumatized by mean comments on the internet. The Daily Wire gets a mention on SNL. And Brian Stelter on CNN shocks no one by coming out in defense of child groomers. In our Daily Cancellation, a conservative pro-life website criticizes me for my Dr Phil appearance. Why? Well I read the article and I’m still not sure.

      <title>Ep. 921 - The Most Deranged And Disgraceful Presidential Administration In History </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Biden Administration earned yesterday the ignoble distinction of being the first Administration in history to fly a trans flag outside of a government building. They’re also the first to officially endorse chemically castrating children. Also, Kamala Harris once again humiliates herself by trying to say sentences out loud. Biden receives his fourth covid shot live on camera. Caitlin Jenner gets a job with Fox News. A deep, dark secret about Clarence Thomas is exposed. You have to see this to believe it. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will for the last time revisit Slapgate to talk about the real villain in that whole debacle who has so far been left off the hook.

      <title>Ep. 920 - Biden Says You Can Now Identify As Gender 'X' On Your Passport</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, in honor of “trans day of visibility,” the Biden Administration has made a number of policy changes, including allowing you to list yourself as the gender of “x” on your passport. How exactly is that going to work? Also, backlash grows against Disney’s self-professed gay agenda, as we at the Daily Wire announce our response to leftism in children’s entertainment. And a lesbian couple sues a fertility clinic for giving them a boy instead of a girl. The experience of giving birth to a boy was, they say, like “rape.” In our Daily Cancellation, people with PhDs complain about being marginalized when people fail to address them as doctors. You know they have to get canceled for that.

      <title>Ep. 919 - Disney’s Gay Agenda </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Disney executives are now openly admitting to their “gay agenda” — their words, not mine. Another executive, in a recent staff meeting, bragged about her “pansexual child.” We’ll talk about Disney’s free fall plummet into far left wokeism. Also, a kindergarten teacher worries that the Florida bill just signed into law will prevent him from talking to his students about his love life. But why does he need to talk to them about that? And Biden signs the anti-lynching act, thanks to Republicans who provided him with this opportunity to virtue signal. Jim Carrey is speaking out against Will Smith’s violent outburst at the Oscars. Why is he almost the only guy in Hollywood saying anything about it? Plus, a Republican congressman claims that he’s been invited to drug fueled orgies by other members of congress. In our Daily Cancellation, Jon Stewart has white guilt and he wants to tell us all about it. We’ll listen, and then cancel him.

      <title>Ep. 918 - How Words Became Violence </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, I have another big announcement to start the show. Also, after the slap heard round the world, the consensus on the woke left it that it is in fact acceptable and justified to physically assault someone for mean jokes. Although there are a number of important qualifiers that we must take into consideration. Also, Florida officially enacts the anti-groomer bill, while the pro-grooming factions react with demonic, pedophilic fury. The NFL updates its diversity rules to encourage the hiring of more women, because women are famously experts when it comes to football. And a male who identifies as trans announces that he has just had his first period. In our Daily Cancellation, psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry have just announced that grief is now a mental illness. And there’s a drug to cure it, which will make them even richer. What a happy coincidence for them.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, I have another big announcement to start the show. Also, after the slap heard round the world, the consensus on the woke left it that it is in fact acceptable and justified to physically assault someone for mean jokes. Although there are a number of important qualifiers that we must take into consideration.

      <title>Ep. 917 - Will Smith Shows What Real Privilege Looks Like </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, woke virtue signaling at the Oscars is overshadowed by Will Smith’s violent cuckold rage. Also, the White House calls for regime change in Russia and then says that it is not calling for regime change in Russia. Plus, videos circulate allegedly showing the torture and murder of Russian POWs. And Cory Booker is still shocked and appalled and heartbroken that Kentaji Jackson was asked to define the word “woman.” And a lesbian couple sues a fertility clinic after giving birth to a boy instead of a girl. In our Daily Cancellation, I am forced to cancel televangelists Joel and Victoria Osteen. I’ll explain why. All of that’d more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 916 - Why We Are In The Midst Of A Civilization-Wide Identity Crisis </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, with the “what is a woman” question going mainstream, helpfully coinciding with the announcement of my upcoming “what is a woman” documentary, we should probably try to figure out why exactly this question is so confusing to people. To that end, there are a couple of points that are often overlooked. Also, Joe Biden has more good news: food shortages are on the horizon. And North Korea releases an unintentionally hilarious hype video for their new missile they just launched. Plus, a heterosexual journalist comes out as queer, though he’s still heterosexual. And we debate the question: is it racist to tip? In our Daily Cancellation, a relationship guru gives some “life hacks” for how to “date” 15 men in 21 days, as she did. I think I know the answer, though it’s probably not the one she gives.

      <title>Ep. 915 - My Global Journey To Answer The Ultimate Question</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, over the last year I have been on a secret journey, spanning the globe, pursuing an answer to the ultimate question — the question that defines a generation. Today I’m finally ready to begin to reveal what I uncovered. Also, the Supreme Court hearings for Kentaji Brown Jackson continued yesterday, with Democrats and Jackson herself lashing out indignantly that anyone would dare question her stellar judicial record of going easy on child sex predators. Plus, Home Depot goes woke. Democrats push to extend the student loan payment freeze, though they can’t explain why. And even though men and women are exactly equal and no different at all, the Army has still lowered its fitness standards — again — to include more women.

      <title>Ep. 914 - The First Black Woman For The Supreme Court Doesn't Know What A Woman Is</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the “what is a woman” movement makes it all the way to the Supreme Court, as Judge Jackson reveals that though she wants to be on the Supreme Court, she cannot answer the most basic questions about reality. She also has a tenuous grasp of justice, as her lenient approach to child porn cases demonstrates. We’ll talk about all of this today. Plus, Governor DeSantis declares the real winner of the race that Lia Thomas won by cheating. ESPN is now woke on steroids. Harry’s, jealous of our success with Jeremy’s Razors, accuses the Daily Wire of hate speech. Kid Rock explains how to become uncancellable. And President Biden declares a new world order. Using those exact words. 
Go to ihateharrys.com and place your first order for Jeremy’s razors today.

      <title>Ep. 913 - Public Schools Are LGBT Indoctrination Camps</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an elementary school holds a gay pride march right through the hallways of the school. Plus, the confirmation hearings for Judge Kentanji Brown Jackson have begun, and Democrats have already made it clear that any tough questioning of the judge will automatically be racist and bigoted. Also, the Daily Wire is now selling men’s grooming products. Like so much of what we do here, it’s a joke but also not a joke at all. And the mayor of Boston commemorates St Patrick’s Day by making racist jokes about white people. And the media tells us about a rise in ADHD among not only children but adults as well. Are so many of us suffering from a mysterious mental illness, or could there be a more logical explanation for our inability to focus?

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an elementary school holds a gay pride march right through the hallways of the school. Plus, the confirmation hearings for Judge Kentanji Brown Jackson have begun, and Democrats have already made it clear that any tough questioning of the judge will automatically be racist and bigoted. Also, the Daily Wire is now selling men’s grooming products. Like so much of what we do here, it’s a joke but also not a joke at all. And the mayor of Boston commemorates St Patrick’s Day by making racist jokes about white people. And the media tells us about a rise in ADHD among not only children but adults as well. Are so many of us suffering from a mysterious mental illness, or could there be a more logical explanation for our inability to focus?

      <title>Ep. 912 - Lia Thomas Inspires People To Finally Oppose The Trans Agenda</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, ESPN has an on-air moment of silence to protest the Florida parental rights bill. Meanwhile, backlash against the NCAA’s policies allowing men in women’s sports continues to grow with no sign of abating. Is the cultural tide turning? Also, Ukrainian president Zelensky invokes the Holocaust while appealing for more countries to get involved in the war in Ukraine. Is that comparison fair? Plus, the White House considers stimulus checks and gas cards to solve the gas prices problem, which will do wonders for the inflation problem. And the media twists itself into knots trying to “debunk” the claim that Biden’s SCOTUS nominee has a tendency to be lenient on child sex predators. But their debunking only succeeded in proving the claim.

      <title>Ep. 911 - The Ridiculous Lia Thomas Charade Reaches Its Inevitable Conclusion </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, last night we were finally treated to the grotesque spectacle of the man Lia Thomas competing against the women in the NCAA championships, which he won handily. Also, misinformation transforms into information once again, as the New York Times finally confirms that the Hunter Biden laptop story was true. Plus, Nancy Pelosi is the latest liberal to try to defeat Putin with a poem. We’ll see if she succeeded. And a few Republicans vote against a bill leveling more sanctions on Russia. Is it because they’re stooges of Putin? Or might there be another reason? And in our Daily Cancellation, a film critic is accused of racism for failing to enjoy a cartoon about an Asian girl. Did he bow to the mob and apologize? We’ll find out.

      <title>Ep. 910 - Leftist Media Accuses Me Of 'Harassing' Groomers</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the organizers of a sex camp for children are now allegedly in hiding because of “right wing harassment” from the likes of Ben Shapiro and yours truly. According to the media, just because you hold masturbation workshops for kids doesn’t mean you can’t be a victim. Also, Jussie Smollett is released from jail, proving that few people are more privileged in this culture than someone who is gay, black, rich, and famous. Also, a children’s hospital gives advice on “tucking.” If you don’t know what that is, you’ll find out today. And probably hate me for telling you. And a popular new song worships Ukrainian president Zelensky as a Christ figure who has come to save the world. What’s the problem with this kind of over the top adulation of a political figure during war time (or any time)? We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 909 - The Never Ending Cycle Of Mass Hysteria</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, mass hysteria has gripped our nation. People are so hysterical that many are now begging for nuclear war. But closer to home, on a smaller scale, we see the hysteria in the proliferation of racism hoaxes, especially in our schools. Speaking of which, there have been three in our schools in just the past week or two. We’ll talk about it. Also, Ukrainian President Zelensky addresses congress and asks for a No Fly Zone, which would lead directly to World War 3. And a funny thing: when most Americans are told what’s actually in the so-called “don’t say gay bill,” they support it. Plus,  lawmakers want to hold social media companies responsible for making our children addicted to the internet. And, in our daily cancellation, lawmakers also now plan to make Daylight Savings permanent. I’ll explain why that’s a bad idea, and might in fact bring about the end of human civilization. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, mass hysteria has gripped our nation. People are so hysterical that many are now begging for nuclear war. But closer to home, on a smaller scale, we see the hysteria in the proliferation of racism hoaxes, especially in our schools. Speaking of which, there have been three in our schools in just the past week or two. We’ll talk about it. Also, Ukrainian President Zelensky addresses congress and asks for a No Fly Zone, which would lead directly to World War 3. And a funny thing: when most Americans are told what’s actually in the so-called “don’t say gay bill,” they support it. Plus,  lawmakers want to hold social media companies responsible for making our children addicted to the internet. And, in our daily cancellation, lawmakers also now plan to make Daylight Savings permanent. I’ll explain why that’s a bad idea, and might in fact bring about the end of human civilization. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. </p><p>I am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.

      <title>Ep. 908 - Screaming Mob Protests My Speech But Can't Explain Why </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, protesters made a scene at my Georgia Tech speech last night, though further investigation indicates that they didn’t know why they were there or what they were upset about. Also, the White House debriefed Tik Tok stars on the Ukraine situation,and now those influencers are dutifully repeating the government propaganda assigned to them. Plus, some parents are upset about the new Pixar film, claiming it’s not appropriate for children. And what exactly is “public health equity”? It’s more than a job’s program for bureaucrats, though it’s mostly that.

      <title>Ep. 907 - A Nation Full Of People Who've Never Been Told No</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a serial killer was released twice from prison, and killed again each time. The story only gets crazier from there, and it’s part of a deeper cultural trend that we’ll talk about today. Also, Antifa plans to disrupt my event at Georgia Tech tonight. Plus, the US Air Force brags about its “LGBTQ initiatives” while war rages in Europe. And a tennis player cries after being heckled by someone in the audience. This emotional display, of course, makes her a hero. And finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the Kim and Kanye drama. It’s not just celebrity gossip.

      <title>Ep. 906 - Jail Time For Jussie</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Jussie Smollett’s attacker has been sentenced to jail time. But the sentence was still too light, as Smollett’s insane behavior in the courtroom demonstrated. Also, our Big Tech overlords have gotten together and decided that actually it’s okay for you to call for the murder of certain people, depending on their nationality and ethnicity. Nothing troubling about that. Plus, Kaepernick compared the NFL to slavery a few months ago, and now he says he still wants to play in the NFL. And Rihanna is pregnant and speaking eloquently about the beauty of pregnancy and the preciousness of unborn life, which seems to contradict her previous pro-abortion activism. This is pretty common with pro-abortion celebrities. And a new poll says that Americans are under an “unprecedented” level of stress. Is that true? Are we more stressed out than anyone else in history? Is life that hard? Or do we just see it that way?

      <title>Ep. 904 - LGBT Witch Hosts 'Sexy Summer Camp' For Kids</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, what is a “sexy summer camp” for children? You probably don’t want to know, but you’re going to find out today, because this is the sort of thing happening in our country. Also, with gas prices rising, the Left has decided that actually high gas prices aren’t so bad. In fact, we Americans enjoy it. And the Senate unanimously passes the anti-lynching law. Every Republican signed onto this pointless bit of virtue signaling. The Biden Administration commits billions to spreading “gender equity” across the globe. And the guy who runs CPAC comes out in support of Lia Thomas.

      <title>Ep. 903 -  Degenerate Democrats Panic Over Anti-Groomer Law </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show protests are growing louder over the bill in Florida which bans the sexual indoctrination of kids in elementary school. The Left has managed to garner this much outrage by simply lying about what’s in the bill. Today we’ll sift through the nonsense and get to the truth. And we’ll read the actual bill itself. A radical step. Also as gas prices skyrocket across the country, Biden announces a ban on Russian oil, but the new oil import plan isn’t much of an improvement. Kamala Harris tries to be inspirational again and it doesn’t go well. Serena Williams is the victim of racism, or so she claims. A police chief in Florida is fired for anti-white bias. There’s a new one. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the body positivity advocate who inadvertently exposes an ugly truth: the body positivity movement is actually fueled by hatred towards men.

      <title>Ep. 902 -  Another Spineless Republican Jellyfish Caves To The LGBT Lobby</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the governor of Utah competes for the title of Biggest Coward In The Republican Party. Stiff competition but with his threatened veto of a bill meant to keep men out of women’s sports, he may just win the prize. We’ll discuss. Also, Netflix, along with Visa, Mastercard and several other major companies have suspended operations in Russia. Are these kinds of measures more likely to help or hurt in the long run? And the White House is poised to extend the pause on student loan payments. For what reason? And where do they get the authority to do this? Plus, the mayor of New York keeps his priorities in order by launching a war against chocolate milk. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the trucker convoy which arrived in DC — well, around DC — this weekend to, I guess, protest covid restrictions, which are mostly all being lifted anyway.

      <title>Ep. 901 - Lia Thomas Is Going To The Women’s Swimming Championships And So Am I</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, in the lead up the NCAA Women’s swimming championships, where a man named Lia Tomas is expected to dominate and break record, Sports Illustrated has run a fawning cover story hailing his courage and athletic prowess. I have a few thoughts to make, and also an announcement that you’re going to want to hear. Stick around for that. Also, the leftist meltdown at University of North Texas was even worse than we thought. More video and information has emerged. We’ll talk about it. Plus, some lawmakers in DC seem dead set on getting us involved in a world war. Some of them also desecrated an American flag to prove their loyalty to Ukraine. We’ll talk about that. And in some churches across the country, Ash Wednesday has been replaced with Glitter Ash Wednesday. What is that and is it as heretical as it sounds?

      <title>Ep. 900 - Demonic Leftists Scream And Spit In Defense Of Child Sex Changes</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, crazed LGBT activists at a Texas university go insane, shouting, screaming, stomping, and spitting because a campus speaker said that we shouldn’t castrate little boys. This is the state of the university system in our country. We’ll talk about it, and play some of the footage, today. Also, Ron DeSantis provoked widespread media condemnation because he told some kids that they don’t have to wear a mask. He’s right, of course, as usual. Plus a handful of Republicans refuse to sign a congressional resolution in support of Ukraine. We’ll look at their reasoning and you can decide if they were wrong or right. And Ukraine has found a way to deal with looters. It’s a strategy we should think of adopting. In our Daily Cancellation, a Hollywood icon is in trouble with the mob because he didn’t like Hollywood’s latest gay western.

      <title>Ep. 899 - The Left’s Ideological Colonization Of The Globe </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as war rages in Ukraine, our media asks the important question: how will this affect trans people? Also, Joe Biden delivers his state of the union speech. It was a pointless spectacle, aside from one significant moment that we’ll discuss. Plus, Russia is banned from the World Cup. That sounds good to me, but didn’t we just hold the Olympics in China? There would seem to be some inconsistency here. Plus, in our Daily Cancellation, the creator of the 1619 project gets herself canceled again. I’ll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 898 - Democrats Virtue Signal While The World Burns</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, with war raging in Europe, our leaders here at home are focused on the important things. Namely, outlawing lynching. But isn’t that already illegal? Why does it need to be illegal again? And why are they worried about this? Why now of all times? We’ll sort through that today. Also, there’s so much propaganda flying around about the war in Ukraine that it can be hard to keep things straight or know exactly what’s going on. It’s probably no surprise, though, that the people pushing the propaganda are also the people who want to push our country into a direct armed conflict with Russia. We’ll discuss. And, Democrats try and fail to pass a federal law permanently enshrining Roe, regardless of the Supreme Court’s decision. Plus, Kamala Harris goes off script, Joe Biden can barely walk, and John Oliver makes the case for decriminalizing prostitution across the country. I’ll explain why he’s wrong, and why he’s canceled.

      <title>Ep. 897 - Crazed Leftists Rush To Defend Child Butchery And Abuse</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the governor of Texas has provoked extreme outrage from the Left by declaring that all so-called “gender affirming medical care” of minors in the state now qualifies and will be prosecuted as child abuse. He’s facing backlash and mutiny over this, but he is obviously completely correct. Also, the latest on the crisis in Ukraine, and the incompetent response from the Biden Administration. Speaking of which, John Kerry has come out to explain that global war is bad, mainly because of all the carbon emissions. Plus, Biden announces his Supreme Court pick. And in our Daily Cancellation, the celebs are chiming in on the Ukraine situation, and their contributions to the conversation have so far been far worse than you can imagine. I’ll play something for you today that is so cringy and embarrassing that it probably needs some kind of surgeon general warning attached to it.

      <title>Ep. 896 - Putin Planned His Invasion While Biden Focused On Diversity And Inclusion  </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden was already having the worst presidential term in American history, and that was before Russia invaded Ukraine, bringing us closer to World War 3. And it is not a coincidence that this has happened after Biden spent his first year in office focusing primarily on wokeness and intentionally making our military weaker and more feminine. We’ll talk about that today. Also, Canada proposes legislation that will allow people to report hate speech before it happens. Brave New World meets the Minority Report in Canada. Plus, a trucker convoy heads to D.C. I have my reservations about this one and I’ll explain. Also, a writer for New York magazine says that parents who insist on parental rights are actually “household tyrants.” And finally in our Daily Cancelation we’ll look at the fat acceptance activist who says that dieting is a form of conversion therapy.

      <title>Ep. 895 - We Must Defend The Biden Administration’s Perverted Values </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Biden Administration has said that American families will have to bear the cost of defending Ukraine against Russia. Why should we have to bear this cost? Because we have to defend our values overseas. But whose values? And what values? We’ll talk about that today. Also, the Supreme Court will decide whether a web designer has the right to refuse to make wedding announcements for a same sex wedding. And the sponsors of that so-called “don’t say gay” bill in Florida have started to buckle under left wing pressure. Plus another UFO sighting, proving once again definitively that aliens walk among us. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the unintentionally hilarious efforts of the Women’s March to turn student debt into a women’s rights issue.

      <title> Ep. 894 - Leftists Fight For The Right To Sexually Indoctrinate Elementary Schoolers </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left has been spent into spasms of outrage because of a Florida bill which would prohibit public school teachers from talking to elementary schoolers about sexual orientation and gender identity. What kind of creep could possibly oppose a law like that? Well, we’ll find out. Also, Canada descends into full on totalitarianism, even as we are told that Putin is the greatest threat to the west. And scholars have discovered that diversity training doesn’t actually achieve anything. What’s their answer? To do more diversity training, of course. In our daily cancellation, we’ll talk about the father of a 14 year old TikTok star who shot and killed her stalker. That’s the good news. The bad news is that this father allowed his 14 year old daughter to be a TikTok star in the first place.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, after a year of controversy, Lia Thomas the trans swimmer finally went to the swimming championships this week and dominated the field as expected. The media and the left have been twisting themselves into knots to justify this insanity. We’ll talk about it today. Also, Democrats in California introduce a dog and cats bill of rights. And a parent at a school board meeting delivers the best smackdown of CRT we’ve heard yet. Plus, BLM crowd funds bail for an attempted assassin while the people who donated to the Canadian truckers are hunted down, doxxed, and shamed. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll take a look at the New York Times article which hails our “age of anti-ambition.”

      <title>Ep. 892 - Groomers Push ‘Queer Inclusivity’ On Preschoolers </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, some leaked audio from a “queer inclusive” presentation at a major education conference reveals exactly what our kids are being subjected to at school. Both public and private school, by the way. Also, some college students are now protesting to demand that mask mandates remain in place. But why do they need a mandate? Can't they just wear their masks if they want to? And a major racism scandal at a school in Illinois. But I have some questions. Plus, BLM bails out the activist who tried to assassinate a mayoral candidate in Louisville. In our Daily Cancellation, Disney is now branching out beyond movies and shows and theme parks and now will be running entire towns, communities where you can go and live. But why in God’s name would anyone want to do that?

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, some leaked audio from a “queer inclusive” presentation at a major education conference reveals exactly what our kids are being subjected to at school. Both public and private school, by the way. Also, some college students are now protesting to demand that mask mandates remain in place. But why do they need a mandate? Can't they just wear their masks if they want to? And a major racism scandal at a school in Illinois. But I have some questions. Plus, BLM bails out the activist who tried to assassinate a mayoral candidate in Louisville. In our Daily Cancellation, Disney is now branching out beyond movies and shows and theme parks and now will be running entire towns, communities where you can go and live. But why in God’s name would anyone want to do that?</p><p>I am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.

      <title>Ep. 891 - BLM Assassin Joins Waukesha Killer In The Memory Hole </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an activist attempted to assassinate a politician in a major American city. This happened yesterday and already it is out of the news. You may have already guessed why but we’ll discuss today. Also, the new mayor of New York is getting a lot of props from people on the right, but he’s as much of a race hustler as any other Democrat. I’ll play a clip that proves that. And the CEO of YouTube did an interview where she called on governments across the world to pass more laws restricting speech. Plus, a bipartisan bill meant to protect children on the internet. I usually say that the worst kinds of bills are the bipartisan ones, but is this an exception to the rule? We’ll take a look. Finally, we will cancel a man who says that women who don’t want to see his penis in the locker room are misogynists.

      <title>Ep. 890 - The Only Rule The Left Cares About </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a recent CNN article compares Joe Rogan’s use of the N-word to January 6th — and January 6th as we know, according to the Left, was as bad as 9-11. This may all seem very stupid on the surface — and it is stupid — but there’s something deeper going on here, which we’ll talk about today. Also, a new euphemism for rioters just dropped. It’s the best one of all. The ATF essentially encourages us to make false reports against our enemies for revenge. And a model says that she "don't need no man" because she's in love with herself. Will "autosexuals" now be welcomed into the LGBT alphabet camp?

      <title>Ep. 889 - The Super Bowl Was A Festival Of Hypocrisy </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Super Bowl last night was one long parade of leftist hypocrisy. We will count the ways. Also, we’ll review some of the weird and woke commercials that companies spent millions of dollars to air during the broadcast. Plus, Nancy Pelosi officially slams the door shut on the Defund the Police movement. And Joe Biden speaks out against racism in the NFL. At least I think that’s what he was doing. It’s hard to tell anymore. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the left’s latest innovation. It’s called platonic conscious co-parenting.

      <title>Ep. 888 - Biden Hires Gender Fluid Drag Queen Dog Fetishist </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Biden Administration goes for gold in the woke olympics by appointing a gender fluid drag queen dog fetishist to a high ranking federal post. Also, speaking of sexual degeneracy, parents in one school district are outraged after their young children were given an assignment asking them to list their sexual desires and preferences. And a new Disney Junior show teaches kids about microaggressions through song. Plus, many Democrats have changed their tune about masking. What accounts for this sudden conversion? Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss what might be the most horrific story of racism you will ever hear. And it happened in a Gucci store.

      <title>Ep. 887 - The Victims Of Emoji-Based Oppression </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, tax-funded NPR publishes a lengthy investigation into the complex racial implications of emojis. Also, trans activists were planning a big protest at my event at Texas A&amp;M last night. So what happened? I’ll tell you about it. And polls show that viewers are fleeing the NFL because of its political pandering. Plus, a pastor attracts the ire of the mob for promoting modesty. And Adele gets in trouble herself for saying that she loves being a woman, which of course is transphobic. In our Daily Cancellation, one of my opponents on that Dr. Phil episode appeared on his podcast yesterday to offer her reflections on the experience. Apparently, she doesn’t like me very much, if you can believe it.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, tax-funded NPR publishes a lengthy investigation into the complex racial implications of emojis. Also, trans activists were planning a big protest at my event at Texas A&amp;M last night. So what happened? I’ll tell you about it. And polls show that viewers are fleeing the NFL because of its political pandering. Plus, a pastor attracts the ire of the mob for promoting modesty. And Adele gets in trouble herself for saying that she loves being a woman, which of course is transphobic. In our Daily Cancellation, one of my opponents on that Dr. Phil episode appeared on his podcast yesterday to offer her reflections on the experience. Apparently, she doesn’t like me very much, if you can believe it.

      <title>Ep. 886 - Crack Pipe Equity </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Biden Administration has come up with a great plan to solve the crime epidemic. They’re going to give out free crack pipes. We’ll discuss. Also, AirBnB is now banning people from its service based on their political views. Plus, the teachers union hangs onto masking, even as most everyone else has moved on. And Showtime puts out a trailer for the most absurdly racist documentary ever produced. But it’s racist against white people so it’s okay.

      <title>Ep. 885 - The Hilarious Leftist Plot To Infiltrate My Speaking Event </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, leftist protesters are planning a major demonstration at my Texas A&amp;M event tomorrow. Fortunately they wrote down their whole plan and I have the document, which I will share with you today. Also, it turns out that some of the people trying to cancel Joe Rogan have said some edgy things in the past themselves. This is what happens when you join the cancel mob. Eventually it turns around on you. Plus, Toyota puts out an ad hailing Colin Kaepernick and rewriting history at the same time. And Biden’s first year in office sees the most police killed in the line of duty since 1995. I wonder why that happened? And in our Daily Cancellation, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are in a public feud over their daughter’s social media use. Who is right and who is wrong?

      <title>Ep. 884 - What I Learned In A Third World Country  </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as I return from my excursion into the third world, we will talk about the pain of suffering of people in this country. Specifically, those who are deeply suffering because of Joe Rogan’s podcast. Also, Stacey Abrams poses for a photograph which unwittingly summarizes two years of insane COVID policies all at once. And the Olympics have started but nobody is watching. CNN hilariously mourns the loss of its boss, after he was ousted because of the latest sex scandal at the network. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will deal with the NFL head coach who says he is the victim of racism. Poor guy.

      <title>Ep. 883 - The Biden Administration Announces Plan To Abolish All Death And Suffering</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Biden Administration has announced its plan to get rid of all traffic accidents and traffic deaths. Reduce it to zero. After failing to shut down COVID, now they will attempt to prevent anyone from ever dying of anything ever again. Also, Joe Biden officially begins his search for a new Supreme Court Justice. He promises it will be a thorough search and he will consider a diverse selection of potential nominees, as long as they are black, female, and liberal. The greatest female Jeopardy contestant of all time, who is actually male, finally loses. A writer wins praise from the Left for publicly announcing that she doesn’t like being a mother. And in our Daily Cancellation, a PhD student attempts to school me on the topic of sex and gender. We’ll see how she did.

      <title>Ep. 882 - A Token Black Woman For The Supreme Court </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, there is an opening on the Supreme Court and it’s been decided that a black woman must fill it. Which black woman? Well any will do, apparently. Once again we see the absurd racism of “racial equity” on full display. Also, there has been a huge surge in children experiencing speech delays because of masking. And Media Matters publishes a lengthy expose about a certain bigoted Dr. Phil clip that lots of people on Facebook have seen and shared. They’re very concerned about it. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal finally with the NFT phenomenon. Is it a good investment opportunity or is it the dumbest thing in the history of the world and a sign of our civilization’s decadence and decay?

      <title>Ep. 881 - Media Matters Doesn’t Like My Dating Advice </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Media Matters and some others on the Left were upset by my analysis of the modern dating scene. Apparently, I’m told, my point of view on the subject is old fashioned and reactionary. They’re not necessarily wrong about that. Also, a truck carrying infected monkeys from a lab escaped from their cages during a highway accident. Why are these labs allowed to dump pathogens all over the globe without any consequence? And Robert F Kennedy Jr made a holocaust analogy during his speech at the anti-mandate protest on Sunday. Yesterday his own wife came out and denounced him for it. Plus, Kamala Harris lists the most vulnerable victim groups in America. The list seems to have expanded to encompass every group except one. And Hollywood actor Peter Dinklage says that the dwarves in Snow White are offensive. The story only gets dumber from there.

      <title>Ep. 880 - Our Overlords Want You Fat, Lazy, And Addicted To Porn</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a major health magazine puts out an issue celebrating fatness and calling for gyms and fitness instructors to be better “fat allies.” And it’s not a satire. It’s all very real. Also, Joe Biden cusses out a Fox reporter. How would the media have reacted if Trump did the same thing to someone at CNN? And amid talk of war for the sake of protecting Ukraine, the White House is asked why America should put itself at risk to protect Europe if Europe won’t protect itself. A good question. Not a great answer. Also, the ladies of the View agree that they may never feel comfortable in public again without a mask because of everything we’ve learned during the pandemic. But what have we learned example. Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, Lena Dunham is back on the scene. And it didn’t take her long to get canceled.

      <title>Ep. 879 - Why The Modern Dating Scene Is A Toxic Wasteland</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, marriage rates in our country are plummeting to historic lows. This is partly due to the fact that the modern dating scene is a miserable, despair-inducing trainwreck. We’ll try to sift through the rubble today and figure out what has gone so wrong. Also, protesters across the world marched against vaccine mandates on Sunday. And more people on the center-left are finally coming out against draconian COVID policies. Is it too little too late, or should we welcome these converts with open arms? Plus, is war with Russia on the horizon? And in our daily cancellation, we’ll discuss the democratic lawmaker who tried to dunk on pro-lifers, only to have it backfire in hilarious fashion.

Is it too little too late, or should we welcome these converts with open arms? Plus, is war with Russia on the horizon? And in our daily cancellation, we’ll discuss the democratic lawmaker who tried to dunk on pro-lifers, only to have it backfire in hilarious fashion. </p><p>I am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.

      <title>Ep. 878 - The Left Attacks Dr. Phil For Allowing Me To Speak </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left is now going after Dr. Phil for allowing me onto his show in the first place. But if they are confident in their position, and if they really believe in their own gender ideology, why should they be so afraid of having the debate? Also, the March For Life takes DC by storm and the Biden Administration has to trot out Tom Hanks to convince the public that his first year in office wasn’t a complete disaster. Plus, an old clip of an MSNBC host saying that your kids don’t belong to you goes viral again. What might we learn from it? And M&amp;Ms are getting a more progressive and inclusive rebranding for the year 2022. With this final piece in place, Utopia awaits.

      <title>Ep. 877 - My Dr. Phil Appearance Caused Trauma And Nightmares </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, I appeared on Dr. Phil to argue about gender and pronouns with a couple of non-binary diversity consultants and a woke college professor. We’ll talk about the experience today and watch a few of the clips together. Also, my opponents on the stage are now complaining that I have caused them to plunge into depression and they’re having nightmares because of me. What did I do to cause such trauma? We’ll try to figure that out. And Joe Biden held just his second press conference in a year and it was a total disaster. The media gets caught in yet another fake news scandal. And a major car company goes woke, though as always it’s not clear what they hope to accomplish.

      <title>Ep. 876 - Canada Outlawed Christianity And Nobody Noticed </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Canada criminalized Christianity last week and nobody seems to have noticed. How did that happen? And are we on the same path in this country? Also, Michael Phelps speaks out about the trans athlete issue, sort of. Steven A Smith returns to the air to tell about his near death experience with COVID. But he seems to have learned the wrong lesson from the ordeal. And Whoopi Goldberg says that the GOP is going to try to remove voting rights from women. I have to admit that the ladies of The View do make a compelling argument for that policy change. Don Lemon on CNN condemns “idiots who do their own research.” And in our Daily cancellation, we’ll deal with the sports analyst who tried to prove his anti-racist credentials by bragging about his MLK memorabilia. It didn’t go well.

      <title>Ep. 875 - A Generation Of Psychological Abuse Victims</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we’re told that there is a “mental illness epidemic” among kids which can be attributed to the pandemic. But this is a lie, and a very nefarious one, and I’ll explain why. Also, the Supreme Court killed the vaccine mandate but some companies are enforcing them anyway. How should we respond? And a clip of Biden says that George Floyd’s death had a greater impact on the world than Martin Luther King’s death. He’s right, but not for the reason he thinks. Plus, a woman drives her car into a river by accident and then takes a selfie while the vehicle sinks below the surface. It is an image that perfectly encapsulates modern western culture.

      <title>Ep. 874 - Canada Officially Criminalizes Biology</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Canada has just effectively criminalized biblical sexual morality and biological science. They call it a ban on “conversion therapy.” We have laws like this in the United States too. But they are not what they first appear. We’ll discuss today. Also, a jihadist took hostages at a synagogue in Texas but the FBI, Biden, and the media are pretending to be puzzled about his motives. And if Glenn Youngkin’s first day as governor of my home state of Virginia is any indication, he is going to have a brilliant tenure. And what is an “after school Satan club”? We’ll find out. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show

      <title>Ep. 873 - The Vaccine Mandate Goes Down In Flames, Hallelujah </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Daily Wire achieves a resounding victory at the Supreme Court, as Biden’s illegal and insane vaccine mandate is blocked and effectively killed. Also, in more good news, college enrollment rates continue to decline across the country. And the top prosecutor in Baltimore is facing a slew of felony charges related to fraud and perjury. Meanwhile, a convicted arson that she set free from prison is speaking out to the media. He is opposed to his own release, yet he was released anyway. Plus, a study claims to find that people are more attractive when they cover their faces with masks. And in our daily cancellation, the Left is upset about my anti-universal voting rights stance. For a change of pace, they’re calling me racist.

      <title>Ep. 872 - The Worst Scandal In History That No One Is Talking About</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, more information has come out about what could quite possibly be the biggest scandal in history. And yet it is treated as a minor sideshow at best. Also, Kamala Harris thoroughly embarrasses herself on camera. We’re used to that by now, but this one is pretty bad even by her standards. And an Australian politician puts out what is accidentally the most racist video you will ever see. It also happens to be hilarious. And a doctor brags publicly about refusing to take her injured son to the doctor for fear of COVID. Finally in our Daily Cancellation I will go toe to toe with every anti-Johnny The Walrus video on YouTube.

      <title>Ep. 871 - There Is No Attack On Voting Rights, Unfortunately</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Harris and Biden have gone off to slay the fictional dragon of voter suppression. Meanwhile, as they argue that it’s racist to require an ID to vote, more and more Democrat-run cities are requiring IDs to do literally everything else. Also, Ted Cruz questions the FBI about its role in the January 6th riots. Their answer, I would argue, confirms our worst suspicions. And Alec Baldwin continues to make himself the victim of the fact that he shot and killed a woman. His case becomes even more outrageous when you compare it to another recent accidental shooting. Plus, USA Today runs a piece arguing that we must destigmatize pedophilia.

      <title>Ep. 870 - Mass Formation Psychosis Is Real And We're All Living Through It</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, is our society experiencing an epidemic of mass psychosis? The regime fact checkers say no, but we’ll look at the evidence. Also, police officers in California pull a man from a crashed plane minutes before it’s hit by a train. It sounds like something out of an action movie but it happened in real life. And for months we were told that it’s dangerous misinformation to claim that the vaccine interferes with a woman’s menstrual cycle. But yet again, what was once misinformation has been vindicated by the evidence. Plus, Navy bootcamp will now include anti-racism training. And in our daily cancellation, we’ll cancel the LA Times columnist who argued that it is our humanitarian duty to mock unvaccinated people when they die of COVID.

      <title> Ep. 869 - Twitter Suspends The World’s Leading LGBT Children’s Author </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the leading LGBT children’s author in the world was suspended from Twitter over the weekend. It was an appalling act of homophobia. But there is something even deeper and more important going on, which we’ll talk about today. Also, the CDC has finally started admitting to some basic truths about the covid virus. Just in time for the midterm elections, but that is a coincidence I’m sure. And a teacher stuffs her son in the trunk of her car so that he doesn’t give her covid. Plus, Navy bootcamp goes woke. And we must cancel a prominent doctor who posted a dramatic 25 tweet thread about his son’s battle with a mild cold. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 868 - The BLM Riots Were A Million Times Worse Than January 6th</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Carcast, yesterday’s January 6th festivities were as insufferable as expected. We’ll take a look at some of the lowlights. Also, we'll compare January 6th to the BLM riots of 2020 to see if we can determine which was worse. It’s not hard to determine because the competition isn’t close. Also, Nancy Pelosi told one of the most egregious lies we’ve heard from a politician in quite some time, which is saying something. And Russia has a plan to ship pedophiles off to penal colonies in the Arctic. Plus, Morgan Wallen survived his cancellation and went on to have the number one best selling album of the year. So why am I canceling him anyway today? We’ll talk about all of that and much more on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 867 - Why Multiple Personality Syndrome Is The Hottest New Fad</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, throwback edition, the hottest new trend on social media is multiple personality disorder. Lots of people, especially kids, are pretending that they suffer from this debilitating mental illness. How did this trend come about and why? We’ll talk about that today. And Aaron Rodgers has clearly earned the MVP award this year in the NFL but some sports writers say he shouldn’t be eligible because he isn’t vaccinated. Plus, Pope Francis condemns couples who have pets instead of kids, proving that even a broken pope is right every once in a while. And women at the University of Pennsylvania consider boycotting in protest of the dude who was allowed on their team. They consider it. Just consider it. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, I will once and for all finally cancel superhero movies. All of them. We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh show.

      <title>Ep. 866 - Armed Robbery Is Now A Misdemeanor In New York </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as violent crime surges to record levels across the country, the new DA of Manhattan has decided to pour gasoline on the flames. He announced this week that he will not prosecute armed robbery, among a slew of other serious crimes. Why are these people doing this? Are they trying to destroy their cities? And if so, why? We’ll talk about that today. Also, Joe Biden addresses the nation about omnicorn and lies repeatedly. And we are only one day away from the sacred anniversary of January 6th. How will you commemorate the special occasion? Plus, a prominent trans YouTuber apparently does not approve of my best selling LGBT children’s book Johnny the Walrus, and recorded a lengthy video explaining why.

      <title>Ep. 865 - An Early Candidate For Biggest Coward Of 2022</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, in one of the most pathetic and cowardly displays we’ve seen in a long time, a comedian issues a lengthy written apology for taking a picture with Dave Chappelle. What can we learn from this sad spectacle, if anything? And is it time to stop our obsession with taking COVID tests? The Florida surgeon general thinks so. Plus, a school district in Virginia stops grading homework assignments in the name of racial equity. And an NFL player storms off the field in the middle of a game, but is he really a victim in the middle of a mental health crisis? Is anyone responsible for their actions anymore or is every bad thing just the result of poor mental health?

      <title>Ep. 864 - My Heroic Battle With Omicron </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, lots of COVID “misinformation” has suddenly become “information” because Fauci and the media are saying it. We’ll talk about that miraculous transformation today. And I’ll tell you all about my own harrowing encounter with the dreaded Omnicorn variant. But Twitter has ramped up its censorship campaign against COVID heretics, even as many of their claims have been proven true. Also, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez says that all of her critics really just want to date her. The Left uncovers a shocking truth about Ron DeSantis. And in our daily cancellation, we’ll deal with the Atlantic writer who blew up her marriage because she was bored and believes that she has discovered deep truths about life from the experience.

      <title>Ep. 863 - The Left’s Twisted Celebration Of Narcissism And Self-Mutilation </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, New York Magazine published a celebratory profile about a woman who violently mutilated her body, and the story only gets worse from there. Also, Joe Biden addresses the nation about the threat of the extremely mild Omnicorn variant. Bill Gates moves the goal posts on vaccines and hopes no one notices. The woman who created sex and the city has regrets about her lifestyle choices, and then regrets about expressing those regrets. A Lutheran pastor delivers a homily in drag. And in our Daily Cancellation, we ask and answer the important question: what are the worst Christmas songs and movies? The answers may surprise you.

      <title>Ep. 862 - Banish The Unvaxxed Because We’re All In This Together </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, more major cities instate draconian mandates, segregating the unvaxxed from society. This must be done because “we’re all in this together,” they say. Also, the data on omnicorn keeps coming in, and all of it indicates that there’s no reason to panic. Just don’t tell the media. Plus, Louis CK has a new comedy special out. The Left says that this somehow proves that cancel culture isn’t real. Is that true? In our daily cancellation, we’ll deal with the social media influencer who recorded a choreographed dance routine in the hospital with her severely sick newborn baby.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, more major cities instate draconian mandates, segregating the unvaxxed from society. This must be done because “we’re all in this together,” they say. Also, the data on omnicorn keeps coming in, and all of it indicates that there’s no reason to panic. Just don’t tell the media. Plus, Louis CK has a new comedy special out. The Left says that this somehow proves that cancel culture isn’t real. Is that true? In our daily cancellation, we’ll deal with the social media influencer who recorded a choreographed dance routine in the hospital with her severely sick newborn baby.

      <title>Ep. 861 - COVID Jumps The Shark In Season Three </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media is in full panic pushing mode over omicron. We are told that a winter of death and misery is upon us. But how worried should we really be? Also, Joe Manchin blocks Biden’s agenda. Pope Francis continues his war against conservative Catholics. And students in Fairfax county protest a hate crime, but wait until you hear the totally unexpected twist in that story. And finally in our Daily Cancellation, Mark Zuckerberg has launched his virtual reality meta verse, and the meta verse has already had its first Me Too moment.

      <title>Ep. 860 - Public School Gives Child New Name And Gender Without Parental Consent</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, one of the worst examples of sexual grooming of children at a public school is exposed. Plus, Biden warns of the coming “winter of death.” A Pentagon officials says that murdering innocent children is a learning experience for the Biden Administration. People continue to beat the hell out of each other at airports, which is apparently not against the rules. An MSNBC host valiantly defends the right of black people to use racial slurs against white people. And me and my people fall victim to cultural appropriation.

      <title>Ep. 859 - Wokeness Is America's Dominant Religion </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a new survey reveals that huge numbers of Americans have left religion in recent years, especially since COVID. But that’s not actually correct. Americans aren’t leaving religion. They’re going from one religion to a different one. I’ll explain. Also, Ron DeSantis continues to lead the charge against wokeness in the school system. And airline CEOs try to explain why it’s stupid to require masks on planes. Plus, a leading climate activist and “scientist” calls for more censorship of “climate denialism.” And in our Daily Cancellation, Kamala Harris is canceled, but perhaps not for the reasons you may think.

      <title>Ep. 858 - The Bubba Wallace Noose Hoax Is Resurrected </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, if you were expecting the media to back away from race hoaxes in shame after the Jussie Smollett verdict, think again. Yesterday ESPN tried to resurrect the Bubba Wallace noose fable. Also, is Amazon to blame for the workers who died when a tornado hit their factory on Saturday? And you’ve heard about the male swimmer crushing the female competition. Today we’ll actually watch one of these races to see for ourselves what a farce it all is. Plus, the head of the NIH breaks into song during a press conference. And in the Daily Cancellation we’ll deal with the controversy surrounding comments that Ben Shapiro’s sister made about Madonna. Am I actually going to cancel a member of the Shapiro family today?

      <title>Ep. 857 - Now SLU Wants To Expel A Student For Associating With Me</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Saint Louis University is still seething about the event I held there a few weeks ago, and now they’ve decided to take their frustrations out on an innocent student. One kid at the school faces possible explosion for hanging flyers for my event off campus. Also, the media is breathlessly reporting the fact that various Fox News hosts texted Trump Administration officials on January 6th begging Trump to speak out against the riot. But these text messages actually undermine their narrative about January 6th, I’ll explain why. And an MSNBC contributor says that the Texas abortion law will lead to vigilantes “hunting down foreigners.” In our Daily Cancellation, we will deal with the Methodist minister who appeared in drag on an HBO reality show. He’s the victim, he says, because he was forced to step down from his role after the episode aired.

      <title>Ep. 856 - Dems Call For Legislation To Stop Tornadoes</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, after tornadoes devastated parts of the country on Saturday, the left insists that the disaster could have been prevented through legislation. Is that true? Can we pass laws that will stop tornadoes? Also, major retail chains beg congress for help in dealing with the surge in crime. I’ll explain why they should be out of luck. A catholic diocese says that it’s a sin to try and change your gender. The media is treating this like breaking news, but isn’t that what every competent christian believes? And with the Jussie Smollett conviction, there is a competition to see who can take his place as our nation’s chief race hoaxer. One BLM supporting doctor seems to be auditioning for the role.

      <title>Ep. 855 - Jussie Smollett Should Be Charged With A Hate Crime </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Jussie Smollett has been found guilty of committing a hate crime hoax. But I think a hate crime hoax is a hate crime in itself, and should be charged as such. We’ll talk about that today. Speaking of hate crimes, my bestselling LGBT children’s book Johnny the Walrus has been removed from Amazon’s LGBT list. I will have something to say about that today, and a fair warning: I might get a little emotional about it. Also, a male college swimmer is dominating female swimming. Outkick has an interview with one of his teammates and she is not happy. Plus, Simone Biles is named Athlete of the Year, for quitting.

      <title>Ep. 854 - COVID Lockdowns Destroyed Our Kids. Here's The Proof. </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a report from the surgeon general shows the extent of the damage covid lockdowns did to children, although that’s not the lesson the government wants us to take from the report. And BLM comes out in support of Jussie Smollett. Media Matters launches an attack on the most prominent and revered LGBT author in the nation. And Prince Harry says that if your job doesn’t bring you joy, you should just quit. Is that good career advice from a guy who’s never had a career?

      <title>Ep. 853 - The Jussie Smollett Saga Reaches Its Conclusion </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Jussie Smollett trial has reached its dramatic conclusion. Today we’ll take a look back at this whole bizarre story and figure out what we might learn from it. Also, Bill De Blasio defends his new dystopian covid measures on the basis that, if New Yorkers submit to this one last infringement on their liberty, covid will be gone forever. And the trial of Kim Potter, the officer who shot Daunte Wright, begins this week. Wright has been made into another martyr of the BLM cause, but we’ll look at the real man, and his brutal and violent history. You haven’t heard some of this before. It’s pretty shocking. And Dallas Police brag about taking 100 thousand dollars from someone who did not commit any crime at all. It’s called civil asset forfeiture. And it’s the subject of our cancellation today.

      <title>Ep. 852 - When Normal People Are Treated Like Freaks </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, online application forms now provide dozens of gender options and sometimes “man” or “woman” don’t even make the list. And speaking of made up terms, a new poll shows that almost no Hispanic people use the term “Latinx,” and yet the Left continues to push it. We’ll talk about all of that today. Plus, Bill De Blasio bans young children from public accommodations if they don’t show their vaccine papers. The evil is so absurd and over the top at this point as to almost be cartoonish. And salacious new details emerge in the Jussie Smollett trial. Also, a company produces a “suicide pod” to help people kill themselves. And in our daily cancellation, we’ll ask the question: why is everyone so ugly these days?

      <title>Ep. 851 - How I Became The Leading LGBT Voice Of My Generation</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, I have somehow become the number one LGBT author in the world. This is a twist no one expected. We’ll talk about it today. Also, the parents of the Oxford High School shooter are being charged with manslaughter. Is that the right move or does it set a dangerous precedent for the future? Or could both be true? Plus, Kamala Harris’s henpecked staffers go to increasingly awkward yet hilarious lengths to prove that they’re happy to work for her. And the New York Times says that hotels in New York should be turned into homeless encampments. What could possibly go wrong? A lot, it turns out. Finally in our daily cancellation, Rashida Tlaib makes a pitch for student loan forgiveness but I’ll explain why she is herself personally a perfect example of why there should not be student loan forgiveness.

      <title>Ep. 850 - Chicago Public Schools Cordially Invite Boys Into Girls Bathrooms</title>
      <description>Today on the Bestselling Children’s Author Show, Chicago public schools are excited to announce that every bathroom in the district, in every school, will now be gender neutral. How could they instate a policy like this right on the heels of the Loudoun County scandal where a girl was raped in a bathroom by a boy in a dress? We’ll talk about that today. Also the White House unveils its new “five point plan” for defeating COVID. Will this work better than the plan before this, or the one before that? And Whoopi Goldberg engages in shocking transphobia while attacking pro-lifers. The New York Times argues that abortion is good because adoption is bad. And Trevor Noah takes the vaccine red pill. An unexpected turn of events.

      <title>Ep. 849 - Brain Dead Supreme Court Justice Calls Unborn Babies Brain Dead</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, starring bestselling children’s author Matt Walsh, the Supreme Court hears a case that very well could overturn Roe v Wade. During arguments, Justice Sotomayor helpfully demonstrated the scientific and moral vacuousness of the pro-abortion side. We’ll look at that today. Also, my event at SLU went forward yesterday, despite the mob of protesters who stood outside blocking traffic. I tried to go out and talk to them but the conversation was not productive. And the Waukesha mass murderer complains that he’s being “demonized” for plowing his car into a parade and killing six people. Alec Baldwin makes himself the victim in his first interview since he shot and killed a woman on a movie set. And Australia hunts down three teenagers who escaped a quarantine camp. Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll take a look at the worst Christmas comedy of all time, just released by HBO.

      <title>Ep. 848 - Bestselling Children’s Author Banned From College Campus</title>
      <description>Today on the best selling children’s author Matt Walsh Show, leftists at St Louis University have gone to extreme lengths to get my talk tonight canceled. I’ll still be there tonight, but first we’ll talk about what we’ve learned from this whole absurd ordeal. Also, Chris Cuomo is suspended by CNN, yet Zoom sex fiend Jeffrey Toobin remains employed. How do they choose who gets free passes over there? And just a day after Jack Dorsey resigned as CEO, Twitter has already made a major move to censor free speech on the platform. Plus, the Jussie Smollett trial begins as new revelations emerge about just how far he went with his scam. And a CNBC host calls for the military to administer forced vaccinations.

      <title>Ep. 847 - I Now Identify As A Bestselling Children’s Author</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, I am now a children’s author. My book went on sale yesterday, and it’s already making some people very upset. I’ll explain why today. Also, Joe Biden gives a press conference about the dreaded super mega turbo omicron variant. Lauren Boebert and Ilhan Omar attempt to patch up their differences over a phone call and it doesn’t go well. Chris Cuomo finds himself in another scandal involving his brother. The trial of Kim Potter, the officer who accidentally shot Daunte Wright, begins. Most people on both the left and right seem to think she deserves jail time. I disagree and I’ll explain why. And we take a look at a gender studies masters thesis. You might expect it to be totally delusional and insane. And you’re right. But it’s even worse than you imagine.

      <title>Ep. 846 - Waukesha Has Already Been Stuffed Down The Memory Hole</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it’s been just a week since an anti-white racist massacred six people and injured dozens more at a Christmas parade. The media has already forgotten the attack. But we should not. Also, the robbery and looting epidemic continues to grip our cities. There is a mostly unexplored similarity between all of these incidents that we’ll talk about today. And the dreaded Omicron variant has everyone in a panic. Or at least we are told that we should panic over it. Is that reaction warranted? We’ll discuss. Plus, another white woman is caught pretending to be a minority. And a GOP congresswoman makes an edgy joke about Ilhan Omar and then commits her real sin by apologizing.

There is a mostly unexplored similarity between all of these incidents that we’ll talk about today. And the dreaded Omicron variant has everyone in a panic. Or at least we are told that we should panic over it. Is that reaction warranted? We’ll discuss. Plus, another white woman is caught pretending to be a minority. And a GOP congresswoman makes an edgy joke about Ilhan Omar and then commits her real sin by apologizing.

      <title>Ep. 845 - They Will Never Tell The Truth About The Waukesha Massacre </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a day after a serial felon and career criminal mowed down dozens of people at a Christmas parade, Democrats are out in public calling for more criminals to be released into our communities. Meanwhile, the killer was a BLM supporter and apparent racist who carried out his attack an hour from Kenosha, two days after the Rittenhouse verdict. Will we ever be told the truth about his motives? And, New York goes nuclear in the war on history, taking down a 200 year old Thomas Jefferson statue, and removing a Theodore Roosevelt statue from a museum. You have to hear the reason they gave for this decision. It’s almost impossible to believe. Plus, Kyle Rittenhouse talks to Tucker Carlson, Condoleeza Rice calls for more female coaches in the NFL, and Joe Biden claims that there's an epidemic of anti-trans hate crimes. Is that true? No, it isn't, but we’ll discuss that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 843 - Another Major Public School Sex Abuse Scandal </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as yet another sex abuse scandal engulfs yet another public school system, an NBC News op-ed argues that parents should stop involving themselves in educational matters. To intrude in the schools is like interfering with your child’s surgery, they say. It’s a terrible analogy but revealing. Speaking of NBC, an MSNBC reporter was caught following the Rittenhouse jury home after deliberations. What does it take to get a mistrial? And students at SLU have started a petition to stop me from speaking on campus. So I started my own petition to stop them from stopping me from speaking on campus. It’s the battle of the petition, and right now I’m winning in a landslide.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as yet another sex abuse scandal engulfs yet another public school system, an NBC News op-ed argues that parents should stop involving themselves in educational matters. To intrude in the schools is like interfering with your child’s surgery, they say. It’s a terrible analogy but revealing. Speaking of NBC, an MSNBC reporter was caught following the Rittenhouse jury home after deliberations. What does it take to get a mistrial? And students at SLU have started a petition to stop me from speaking on campus. So I started my own petition to stop them from stopping me from speaking on campus. It’s the battle of the petition, and right now I’m winning in a landslide.

      <title>Ep. 842 - More Outrage Theater From Democrats</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Democrats spend a day in Congress censuring and condemning a Republican for posting an offensive cartoon meme on his social media page. AOC says that anyone who doesn’t share in their outrage is a “nihilist.” But who are the real nihilists here? Also, the Daily Wire scores a major victory as OSHA suspends the Biden vaxx mandate. And huge, record numbers of people are dying of drug overdoses. Why is it happening? What’s going on? Plus, an MSNBC host warns us about the scourge of “white tears.” What does that mean? Besides that she’s racist. And a doctor says that he still can’t take his three year old to the grocery store because it would be “risking her life.” How can people, especially doctors, still be that deluded.

      <title>Ep. 841 - How The Media Rigged The Rittenhouse Trial </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as we await a verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse case, we ask this question: is it possible for anyone to get a fair trial in modern America, or has the media effectively put an end to fair trials in America? Also, an FBI whistleblower reveals that Merick Garland lied when he was testifying to lawmakers about the FBI’s pursuit of parents at school board meetings. Plus, a waffle house customer claims that a waitress committed a noose-related hate crime. When has a story like this not been a hoax? And in our daily cancellation, we will finally once and for all cancel sesame street.

      <title>Ep. 840 - The Conspiracy Against Kyle Rittenhouse</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the prosecutors in the Kyle Rittenhouse case make their closing arguments in their case against self-defense and the Second Amendment. We’ll take a look at the closing arguments, and we’ll trace this case all the way back to where it all really started. Also, Rep. Cori Bush claims that armed white supremacists shot at her. There is absolutely no evidence of this, of course. And Beto O’Rourke runs for governor. Plus, a city in Michigan elects an all-Muslim city council. The media says this is a great example of “racial diversity.” There are a number of problems with that claim. We’ll discuss. And a feminist author says that many women deeply regret having children and getting married. Is that true or just wishful thinking on her part?

      <title>Ep. 839 - 'Diversity' Is Code For 'Go To Hell, Whitey'</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Marine Corps hires a “chief diversity officer” as it moves towards its goal of creating a more diverse, equitable, and tolerant force. That’s the way they’re selling it, anyway. But today we’ll talk about what they really mean. Also, Kamala Harris is upset that she doesn’t have enough to do as Vice President, and now her team is accusing Joe Biden’s team of racism. Who could have possibly seen this coming? Plus, a Michigan school is forced to shut down because a large number of staff members have an adverse reaction to the COVID booster. And, as we discussed on Friday, a college professor is on a campaign to destigmatize pedophiles. The college has responded to the outrage. And Britney Spears is free. Should we celebrate? Should we care at all? We’ll talk about that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Marine Corps hires a “chief diversity officer” as it moves towards its goal of creating a more diverse, equitable, and tolerant force. That’s the way they’re selling it, anyway. But today we’ll talk about what they really mean. Also, Kamala Harris is upset that she doesn’t have enough to do as Vice President, and now her team is accusing Joe Biden’s team of racism. Who could have possibly seen this coming? Plus, a Michigan school is forced to shut down because a large number of staff members have an adverse reaction to the COVID booster. And, as we discussed on Friday, a college professor is on a campaign to destigmatize pedophiles. The college has responded to the outrage. And Britney Spears is free. Should we celebrate? Should we care at all? We’ll talk about that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 838 - College Professor Wants To Destigmatize Pedophilia</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we will expose the people who are openly trying to normalize and destigmatize pedophilia. It’s shocking and you need to hear about it. Also, Dave Portnoy goes on offense after the media smears him with a Me Too hit piece. Plus, the media runs cover for Biden after he uses some very un-PC language during a speech. And a male rapper wears a dress to an awards show, and we are still supposed to be shocked and impressed by this kind of thing. Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the claim that the only way to save our planet is to stop having babies. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 837 - Kyle Rittenhouse Is A Hero </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Kyle Rittenhouse takes the stand in his own defense. The DA pulls out every dirty trick in the book in an effort to railroad him. We’ll discuss the latest in the case today. Also, a George Floyd biography is coming soon. Will it include the part where he forced his way into a woman’s home and robbed her at gunpoint? And two couples at an IVF clinic have a mix up that results in their babies getting swapped. YouTube gets rid of the dislike counter in order to protect the fragile feelings of content creators like myself. And workplace masturbator Jeffrey Toobin appears on CNN with some highly ironic analysis of the Rittenhouse case.

      <title>Ep. 836 - The Conspiracy To Turn Our Kids Gay </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a new poll finds that forty percent — yes forty percent — of gen Z identifies as LGBT. What in God’s name is going on? We’ll try to figure that out today. And a witness in the Rittenhouse trial yesterday claims that the DA tried to get him to perjure himself. Plus, Jimmy Kimmel says that Americans only hate Kamala Harris because we’re all sexist. And a truck driver launches a long shot campaign for the New Jersey senate, wins, unseats a powerful incumbent, and now the media would like us to know that this is all very bad because he’s racist. In our Daily Cancellation, we’re told that climate change fears are giving millions of Americans PTSD. Is that true?

      <title>Ep. 835 - The War On Masculinity </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Senator Josh Hawley provokes mockery and jeers from the media for suggesting that there is an attack on masculinity in our culture. But he’s completely correct, of course. In fact, the situation is even worse than he describes. Masculinity is in its death throes in the West. And if masculinity dies, the West will go down with it. Also, another day, another prosecution witness in the Kyle Rittenhouse case accidentally destroys the prosecution’s case. Plus, Snopes does a fact check on the claim that Joe Biden let one rip in front of a member of the Royal Family. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the Republican Party’s embrace of sexual identity politics with the newly christened RNC Pride Coalition.

But he’s completely correct, of course. In fact, the situation is even worse than he describes. Masculinity is in its death throes in the West. And if masculinity dies, the West will go down with it. Also, another day, another prosecution witness in the Kyle Rittenhouse case accidentally destroys the prosecution’s case. Plus, Snopes does a fact check on the claim that Joe Biden let one rip in front of a member of the Royal Family. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the Republican Party’s embrace of sexual identity politics with the newly christened RNC Pride Coalition.

      <title>Ep. 834 - A Country That Honors Men Like Harvey Milk And George Floyd Cannot Survive</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a ship named after the pederast Harvey Milk was christened by a transgender Navy veteran over the weekend. It was a very encouraging and inspirational spectacle, to China. Also, eight people died during a rap concert. Is the performer to blame? And the sports media is beside itself with outrage because Aaron Rodgers didn’t get the COVID vaccine. Plus, SNL looks for comedy in abortion and only succeeds in proving the opposite point from what it was trying to prove. In our Daily Cancellation today, we will be once and for all canceling equality.

      <title>Ep. 833 - Our Big Tech Overlords Take Wokeness To A Whole New Level </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, our Big Tech overlords have unveiled a new ritual for us. Apparently now you are supposed to introduce yourself with name, pronouns, and also race. It’s the cutting edge of wokeness. Also, the prosecution’s case completely collapses in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial. The Left has a good laugh over inflation at the grocery store. A teacher explains what Democrats really mean when they say that Critical Race Theory isn’t taught in schools. And finally, Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports gets the Me Too treatment.

      <title>Ep. 832 - Yes, There Is A 'White Backlash.' As There Should Be. </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Daily Wire's legal fight against the Biden Administration officially begins. And, the media claims that the results in Virginia were the product of "white grievance" and "white backlash." They're not totally wrong. Plus, Pfizer's vaccine is now officially available to kids as young as five. Will a mandate be next? And what will happen if they try that? And mental health experts are finally admitting that masking has done psychological damage to people. I'm old enough to remember when such claims were dangerous, anti-science misinformation.

      <title>Ep. 831 - A Triumphant Moment For All Of Us Virginians </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Republican Glenn Youngkin pulled out a stunning victory last night. We’ll talk about the lessons that can be learned from it, and we’ll revel in the hilarious media meltdown today. Also, the mother of the boy who raped a girl in Loudoun County has finally spoken out. Her comments are revealing but perhaps not in the way she intends. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, is it cruel and callous for parents to kick their adult children out of the house and force them to live on their own?

      <title>Ep. 830 - When A Country Gives Up On Work</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a new report shows how government handouts have enabled record numbers of able-bodied young men to opt out of the workforce entirely and indefinitely. But why would young men want to opt out of work? Isn’t that the real problem? We’ll discuss today. Also, the Virginia governor’s race will be settled tonight. Terry McAuliffe made his closing case to voters last night, and I do not think that it will prove effective. Plus, the Supreme Court refused to step in an hear a case from a Catholic hospital that was sued after refusing to perform a sex change operation. And Sleepy Joe falls asleep at the UN climate summit. Finally, Atlanta Braves fans are still doing the tomahawk chop even though the media has repeatedly informed them that it is racist. But is it really racist? We’ll talk about that today and much more on the Matt Walsh Show.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a new report shows how government handouts have enabled record numbers of able-bodied young men to opt out of the workforce entirely and indefinitely. But why would young men want to opt out of work? Isn’t that the real problem? We’ll discuss today. Also, the Virginia governor’s race will be settled tonight. Terry McAuliffe made his closing case to voters last night, and I do not think that it will prove effective. Plus, the Supreme Court refused to step in an hear a case from a Catholic hospital that was sued after refusing to perform a sex change operation. And Sleepy Joe falls asleep at the UN climate summit. Finally, Atlanta Braves fans are still doing the tomahawk chop even though the media has repeatedly informed them that it is racist.

      <title>Ep. 829 - Kaepernick Says NFL Players Are Slaves But He Still Wants To Be One</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, race hustlers Colin Kaepernick and Ibram X Kendi both thoroughly embarrassed themselves over the weekend, exposing the emptiness and absurdity of their worldviews. It was a bad weekend for race hustlers in general, and we will revel in their self-immolation today. Also, Democrats in Virginia have all of the momentum going against them heading into the election on Tuesday, so they decided to resort to some good old fashioned fraud. And a Southwest Airlines pilot allegedly says "Let's go Brandon!" over the intercom on the plane, and this is apparently a crisis. Plus, rumors are swirling about Joe Biden's meeting with the pope. I feel duty-bound to discuss those rumors today.

      <title>Ep. 828 - High School Boys In Lingerie Give Their Principal A Lap Dance </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a school in Kentucky holds a “man pageant” where high school boys in lingerie gave lap dances to their teachers while a school in Florida brought elementary schoolers to a gay bar for a field trip. What is the issue with all of this? Is it an infringement on “parental rights”? Yes, but that’s not even half of the problem. Also, an uncharacteristically impressive performance from Republicans as they interrogate Attorney General Garland during a Senate hearing. And a woman is brutally assaulted on a train in New York while dozens of people stand by and watch. This is becoming a theme. Plus, a professor at Rutgers claims that black and brown people lived in peaceful harmony across the globe until white people ruined it all. And Anthony Weiner’s estranged wife says she was sexually assaulted by a US Senator. The problem is that her sexual assault story doesn’t feature an actual sexual assault.

      <title>Ep. 827 - The Disgraceful Political Show Trial Of Kyle Rittenhouse   </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as the Kyle Rittenhouse case heads to trial next week, we’ll talk about the people who should really be standing trial for everything that happened in Kenosha last summer. Also, the Daily Wire breaks major news that could be the nail in the McAuliffe campaign’s coffin. And more damning information has come out about the armorer on the set of that Alec Baldwin movie. Was this a diversity hire gone wrong? Plus, an Instagram influencer poses for selfies next to her father’s coffin. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’m afraid I must cancel many of you in the audience. I don’t want to do it, but I must.

      <title>Ep. 826 - A Country That Values Puppies Over People   </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Anthony Fauci is coming under fire from both the left and right, and what is it that has finally made the public turn on him? The answer to that question tells us quite a bit about our culture and its priorities. Also, a Virginia court rules that a girl was in fact raped inside a bathroom in a Loudoun County school, but the media still isn’t ready to accept the story. They are now engaging in what, in any other circumstance, would be called victim blaming. And a GOP senate candidate says he doesn’t believe in the separation of church and state. He’s getting criticism for that, but he has a point. Plus, the Republican candidate for governor in Virginia is surging in the polls after leaning into cultural and social issues. Might the Republican Party finally learn a valuable lesson from that?

      <title>Ep. 825 - Media Shocked To Discover That Children Need Fathers  </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media is shocked to discover that Dads matter. Apparently children need male role models in their life. Maybe the nuclear family isn’t a patriarchal conspiracy after all. Also, the latest on the bizarre and tragic Alec Baldwin story. And, the Treasury Secretary now wants to levy taxes on “unrealized capital gains.” If you don’t know why that’s an insane and tyrannical idea, I’ll explain.

      <title>Ep. 824 - A Generation Descends Into Mass Psychosis </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an entire generation of kids appear to be suffering from a kind of mass psychosis. This seems like a problem that deserves more attention than it’s getting. Also, megalomaniac Joe Biden brags that he has “restored the soul of our nation.” Merrick Garland is asked why he sent the FBI after parents at school board meetings, and his reason is less than sufficient. And how many undercover feds were at the January 6th riot? Were they the ones who encouraged the crowd to enter the Capital? The evidence is piling up. Plus, a 100 year old Robert E Lee statue will be melted down and turned into a new piece of art to celebrate diversity.

      <title>Ep. 823 - The Spoiled, Privileged Brats Who Wish They Were Oppressed </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the LGBT Netflix employees finally held their big walkout yesterday to protest Dave Chappelle and biological science. Only it wasn’t big. Just a small assortment of people gathered for the demonstration. Many on the Right think that the pathetic turnout was a failure and an embarrassment for the Left. But I think they’re missing the point completely. Also, the State Department celebrates national pronouns day, and Donald Trump launches his own social media platform. Is it on its way to wild success, or doomed to failure? Plus, the WNBA holds a parade in Chicago yesterday and you have to see the footage to really appreciate it. In our Daily Cancellation, I must cancel a Republican candidate for a political ad that you must be careful watching, as it may cause a fatal case of the cringe.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Netflix employees stage a walkout in protest of Dave Chapelle’s comedy show as the CEO of the company begins to cave. Also, Jen Psaki has a good laugh over the supply chain crisis. Katie Couric complains about sexism in the news industry.

      <title>Ep. 821 - The Left Turns Womanhood Into A Halloween Costume </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, our culture has turned womanhood into a costume for men to wear. We’ll discuss the latest example. Also, Colin Powell died of COVID and the media are quick to point out that he had comorbidities. But why is this the one time that they want to talk about COVID comorbidities? And the Loudoun County prosecutor defends his decision to send a rapist student to another school, where he proceeded to rape again. His defense is not very convincing. Plus, outrage over Hooters. Did you know that they require their waitresses to wear skimpy outfits? Shocking stuff. In our daily cancellation, we deal with a feminist college professor who says men have an unfair advantage in the workplace because of all the bonding we guys do in the bathroom. There are a number of problems with this theory. We’ll discuss that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 820 - A Society Overrun By Cowards And Weaklings</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a woman on a train in Philadelphia was sexually assaulted for nearly 10 minutes while bystanders watched and did nothing. Why does this sort of thing happen, and why does it appear to be so common these days? Also, the ACLU files an amicus brief in support of compelled speech. There was a time when the ACLU defended free speech. Times have changed. And Kamala Harris is campaigning in churches. How can she walk in the door without bursting into flames? Also, isn’t it illegal to campaign in churches? And finally, in our Daily Cancellation, the outrage mob is very upset at me because of some things I said about paternity leave. Will I apologize today, or double down? The answer may surprise you. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 819 - Secretary Buttigieg Disappears For Two Months And Nobody Notices</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Texas recently passed a bill banning racist concepts like critical race theory from the classroom. The media is now claiming that this rule somehow requires holocaust denial. We’ll try to figure out what the hell they’re talking about today. Also, the secretary of transportation has been on paternity leave for two months and nobody noticed. What does that say about the necessity of his job? And Amazon’s new Lord of the Ring series promises to include a cast of racially diverse hobbits. Plus, Joe Biden announces that your 5 year old will soon be eligible for the COVID vaccine.

Also, the secretary of transportation has been on paternity leave for two months and nobody noticed. What does that say about the necessity of his job? And Amazon’s new Lord of the Ring series promises to include a cast of racially diverse hobbits. Plus, Joe Biden announces that your 5 year old will soon be eligible for the COVID vaccine.

      <title>Ep. 818 - Loudoun County Is Not An Outlier. There's A Sex Assault Epidemic In Public Schools.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Loudoun County continues to lie about, and cover up, the sexual assault of a student inside the girl's bathroom by a boy in a dress. But Loudoun County is not an outlier. There has been a sex abuse epidemic in public schools for decades. Also, an NBA star will not be allowed to play for his team because he refuses to get vaccinated. And Bill DeBlasio removes a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Plus, Republicans remain mostly silent about the Biden Administration's plan to monitor our bank accounts. And Demi Lovato continues to speak out about her alien encounters. In our Daily Cancellation, has the remake craze over at Disney finally gone too far?

      <title>Ep. 817 - Gay Superman Defeats Climate Change And Racism </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, confirming our longstanding suspicions, Superman has come out as gay. Yet another iconic character has been inducted into the LGBT community. We’re told that this is all about creating greater representation for supposedly marginalized groups, but I think there’s something else going on and I’ll explain. Also, parents in Loudoun County call for the superintendent to resign after the school district covered up the rape of a girl in a school bathroom. And the Chicago police department is having trouble recruiting new cops. I wonder why? Plus, Lego commits itself to combating gender stereotypes.

      <title>Ep. 816 - NFL Fires Coach For Vulgar Language. Still Employs Domestic Abusers And Drug Addicts.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, NFL head coach Jon Gruden has been forced to resign after the media published his private emails containing “vulgar language.” Meanwhile, the NFL still employs domestic abusers, rapists, and drug addicts. But none of those crimes are as bad as thought crimes. Also, Southwest cancellations continue as the CEO of the company continues to deny that it has anything to do with a vaccine mandate. And California, always on the forefront of the culture of death, passes a bill making it easier for people to kill themselves.

      <title>Ep. 815 - No, I Will Not Celebrate "Indigenous People's Day"</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Columbus Day has been increasingly replaced by Indigenous People's Day. We're told that we should celebrate Indigenous People rather than Columbus, because Columbus was a violent man who conquered lands that didn't belong to him. And that's mostly true, but I still say we should celebrate him and I'll explain why today. Also, Southwest canceled thousands of flights right as its employees went on strike over its vaccine mandates. But the media insists that the two issues are not connected at all. Plus, the family of the Texas school shooter continues to defend him, even though he brought a gun to school and shot people. And in our Daily Cancellation, we'll talk about one of the most nauseating ESPN segments ever aired on the network.

      <title>Ep. 814 - Sane People Are The Most Marginalized Community In America </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the backlash against Dave Chappelle grows, as the media insists that any and all jokes about, or criticisms of, LGBT people are out of bounds and automatically bigoted. They say that LGBT people are marginalized and that’s why you can’t make these jokes. But if you aren’t allowed to joke about a group of people, isn’t that an indication that they are the exact opposite of marginalized? Also, the high school student who shot a teacher and two classmates on Wednesday was released on bail on Thursday. What’s going on there? And the New York Times claims that 900,000 children have been hospitalized with COVID, which isn’t even close to true. And a new study confirms that women are attracted to men who can provide for them financially. What does it say about our society that we needed a study to confirm that obvious fact? We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 813 - Why My Kids Aren’t Getting The COVID Vaccine  </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Pfizer is seeking an “emergency authorization” to start giving the vaccine to kids aged 5 to 11. But what’s the emergency exactly? And what will we do when the government starts mandating this stuff to young children? Also, gang members in Chicago get into a shootout in broad daylight, and the DA has decided to charge none of them with crimes. Plus, a school shooting in Texas has the Left screaming about gun control again, but as always they’re missing the point. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll consider the TikToker who claims that almost all men are rapists.

      <title>Ep. 812 - The Most Far Reaching Censorship Campaign In American History</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the senate held a hearing with the “Facebook whistleblower” yesterday, setting the stage for the most far reaching censorship campaign in American history. Also, an ESPN anchor is pulled off the air after criticizing vaccine mandates. And Dave Chappelle has a new comedy special out. The media insists that it is “incendiary” and “bigoted,” so you know it must be good. Finally, race baiter Ibram X Kendi preaches his version of the Gospel message, and it is as heretical as you might expect.

      <title>Ep. 811 - FBI Focuses On The Real Threat: Parents At School Board Meetings </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as left wing activists stalk lawmakers in bathrooms, the FBI has been mobilized to hunt down parents who raise their voices during school board meetings. Also, Facebook goes mysteriously dark for hours as Democrats and the media ramp up pressure to compel the company to further censor conservative content. And a new report shows how the United States has the strictest mask guidelines for children in the entire world. Plus, a trans activist tries to get a fast food employee fired for “misgendering,” in one of the most vicious cancel culture campaigns we’ve seen yet.

      <title>Ep. 810 - The Truth About The Facebook ‘Whistleblower’  </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media is promoting the story of the Facebook “whistleblower.” She was on 60 Minutes last night, revealing alleged secrets about the Big Tech giant. But this story is not what it appears to be. We’ll talk about it today. Also, Fauci says that maybe — just maybe — we might be able to “get back to normal” by Christmas, but maybe not. And a Democratic senator is chased into a bathroom, and recorded inside the bathroom, by crazed left wing activists. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss a recent article arguing that God needs new preferred pronouns.

      <title>Ep. 809 - Killing Your Children Is A Loving Act, According To Democrats </title>
      <description>Democrats and abortion supporters ranted, raved, and cried during a committee hearing on the Texas abortion law yesterday. Also, the national school board association is asking for the Biden Administration’s help in fighting back against the “domestic terrorists” who are saying mean things to them during school board meetings. And a Republican congressman says some brave and necessary things about the family and responsibility. Plus, Demi Lovato has an encounter with aliens, and a New York Times op-ed argues that divorce is an act of “radical self-love.”

      <title>Ep. 808 - Ron DeSantis Is Accused Of Not Being A Tyrant </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a left wing group puts out the most unintentionally hilarious political attack ad of all time, hitting Ron DeSantis for not being a tyrant. Also, there’s another alleged scandal involving Kristi Noem. And Netflix’s most popular show right now is gratuitously violent Korean torture porn. What does that tell us if anything? Plus, YouTube moves to ban all anti-vaxx content. But what even is anti-vaxx content? And in our Daily Cancellation, I must cancel dating apps. And I’ll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 807 - Local Virginia Man Speaks At School Board </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we finally descended upon Loudoun County yesterday, my new home, to make our voices heard. Though the school board threw every possible roadblock in the way. But the Loudoun County situation is part of a larger and more important conversation about who, exactly, should be determining what our kids are taught in schools. The state, or the parents? Also, the chairman of the joint chiefs is asked why he won’t resign for his failures in Afghanistan. His answer is less than sufficient. Greta Thunberg babbles incoherently and receives raucous applause. A black teacher in California is not pleased with the special gift basket she's given for being black. And Will Smith says that his open marriage with his wife is perfect, beautiful, and loving. Somehow I doubt that.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we finally descended upon Loudoun County yesterday, my new home, to make our voices heard. Though the school board threw every possible roadblock in the way. But the Loudoun County situation is part of a larger and more important conversation about who, exactly, should be determining what our kids are taught in schools. The state, or the parents? Also, the chairman of the joint chiefs is asked why he won’t resign for his failures in Afghanistan. His answer is less than sufficient. Greta Thunberg babbles incoherently and receives raucous applause. A black teacher in California is not pleased with the special gift basket she's given for being black. And Will Smith says that his open marriage with his wife is perfect, beautiful, and loving. Somehow I doubt that.

      <title>Ep. 806 - The Vaccine Sacrament </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the governor of New York is set to fire hundreds of health care workers for not getting vaccinated, artificially creating a healthcare worker shortage. While speaking at a church, she framed her vaccine mandates in explicitly religious terms. It’s blasphemous but revealing. Also, Joe Biden gets his third COVID shot while announcing that things won’t get back to normal until 98 percent of all people are jabbed. Plus, a medical journal refers to women as “bodies with vaginas.” And more information has come out about that guy who whipped up a social media mob against a woman who allegedly said something mean about him at the dog park. Finally, the local media here in my home of Virginia are not happy that I’ve come to speak at the Loudoun County school board. We’ll play a few clips for you today.

      <title>Ep. 805 - The power of victimhood</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, cancel culture claims another victim. This time, a random woman at a dog park has her whole life destroyed after an out of context video goes viral. Also, Liz Cheney comes out for trans rights. Biden tells blatant lies about border patrol. The media wonders why so many people with COVID symptoms are testing negative for the virus. I have a theory. Plus, the Loudoun County school board tried to stop me from speaking at their next meeting by changing the rules. But I may have found a workaround. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will cancel the female James Bond before she even exists.

      <title>Ep. 804 - White Students Singled Out And Harassed In The Name Of Multiculturalism </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, two white students are kicked out of a study hall at Arizona State University for the crime of being white. Also, a couple of the Afghans we evacuated from the country in August have already been charged with sex crimes. And a mother at a school board meeting confronts the school board over the heinous and pornographic books that are being distributed to students in the district. Plus, Australian police are now firing rubber bullets indiscriminately into crowds of protesters. Finally, a woman on the subway is offended by pornographic OK Cupid ads, so she takes matters into her own hands.

      <title>Ep. 803 - The ACLU Rewrites History And Erases Women At The Same Time </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the ACLU honors the anniversary of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death by erasing women. Also, whip-gate enters its fourth day, with the Democrats and the media sticking to the false narrative, no matter how many times it is debunked. And several late night hosts all teamed up last night to bring our attention to the alleged climate crisis. It was hilarious comedy, as always from that group. Plus, Kim Kardashian is leading the charge to free another murderer from prison. And Vice publishes an article claiming that natural immunity doesn’t exist at all. Isn’t that medical misinformation?

      <title>Ep. 802 - Yes, The Media Ignores Black Murder Victims. Here’s The Real Reason Why.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, some in the news media are claiming that the Gabby Petito case is only getting all of this attention because she’s a white woman. They say that black men and women who are killed or go missing are often ignored. They’re actually right. But not for the reason they think. We’ll discuss the real reason behind this disparity today. Also, Kamala Harris condemns border patrol agents for using whips on Haitian immigrants, even though border patrol agents did not use whips on Haitian immigrants. And BTS performs for the UN general assembly, providing yet another reason to abolish the UN. 500 female sports stars come out in support of abortion rights. I didn’t even know there were 500 female sports stars. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the increasing trend of teachers coming out to their students.

      <title>Ep. 801 - The Media Spins Its Most Absurd False Narrative Yet</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media specializes in spinning false narratives. But the narrative they’ve concocted about border patrol agents on horseback whipping and lassoing Haitian immigrants is perhaps the most absurd yet. We’ll discuss today. Also, speaking of those illegals, shouldn’t we be treating the immigrant invasion as a biological terror threat, given that none of them are masked or vaccinated? We treat unvaccinated American citizens that way, after all. Plus, Australia descends further and further into fascism. Is it a preview of things to come in this country? And Facebook conducts its own research and discovers that social media is deeply harmful to kids. It then did the responsible and ethical thing and immediately swept those findings under the rug. We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

We treat unvaccinated American citizens that way, after all. Plus, Australia descends further and further into fascism. Is it a preview of things to come in this country? And Facebook conducts its own research and discovers that social media is deeply harmful to kids. It then did the responsible and ethical thing and immediately swept those findings under the rug. We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. </p><p>You petitioned, and we heard you.

      <title>Ep. 800 - Trans Sex Offender Harasses Women. Media Sides With Sex Offender.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a few months ago, the entire corporate media condemned a woman a bigot and a transphobe when she complained about a man exposing himself inside the women’s locker room at Wi Spa in Los Angeles. But in recent weeks, the media has stopped talking about the case completely. That’s because of the recent revelations about this man, and what he was really doing inside that locker room. They don’t want us to talk about this story anymore, but we will today. Also, the mayor of San Francisco defends herself against charges of hypocrisy after being seen partying maskless at a night club. Daycare workers are caught on tape trying to force a mask onto a very young child. The former head of the FDA says that the whole “six feet of social distancing” rule was arbitrary and nobody knows where it came from. And the Biden Administration now wants permanent access to all of your banking information and your transaction history. Who could possibly object to that?

      <title>Ep. 799 - It Might Be Time For A National Divorce </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, is it now officially and finally time for us to break up? Do we need a national divorce, or is there another solution to the increasing division and hostility in our country? Also, the Biden Administration withholds lifesaving COVID treatments from red states. The Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Virginia makes the case for executing fully developed viable infants in the third trimester of pregnancy. Lil Nas X shares his real thoughts about the kids he might be influencing. And the right rallies around Nicki Minaj after she comes out in support of vaccine choice. She’s right about the issue, but are we a little too quick to hail celebrities as heroes if they agree with us about one issue?

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show an asthmatic two year old is kicked off a plane for not complying with masking regulations while video shows yet another woman getting followed around the grocery store and harassed by a male member of the masking cult.

Also, a mayor in Ohio threatens to arrest the entire school board because of pornographic material distributed to students. And Meghan Markle and Harry are named one of the most influential people in the world. But they still just want privacy.

      <title> Ep. 797 - It's Time For Me To Go To Another School Board Meeting</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, I have found the next school board that I will be visiting, but I’m not going alone this time. I’ll tell you all about that today. Also, the recall of Governor Newsom in California fails miserably. What can we as conservatives learn from that, if anything? Plus, I have a few thoughts on the tragic death of Norm Macdonald. And what about the story of General Milley going directly to the Chinese government to circumvent Trump? Isn’t that treason? Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with this question: is it white supremacy to tell kids in school to be quiet and behave? One teacher thinks so. We’ll talk about that today and much more on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 796 - AOC Takes Brave Stand Against Rich Elites By Partying With Them</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the ruling class got together at the Met Gala last night to celebrate their wealth. AOC was on the scene in a “Tax the Rich” dress. Was it a courageous and rebellious display by the congresswoman, or rank, shameless hypocrisy? We’ll discuss. Also, a new poll shows that an increasing number of vaccinated Americans are cutting off ties with unvaccinated friends. Plus, Secretary of State Blinken admits that many of those SIV applicant Afghans we’re admitting into the country are not actually SIV applicants. And, a male MMA fighter enters the ring with a female fighter and beats her into submission. This is being celebrated as a brave and beautiful moment in sports history, but I have a different take. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the VMAs were last night. It was vulgar and debauched and also boring and nobody cared about it. I think there’s an important lesson in that, which I’ll explain today. Also, George Bush gave a speech on 9-11 which has the Left celebrating him. Bush went from Hitler Incarnate to “one of the good ones.” What does that tell us? And white liberals keep calling Larry Elder a white supremacist. Plus, a new poll shows that Democrat voters consider Trump supporters to be a bigger threat than the Taliban or China. And finally many people in the media have been defending the vaccine mandates on the basis that they have the right to be free from COVID. Is that true? Does any such right exist?

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the VMAs were last night. It was vulgar and debauched and also boring and nobody cared about it. I think there’s an important lesson in that, which I’ll explain today. Also, George Bush gave a speech on 9-11 which has the Left celebrating him. Bush went from Hitler Incarnate to “one of the good ones.” What does that tell us? And white liberals keep calling Larry Elder a white supremacist. Plus, a new poll shows that Democrat voters consider Trump supporters to be a bigger threat than the Taliban or China. And finally many people in the media have been defending the vaccine mandates on the basis that they have the right to be free from COVID. Is that true? Does any such right exist?

      <title>Ep. 794 - The Decaying Old Tyrant Must Be Defied</title>
      <description>You petitioned, and we heard you. Made for Sweet Babies everywhere: get the official Sweet Baby Gang t-shirt here: https://utm.io/udIX3
Today on the Matt Walsh Show, President Biden attempts one of the most tyrannical power grabs in the history of the presidency, issuing a vaccine mandate that affects 100 million Americans. I’ll have plenty to say about that today. Also, on the same day that the president tried to force 100 million Americans to inject a substance into their body, Kamala Harris went in front of cameras to speak out in defend of bodily autonomy. There seems to be a disconnect. And the Left comes to the defense of a death row inmate, claiming that pro-lifers are hypocrites if they don’t do the same. Is it true that pro-lifers have an obligation to oppose the death penalty? Also, a woman says she’s the victim of fat phobia and racism because she was kicked off a plane for not wearing a shirt.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, one of the largest and oldest Confederate statues has now come down in Virginia. But it is what they plan to put in its place that really tells the story. Also, the State Department continues to issue stern verbal warnings to the Taliban over their lack of inclusivity. And Larry Elder is physically attacked by a crazed leftist in a monkey mask. And Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has made her scientific case for why men can menstruate. We will hear her out. Maybe she makes a good case.

      <description>You petitioned, and we heard you. Made for Sweet Babies everywhere: get the official Sweet Baby Gang t-shirt here: https://utm.io/udIX3
Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a new report reveals how men have abandoned the university system. Why has this happened? I think I know why. Also, satanists are coming to the defense of abortion rights, what does that tell us? And in our daily cancellation, we will have another exciting reverse cancellation. Apparently some people are upset because I said that females shouldn’t be football analysts.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a viral video reveals again that our once great American cities have turned into something out of a horror movie. The question is why and how this happened. I’ll give my answer today. Also Five Headlines including the CEO of a video game development company comes out as pro-life and pays the consequence. Joe Biden changes his mind about when life begins. And a female sports reporter claims that she was groped by fans while reporting on a football game, but the video shows something different. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 789 - Leftism Is A Death Cult</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show the pro-abortion, leftist death cult continues to meltdown in spasms of demonic rage over the Texas abortion law. We'll talk about that. Also, a new report says that half of the nation's children are overweight or obese. I wonder if keeping them cooped up inside for a year and a half could have something to do with that? And the Bachelor contestant canceled a few months ago for going to an old south themed frat party has hit the interview circuit for her apology tour and it's incredibly embarrassing to watch as you might expect. Plus, fast food restaurants are so desperate for workers that they're now advertising openings for 14 and 15 year olds. Some people are upset about this, apparently, but I think it's a good thing.

      <title>Ep. 788 - Leftists Weep And Wail Because Fewer Babies Will Die In Texas</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, our good friend Kristi Noem wrote an op-ed explaining what she thinks conservatism means, and what conservatives should stand for. Her ideas in this regard are pretty standard for Republicans. They’re also wrong. I’ll explain. Also, Five Headlines including the Texas abortion bill effectively banning most abortions in the state went into effect this morning. It’s is a wonderful moment and significant progress in the right direction. But Leftists, as you can imagine, are quite upset that fewer babies will be dying. Plus, Joe Biden gives another address to the nation to defend his catastrophic failures in Afghanistan. Every time he tries to defend himself, he just looks worse. And the LA Unified School district sent out its COVID guidelines for the school year, and they’re as deranged as you might expect. Maybe even a little more than you expected.

      <title>Ep. 787 - Pledging Allegiance To The Pride Flag Of The United States Of LGBT</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the head of the LA teachers union admits that she doesn’t care about kids learning academic subjects. She just wants them to be properly indoctrinated. She may be the one saying it out loud, but this is how the public school system has operated for decades. Also, the CDC has expanded its interests beyond infectious diseases and is now fighting the scourge of gun violence. And can you now lose custody of your kids if you aren’t vaccinated? Things seem to be trending that way. Plus in our Daily Cancellation, a firefighter in Virginia is under investigation for making an allegedly racist movement with his fingers. The story only gets more insane from there. We’ll talk about that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 786 - Psychologist Prescribes Mass Suicide For White People</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a prominent psychologist suggests that white people should kill themselves while another worries that white people are haunted by the “ghosts of whiteness.” It’s just more radical leftism from mental health professionals. The entire industry is rife with it. We’ll talk about the consequences of that fact today. Also, Dr. Fauci endorses vaccine mandates for children and makes a predictably misleading argument in favor of them. A security guard shoots a man because he wasn’t wearing a mask and says it’s self-defense. Hollywood churns out another woke remake. And speaking of Hollywood, why was James Cordon stopping traffic and thrusting his pelvis in the faces of unsuspecting motorists?

      <title>Ep. 785 - The Ashli Babbitt Shooting Looks Even Worse Now That The Cop Has Spoken Out</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the cop who killed Ashli Babbitt has gone public. He was interviewed by NBC. And after seeing him, and listening to his side, I am even more sure than I was before that her killing was unjustified. She was murdered. Also, President Biden literally falls apart on camera while responding to the terrorist killing of 13 American servicemen. And the Supreme Court shuts down Biden’s unconstitutional eviction moratorium. Plus, the media is lying about COVID in Florida, again. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the new non-binary remix of “It’s Raining Men."

      <title>Ep. 784 - Governor Kristi Noem Is Offended By My 'Horrible Misogyny' </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Republican governor of South Dakota has accused me of “horrible misogyny” because I criticized her. She used leftist buzzwords and even a Media Matters clip to hit me, in hopes of impressing the Left. But as always when Republicans try this kind of move, it has not worked out as she intended. We’ll talk about it today. Also, Dylann Roof’s death penalty sentence was upheld yesterday, and yet we haven’t heard any of the anti-death penalty advocates on the Left protest the decision, funny enough. And a freshman orientation seminar at a university claims that straight, white, Christians are natural oppressors. Plus, Nancy Pelosi calls for congress to pass a law that will stop hurricanes and floods from happening. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the DoorDash delivery drivers who are calling for higher wages and better tips. But do they really deserve it?

      <title>Ep. 783 - A Country Filled With Prostitutes And Sex-Starved Losers</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show we will follow the saga of Only Fans. First it announced that it was getting rid of pornographic content but after a huge backlash from the public the company has backtracked. What does this whole drama tell us about our culture? We’ll discuss today. Also, the rapper Busta Rhymes delivers one of the best anti-mask speeches we’ve yet seen. And the Republican governor of South Dakota says that she will not prevent employers from imposing vaccine mandates. And Planned Parenthood gets into the trans hormone therapy game. Plus in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll ask the important question: is air conditioning racist? The answer might surprise you.

      <title>Ep. 782 - There Is A Conspiracy To Sexualize Your Children. Here's Where It All Started.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as more school boards across the country adopt radical pro-transgender policies, it is time that we take a step back and trace the roots of this madness. We know that our country has gone insane, and that the insanity is being especially foisted upon our children, but how did we end up this way? Where did it begin? Who did it begin with? Today we’ll discuss the two men who started it all. Also, doctors in Florida walk out of the job in protest against patients who aren’t vaccinated. And the government has investigated itself and decided that it didn’t do anything wrong when Ashli Babbitt was shot in the Capitol, though they still won’t tell us who shot her. And a viral trend has people suffering devastating head injuries while trying to climb milk crates. It is very hilarious, I mean troubling. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the revolutionary new social movement called “lying flat,” in which people just lie around all day doing nothing. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 781 - If You're Scared, Stay Home. I'll Be Out Here Living My Life</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as we have seen for many months now, many people in this country and across the west are eager to give up their basic rights and liberties for fear of COVID. They insist that we should all live in the same way, fearful and oppressed. But I have a different solution, which I will suggest today. Also, President Biden warns those in the path of Tropical Storm Henri that they must remember to wear their masks when the storm hits. And the media claims there is a “Rising trend” of anti-mask parents physically assaulting teachers. The trend doesn’t exist. They’re making it up. We’ll look at the facts today. And finally, the cancel mob has taken a special interest in the hunt for a new host of Jeopardy. Why do they care so much?

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Bank of America is the latest major corporation to institute a radical racial reeducation program for its employees. This is perhaps the worst one yet. Also, American citizens in Afghanistan, according to a report, have to pay for the privilege of being evacuated from the country. And Jamaicans protest the US embassy for flying a pride flag. The social media mob digs up dirt on the new Jeopardy host for some reason. And in our daily cancellation, we will discuss Mark Zuckerberg’s plan to turn Facebook into a virtual reality experience. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 779 - To Save Our Civilization, Get Married And Have Lots of Babies</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the US birth rate is collapsing. Our civilization is going extinct. Some may consider this a minor problem, others say it’s actually a good thing. We’ll discuss. Also, Joe Biden finally answers some questions about his Afghanistan evacuation plan and his answers were more unintelligible than usual. He is falling apart before our eyes. Meanwhile, the Left continues to argue that the Taliban in Afghanistan really aren’t any worse than conservatives here in America. This line of argument raises a few questions. And, a doctor in Alabama announces that he will not see any patients who haven’t been vaccinated, while another doctor elsewhere in the country takes a picture of himself crying on the job and posts it to Twitter, to raise awareness about the fact that he’s an attention starved drama queen.

      <title>Ep. 778 - Fleeing Taliban Runs For Cover As US Sends Sternly Worded Letters </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, already the clamoring has begun to accept thousands of Afghan refugees. Meanwhile, our own people — thousands of them — are still trapped in Afghanistan, and the Biden Administration is not guaranteeing that all will be rescued. This is another example of what an America Last policy looks like. Also, a top vaccine official in Tennessee said that she was mailed a dog muzzle as a threat from anti-vaxxers. You’ll never guess who really sent it. Meanwhile, New Zealand goes into full lockdown over one COVID case. Just one. And Australia has now instructed its people that they must not drink outside without a mask. And, the biggest news of all, Carrie Underwood has sparked controversy by liking one of my tweets. This headline-making news has caused lots of distress to lots of people, and it is all quite hilarious.

      <title>Ep. 777 - A More Diverse And Inclusive Taliban </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it could be a Babylon Bee headline, but it is tragically real: the State Department issued a statement yesterday calling for the Taliban to be “inclusive” and “representative.” Our country is run by people who are completely out of touch with all semblance of reality. We cannot hope to solve Afghanistan’s problems if we cannot solve that problem. Also, Joe Biden makes his excuses in a speech yesterday. He’s been roundly panned for the speech, and for good reason, but was he actually right about some of what he said? We’ll discuss. And the governor of Tennessee tells the state’s public schools that they cannot issue mask mandates. Nashville schools do it anyway. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about Lizzo’s claims that her critics are fat phobic, sexist, and racist.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it could be a Babylon Bee headline, but it is tragically real: the State Department issued a statement yesterday calling for the Taliban to be “inclusive” and “representative.” Our country is run by people who are completely out of touch with all semblance of reality. We cannot hope to solve Afghanistan’s problems if we cannot solve that problem. Also, Joe Biden makes his excuses in a speech yesterday. He’s been roundly panned for the speech, and for good reason, but was he actually right about some of what he said? We’ll discuss. And the governor of Tennessee tells the state’s public schools that they cannot issue mask mandates. Nashville schools do it anyway. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about Lizzo’s claims that her critics are fat phobic, sexist, and racist.

      <title>Ep. 776 - There Are No More Rainbow Flags In Afghanistan</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, President Biden goes into hiding as his Afghan withdrawal plan falls apart. I have quite a lot to say about this subject, and by the end, if I’ve done my job, I will probably have ticked off everyone on all sides of the issue. Also, the American Academy of Pediatrics gaslights the critics of masking children, while the Surgeon General declares that you do not have the right to share opinions that he deems “misinformation.” Plus, Tim Tebow made his NFL debut, which is proof of racism, according to many people in sports media. In our Daily Cancellation, I’ll respond to my critics who say that I am a white supremacist conspiracy theorist because of something I said on my show on Friday.

      <title>Ep. 775 - Dangerous, Radical, Far-Right Mob Promotes Science And Common Sense</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media is reporting that I was part of a radical, chaotic, extremist, dangerous mob at the school board meeting a few days ago. That’s not exactly how I remember it. This is just one of the lies they are telling as part of their latest push to convince you to panic over COVID all over again. Also, a woman in California has been charged with murder after throwing her infant off of a roof. She obviously deserves to rot in prison for what she did, and yet I can’t help but notice that if she had killed her infant only a few months earlier, and for the same reason, we would be told to celebrate her. And, Media Matters publishes a report highlighting the supposed “transphobia” of the Daily Wire in a transparent effort to get us booted from YouTube. Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll try to figure out whether it is actually sexist to describe a woman as “nice.” Jen Psaki says it is.

      <title>Ep. 774 - A Pandemic Of Entitlement And Laziness </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, there are ten million jobs open in this country right now because employers are finding it impossible to coax the unemployed off of their couches. I want to talk about this crisis, and also share some of the stories from these business owners, so that we can all understand what they are up against. If you think our country has an entitlement problem, wait until you hear this. Also, an elementary school in Atlanta is under fire for instating racial segregation. They literally had black classrooms and white classrooms. Plus, Larry Elder is running for governor of California. He’s a reliable conservative, very outspoken, which is why his answer about trans bathrooms was surprising. And the health chief down in Australia has warned the people of that country that they must avoid all conversation in public, because conversation can be deadly. I hate small talk as much as the next guy, but this seems to be overboard.

      <title>Ep. 773 - My Adventure At The School Board Meeting </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as a concerned community member, I personally attended a Nashville School Board meeting yesterday to voice my opinion on the district’s universal mask mandate. Many others were there, on both sides of the issue. It was an illuminating experience. I’ll tell you about it and play some of the footage. Also, Andrew Cuomo is resigning. Conservatives are celebrating. But the Left is celebrating too, which tells me that maybe this isn’t the big win that we think it is. I’ll explain. And Dr. Fauci has some thoughts on freedom. He’s not a fan of it, apparently. No surprise there. Plus, in our Daily Cancellation, we ask the question: are master bedrooms racist? The answer might surprise you.

      <title>Ep. 772 - Famous Olympic Quitter Comes Out In Favor Of Baby Murder</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, for her next act, Simone Biles has come out as stridently pro-abortion. The Left is celebrating the news, but the argument she makes in favor of baby murder is quite demented, especially considering her own background. Also, CNN helps to raise 200 grand for a single mother who was facing eviction. But it turns out the story was a scam. President Biden is now inviting Tik Tok influencers to the White House to perform weird pro-vaccine skits. And we have an unfortunate but important update on the James Younger story. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with an NPR story about an alleged 1000 year old non-binary medieval warrior who was recently unearthed by archeologists. The story only gets weirder and dumber from there.

      <title>Ep. 771 - Eat, Drink, And Be Merry, For Tomorrow You'll Probably Get COVID</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, many people are very upset after Obama flouted every COVID safety guidelines to throw himself a giant birthday party. But I think there are some important lessons we can take from this, which go beyond simple outrage. I’ll explain today. Also, some truly inspiring not to mention hilarious video of one old guy who has no time for the left’s gender nonsense. You have to see this. And the media claims that children’s hospitals are filling up with COVID patients. Is that even remotely true? Plus, a prison inmate gets 25 years for beating a child rapist to death. If you already feel like that sentence is grossly unfair, wait until you hear the rest of the story. Then, in our Daily Cancellation, I will confront Nike over its latest commercial, which you will not be able to watch without dying of secondhand embarrassment.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as we head into another school year, with our kids subjected to mask mandates on top of the usual leftist indoctrination, we need to ask one question: is it possible to save the school system, or is it time to simply abandon it? Also, CNN starts firing employees who don’t get the vaccine. A Gallup poll finds that no Hispanic person actually wants to be called Latinx. A journalist fires a so-called “assault rifle” for the first time, and his reaction is hilarious. The medal winning women’s olympic weightlifters are asked about the male who competed against them, and their response tells you everything you need to know. And in our daily cancellation, we’ll have the story of a Hollywood actress who says she is expressing her love for her husband by divorcing him.

      <title>Ep. 769 - For Leftist Elites, Hypocrisy Is The Point</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, squad member Cori Bush gives a shockingly honest answer when asked why she uses private security even as she calls for defunding the police. You should hear this, and we’ll play it today and talk about the lessons we might learn from it. Also, CNN runs a story that unintentionally reveals the psychological abuse that some COVID-panicked parents are subjecting their children to. It’s worse than you think. And Ron DeSantis again proves why he should be the 2024 frontrunner. Plus, in our Daily Cancellation, we have a story about a trans YouTuber named Chris Chan that is so outrageous that if I summarized it right now, you’d think I was making it up.

      <title>Ep. 768 - Tyrannical Biden Administration Abolishes Private Property Rights</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the CDC has extended the eviction moratorium once again forbidding property owners from evicting tenants who don’t pay their rent. Biden admits that this isn’t constitutional and he has no authority to do what he’s doing, and yet he does it anyway. This is what it’s like to live in a lawless country. Also we have our Five Headlines. The New York Attorney General releases her report detailing Governor Cuomo’s serial sexual harassment. But I’m still mostly concerned about the fact that Cuomo killed thousands of elderly people. Plus, the NIH director says that parents should wear masks in their homes to protect their children, and later backtracks. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the rapper who is in the middle of a PR crisis because of his comments about gay people. Yet this rapper says many more objectionable things in his songs, and few people seem to have a problem with that.

      <title>Ep. 766 - I Cannot Trust The Experts Because They've All Gone Insane</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are told that we must trust the medical and scientific experts, but what if the medical and scientific experts have gone completely insane and abandoned the most basic medical and scientific truths for ideological reasons? What then? We’ll talk about that today. Also Five Headlines including some good news from the Olympics as the women’s USA soccer team continues to lose and the trans weightlifter Laurel Hubbard completely flops in embarrassing fashion. Plus, Democrats panic as the eviction moratorium comes to an end. But should there have ever been an eviction moratorium? And we’re told that Florida is in the middle of a COVID crisis. Is that true? We’ll talk about the data that the panic pushers don’t want us to focus on. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, Fauci, Don Lemon, and Ted Lieu and others all say that you have the right to be free from sickness. They’re horrible wrong, of course, and I’ll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 765 - A Three Point Plan To Defeat COVID And Live Forever</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as mask mandates return and talk of lockdowns picks up, it is clear that no amount of COVID risk is acceptable. With that in mind, I have come up with a three phase plan to eliminate the COVID risk and ensure that all of us can live safely and happily forever. I will share that with you today. Also we have our Five Headlines, including the journalist who had her own proposal: porn for kids. Yes, really. Plus, Facebook gets ready to unveil glasses that will record everything we do. And a restaurant owner calls Chris Cuomo to task live on air. We’ll play the heartwarming clip. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with Chris Hayes from MSNBC, who made an argument for masking while vaccinated that is truly breathtaking in its stupidity.

      <title>Ep. 764 - Wear The Mask Forever, You Peasants</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the mask mandates are returning and you aren’t allowed to question it. This is how “science” works now. Namely, like religious dogma. Also we have our five headlines including the Capitol officers continuing their media tour, a former president of Planned Parenthood says she was shocked to discover that Planned Parenthood only cares about abortion, and gender theory begins to make in roads into medical school. In our Daily Cancellation, I will respond to the outraged masses that have been trying to cancel me over the past two days. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 763 - Quitting Is Not Courageous</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media is falling all over itself to celebrate Simone Biles for quitting. She is the most inspiring and courageous quitter the world has ever seen, they tell us. But I’m not so sure that I agree with this redefinition of courage. And our Five Headlines including the pathetic, desperate, and grotesque display put on by the Democrats during the January 6th hearing yesterday. Also, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who was not in the Capitol that day, now says that she was afraid that she would be raped. The CDC has reinstated the mask mandate, but the question is whether anyone gives a damn about the CDC’s mandates at this point. And in our Daily Cancellation, after a day filled with men crying on camera, we will discuss whether these sorts of displays should be welcomed in our society.

      <title>Ep. 762 - The Empty People</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are witnessing an infinite expansion of gender and sexuality identities, though all of the new identities seem to be repetitions of each other. Why is this happening? Where is it coming from? I have a theory. Also Five Headlines. Democrats begin their latest “investigation” into the events of January 6th. California introduces vaccine mandates. John Oliver pushes reparations. And new polls show that most Americans don’t think men should compete against women in women’s sports. And yet that’s exactly what’s happening. Why?

      <title>Ep. 761 - Why You Shouldn't Care About Being Called A Bigot </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a racial equity activist group is calling on white liberal families to pledge that they won’t send their kids to Ivy League schools. And in fact, given that white liberals agree that white privilege and systemic racism exists, the group actually has a point. Also we have our Five Headlines, including Tucker Carlson getting accosted by a deranged leftist while out with his family, the Olympics begins and nobody notices, and AOC offers a defense of Critical Race Theory that contradicts the usual defense of Critical Race Theory. And in our Daily Cancellation, I must cancel the Free Britney movement.

      <title>Ep. 760 - Feminists Experience Equality. They Don't Like It.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we have moved one step close to signing women up for the draft. Yet the people who have clamored for gender equality aren’t celebrating the news. I wonder why? Also we have our Five Headlines, including Nancy Pelosi once again declaring herself a “devout catholic” in spite of her rabid defense of child murder. And the mayor of DC outlaws flavored tobacco, but will still be ready to throw any cop who tries to enforce the law under the bus. Hunter Biden gets ready to sell some of his art for hundreds of thousands of dollars. We’ll take a look at his masterpieces today. And the team formerly known as the Cleveland Indians has chosen a new name. But will people find a way to be offended by it? We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 759 - No I Will Not Put A Mask On My Child</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, President Biden had a town hall event yesterday. Mostly he babbled incoherently, but the coherent parts were the most disturbing. Among other things, he called for kids over the age of 12 to wear masks. We’ll talk about why pushing masks on kids, especially at this point, is irrational, anti-science, and abusive. Also our Five Headlines, including a new poll which shows that race relations are at their lowest point in decades. I wonder who we can blame for that? And JK Rowling continues to stand firm in the face of insane hatred from trans activists. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will address the very intense backlash from my review of a BTS song.

      <title>Ep. 758 - An Epidemic Of Virtue Signaling</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, performative wokeness has reached epidemic levels in this country, and it was on full display yesterday. I’ll explain. Also we have our Five Headlines, including some updates on that weird story of the supposed right wing plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan. It appears that this was more of an FBI plot, which the FBI then foiled. And Prince Harry is once again showing how much he desires privacy by writing an explosive memoir about the Royal Family, while AOC shows how much she hates capitalism by investing heavily in her online merchandise story. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the ladies of the US women’s soccer team who showed how much they hate their own country by kneeling before their match last night. And then they lost badly.

      <title>Ep. 757 - Yes Of Course We Should Legislate Morality</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, many people claim that we should not be “legislating morality” or “forcing our morality.” I disagree. I think that’s exactly what we should do, and I’ll explain why. And our Five Headlines. Jeff Bezos launches himself to space. The American Academy of Pediatrics calls for children to wear masks as the new school year start. New and damning revelations about that state representative in Minnesota who claims he was racially profiled during a traffic stop. NPR puts out a hit piece on the Daily Wire. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss a viral video which shows that some Americans literally don’t know what century they’re currently living in. All of that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a hardcore porn star gets booted from an event for conservative teens, and many conservatives have a problem with this, for a variety of ludicrous reasons.

CNN gets called out live on the air by a CNN guest. And Kamala Harris says it is your biblical duty to get vaccinated.

      <title>Ep. 755 - Stop Assaulting Me With Your Violent Opinions</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the American Booksellers Association apologizes for a “violent incident” where they promoted a book that leftists don’t like. We’ll talk about this story, and more broadly about the idea that words, books, and opinions can be “violent.” Also Five Headlines including the Surgeon General’s pledge to start putting warning labels on speech it doesn’t like, the White House says it is working with Facebook to tamp down “misinformation,” Pope Francis continues his war against conservative Catholics, leaked audio proves that Sharon Osbourne was set up and framed as a racist before being kicked off her talk show, and in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the new efforts to combat the negative stereotypes of sharks.

      <title>Ep. 754 - When The Left Eats Itself</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left continues to eat itself, as a gay rights organization that had been around for 50 years voluntarily dissolves and disbands after BLM criticized it. This is a convoluted but also instructive not to mention hilarious story, and we’ll talk about it today. Also Five Headlines including Olivia Rodrigo’s trip to the white house to promote vaccines, raising the question: who is Olivia Rodrigo? Speaking of BLM, they have finally spoken out about the situation in Cuba, in order to defend the Cuban government. And a state representative in Minnesota says he was racially profiled during a traffic stop. But the body cam footage shows something else. And in our Daily Cancellation we will wade into the murky, confused, and toxic waters of abortion Tik Tok.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the war on American history continues, and now it has moved way beyond simply removing statues of Confederate generals. We’ll discuss the latest on that front today. Also Five Headlines including Democrats in Texas absconding from the state in order to prevent the passage of bills they oppose. These are the same people who complain about “obstructionism.” And will the Biden Administration be fact checking your text messages? A new report makes that claim. In our Daily Cancellation we talk about an article in a scientific journal claiming that geology is racist. The reason they give for this claim is so unbelievably insane and stupid that it may actually shock you.

      <title>Ep. 751 - The Truth About Caitlyn Jenner</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Caitlyn Jenner attended CPAC over the weekend, reigniting the debate about whether this person, in any sense, represents conservatism. I give an emphatic no to that question. Also our Five Headlines, including Cubans waving American flags as they protest Communism, Ben Carson upsets a lot of people with an (entirely correct) statement about the black family, and the San Francisco Gay Men’s Chorus, after releasing a song warning that they are “coming for our children,” have now decided that they are the victims because of the backlash they received. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss Kamala Harris’s claim that rural Americans don’t have access to photocopiers.

In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss Kamala Harris’s claim that rural Americans don’t have access to photocopiers.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Ep. 750 - Won't Someone Please Think Of The Ivy League Grad Students?</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as the student debt crisis continues to spiral out of control, the Wall Street Journal publishes an article asking us to feel sympathy for Ivy League grad students who are drowning in six figure debt after discovering that their masters degrees aren’t leading to lucrative jobs. For some reason, I struggle to feel any sympathy for these people. Also Five Headlines including former media darling Michael Avenatti gets his prison sentence, Rand Paul looks to revoke the federal mask mandate on airplanes, and we’ll discuss the latest alleged racism controversy over at ESPN. In our Daily Cancellation, we will cancel Scarlett Johansson for complaining in a recent interview that she is “under appreciated” and “underpaid.”

      <title>Ep. 749 - They're Coming For Your Children</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden unveils his brilliant new plan for education. He wants to add four additional years of public school. Your children should be in the state’s clutches for 16 years, he says. We’ll talk about all of the reasons why that is a terrible idea today. Also Five Headlines including talk of sending US troops into Haiti, a teachers union comes out and says we need more critical race theory in education while another union says that there is no critical race theory in education at all, and yet another woman at a spa in Los Angeles is sexually harassed by a naked trans person. Plus, our Daily Cancellation, where we will talk about a recent Washington Post article which informs us that the word “exotic” is now racist.

      <title>Ep. 748 - It's Time To Put Cameras In Every Classroom</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, many parents are finally calling for greater transparency in the classroom, and more control over what sorts of things their children are taught. If that is the goal, and it should be, then why aren’t there cameras in every classroom in the country, documenting everything that teachers do and say to their students? Also, Five Headlines. The media marks the 6 month anniversary of January 6th. As we get further and further away from that event, their retelling of it gets more and more dramatic. Andrew Cuomo declares gun violence a “public health emergency.” Joe Biden wants to go door to door to get people vaccinated. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the orgy of ungrateful whining and complaining that accompanied July 4th this year.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, proponents of Critical Race Theory are now claiming that all they want to do is teach kids about the facts of American history, facts like slavery. I think we should teach about slavery too, but we should be telling the whole truth. Today we’ll talk about the whole truth of slavery. Also Five Headlines. The NSA denies Tucker Carlson’s claim that he’s being spied on. Or did they really deny it? A man is crowned Miss Nevada USA. And a woman whose husband is active duty Navy alerts me to a mandatory “diversity hike” in honor of Pride Month that her husband was forced to participate in. And in our Daily Cancellation, a new organization of Gen Z Republicans has a plan for connecting with today’s youth, and it’s terrible.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a woman encounters a naked man in the women’s locker room and then does what so many others these days refuse to do: She objects, loudly and publicly. She had the courage to be sane and normal, which is something that many in our culture lack. Also Five Headlines. Tucker Carlson reveals that the NSA is spying on him, a majority of the “conservative” justices on the Supreme Court refuse to take up a case dealing with the trans bathroom issue, a Daily Beast reporter reveals his utter horror at the sight of families eating meals together at restaurants, and in our Daily Cancellation we’ll discuss the brave white British man who has come out as a non-binary Korean, though many on the Left have refused to accept his trans-racial identity.

In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the NPR article blasting Tom Hanks for making too many movies about white people doing good things. That’s very problematic, as we’ll see. All of that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 740 - White Supremacists Are Using Climate Change To Kill Us</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden declares that global warming is the greatest threat we face. But didn’t he just say white supremacy is the greatest threat? Democrats keep cycling through different bogeymen and fear tactics. We’ll discuss. Also Five Headlines including the rehabilitation of Jeffrey Toobin, featuring perhaps the most cringe-inducing video of all time. And a young girl speaks up against gender theory in school. We have that video. Plus iHeartMedia puts out a job listing and declares that it wants diverse applicants only (read: not white). Isn't that illegal? Finally in our daily cancellation we have the harrowing tale of Korean Canadian sitcom stars who spent five seasons on a show and now that it’s over they say they were being victimized by racism the whole time.

      <title>Ep. 739 - The Left Searches For A 'Cure' For Whiteness</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we will discuss the problem of whiteness. I don’t think whiteness is a problem, but we are told that it is. In fact, as a recent paper in a psychoanalytic journal argues, it is really a disease which must be “cured.” Also five headlines including the cop who flipped a pregnant woman’s car on the highway because she didn’t pull over fast enough during a traffic stop. Is that proper procedure? And Dr. Fauci claims that he himself is science made flesh, to question him is to question science. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the New York Times article that generated controversy because it supposedly suggested that you shouldn’t have a lot of obese and depressed friends. But I think it makes a good point, I’ll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 738 - Burger King And Nickelodeon Compete For Gold In The Woke Olympics</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Burger King and Nickelodeon have come out especially aggressively this month to push radical far left LGBT propaganda. Both of these companies would be bankrupted if conservatives responded by refusing to ever patronize them again. But that won’t happen. Why? Also Five Headlines including the CEO of Pfizer says that children don’t really need the vaccine, but they’re going to be testing it on kids anyway for the sake of protecting adults. Isn’t that totally backwards? And Chris Harrison of the Bachelor has officially lost his job after groveling and apologizing to the mob despite having done nothing wrong. The same old story again. And in our Daily Cancellation, National Geographic has a message for whitey: be ashamed. Be very ashamed.

      <title>Ep. 737 - Groveling To The Mob Won’t Stop It From Consuming You</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a Hollywood actress delivers a groveling apology to the mob, despite having done absolutely nothing wrong. Meanwhile, a prominent psychiatrist who publicly fantasized about murdering white people doubled down and refused to apologize. What can we learn from this contrast? Also Five Headlines including an MSNBC analyst saying that she saw some American flags over the weekend and was “disturbed.” Also, the Biden Administration officially adopts the “birth people” label to describe women. And Trump says he’s considering Ron DeSantis as a VP in 2024. I think that’s a terrible idea and I’ll explain. Plus in our Daily Cancellation, the actress Monique gets into some hot water for criticizing people for dressing like slobs in public. But she’s right, of course. There’s a slob epidemic in America.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a very special announcement coming up in just a second, and also, Democrats have already defunded police departments across the country amid a surge in violent crime. Now they’ve unveiled their brilliant next step: stop building jails. That will surely solve the crime problem. And Five Headlines including women inmates and former inmates speaking out about men being put in cells with them. Plus, Katie Hill sues various media outlets over the nude photos of her that they published, and loses. Now she has to pay 100 thousand dollars. And more information comes out about the UFOs that infest our skies. Are they really technology from foreign adversaries? And if they are, should we be concerned that our own military is more focused on diversity and inclusion than on defending our nation? All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 734 - AOC Neglects Her Poor Family Members, Blames Trump</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, AOC posts pictures of the crumbling shack where her grandmother lives in Puerto Rico. She blames Trump for her grandmother’s living conditions. But why isn’t she reaching into her own pocket to help? Also Five Headlines including the Fauci emails revealing, well, basically what we already knew. That we have been lied to, repeatedly. In our Daily Cancellation, a high school valedictorian went off script during her graduation speech to slam the state of Texas for restricting abortion. There is actually quite a lot to be learned from her remarks on the subject, though not the things she wants us to learn from them.

But why isn’t she reaching into her own pocket to help? Also Five Headlines including the Fauci emails revealing, well, basically what we already knew. That we have been lied to, repeatedly. In our Daily Cancellation, a high school valedictorian went off script during her graduation speech to slam the state of Texas for restricting abortion. There is actually quite a lot to be learned from her remarks on the subject, though not the things she wants us to learn from them.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Ep. 733 - The 'White Supremacy' Bogeyman </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden makes the grotesquely absurd claim that white supremacy is the most lethal threat we face as a country. We will analyze that claim and see if we can’t identify at least a few other threats that are perhaps a bit more urgent. Also Five Headlines including the woke mob randomly deciding that a certain actress is a racist Klan member. It’s not true, but then again this actress supported BLM prior to this, so I’m not sure I have much sympathy for her. And for a little change of pace, a Republican congresswoman says that someone came and sprayed offensive graffiti on her property. The Left is skeptical of the claim, for once. I wonder why. Plus, in our Daily Cancellation, we will cancel Kamala Harris. Again. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 732 - Pushing Pansexualism On Preschoolers</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as we head into so-called “pride month,” the LGBT propaganda is going into overdrive. The children’s show Blue’s Clues kicks things off with an episode featuring a drag queen, a pride parade, and pansexuals. Also Five Headlines including more sexual indoctrination of children, this time a graphic video about masturbation which was shown to six year olds at a school in New York City. And an NBA all star says that he is the victim of the “underlying racism” of NBA fans. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the obese woman who says you are morally obligated to find her attractive.

      <title>Ep. 731 - Don’t Reform The Public School System. Destroy It.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, in a disturbing Zoom video, a public school teacher tells other teachers that it is their moral duty to brainwash kids into critical race theory. In fact, if they do not brainwash kids, then they are no better than sexual abusers. This kind of madness is all over the school system, which raises the question I’ve asked many times: when are we going to abandon the system entirely? If not now, when? Also Five Headlines including the defund the police proponent who ended up having to call the police after some kids stole his car. And Caitlyn Jenner, in a shocking turn of events, flip flops and comes out in favor of males in female sports. Plus, a woman writes to Slate asking what to do about her husband who won’t take his mask off at all, ever, even while being intimate. In our Daily Cancellation, I will defend myself against the gay news publication that is currently trying to cancel and deplatform me.

      <title>Ep. 730 - The Truth Is Hurtful</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, USA Today commits the most egregious form of Orwellian speech manipulation that we’ve seen. You have to hear this to believe it. That’s coming up. Also Five Headlines including a new study which seems to show that mask mandates did absolutely nothing to slow the spread of COVID. Who would have thought? And a white journalist is put on the spot in an interview when he’s asked what he likes about being white. It’s an interesting exchange, we’ll play that today. Also, a new proposal from Maxine Waters to give down payment assistance to Americans to help them buy homes. But, of course, not all Americans will get help. Especially not white Americans.

      <title>Daily Wire Backstage: The Mask Is Off</title>
      <description>Can Biden’s daily regimen of Gatorade, PB&amp;J’s, and Flintstone Vitamins really keep him in the tip top cognitive shape we’ve come to expect? Is there a certain number of rockets fired by Hamas at Israeli civilians that would convince the Left they’re on the “wrong side of history?” Because clearly, 3500 isn’t it. And when the UFOs playing peek-a-boo with our military do finally land, will John Cena apologize to our alien overlords for Hollywood’s shame that is The Last Jedi, Battlefield Earth, and Howard The Duck? Let’s hope he does the right thing.

      <title>Ep. 729 - Only Democrats Are Allowed To Make Hitler Analogies, According To Democrats </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left has gone into spasms of outrage because Marjorie Taylor Greene made a Holocaust analogy. These are the same people who make Holocaust analogies every time they open their mouths. But somehow we’re supposed to take their outrage seriously this time. Well, I don’t. Also Five Headlines including breaking news that the COVID vaccine is 100 percent effective preventing COVID in kids. Do you know what else is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing COVID in kids? Their immune system. Also, Minneapolis commemorates the anniversary of George Floyd’s death with a drive by shooting at his memorial site. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the viral video which seeks to prove that it’s impossible for a black person to be racist against a white person.

      <title>Ep. 728 - The Fragile Weaklings Who Lead Us </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, AOC is still talking about the supposed trauma she experienced on January 6th, even though she was never in any danger, and never personally encountered any rioters. We’ll discuss. Also Five Headlines including the media finally coming around to the idea that COVID came from a Chinese lab, after a year of insisting that this was all a conspiracy theory. Also, the White House finally acknowledges the surge in violent crime in our cities, but pins the whole issue on lax gun control. And students at a school in New York were given a class on pornography, without parental consent. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the push to normalize facial hair on women.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, millions of children are being experimented on, abused, and mutilated, all in the name of gender ideology. The problem has reached epidemic proportions. So much so that even some mainstream media outlets have started to notice. We’ll talk about the problem today. Also Five Headlines including the mayor of Chicago announcing that she will only accept interviews from non-white reporters. One elected politician in Washington had the courage to condemn her for this bigotry, and it wasn’t a Republican. Also, is Prince Harry a victim of emotional abuse? In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll consider the mother on Tik Tok who is worried that her white male baby will grow up to be awful, and has developed a plan to prevent that from happening.

      <title>Ep. 726 - Drag Queen Indoctrination Hour</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, PBS has teamed up with the New York City Department of Education to bring drag queens and children together. We will discuss the never-ending efforts to groom and sexualize children today. And Five Headlines including: a Democrat congressman righteously screaming at Republicans for not living in reality. But what the hell do Democrats know about reality? And Joe Rogan gets in trouble for daring to suggest that there might be some anti-white sentiment out there. And in our Daily Cancellation I will respond to the popular YouTuber who tried to DEMOLISH me for my views on masking.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, another pop star comes out as non-binary and demands that we use they/them pronouns. Lots of people, even conservatives, seem perfectly willing to go along with the preferred pronoun thing these days. But I’ll explain why we shouldn’t, and why the issue matters. Also Five Headlines including: BLM finds its newest martyr, a 10 year old boy speaks out eloquently against the masking insanity, and airlines will start weighing passengers before boarding. In our Daily Cancellation, I have the distinct honor and privilege of canceling Chris Cuomo.

      <title>Ep. 724 - There's A Bug In The House. Grab The Salt And Pepper. </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left screams in horror as a case challenging Roe heads to the Supreme Court. They say that women’s rights are under attack. But how can they even talk about women’s rights, given that, according to them, women don’t really exist? Also, is Roe likely to be overturned? And what happens if it is? We’ll tackle all of that today. Plus, Five Headlines including Fauci finally admitting that he’s been masking for symbolic reasons. And the ties between Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein come into focus, after months of the media canonizing Gates and insisting that we trust and listen to him. In our Daily Cancellation, we will talk about the recent push to convince us to eat bugs. Should we start eating crickets and cockroaches instead of bacon and hamburgers?

      <title>Ep. 722 - Stop Waiting For Permission To Live Your Life </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the CDC has given us permission to breathe fresh air again. Some of us, anyway. Many people have been waiting for this permission and are grateful that the CDC will allow them to show their faces in public again. It’s a rather pitiful and embarrassing picture, altogether, and we’ll talk about it today. Also Five Headlines including the hackers who caused a gas shortage across the US win a big ransom for their troubles. AOC calls in extra security because another member of Congress yelled at her. And Disney goes for Gold in the woke Olympics with its new cartoon show features interracial gay dads. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the American Idol contestant who was forced off the show for something he posted when he was 12 years old.

      <title>Ep. 721 - Don't Worry. Our Army Of Feminists And Gay Activists Will Protect Us.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Army has launched its own woke leftist ad campaign, as both the intelligence community and the military continue to prioritize left wing ideology over less important concerns, like defending the country from its enemies. Also Five Headlines including a change to the Dictionary that has now turned myself and millions of others into “anti-vaxxers.” Plus college students are suspended for not wearing a mask — off campus. And outrage over a video of a brutal full-contact drill among little kids at a football practice. Is the outrage overblown, or do the critics have a point? And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the former MSNBC host who has decided that it should be legal to kill any white man who uses a racial slur. That perspective is more popular than you’d like to think.

      <title>Ep. 720 - Why Feminists Are Miserable</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a New York Times writer provoked outrage among feminists when she published a piece saying that she’s happy about being a mother. Those kinds of shocking and outrageous statements simply cannot be tolerated, apparently. We’ll discuss. Also, Five Headlines, including Rand Paul and Dr. Fauci clashing once again. The CDC director warns about the unspecified dangers of summer camp for children. And another famous celebrity comes out against cancel culture. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the media and Hollywood’s brave stand against the racism of the Golden Globes.

      <title>Ep. 719 - Spoiled, Ungrateful Brats  </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Tim Tebow is getting another crack at the NFL but Colin Kaepernick isn’t. The media says this is evidence of racism. I say it’s evidence of something else. Also five headlines including, hackers shut down a major US pipeline and the GOP says that we need to get mothers back to work — is that the right messaging? Also, is a horse the latest victim of cancel culture? And speaking of canceling, in our daily cancellation we’ll deal with the morbidly obese “model” who now says she has anorexia. They just don’t make anorexics like they used to.

      <title>Ep. 718 - Dreaming Of A World Where Michelle Obama And Oprah Winfrey Are No Longer Oppressed  </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Michelle Obama is once again complaining about the persecution she has suffered as a black woman in America. She’s not alone. LeBron James, Oprah Winfrey, Meghan Markle and other black millionaires and billionaires have all frequently complained about our racist system of white privilege. Today we will reflect on their stories. Also Five Headlines including Dr. Fauci finally giving a definitive date for when we can return to normal. It’s a year away. And the CIA doubles down, releasing yet another woke ad. Plus, Sarah Silverman comes after Caitlyn Jenner, proving a few points that I will explain today. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will consider the story of the rapper who was shot and killed by a 15 year old boy for his Rolex watch. What should we say about a man who promotes street violence and then dies by it? Well, we can say a lot, and I will today, and it will make people very mad.

      <title>Ep. 717 - When A Man Loves A Birthing Person</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a teacher in Washington read a trans indoctrination book to her first grade students. The school board didn’t take any action against her, probably because the board is run by a woman who owns an all ages sex toy shop. This is the state of the modern school system. Also, we’ll discuss the “birth person” controversy, just in time for Birthing Person Day. And in our Five Headlines, Caitlyn Jenner continues to be a train wreck, the jobs report proves that it’s probably not a good idea to pay people to not work, and AOC credits Planned Parenthood with saving babies. Finally our Daily Cancellation deals with the case of a high school girl who faces over a decade in prison for trying to rig her homecoming election.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Biden Administration is explicitly discriminating against white people and men as it doles out COVID relief. This is what systemic racism actually looks like. Also Five Headlines including Trump’s Facebook ban is upheld, Southwest kicks a three year old off a flight because although he was wearing a mask they were afraid he might take it off at some point in the future, and South Carolina brings back the good old fashioned firing squad.

      <title>Ep. 715 - The Chauvin Trial Was A Sham. Throw Out The Verdict.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the trial of Derek Chauvin was the greatest sham in the history of the modern American legal system. We are now learning just how much of a sham it truly was. Today we’ll talk about the juror who apparently lied his way onto the jury in order to, as he says, bring about social change. Also, Five Headlines including Jill Biden’s push for universal free community college and the bizarre story of the child who was paddled with a wooden board by her teacher while her mother watched. But now the mother is complaining to the media. And in a Daily Cancellation that is sure to make a lot of people very angry, I will explain why anxiety isn’t a real mental disorder.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a woman called internal affairs to complain that an LA County Sheriff’s Deputy “harassed” her during a traffic stop. But body cam footage shows a completely different story. Also Five Headlines including outrage at Rick Santorum for claiming that Europeans built our civilization. But isn’t that simply an indisputable historical fact? And Caitlyn Jenner comes out against men playing in women’s sports, but does that mean we can trust him as conservatives? Plus, the Gates' are getting divorced. And in our Daily Cancellation, the Disney classic “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” is finally being called out for its promotion of rape culture. It’s about time.

      <title>Ep. 713 - Eradicating The Cancer Of Critical Race Theory</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, there is finally a real and concerted effort to push back against Critical Race Theory in schools. But the effort should go beyond merely pushing back. I’ll explain why. Also Five Headlines including a new report claiming that America will never achieve herd immunity and the coronavirus will be with us forever. Also, a viral video shows a mother trying to plant the idea into her daughter’s head that she’s really a boy. And a male Democrat congressman tells a Republican woman to “shut her mouth” and is of course applauded by the left. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal once and for all with the question: Are aliens preparing to invade? And another question: Why doesn’t anyone seem to care?

      <title>Ep. 712 - It's Time To Get Over Your White Guilt </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we often hear, especially from the Left, that slavery is America’s “original sin.” It is the reason why we are supposed to be overcome with guilt as Americans. But today I want talk about this idea of slavery as original sin and explain why it’s totally wrong. Also our Five Headlines, including Biden’s move to ban menthol cigarettes. The Democrats want to defund the police, while also passing more petty laws for the police to enforce. Speaking of the police, a teacher in a zoom call berates a student for saying that police are heroes. We’ll play that for you. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the truly insane and almost unbelievable story of the Jeopardy contestant who issues a public apology after being accused of racism for holding up three fingers.

      <title>Ep. 711 - Daddy Government Wants Your Child </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, President Biden delivered a long, rambling, and at times barely intelligible speech to congress last night, but if you could stay awake and decipher it, there was plenty to be concerned about. Especially the part where Biden unveils his plan for “universal preschool.” I’ll explain why that is a horrible, dystopian idea. Also Five Headlines including the parents who are volunteering their babies for COVID vaccine trials. What sort of parent would do that? And a track runner in Oregon collapses on the track after being forced to run with a mask. Plus, is the No Fly List being politically weaponized by the Biden Administration? Finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the outrage over comments Steve Harvey made claiming that men and women cannot be platonic friends. Is he wrong, or exactly 100 percent correct?

      <description>Will Biden be able to make it to the end of this speech without taking a nap? If he manages to make it all the way through without a single "C'mon, man,” how can we be sure it wasn’t faked like the moon landing? How many times could Kamala have visited the border between the start and finish of this crapshow?

      <title>Ep. 710 - Our Benevolent Masters Will Now Allow You To Sit On Your Porch</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, our lords and masters in the CDC and the White House have given us new COVID guidelines. In their benevolence, they are now allowing us to walk outside and even have picnics without masks, if we’re vaccinated. Also Five Headlines, including outrage over a bill in Idaho that bans abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, and outrage over a video of Wayne LaPierre killing an elephant. There seems to be an interesting contrast between these two stories. Plus, Justin Bieber is accused of cultural appropriation for wearing dreadlocks. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the claims that there is systemic racism against black NFL players.

      <title>Ep. 709 - A Nation Of Paranoid Lunatics Afraid Of Fresh Air</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the state of Michigan has expanded its mask mandates to include children who are two, three, and four years old. We have become a society of adults who fear breathing fresh air, and we are raising our kids to share in that phobia. Also Five headlines including a totally predictable crisis as police departments across the country struggle to find new recruits. I wonder why? And Lindsey Graham gets in trouble for saying that Obama’s election proves systemic racism isn’t real. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the man who was doxxed and then fired from his job for allegedly harassing a dude in a prom dress. But, as always with these things, there’s a whole lot more to the story.

      <title>Ep. 708 - Electing A Trans Governor To Own The Libs</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, many Republicans rejoice as Caitlyn Jenner runs for governor. They are very excited about the prospect of a Republican transgender governor. But can the Right defeat the Left by fully embracing and accepting its fundamental claims about gender? Consider me skeptical. Also Five Headlines including the family of Ma’Khia Bryant calling for police reform, a Democrat Representative admits to emotionally abusing her daughter, the Oscars announce the winners but nobody’s ever heard of any of them, and a new study reveals that the 6-foot social distancing guideline is totally arbitrary and baseless.

      <title>Ep. 707 - Robbed At Gunpoint By Your Guardian Angel </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Democrat politicians and hundreds of others gathered yesterday to mourn Daunte Wright, the violent criminal shot by police last week. During the service, he was literally elevated to the status of a guardian angel. We’ll talk about the whole grotesque display today. Also Five Headlines including a new angle on the Ma'Khia Bryant shooting that absolutely confirms that it was a justified shooting — something that we knew already from the body cam. And a mother speaks out about masking policies at a school board meeting. It was a real truth to power moment. We’ll play that. Also, environmental activists pollute in the name of saving the planet and AOC says that racism is causing climate change.

      <title>Ep. 706 - BLM Is Outraged That A Cop Saved A Black Woman From Getting Stabbed To Death</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left and BLM continue to be outraged over a cop who saved a black woman from being stabbed to death. They say the cops had no right to shoot someone just because they were trying to stab another person. This is yet another example of the Left’s total rejection of personal responsibility. Today I want to talk a little about personal responsibility as it relates to these police shootings. Also Five Headlines including the White House releasing one of the most repugnant and irresponsible public statements we’ve ever heard from any White House, while LeBron James doxes the cop in the Ma’Khia Bryant shooting. And a female athlete sues after being benched and forced off her soccer team for refusing to take a knee in solidarity with BLM.

      <title>Ep. 705 - Justice Is Dead </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as the jury in the Chauvin trial gives the violent mob what it demanded, another police shooting has led to more protests and claims of systemic racism in policing. The problem is that the “victim” in this case was shot while trying to stab someone. We’ll have more on that case and the Chauvin trial today. Also, speaking of the Chauvin case, Nancy Pelosi officially canonizes George Floyd as our culture’s new Christ figure. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with complaints that a children’s cartoon about dogs fails to portray racial diversity. How can you have racial diversity among cartoon dogs?

      <title>Ep. 704 - A False Narrative Falls Apart</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, officials in DC are finally, after four months, telling us the truth about the alleged “deadly riot” at the Capitol on January 6. And the truth is the opposite of what we have been told this whole time. Also Five Headlines including mainstream media journalists and legal analysts prove that they don’t understand how our court systems work in this country. The judge in the Chauvin case admonishes Maxine Waters. Planned Parenthood faces up to its racist past, sort of. And “incest advocates” make their case for marriage equality. Why shouldn’t we tolerate and accept their alternative lifestyle?

      <title>Ep. 703 - White Guilt Is Mandatory </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, outrage over a plan by some congressional Republicans to form a caucus dedicated to preserving our Anglo-Saxon political traditions. This is offensive because, as the new rules clearly states, anything even loosely associated with whiteness is bad. We’ll talk about, and break, that rule today. Also Five Headlines including a high profile elected Democrat committing jury tampering and incitement. Shockingly, the people who were so worried about “incitement” a few months ago have nothing to say about this. And the mother of a “trans boy” goes viral. But the video proves the opposite of the point it’s supposed to prove. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the millions of Americans who apparently will cling onto their masks, even after they are vaccinated, because for them it has become nothing more than a security blanket.

      <title>Ep. 702 - The Problem Is Bad Parenting, Not Bad Policing</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, yet another police shooting sparks outrage and protests. This time a 13-year-old boy is killed. As always, everyone is blaming the police. But I think we should move the conversation from policing to parenting. That is the real source of the trouble, and the thing that nobody seems to want to talk about. Also Five Headlines including the Democrats begin their push for reparations while a bunch of white celebrities come out in support of the idea. And the media baselessly smears Ron DeSantis in the most vile way imaginable. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the scientists who have now begun creating half-monkey, half-human hybrid embryos. What could possibly go wrong? Or better yet, what could possibly go right? All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.

      <title>Ep. 701 - The Truth About Ashli Babbitt And Our Two Tiered Justice System </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the DOJ has announced that the officer who shot Ashli Babbit will not be charged with a crime. In fact they won’t even tell us his name, or give us any other information. Today we are going to look closely at this case and try to figure out what happened, and why the woman died, and whether it was justified or not. Also Five Headlines including the Biden Administration has its feet held to the fire during the White House Press briefing over its abortion policies. That doesn’t happen every day. And CNN brings a trans athlete on the air to explain why men actually don’t have an advantage over women in sports. Plus, Biden’s UN Ambassador hates America. Perhaps a bit of a conflict of interest there.

      <title>Ep. 700 - BLM Canonizes Yet Another Violent Abuser Of Women</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as rioters continue to destroy Minneapolis over the death of Daunte Wright, the full truth about Wright’s death, and his life, is finally coming out. Wright was wanted by police after robbing a woman at gunpoint and choking her. Does that detail matter? I say it does, and I’ll explain why. Plus our Five Headlines, including the mayor of Brooklyn Center suggesting that cops who do traffic stops shouldn’t have guns. What could go wrong? And the AP declares that the term “mistress” is no longer acceptable because it stigmatizes floozies. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about something called “Neo-pronouns.” If you thought the Left couldn’t make a bigger mess of pronouns, you were mistaken.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the body cam footage of Daunte Wright’s death has been released. Today we are going to have the uncomfortable conversation about that footage, and about Wright’s death, that the media refuses to have. Also Five Headlines including some bizarre and chilling footage from the press conference with the Brooklyn Center Police chief. The media, on camera, tries to convince him that the rioting he just experienced was not actually rioting. Also, the White House unveils its strategy to convince white conservatives to get vaccinated. It’s as cartoonish and insulting as you’d expect. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll cancel the actor who formerly voiced the character Apu on the Simpsons, and who now says that he wants to apologize to each Indian person individually for that character. You know that’s getting him canceled.

      <title>Ep. 698 - 500 White People Killed By Cops. Zero Protests.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, rioting ravages another American city after a black man was killed by police. Yet hundreds of white people have been killed by cops over the past year, and there has not been one protest or riot over any of those deaths. What does that tell us? Also Five Headlines including the media already beginning to preemptively slander the jurors in the Derek Chauvin case.

      <title>Ep. 697 - The “Influencers” Who Prey On Your Children</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, one of the most famous and influential YouTube stars on the planet is, allegedly, a sex predator who preys on young boys. This is not a huge surprise but it does raise a question: Do you know what your kids are doing online, and who they are being influenced by? Also Five Headlines including Joe Biden’s gun control push, another SHOCKING twist in an alleged hate crime case, and a Republican legislator sparks controversy by comparing abortion to slavery. But is he right? Yes, he is. I’ll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 696 - They Want Vengeance, Not Justice</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media and BLM activists want you to forget that “reasonable doubt” is the standard in the Derek Chauvin trial, and in every other trial. All that matters is whether there is reasonable doubt about Chauvin’s role in Floyd’s death. If there is, he should walk. Is there? We’ll talk about that today. Also Five Headlines including the police chief in DC justifying his decision to be lenient on the two girls who murdered Mohammad Anwar. How would his reasoning apply to the Chauvin case? And scientists look to extend human life by harvesting blood from the young. Plus, white liberals are asked about their stance on voter ID and their responses are incredibly, though expectedly, racist. Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, another member of the View is on the chopping block. I’ll explain why.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, United Airlines has decided to start hiring pilots based on diversity rather than merit. This is yet another conservative slippery slope argument come to life. Also Five Headlines including Joe Biden equivocating on whether companies should boycott Georgia over their voter ID law, Caitlyn Jenner considers a run for governor, and a former CIA director becomes the latest ex-government official to publicly entertain the idea that aliens may have already visited Earth. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about Tucker Carlson’s interview with the governor of Arkansas last night. He attempted to defend his position in favor of chemically castrating children and it did not go well.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the cowardly governor of Arkansas vetoes a bill that would have banned the chemical castration of children in the state. The Republican Party continues to prove itself utterly useless in the fight against the radical left. Also Five Headlines including the insanely lenient plea deal offered to the two girls who carjacked and murdered a man in DC. If this is privilege, it ain’t white male privilege. Also, another family was harassed on a plane because their young children weren’t masked. And Derek Chauvin’s defense gets the police chief to make a surprising admission on the stand.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, mega corporations are now condemning and boycotting the state of Georgia as punishment for a law that protects the integrity and safety of elections in the state. This is just the latest example of the wealthiest and most powerful institutions acting on the Left’s behalf, even as leftists pretend to be the counterculture resistance. Also Five Headlines including an attack on Capitol police officers that is already being memory-holed, for obvious reasons. Arkansas moves to ban the genital mutilation of children. And a pastor in Canada shows us how to deal with agents of the state who infringe on our rights. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, speaking of agents of the states infringing our rights, the CDC has given me yet another reason to cancel them.

      <title>Ep. 691 - Fairness Is Overrated  </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an NBC News anchor says on the air that he doesn’t care about being fair or hearing both sides. I actually agree with him, and feel much the same way. Also Five Headlines including CNN’s claims that there is no way to determine the sex of a baby at birth. And a school district took Thomas Jefferson’s name off of one of their schools, but they’re having trouble finding a new name. Apparently everyone in history, even very recent history, is problematic. Plus, Jill Biden butchers the Spanish language while standing in front of a very Nazi-esque flag. And in our Daily Cancellation, the woke mob finally comes for The Office.

      <title>Ep. 690 - Sacrificing A Goat For Racial Justice </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as the Derek Chauvin trial continues, we’ll try to sort through all of the issues related to George Floyd’s death. Was he actually murdered? Did it have anything to do with race? And, however he died, does he deserve to be memorialized and celebrated nationwide? Also Five Headlines including another vicious anti-Asian assault that’s being blamed on white supremacy, even though it wasn’t carried out by a white person. Plus, YouTube makes a move to protect the feelings of YouTube creators like myself, and AOC says you’re racist if you use the term “border surge.”

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as the Derek Chauvin trial continues, we’ll try to sort through all of the issues related to George Floyd’s death. Was he actually murdered? Did it have anything to do with race? And, however he died, does he deserve to be memorialized and celebrated nationwide? Also Five Headlines including another vicious anti-Asian assault that’s being blamed on white supremacy, even though it wasn’t carried out by a white person. Plus, YouTube makes a move to protect the feelings of YouTube creators like myself, and AOC says you’re racist if you use the term “border surge.”

      <title>Ep. 689 - Pop Culture Predators</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we’re going to discuss the sexually explicit, satanic new song from the rapper Lil Nas X. What makes it especially evil is that he spent the last two years carefully cultivating a following of very young children. Once again, the music industry preys on kids. Also Five Headlines including the trial of Derek Chauvin gets underway, Joe Biden says it’s our patriotic duty to wear masks, and the CDC director has an emotional breakdown on TV. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the teacher who is caught on video trying to racially brainwash a student. The video is disturbing but important.

      <title>Ep. 688 - How Our Culture Turns Kids Into Murderous Psychopaths</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, two teens girls in DC carjack and murder a man and it’s all caught on video. This is part of a far reaching culture trend, and it connects to the fatherless home epidemic and pop culture garbage produced by the likes of Lil Nas X and others. It’s time we look honestly at this problem. Plus, Five Headlines including Biden’s plan to require “vaccine passports,” and Dr. Fauci says that children should still wear masks when they play with each other. Also, a Tik Tok teacher speaks out against the racism of light colored Band-Aids. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will deal with what I consider to be the worst — yet most common — marriage advice.

      <title>Ep. 687 - What To Do When Your President Is Senile</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden continues to fall apart mentally and physically. This is the consequence of putting a senile man in the White House. Is it time to talk seriously about putting an upper age limit on the presidency? Why haven’t we talked seriously about that already? Also Five Headlines including a plan in Oakland to give 500 dollar monthly checks to poor families — except the white ones. Another example of systemic racism against whites. And Sesame Street gets racially woke, plus a new mask that you can wear while you eat. Unless you have self-respect and dignity, that is. In our Daily Cancellation, I will once again have to cancel the people who are trying to cancel me.

      <title>Ep. 686 - Telling The Forbidden Truth About Race And Violence</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are going to have an uncomfortable conversation about race. Though it should not be uncomfortable at all, because all I’m going to do is give you the facts about interracial violence and homicide. The media is telling you lies. Today we’ll look at the truth. Also Five Headlines including Utah’s move to protect children from pornography, the mayor of Charlottesville goes insane, and a soccer player is the latest spoiled rich woman to publicly announce that she’s oppressed. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with a few recent examples of alleged anti-Asian racism. But are they really examples of racism at all? My answer will not shock you.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as law enforcement officials say there is no evidence of a racially motivated hate crime in the Atlanta mass shooting last week, the Left becomes increasingly desperate to connect the event to racism. But as always, in their rush to make everything about race, they miss what really motivated this shooting. And so there is an extremely important conversation we don’t end up having, but will have today. Also Five Headlines including the Cancel dominos continue to fall as another Teen Vogue employee has her own racist tweets from the past resurface. And a viral Tik Tok video proves again that all cyclists are psychopaths. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, I have to address the man who stormed off an elevator yesterday when I committed the sin of getting on the elevator without a mask.

      <title>Ep. 681 - Everything Is White Supremacy</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, two black teens burned a white man to death and the media all but completely ignored the story. Meanwhile, an attack on massage parlors in Atlanta is being desperately linked to white supremacy despite a total lack of evidence for the connection. Plus, Five Headlines including the State Department battling the scourge of “entrenched whiteness,” Ron Desantis battling the much more serious scourge of Critical Race Theory, and a GoFundMe for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle somehow fails to gain traction. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with an article in the Scientific American which tries to debunk the case for banning males from female sports. Does it succeed?

      <title>Ep. 677 - Biden Performs Social Experiments On The Military </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, in the most egregious case of Big Tech Censorship yet, Amazon has declared that it will not sell any books which categorize transgenderism as a mental illness. Which is to say, they will not allow science on their website. Also Five Headlines including Joe Biden deciding what sort of July 4th celebration you’re allowed to have, a former conservative actress goes on an apology tour, and the stimulus bill is passed. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the renewed controversy over women in the military.

      <title>Ep. 676 - Playing The Long Game </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Right celebrates a new poll showing a majority approval for laws banning men from women’s sports. But I think the truth is not quite as rosy as it’s being made out to be. The Left is playing the long game, and they’re winning, as always. Also Five Headlines including an abortion ban in Arkansas, a new left wing “autonomous zone” in Minneapolis, and the soap company Dove has decided to stop using the word “normal” in its advertising, because it might offend someone. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with a feminist writer who’s worried that stay at home moms might be setting a bad example for their children.

      <title> Ep. 905 -  Buttigieg’s Husband Leads Kids In Pledge To Pride Flag</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as creepy sexuality camps for kids proliferate across the country, video surfaces of Pete Buttigieg’s husband leading children at a gay camp in a pledge of allegiance to the pride flag. Also, Democrats pass a 1.5 trillion dollar spending bill with lots of goodies for left wing causes and Ukraine. Plus, a black man kills a white man for saying a racial slur and is only sentenced to house arrest. In our Daily Cancellation, a married couples claims they’ve never argued in thirty years of marriage. Where’s the fun in that?

      <title>Ep. 675 - Plunging The Depths Of Cultural Insanity </title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Disney decides that Peter Pan is not appropriate for young children due to its “racism.” We seem to have developed some very strange ideas about what is and is not appropriate for kids in our culture. Also Five Headlines including Milo Yiannapolous coming out as ex-gay. The Left says he’s not allowed to do that. And a New York Times journalist says online harassment has “destroyed her life.” In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the famous musician who apologized and stepped down from his band after committing the sin of reading a book.

      <title>Ep. 674 - Super Straight Pride</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a new online trend has some people declaring themselves “superstraight.” The Left has condemned it as transphobic, but then again they condemn everything as transphobic. Also five headlines including BLM protesters fighting against racism by harassing little girls on their way to a cheerleading competition, Minneapolis braces for rioting as the Derek Chauvin trial begins, and lonely people have given rise to a new trend: cow cuddling. Plus in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss a pastor who got himself fired after he gave a sermon telling women that they have a responsibility to look attractive to their husbands. Did he have a point? I’ll see how many people I can tick off when we discuss that.

In our Daily Cancellation, we will discuss GOP House leader Kevin McCarthy making a stand against cancel culture by reading Green Eggs and Ham. Is this a meaningful symbolic gesture, or hollow right wing virtue signaling?

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media said there would be an insurrection in D.C. yesterday. It never happened. Now they’re saying the insurrection will actually be another day, and the military has to remain in the city until this new date. Are we starting to see a pattern? Also Five Headlines including eBay’s ban on the newly “offensive” Dr. Seuss books, the Washington Football Team decides to get rid of its cheerleaders, and BLM is revealed to be one big grift. What a shock. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about one Democratic representative’s plan to lower the voting age to 16.

      <title>Ep. 671 - How To Cure Our Racist Babies</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Arizona Department of Education is concerned that our babies might be racist. What can we do about racist babies? We’ll talk about that today. Also Five Headlines including the creepiest COVID PSA you’ve ever seen, Joe Biden lashing out at people who are fed up with masks and lockdowns, and Andrew Cuomo addresses the sexual harassment scandal, while mostly ignoring the real scandal. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the former host of the Bachelor, who continues to debase himself in increasingly embarrassing ways in the hopes of earning forgiveness from the cancel mob. That never works.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a school in New York encourages its white students to be “white traitors” and “white abolitionists.” We’ll talk about how this is only one of the ways in which our culture instills self-loathing, especially in children.

Also Bill Gates tells us plebes that we need to stop eating meat. For our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the story of the father who sent out a few bad tweets and had Child Protective Services show up at his house because of it.

      <title>Ep. 656 - The Cancel Mob Claims Another Scalp</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a conservative actress is fired by Disney after outrage over her “anti-Semitic” and supposedly offensive posts. But her posts were neither anti-Semitic nor offensive. We’ll talk about the real reason she got the axe. Also Five Headlines including the CDC’s new endorsement of double masking. And the Biden Administration announced plans to get schools back open. Half of the schools. One day a week. Is that enough? And in our Daily Cancellation, we will discuss the crucial differences between breastfeeding and “chestfeeding.”

Also Five Headlines including Joe Biden’s plan to raise the minimum wage, which the Congressional Budget Office says would wipe out thousands and thousands of jobs. And one of the greatest videos in the history of the internet goes viral yesterday. Plus our Daily Cancellation, where we will discuss the insane left wing conspiracy theory surrounding Cracker Barrel.

      <title>Ep. 652 - Dems Turn Congress Into Group Therapy</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Democrats, who sat back and cheered while millions of Americans were impacted by rioting all summer, spent last night on the House floor tearfully describing their own trauma from a riot in which none of them were harmed. It was kind of a group therapy session, and a cynical and disgusting display. Also Five Headlines including the White House declaring that even after you get the vaccine, you still need to wear a mask. So what is the point of the vaccine? And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the resurgent career of Nick Cannon, who got his job back after calling white people subhuman savages. What does this tell us about the nature of privilege in America?

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Washington Post has come up with a new innovation to account for all of the non-white people who are Trump supporters. They’re calling it “multi-racial whiteness.” Also Five Headlines including the media hurries to provide publicity and attention to the “right wing militias” who are supposedly gathering in state capitals across the country. The funny thing is that they don’t seem to be very right wing. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will cancel a public health expert who insists that it is healthy and wise to exercise outdoors with a mask on. Is there any truth to that? We’ll find out.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a week before the inauguration and Democrat mayors are rushing to reopen their cities and restart their economies. The timing, we’re supposed to believe, is entirely coincidental. Also Five Headlines including an interview with Jacob Blake that unwittingly destroys the narrative in his defense.

      <title>Backstage Premiere: RUN HIDE FIGHT </title>
      <description>Join Ben Shapiro, Jeremy Boreing, and the rest of the Backstage crew and special guests as Daily Wire makes its entrance into entertainment content with its first feature film, RUN HIDE FIGHT.

Starring Isabel May, Thomas Jane, Radha Mitchell, RUN HIDE FIGHT follows a high school sieged by a quartet of school shooters. Zoe Hull (Isabel May) is a high school student coping with the recent loss of her mother. All she wants is to get through the last few weeks of her senior year and leave — off to college and a fresh start. Instead, her high school is attacked by four nihilistic, gun-toting students, who plan to make their siege the worst school shooting in history. Using her wits and survival skills, Zoe fights back to save herself and her fellow students. 

AUDIENCE WARNING: This video is rated TV-MA for violence, language, and nudity and is intended only for mature audiences.

RUN HIDE FIGHT will be available for streaming on Dailywire.com after our live stream premiere — exclusively for Daily Wire members.

      <title>Ep. 635 - The Democrats Set Out To Make Everything Worse</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the government is in the middle of an all out effort to find the people who stormed the Capitol and bring them to justice. But no such effort has been made against the BLM and Antifa rioters who have killed dozens and caused billions of dollars of damage. And it is this hypocrisy, inconsistency, and lack of equal justice, that partly leads to rioting in the first place, so it’s worth talking about. Also Five Headlines including the story of a woman who identifies as a fairy and her two lovers, a troll and a leprechaun. Classic love story. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about president Trump’s second impeachment and why impeaching the president this time is an even worse idea than it was the first time.

      <title>Ep. 632 - The Media Suddenly Stops Caring About Unarmed People Getting Shot By Cops</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an unarmed woman was shot and killed by police when the Capitol was taken over on Wednesday. All of the people who have spent years shouting about the killing of unarmed civilians have been mysteriously silent about this case. Or, if not silence, they have celebrated the woman’s death. Also Five Headlines including the Democrats hatching a plan to remove Trump from office, even though he’s going to be gone from office in two weeks anyway. And we will cancel a former NBA star who says that the riot in DC was an example of white supremacy, and his argument gets even more absurd from there.

      <title>Ep. 631 - How We Got Here</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, chaos in DC yesterday as a group of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building. I want to talk about what led up to those events. The media and the Left for months were openly justifying and encouraging riots and political violence. Today they say that none of that had anything to do with the riot in DC. But I think there is a very obvious connection, which we will discuss today. Also Five Headlines including more on the mother and military veteran who was shot and killed by Capitol police during the riot. And President Trump is suspended from Twitter.

      <title>Ep. 630 - Justice Is Not Served</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the DA in Kenosha has announced that the officers involved in the Jacob Blake shooting will not be charged with a crime. The Left is outraged about this, but I think the real outrage is that Jacob Blake himself will also not be charged. Also Five Headlines including the runoff election in Georgia. Democrats now stand poised to take full control of the government. But who is to blame for the massive Republican failure in the state? And a new study suggests that maybe, it turns out, men who identify as women still have an advantage over women in sports. That’s what the study suggests anyway. Shocking stuff. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel three bands who have declined their Grammy nominations, saying they don’t deserve the nominations because they’re white. White guilt is a mental illness, I believe.

      <description>Is this the last time we'll see Trump in the White House or will he return in 2024 like the ghost from Christmas Past? Can Joe keep moving like an elf-on-the-shelf, safe from the clutches of a lurking Kamala? Will our stockings be full of presents or some Green New Deal economy-crushing coal alternative?

Join this roundtable discussion featuring Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, Michael Knowles, and Daily Wire god-king Jeremy Boreing as they get to the bottom of these questions and more.

      <title>Ep. 626 - Systemic Racism Against White People</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, some states are reportedly considering a race-based distribution strategy for the vaccine. Is this another example of anti-white systemic racism? Also Five Headlines, including: the deadliest epidemic to hit San Francisco this year is not COVID. Plus SNL actors sing and dance together on stage without a mask, yet you still can’t walk through the grocery store without one. What’s the science behind that? Finally a very somber and personal daily cancellation.

      <title>Ep. 625 - Public Health Experts Push For Racial Eugenics</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, public health experts are suggesting that we should give out the vaccine based on race. They are advocating openly for racial eugenics. Also Five Headlines including a major spike in cases in LA county. But if the lockdowns work, why would this be happening in one of the places in the country with the strictest lockdown policies? And in our Daily Cancellation, I will respond to the people who are angry at me for daring to suggest that it’s not good to be a prostitute.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, AOC and others on the Left have been celebrating the glories of ‘sex work’ and defending sites like OnlyFans. They say it’s a legitimate and noble way to make a living. Why are leftists constantly encouraging people to do things that will make them miserable? Also Five Headlines including 600 dollar stimulus checks as part of the latest COVID relief bill. What good will 600 dollars do? And today in our Daily Cancellation we will discuss the intense controversy over the singer Lizzo drinking a smoothie. Is she betraying the fat community?

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, now they are coming for Abraham Lincoln. After Thomas Jefferson’s name was taken off of a school in Virginia last week, now Abraham Lincoln High School in California is getting a name change.

Also Five Headlines including news from a doctor on MSNBC that even if you get a vaccine, you still can’t travel or live your normal life. And a famous evangelist claims that “Trumpism” is the greatest threat facing the church.

      <title>Ep. 622 - The Case For Secession</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, there has been a lot of talk in recent weeks about breaking up the country, having a national divorce. Today I will make my case for secession, but also explain why I think it will never happen. Also Five Headlines, including Biden hacking and wheezing his way through a speech. How long before President Harris officially takes over? Also, another business owner stands up against tyrannical health inspectors, and inmates at a jail in Pennsylvania complain that they are being persecuted by the dinner menu.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a two year old child and her family were kicked off a United flight because she wouldn’t wear a mask. We’ll discuss why masking children is an especially pointless, cruel, and cowardly move. Also Five Headlines including Bill Gates telling us that we cannot go back to normal for a while yet. And his opinion is supposed to matter, for some reason. Also the Cleveland Indians solve racism by changing their name. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel Jill Biden. One of many Jill Biden cancellations yet to come, something tells me.

      <title>Ep. 620 - Execute Criminals, Not Babies</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left is in mourning over the execution of a convicted murdered by the federal government. They accuse pro-lifers of being hypocrites because some of us support the death penalty. But today we’ll talk about why their position — that the death penalty is okay for babies but not for criminals — is really deranged and incoherent. Also Five Headlines, including Rush Limbaugh causing waves by bringing up the possibility of secession. I think that secession would not be a terrible idea, and I’ll explain why. Plus our Daily Cancellation and more.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left is in mourning over the execution of a convicted murdered by the federal government. They accuse pro-lifers of being hypocrites because some of us support the death penalty. But today we’ll talk about why their position — that the death penalty is okay for babies but not for criminals — is really deranged and incoherent. Also Five Headlines, including Rush Limbaugh causing waves by bringing up the possibility of secession. I think that secession would not be a terrible idea, and I’ll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 619 - The Mainstream Media Discovers Hunter Biden</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, YouTube begins a major censorship campaign, as the media finally discovers that there might be something to the Hunter Biden story. Of course they make this discovery only after the election. Also Five Headlines including a Michigan lawmaker making death threats against Trump supporters, and Joe Biden announces his plan to make the military more diverse and inclusive. And today I must cancel the Cartoon Network.

      <title>Ep. 618 - Cracking Down On Smut Peddlers</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a report about rampant child porn on Pornhub has prompted the site to make “major changes.” But the changes don’t go nearly far enough. Also Five Headlines including Eric Swalwell’s ties to a Chinese spy, and dozens shoppers camp out in a Walmart parking lot to buy a new video game console. Why is that okay during a pandemic, but you still can’t visit your grandparents for Christmas? And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll cancel a school board that voted to remove Thomas Jefferson’s name from their elementary school. The reasons they give are truly, deeply insane.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, nearly 20 percent of America's restaurants have closed permanently because of the lockdowns and another 10,000 will be added to the list soon. The government has intentionally decimated one of our most important industries. How can anyone feel anything less than rage over this? Also Five Headlines including the Democrats setting to work to enact their radical pro-abortion agenda, and an Israeli scientist makes a stunning revelation involving space aliens and something called the Galactic Federation. Plus we will cancel an anti-gun mall Santa.

      <title>Ep. 615 - More Anti-White Brainwashing In Public School</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a school district in California is forcing its employees to attend so-called “white privilege training.” I’ll tell you what this insane training entails. And also I’ll ask a pertinent question: when is a white employee finally going to stand up and file a racial discrimination lawsuit to stop this sort of madness? Also Five Headlines including more sheriffs saying they will not enforce unconstitutional lockdown orders, and Warner Brothers gives the death blow to movie theaters. Is that something to celebrate? And in our Daily Cancellation, I will preemptively cancel any future potential COVID vaccine mandate, and anyone who pushes for one.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a video of a business owner in Michigan is going viral. He is defying his state’s shut down order and paying a hefty price for it. But his message is inspiring and worth listening to. Also Five Headlines including supposed conservatives urging Republican voters in Georgia to stay home and hand the Senate to Democrats, and another anonymous racist note. These things are everywhere. It’s just that they’re always fake.

      <title>Ep. 613 - Women Are Not Men</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the actress Ellen Page has announced that she’s actually an actor named Elliot Page. She came out as a man. Of course the media has been in a state of rapturous celebration over it, but I have some questions. I think they are fair questions. Also Five Headlines including Chuck Schumer endorsing Joe Biden’s plan to force women to share the bathroom with men, and Biden’s Treasury secretary nominee explains how she will sue the treasury to heal racism, sexism, and climate change. Finally, today, breathing is canceled. This was not my decision. USA Today canceled breathing in a recent op-Ed and it’s my duty to share the news with you.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the actress Ellen Page has announced that she’s actually an actor named Elliot Page. She came out as a man. Of course the media has been in a state of rapturous celebration over it, but I have some questions. I think they are fair questions. Also Five Headlines including Chuck Schumer endorsing Joe Biden’s plan to force women to share the bathroom with men, and Biden’s Treasury secretary nominee explains how she will sue the treasury to heal racism, sexism, and climate change. Finally, today, breathing is canceled. This was not my decision. USA Today canceled breathing in a recent op-Ed and it’s my duty to share the news with you.

      <title>Ep. 612 - The Petty Tyrants That Rule Us</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an official in California votes to ban outdoor dining and then immediately goes to eat at a restaurant outdoors. We have gotten used to this hypocrisy from our rulers, but we should not be used to it. Also Five Headlines including controversy over a restaurant owner who scolded his patrons for twerking in his restaurant. People are offended that he told them to stop twerking. But reasonable people are more so concerned that he had to tell them in the first place. And in our Daily Cancellation, as we get into the holiday season, I will be canceling Christmas trees.

      <title>Ep. 611 - The Lockdown’s Catastrophic Effects</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the lockdowns are having a catastrophic impact on the economy, mental health, and education. In one country, more people have died by suicide than by COVID. The situation across much of the rest of the world is also dire. Yet those who push the lockdowns refuse to grapple with or even acknowledge the devastating effects. Also Five Headlines, including Joe Biden’s injury and another “anonymous racist note” story that the media is reporting as fact, even though anonymous racist notes are almost always hoaxes. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’m afraid it is my duty to rain on the parade of everyone celebrating a woman’s “historic” kick during a college football game on Saturday.

      <title>Ep. 610 - Why I'm Not Cancelling My Thanksgiving Plans</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Thanksgiving is tomorrow. This shouldn’t be necessary, it shouldn’t come to this, but I will offer my defense of celebrating Thanksgiving and explain why I will still be gathering with my family for the holiday. Also Five Headlines including the media going back into fawning mode now that they’re anticipating a Democrat in the White House. Also some employees at Random House apparently broke down in tears when they found out that the publisher was putting out a Jordan Peterson book. Is there ever any acceptable reason to cry at work? We’ll discuss. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will be canceling one of the most sinister groups in America: cyclists.

      <title>Ep. 609 - What's Really Driving The Trans Epidemic Among Children</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a horrifying documentary on HBO intends to promote the trans-ing of children, but instead it accidentally shows why and how kids really end up gender confused. It’s not surprising, but it is illuminating. Also Five Headlines including the governor of Maryland announcing that we don’t have a constitutional right to not wear a mask. We’ll deal with that bizarre and alarming claim today. And Emperor Cuomo has a message for any police officers who refuse to enforce his royal edicts. Plus our Five Headlines and more.

      <title>Ep. 608 - The Media Suddenly Decides That Evidence Is Important</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we have heard a lot about the need for evidence but many of the people in the media screaming about the alleged lack of evidence of voter fraud have themselves advanced many wild claims and insisted that we shouldn’t require evidence to believe them. We’ll go over some of those wild claims today. Also Five Headlines including some in the American public beginning to stand up and resist the unconstitutional lockdown orders. This is what is needed if we’re ever going to be free again. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll cancel a woman in Canada who successfully shut down a pop up restaurant because it had committed the sin of cultural appropriation. But we’re also going to cancel the owner of that restaurant for caving to the outrage mob.

      <title>Ep. 607 - What Leftists Mean When They Say 'Unity'</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a New York Times writer says he’s given up on reaching out to Trump voters after all of his outreach efforts failed. But we can learn something important about the leftist mentality from the way he went about this “outreach.” Also Five Headlines including a press conference held by Trump’s lawyers, laying out their voter fraud claims. Tucker Carlson says that one of the lawyers, Sidney Powell, has refused to provide any of the evidence she claims to have. We’ll try to make sense of all of that today. And in our Daily Cancellation, New York Magazine produces one of the most racist videos you will ever see in your life. We’ll play that today and of course, cancel everyone involved.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, schools across the country are shutting down again. Many of them still have not opened. It is clear that the people running the education system — to include the teachers unions — do not really care that much about education. Also Five Headlines including a bombshell study which seems to vindicate the anti-maskers. Plus Japan starts using robots to enforce social distancing. And our Daily Cancellation, and much more.

      <title>Ep. 605 - A Society In Denial</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as many states go back into lockdown mode, and the holiday season is effectively canceled due to COVID, we are told that those who resist these measures or refuse to follow them are in denial about the danger. But I think the people who want to keep society shut down for fear of a virus are the ones in denial, and I’ll explain why. Also Five Headlines including the latest Democrat politician to violate his own COVID restrictions, and the Daily Beast uncovers a massive scandal. Apparently a Christian politician tried to convert some people to Christianity. Shocking stuff. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel Canada. They’ve been begging for it for years. And now the time has come.

      <title>Ep. 604 - Public Health Experts Destroyed Their Own Credibility And Will Never Get It Back</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, public health experts are calling for more lockdowns while blaming the public for not listening to them and causing a new surge in coronavirus cases. But maybe these people should consider that we aren’t listening to them because they demolished their own credibility by supporting the BLM riots in the midst of the pandemic. Also Five Headlines including a nurse going on CNN to badmouth her own dying patients. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will discuss Harry Styles in a dress.

      <title>Ep. 602 - Follow The 'Science' Into The Abyss</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it is well known that the people who shout “follow the science” are often the most hostile to it. The latest example is the left’s campaign to censor a book about the “transgender craze” among children. We’ll talk about that today. Also in our Five Headlines Chicago becomes the latest city to cancel Thanksgiving. The mayor says it’s necessary in order to save lives. She seems very selective in the lives she wants to save in her city. Plus Cracker Barrel apologizes for a rope that offended people. Plus our Daily Cancellation and more.

      <title>Ep. 601 - Emperor Cuomo Tries To Invade Your Home</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, democrat governors are now telling people how many of their own family members they’re allowed to have in their own homes. Somehow the COVID restrictions keep getting even more onerous and unconstitutional, not less. Also Five Headlines including the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, drafting legislation that will offer legal protections to people who shoot rioters and looters in self defense. Should we start the Ron DeSantis 2024 chants now? And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel The Rock.

      <title>Ep. 600 - The Leftist Misinformation Machine Goes Into Overdrive</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the left wing media is hunting down and combating “misinformation” about the election. The only problem is that much of what they call misinformation is actually completely true. Plus Five Headlines including the CDC’s new Thanksgiving guidelines, which I will be sure to completely ignore. And in our Daily Cancellation I will have to cancel the AP for coming up with a whole new set of words that are now offensive.

      <title>Ep. 599 - Biden's Coronavirus Adviser Says People Should Die At 75</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden’s coronavirus adviser is on the record saying that everyone is better off dying at the age of 75. This seems like a rather serious conflict of interest. Also Five Headlines including brave feminists remaining silent as prosecutors drop sexual assault charges against Jacob Blake as part of a plea deal, and the mayor of DC is the latest Democrat mayor to break her own quarantine rules. Apparently she gets to be an exception, she explained. And in our Daily Cancellation, I must cancel many states across our union for the sins they have committed. This has nothing to do with the election. It’s much more serious than that. All of that on the way, and more.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media calls the race for Joe Biden. With counts still ongoing and the winner not actually determined, Biden delivered a victory speech where he called for “unity.” The Democrats want to be pals again, now that they think they’ve won. I’ll explain why their gestures of friendship are meaningless. Also Five Headlines including, the death of an icon, and a very coincidental COVID miracle. Plus our Daily Cancellation and more.

      <title>Ep. 597 - Dems Pretend They Didn't Just Spend Four Years Calling Trump An Illegitimate President</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media panics over Trump questioning the integrity of the election, but the media itself has been questioning the integrity of his election for the past four years. Also we’re examining the fraud claims. Is there good reason to suspect fraud? And if so, what should be done about it? Plus, Democrats fight amongst themselves over whether socialism and leftist extremism is the future of their party. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the radical sex ed mandate just approved by the voters of Washington state.

      <title>Ep. 596 - A Crisis Of Trust And A Close Election</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, chaos and uncertainty around the election. This is the inevitable result of a confused and haphazard voting system combined with a total lack of trust in the media and our institutions. The media now scolds Americans who question the election results, but it is their own fault for giving us so many reasons to doubt what they tell us. Also, Five Headlines including moves all across the country to legalize drugs. Is it time for the GOP to make marijuana legalization part of its platform? And in our Daily Cancellation, I cancel National Geographic for speculating that prehistoric people 9000 years ago may have been proponents of left wing gender theory.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the election is not determined yet, but the result, whatever it is ultimately, is already far from what the media and the polls predicted. How did they get it so wrong? And do we have to be worried about voter fraud? What else can we determine based on what we know so far?

      <title>Ep. 594 - Vote Against Mob Rule, Vote Republican</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it’s Election Day, and it looks very different from any other Election Day in modern American history. Shops are boarded up. The National Guard is on standby. And none of this is being done to protect against possible mobs of angry Republicans. Also Five Headlines including a CNN contributor sincerely arguing that Donald Trump is literally worse than Hitler, and reports of families being ripped apart by political differences. Is there ever a good reason to disown a family member because of the politician they support? Finally in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel daylight savings time once and for all.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it’s Election Day, and it looks very different from any other Election Day in modern American history. Shops are boarded up.

      <title>Ep. 593 - The Biden-Harris Ticket Goes Full Marxist</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Biden team is making its closing pitch to voters, and the closing pitch is full blown Marxism. Will it work or backfire? And if it does work, what does that say about our country? Also Five Headlines including cities bracing for leftist rioting after the election. If I was a leftist, I’d be pretty ashamed. Though if I was a leftist, I’d also be incapable of shame. And a special Double Cancellation today.

      <title>Ep. 592 - Your Life Does Not Depend On The President</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, many people in this country seem to think that if the result of the presidential election is not what they want it to be, it will be the end of life as they know it. This is why cities have to brace for rioting if Trump wins. People are way too emotionally invested in presidential politics. Today I’ll try to inject a little bit of sanity into this picture. Also Five Headlines including Trump picking up another endorsement from a prominent rapper. Is this an aberration or is it a sign that Trump will do better than the polls predict? Also your Daily Cancellation and much more.

      <title>Ep. 590 - If You Elect Democrats, You Get The Chaos You Deserve</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, rioting raged in Philadelphia for a second night, and spread to New York, DC, and elsewhere. As usual, the Democrat leaders of these cities did almost nothing to stop it. This is what you get from Democrats: they sit and watch while their cities burn. Also, the “victim” of the police shooting that sparked the riots has a lengthy criminal record, including a horrible crime against a woman. He is not the only BLM martyr in the last few months to have a history of abusing women. Why is that BLM celebrates and canonizes men like this? And in our Five Headlines, an explosive Tucker Carlson interview with the man blowing the whistle on Biden family corruption. And for our Daily Cancellation, in perhaps my most deserved and necessary cancellation yet, I will be cancelling dancing.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, BLM is back to rioting, this time over the shooting of an armed man who was charging at police officers with a weapon. BLM is going off script by rioting only a week before the election. Hopefully voters take notice. Also Five Headlines including Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation, plus Tampax tries to earn some Woke points by marketing itself to men who have periods. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel pets.

      <title>Ep. 588 - The Media Somehow Manages To Stoop To A New Low</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media will stop at nothing to distract from the Hunter Biden scandal. They somehow managed to stoop to a new low this week. Also Five Headlines including Joe Biden giving his fullest answer yet on the court packing question. And a deeply offensive ranking of Halloween candy. In our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel everyone, once and for all. I have been given no choice.

      <title>Ep. 587 - Leftist Witch Hunters Burn Chris Pratt At The Stake</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Chris Pratt has been trending on social media all week thanks in large part to leftists who think he might be a Trump supporter because he didn’t attend a Biden fundraiser with other Marvel actors. This is how modern witch hunts work. Also Five Headlines including Biden finally responding to the Hunter Biden scandal, sort of. And the city of Miami holds a press conference because people are offended by a facemask worn by a Miami police officer. Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel birthdays.

      <title>Ep. 584 - Joe Biden, A Madman Driven Insane By Left Wing Ideology</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden at his town hall last night proved once again that he is a man living in a fantasy world, driven mad by left wing ideology. The latest evidence is his proposal that police officers neutralize dangerous suspects simply by “shooting them in the leg.” We’ll talk about why this is an absurd and unworkable idea. Also Five Headlines including the Left doxing a woman for nodding during Trump’s town hall. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will cancel body shaming. Not the thing itself. We will cancel the term “body shaming” and all the panicking people do over it.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Big Tech giants are waging an all out war to suppress damaging stories about Joe Biden right before the election. We are facing a very dangerous moment. And though conservatives like myself don’t like to think this way, it’s time for the government to step in. Also Five Headlines including more faux controversies coming out of the Amy Coney Barrett hearings. And in our Daily Cancellation, it is finally time for me to cancel Barbie.

      <title>Ep. 582 - Leftism Is Indistinguishable From Insanity</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, desperate Democrats, grasping for any reason to hate Amy Coney Barrett, have now decided that her use of the term “sexual preference” is offensive and horrible. The entire Left decided in the span of 24 hours that this term is offensive. We’ll talk about the implications of living in a culture where words change meanings so quickly, and also why the Left’s theory of sexual orientation completely contradicts their theories of gender.

      <title>Ep. 581 - Dems Horrified That Barrett Might Interfere With Their Right To Kill Babies</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Democrats are coming up with a million reasons to oppose Amy Coney Barrett because they don’t want to be honest about the real reason, which is that she might make it harder to kill babies. Also Five Headlines including absurd claims of “voter suppression,” which we will analyze, and a harrowing video of an encounter between a mountain lion and a hiker. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will be canceling everyone involved in a viral video of a woman forcing her boyfriend to marry her at a Target.

      <title>Ep. 580 - Dems Add 'Court Packing' To List Of Redefined Terms</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Democrats have made it clear that they absolutely will pack the court if they are given the power to do so, overturning a century of precedent and setting us down a dangerous path. They’re defense of this plan is to, as always, redefine the term “court packing,” claiming that Republicans are packing the court simply by filling vacant seats. Also Five Headlines including an unlicensed security guard apparently hired by an NBC affiliate shot and killed a Trump supporter. And Tucker Carlson talks about UFOs, and brings up a number of important questions. And in our Daily Cancellation, as is my custom on Columbus Day, I will cancel those who have been trying to posthumously cancel the great explorer.

      <title>Ep. 579 - Yelp Creates Insane 'Racism' Tag For Businesses</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Yelp has introduced a new feature that will tag and label any business “accused of racist behavior.” What could possibly go wrong? Also Five Headlines including Nancy Pelosi invoking the 25th Amendment and Mel Gibson starring in a film about an alcoholic Santa Claus being hunted by a hitman. The Oscar buzz has already started. And today in a very serious and emotional Daily Cancellation, I will be canceling the people who have been cyber bullying me over the past day.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Mike Pence dominates in the Vice Presidential debate. The media is so desperate to distract from Pence’s brilliant performance that they are now accusing him of sexism for debating a woman — at a debate against a woman. Also Five Headlines including more rioting and looting for perhaps the most absurd reason yet. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel celebrities who got naked in order to encourage people to vote. I will not only be cancelling them but I will also be cancelling all get out the vote drives. I think they should all be abolished and I’ll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 577 - Refuting the Lies of Michelle Obama</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Michelle Obama comes out swinging against Trump, calling him racist and a liar and immoral. But speaking of liars, she lies repeatedly in her attack. We’ll get to the truth. Also Joe Biden makes empty calls for “unity,” but I’ll explain why unity in America is impossible. And in our Five Headlines, Hollywood plans a film lionizing Katie Hill, the congresswoman who sexually took advantage of her subordinates. Me Too was already dead, but it’s especially dead now. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel all drivers on the road, except for me.

      <title>Ep. 576 - Trump Says Not To Be Afraid Of COVID. He's Right.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, after overcoming the coronavirus, Trump tells Americans not to be afraid of the virus and not to let it dominate our lives. The media doesn’t like this message, but it’s exactly what people need to hear. And my own recent personal experience proves it. I’ll explain. Also Five Headlines including more stunning revelations from the Melania Tapes, only they aren’t the sort of revelations the Left wants. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the not-at-all-shocking conclusion to the Althea Bernstein “hate crime” case.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, after overcoming the coronavirus, Trump tells Americans not to be afraid of the virus and not to let it dominate our lives. The media doesn’t like this message, but it’s exactly what people need to hear. And my own recent personal experience proves it. I’ll explain. Also Five Headlines including more stunning revelations from the Melania Tapes, only they aren’t the sort of revelations the Left wants. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the not-at-all-shocking conclusion to the Althea Bernstein “hate crime” case.</p><p>If you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/walsh">https://www.dailywire.com/walsh</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Ep. 575 - Biden Is The One Who Needs To Condemn Violent Extremists</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media is breathlessly reporting that Trump refused to condemn white supremacists in last night’s debate. It’s a lie. He did condemn them. He’s already condemned them. He’s condemned them many times. Meanwhile, Joe Biden and the rest of the Democrats have actually never condemned the violent extremists in the midst, like BLM and Antifa. That’s the real outrage, considering those groups are currently burning down our cities. Also Five Headlines including an unintentionally hilarious “fact check” on a Babylon Bee article. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll cancel the Atlantic for trying to make a scandal out of the fact that Trump allegedly makes fun of televangelists. Who doesn’t?

      <title>Ep. 574 - A Civic Duty To Hate The IRS</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, many on the Left have been nobly sermonizing about our civic duty to pay taxes. But they have a very strange and inconsistent view on civic duties and obligations. Also Five Headlines including the media’s continued attempts to smear Amy Coney Barrett on the basis that she’s a Bible believing Christian. Plus the push to lower the voting age to 16. That’s a terrible idea for so many reasons it’s difficult to count them all. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will be canceling grown men who use emojis. I have discovered that this is an issue of national interest and importance.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media obtained President Trump’s tax records. The big scandal is that Trump managed to legally keep a lot of his own money. Somehow I am not able to feel much outrage about this. Also Five Headlines including another revelation in the Jacob Blake shooting, and Amy Coney Barrett is officially announced as Trump’s SCOTUS pick. The attacks from the Left have been as deranged as expected. Plus the Daily Cancellation and more.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we’ll talk about the most dangerous conspiracy theory in America today. And it’s not the one the media is freaking out about. It’s the conspiracy theory that is currently fueling rioting and anarchy in the streets. Also Five Headlines including BLM and Antifa protesters in LA use cars to chase down an innocent motorist and attack him. And the cops arrest the victim. Then a very special Daily Cancellation segment, dedicated to a very special person.

      <title>Ep. 571 - Everything You’ve Heard About The Breonna Taylor Case Is A Lie</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, violent insurrectionists descend on Louisville in response to the grand jury decision in the Breonna Taylor case. But almost everything BLM has said about the shooting of Breonna Taylor is a lie. Not that the truth matters to them, but we’ll talk about the truth of the case today. Also Five Headlines including the Left fretting that Donald Trump won’t submit to a “peaceful transfer of power.” That’s an interesting charge for them to make, as they continue to burn down our cities. And in our Daily Cancellation I will cancel the CDC for trying to cancel Halloween.

      <title>Ep. 570 - Ban Critical Race Theory In Our Schools</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Donald Trump is on a righteous crusade against Critical Race Theory. Now it is time to expand that mission into the schools, where CRT is the most dangerous. Also Five Headlines including the media’s misinformation campaign about what overturning Roe v Wade would actually mean. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’m afraid I have to cancel Amy Coney Barrett, and I’ll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 569 - Establishment Conservatives Craft A Plan For Defeat</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Republicans have the chance to flip the Supreme Court, rescue it from the clutches of left wing radical activist judges, and potentially save millions of unborn lives in the process. But some so-called conservatives are arguing that it would be “unprincipled” for Republicans to take advantage of the opportunity. Also Five Headlines including Chris Cuomo giving a constitution lesson to Don Lemon on CNN last night. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will finally cancel the entire country of Japan.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Republicans have the chance to flip the Supreme Court, rescue it from the clutches of left wing radical activist judges, and potentially save millions of unborn lives in the process. But some so-called conservatives are arguing that it would be “unprincipled” for Republicans to take advantage of the opportunity. Also Five Headlines including Chris Cuomo giving a constitution lesson to Don Lemon on CNN last night. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will finally cancel the entire country of Japan.

      <title>Ep. 568 - RBG Dies, The Left's Psychotic Breakdown Intensifies</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left has its expected psychotic breakdown in response to Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s death. They’re claiming that it would be an assault on the rule of law and democracy for Republicans to confirm a replacement before the election. That’s absurd and laughable. I’ll explain why. Also Five Headlines, including the tragic suicide of a bar owner who was facing prison for defending himself against a rioter who attacked him. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel all airlines and airports after having to endure their completely arbitrary COVID regulations last week.

      <title>Ep. 567 - The Scourge Of Democrat Mayors</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a major scandal as leaked emails reveal that the Democratic mayor of Nashville was covering up COVID-19 data in order to fraudulently continue the lockdowns. We’ll talk about this story and also ask: given everything we’ve seen recently, why would anyone vote for a Democrat to run their city or state? Also Five Headlines including Trump’s “patriotic education” initiative and a video of an unhinged woman berating a CVS employee for calling the cops on shoplifters. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll cancel the people burning JK Rowling’s books because they’re mad that she believes men have penises.

      <title>Ep. 566 - The Truth Is Out. We Don't Need The Public School System</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, according to recent reports huge droves of American families are flocking to homeschool. They are fed up with the way the school system has responded to the coronavirus and are now choosing to educate their children themselves. There is good reason to think that this shift may be permanent, and part of a larger trend. And that is a very good thing, because we cannot reclaim our culture until we break the public school system’s stranglehold on our children. Also Five Headlines including the media flipping out because Bill Barr allegedly wants to arrest and try protesters with sedition and arrest the mayor of Seattle, among other things. We’re supposed to hate Barr for this but instead I kind of want to make him king. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel the Cardinal in New Jersey who says a Christian can in good conscience vote for Joe Biden. No, a Christian cannot.

      <title>Ep. 565 - The Democrat Party's War On Science</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a major science publication endorses Joe Biden and hails him as the most pro-science candidate in the race. Of course, the Democrat Party has for years called itself the Party of Science. But does it deserve that label? No. Not remotely. We’ll talk about why. Also Five Headlines including President Trump’s historic peace deal and the heroic female police officer who was shot in that assassination attempt over the weekend has been identified. Oddly, the media isn’t very interested in her story. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel the cowardly pastor who apologized to his congregation when his associate pastor criticized BLM during a homily.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, after a summer of rioting spurred by a handful of high profile police shootings, today I want to take a look at what we can actually learn from those cases. They seem to provide a blueprint for how to avoid getting killed or maimed by the police. It’s not as hard as you might think. Also Five Headlines including a federal judge shutting down the shut downs. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel Joe Biden for claiming that you’ll die in a hurricane if Trump is reelected.

      <title>Ep. 563 - BLM Riots Over Death Of Knife Wielding Maniac</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, riots have made their way to Amish country now. This time BLM and Antifa are tearing the city of Lancaster apart because a knife wielding maniac got shot while trying to stab a police officer to death. This, somehow, is racism we’re told. Also, two police officers in LA fall victim to an attempted assassination. How much responsibility do Joe Biden and the Democrats bear for this? And in our Daily Cancellation, I will be cancelling the “black national anthem” which was played before every NFL game this weekend.

And in our Daily Cancellation, I will be cancelling the “black national anthem” which was played before every NFL game this weekend.</p><p>If you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/walsh">https://www.dailywire.com/walsh</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Ep. 562 - There Is A Full-Fledged Effort To Sexualize Children In Our Culture</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as the backlash against the child-sexualizing Cuties movie on Netflix grows, it’s important for us to take a step back and understand that the movie fits into a larger and diabolical trend in our culture. Also Five Headlines including an interesting expose on the privileged lives of some of the rioters arrested in New York. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’ll address the media outrage about fans in Kansas City last night who allegedly booed “racial unity.”

      <title>Ep. 561 - Netflix Gets Into The Child Sexual Exploitation Business</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Netflix has officially released the “Cuties” movie about twerking 11-year-olds. Many defenders of the film in the media said that the outrage against the film was off base and that its detractors were taking things out of context. Well, now the full movie is publicly available. And it turns out, it’s even worse than we thought. Also Five Headlines including another shocking scandal that is sure to bring down Donald Trump. At least that’s what they tell me on CNN. And in our Daily Cancellation, I am sad to report that I must cancel my wife yet again.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Kamala Harris was the latest Democrat to visit and pay homage to Jacob Blake, credibly accused rapist and serial abuser. With the canonization of men like Blake and George Floyd, the Me Too movement is officially dead. Also Five Headlines including BLM fighting for racial justice by harassing elderly diners at restaurants. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel gender reveal parties before they get us all killed.

      <title>Ep. 558 - Facts Don't Matter To Black Lives Matter</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, BLM lies and fabrications lead to more protests. As we have learned, facts don’t matter to Black Lives Matter. But here's a really crazy idea: Maybe, instead of blaming the police for choices that criminals make, we might consider blaming the people actually making the choices. Also Five Headlines including Joe Biden race baiting, California Democrats moving to decriminalize pederasty, and Harry and Meghan sign a Netflix deal and promise to make some of the worst programming the world has ever seen. Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the black college professor from “the hood” who just confessed to being a white Jewish girl from suburban Missouri.

      <title>Ep. 557 - The Shocking And Twisted Origins Of Modern Gender Theory</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it is now accepted as dogma that gender is a social construct and men and women can change their genders. We’re going to explore the origins of this theory and reveal the truth about the degenerate quack who came up with it. Also Five Headlines, including the dastardly conspiracy that caused Nancy Pelosi to break the lockdown rules by getting her hair done in a salon. She’s the victim here. And in our Daily Cancellation, speaking of victims, we’ll talk about yet another rich celebrity who, it turns out, is being racially oppressed.

      <title>Ep. 556 - The Pathetic Moral Cowardice Of The NFL And NBA</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the NFL and NBA pretend to take a stand for “social justice,” but it’s all an act. They have always run from every opportunity to help fight for real justice. Also Five Headlines including Nancy Pelosi becoming the latest Democrat politician to break the lockdown rules. But it’s okay because she’s important. And in our Daily Cancellation, I cancel all the white adherents to the critical race theory cult who are running around begging forgiveness for their inherent racism.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the NFL and NBA pretend to take a stand for “social justice,” but it’s all an act. They have always run from every opportunity to help fight for real justice. Also Five Headlines including Nancy Pelosi becoming the latest Democrat politician to break the lockdown rules. But it’s okay because she’s important. And in our Daily Cancellation, I cancel all the white adherents to the critical race theory cult who are running around begging forgiveness for their inherent racism.

      <title>Ep. 555 - The Left's Racial Narrative Is Having Its Desired Effect</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a video of a white man being beaten with a brick in Baltimore is uploaded to Instagram with the caption “white lives don't matter.” This is the latest apparently racially motivated assault on a white person. The media obviously is ignoring it, but it’s happening, and the reason why it’s happening is clear. Also Five Headlines including Trump getting in trouble for speaking the truth about BLM and Joe Biden having a mental breakdown on live TV. And in our Daily Cancellation I will cancel everyone who is currently trying to cancel Adele for her supposedly racist hairstyle.

      <title>Ep. 554 - We Have Made It Impossible For Police Officers To Do Their Jobs</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, is it possible to be a police officer in America today when even shooting a knife wielding suspected rapist and serial abuser causes protests and riots? Also Five Headlines including the apparent execution murder of a Trump supporter in Portland, and Joe Biden’s incredible moral cowardice in the face of the escalating violence. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll cancel the latest celebrity to come out as non-binary, whatever that is supposed to mean exactly.

      <title>Ep. 553 - An Uprising Of Spoiled Rotten Brats</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, why are our cities being consumed by chaos? What is really driving this? This isn't a fight for racial justice or anything close to that. These are spoiled brats who've never contributed anything of value to society, lashing out against normal hard working Americans. Also Five Headlines including crazed mobs swarming Rand Paul and other Republicans as they leave the convention in DC last night. And we'll discuss the most powerful moment of the entire convention, and what we can learn from it.

      <title>Ep. 552 - The Media Narrative In The Jacob Blake Shooting Begins To Crumble</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media narrative in the Jacob Blake shooting is falling apart. As the truth emerges, the story we were originally told appears wrong or misleading on a number of key points. But that doesn’t matter to the rioters, who consider truth to be an irrelevant detail. Also Five Headlines including the nun at the RNC convention last night sent in to do battle against the DNC’s fake nun. There was a clear victor. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel the New York Times for an article that asks us to feel sorry for men who get caught by police while trying to have sex with children.

Also Five Headlines including the media’s hysterical reaction to Nick Sandmann’s great speech at the RNC convention, plus teachers claim they were traumatized by an active shooter drill and now require money to heal their emotional wounds. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll cancel the esteemed race baiter Jemele Hill.

      <title>Ep. 550 - Cities Burn While Democrats Cheer</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, rabid mobs continue to wreak havoc and destruction in Wisconsin and elsewhere across the country, all with the explicit support of the Democrat Party. Nancy Pelosi said yesterday that Republicans are “domestic enemies.” But that label applies much more to Democrats. Also Five Headlines including Jerry Falwell in a throuple, allegedly. Incredibly important story there. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel PhDs.

      <title>Ep. 549 - The Truth About The Police Shooting In Wisconsin</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, another police shooting caught on tape. Another round of rioting. Once again, the shooting is declared a racist murder right away. But, as we always try to do on this show, we’ll look at the actual facts of this case. They tell a very different story. Also Five Headlines including an NHL announcer getting suspended for an utterly innocuous joke that feminists have labeled “sexist.” And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the incredibly misleading CBS poll that has the media accusing Republicans of murderous nihilism.

      <title>Ep. 548 - Netflix Sexualizes Children (again)</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the sexualization of children in our culture continues with a horrifying Netflix film about twerking 11-year-olds. And Five Headlines including last night’s DNC convention finale, and a school system that wants parents to pledge in writing that they will not eavesdrop on their children’s virtual classes. And in our Daily Cancellation we will cancel a Christian publisher for its exceedingly cringey attempt to connect with today’s youth.

      <title>Ep. 547 - SJWs Defend Racial And Ideological Discrimination At Goodyear</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Goodyear was exposed for its discriminatory policy allowing “black lives matter” but not “all lives matter” or “blue lives matter.” The media has rushed to the company’s defense. But leaked audio now shows that the policy is worse than we thought. Also Five Headlines including a stirring speech from a pop star at the DNC convention last night. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the vile left wing mob that randomly destroyed a man’s life because of an innocent typo in a tweet.

      <title>Ep. 546 - Boycott Companies That Hate Us</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, another company comes out in support of the marxist BLM organization while discriminating against conservatives. It’s time for conservatives, such as myself, to get over our aversion to boycotts. Also Five Headlines, including the DNC convention speech by an accused rapist who was photographed receiving a massage from one of Epstein’s sex slaves. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’ll cancel MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes, and in the process of that cancellation, just for good measure, I will also cancel college.

Also, Five Headlines, including the DNC convention, which was mostly horrifically boring, except for one incredible moment that I’ll play for you. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel everyone on the Left who can’t make up their minds about whether women are supposed to be respected or not.

      <title>Ep. 544 - Democrats Call For Unity. But Their Unity Doesn’t Include You.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the DNC convention kicks off with a call to “unite America.” But what does “unity” look like in the mind of a Democrat? Apparently it includes rioting and looting and destruction. Also Five Headlines including a college professor who has finally uncovered the sinister nature of coloring books. And finally in our Daily Cancellation, we will talk about the hate crime claim made weeks ago that got a lot of attention for a few days but hasn’t been mentioned by the media or law enforcement since. I wonder why?

      <title>Ep. 543 - Why Biden's Nationwide Mask Mandate Idea Is Stupid, Arbitrary, and Illegal</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden has proposed a nationwide mask mandate. This idea is very stupid on a number of levels, and we’ll dissect each of those levels today. Also Five Headlines including a wave of depression and suicide due in part to the coronavirus lockdowns, and the New York Post reports on something called “erotic weight gaining,” which is a thing now, apparently. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel human rights. I’ll explain why.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, there is an update to the story of the black man who assaulted a white Macy’s employee, and it’s outrageous. Also Five Headlines including the cancer stricken 2-year-old who was stranded at a cancer treatment center while it was attacked by rioters in Chicago. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the feminists who claim that normal human interactions are sexist “micro-aggressions."

      <title>Ep. 541 - Child Executed While Riding Bike. National Media Ignores. Here’s Why.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, one of the most horrific murder cases in modern history has gotten zero — and I really mean zero — coverage from the American national media. The reason? The victim is a white five-year-old child. The alleged killer is a black man. But this case deserves attention, and we’ll give it the attention it deserves today. Also Five Headlines including a BLM activist claiming that looting is okay because it’s a form of reparations. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’ll cancel all the leftists celebrating over a woman being chosen as Biden’s VP. Apparently these leftists have forgotten that women don’t exist anymore, according to them. So I will remind them.

      <title>Ep. 540 - Objectification Is Not Empowerment</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the number one song in the world right now consists of a couple of women shouting about their genitals. We are told that this is “empowering” and “sex positive” and “inspiring.” But in fact it is the opposite. And all of the people defending and celebrating the song are hypocrites. I’ll explain why. Also Five Headlines including another BLM supporter pulls a gun on a motorist who committed the crime of trying to drive on a public road. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel the climate alarmists who have scared children so much that now some kids are traumatized when they go outside.

      <title>Ep. 539 - Public School Teachers Are Afraid That You'll Hear Them Brainwashing Your Kids</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a teacher admits publicly that he’s afraid online learning will interfere with this ability to brainwash his students. Many other teachers chimed in to agree with him. When the school system says this sort of thing out loud, we should listen. Also Five Headlines including more looting in Chicago, and a controversy over a Trolls doll that seems silly until you take a closer look. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel NASA for putting social justice ahead of space exploration.

      <title>Ep. 538 - Dissolve Planned Parenthood</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Attorney General of New York is going after the NRA, seeking to dissolve it for its alleged criminal conduct. That brings up a good question: Why hasn’t any Republican AG done this with Planned Parenthood? Also Five Headlines including Joe Biden accidentally being racist again. Plus another actress issues a tearful public apology. The reason is possibly the most absurd yet.

      <title>Ep. 537 - The Problem With Pretending That Beyonce Is An Artistic Genius</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Beyonce just released a new album, and as always, the media tells us that it is a work of staggering artistic genius. That’s all anyone is allowed to say about Beyonce. In reality, of course, she’s a mediocre pop star. But what does it say about our culture that these are the artists we elevate, and the art we hail as especially significant? We’ll talk about that. Plus Five Headlines including riots continuing in Portland even though we were assured that riots would end as soon as the feds left. And in our Daily Cancellation, I am forced to cancel Tomi Lahren. She has left me no choice.

Plus Five Headlines including riots continuing in Portland even though we were assured that riots would end as soon as the feds left. And in our Daily Cancellation, I am forced to cancel Tomi Lahren. She has left me no choice.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Beyonce just released a new album, and as always, the media tells us that it is a work of staggering artistic genius.

      <title>Ep. 536 - Genius Woman Says America Is Too Violent, Moves To Mexico</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we'll discuss the very funny but also instructive story of a woman who left America because of its violence and racism and moved instead to Mexico, a country that is far worse than America in every category and by every measure. Also Five Headlines including Joe Biden continuing to fall apart on camera, and the supposedly surging QAnon movement. And in our Daily Cancellation I cancel Ryan Reynolds for being the latest celebrity to issue a groveling and ridiculous apology.

      <title>Ep. 535 - George Floyd Bodycam Footage Is Out. We Weren't Told The Full Truth.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, after two months of being kept from the public, the bodycam footage showing the minutes leading up to George Floyd’s death has been released. Let’s just say that the issue is far more complicated than what the media led us to believe. We will discuss in detail today. Also Five Headlines including a white ESPN host openly gloating over the injury of a black NBA player who stood for the National Anthem. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will try to soothe the fears of a paranoid journalist who thinks pickup trucks were invented to kill pedestrians.

      <title>Ep. 534 - The Tyranny Of Non-Contributing Ignoramuses</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Donald Trump is pushing back against mail-in voting because he’s concerned about voter fraud. But I think the real problem with mail in voting — and with our system of voting generally — is different, though it is far more politically incorrect to discuss. Also Five Headlines including murderers and other dangerous felons now having their cases dropped in Oklahoma after the Supreme Court ruled that wide swaths of the state are Indian territory. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the pro-lifers who were arrested in DC for writing a pro-life message in chalk on the sidewalk. Meanwhile the mayor has had her own preferred political messages painted in huge letters across entire city blocks.

      <title>Ep. 533 - Funerals for Me But Not For Thee</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, after a series of memorial services across several states, John Lewis was laid to rest at a funeral attended by many people including 50 congress members. Today we’ll discuss the blatant and outrageous double standard that allows departed politicians to have multiple funerals while average Americans still aren’t allowed to have one. Also Five Headlines including a whole trove of Epstein documents are now out, and a number of famous names are mentioned. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will finally cancel the most evil, deranged, and dangerous psychopaths in the country. All of that on the way.

      <title>Ep. 532 - The Mask Wars Are Incredibly Stupid</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the mask wars are driving people insane. But the mask issue should not be ideological, and does not need to be a battleground in the culture war. Today I hope to inject a little bit of basic common sense into the mask debate. Also Five Headlines including crazed Taylor Swift fans doxxing a music reviewer who didn’t like Swift’s album enough. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will preemptively cancel the false narrative around the latest video of a man dying in police custody.

      <title>Ep. 531 - Teachers Are Too Afraid To Go Back To Work, Not Too Afraid To Protest</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, teachers around the country are claiming that going back to school would be a “death sentence.” Yet many of them are out protesting in large crowds. It’s almost as if their “fear” of returning to work is performative and fake. Also Five Headlines including, speaking of teachers, a teacher who specializes in helping children with emotional needs, now arrested for assaulting a state senator at a protest. And in our Daily Cancellation we will cancel everyone who is claiming that police arresting suspects are “kidnapping.”

      <title>Ep. 529 - The Protesters Are Drunk On Their Own Sense Of Entitlement</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a generation of spoiled entitled brats have decided that they're actually oppressed, and that's why we've seen this chaos in our streets for the past two months. But normal law abiding Americans are finally getting sick of it and responding in kind. It's only going to get uglier from here. Also Five Headlines including confirmation that space aliens exist and they have visited Earth. And somehow no one cares. And in our Daily Cancellation we cancel Netflix for pushing the harmful, insane myth of "transgender children."

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are told that many unarmed black men are being murdered by police. But this claim is extremely misleading on multiple levels. I’ll give you the real facts today. Also Five Headlines including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez having a temper tantrum on the House floor because someone called her a mean name. And in our Daily Cancellation we’ll cancel the football team in Washington. They got rid of “Redskins” but replaced it with a name even more offensive than the old one.

Also Five Headlines including the BLM supporter who is pictured kneeling on the neck of a toddler.

Also Five Headlines including the continued blood bath in Chicago and the Left’s latest discovery that BMI — the body mass index — is actually racist. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will be canceling the Trump campaign. I’ll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 525 - Tucker, Hannity Targeted With The Most Frivolous Harassment Allegations Yet</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the latest Me Too allegations against Fox, including Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, are perhaps the most frivolous harassment claims we’ve heard yet. Also Five Headlines including George Stephanapolous’s wife saying that she would watch porn with her adolescent daughters. And in our Daily Cancelation, we discuss the unnamed woman who got naked for the cops at a Portland protest. Something tells me this would be received much differently if the naked woman was a dude.

      <title>Ep. 524 - Public School Teachers Insist That Public School Is Not Essential. They’re Right.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Democrats, the media, and many public school teachers are now in effect arguing that public school is inessential and expendable. I agree with them and I think we should take them at their word. Also Five Headlines including Kanye’s powerful pro-life plea. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will discuss whether a black woman doing Irish dance should get an exemption from the “cultural appropriation” charge.

      <title>Ep. 523 - The Myth Of Systemic Racism</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are told America is a systemically racist country. But the facts don’t support that claim. And today I want to talk about the one fact that most contradicts the systemic racism theory. Also Five Headlines including the Left’s freak out because the federal government is finally starting to come down on the Antifa terrorists. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the story of a great and loving father who beat the hell out of his daughter’s molester, and is now under arrest.

      <title>Ep. 522 - The Only Acceptable Form Of Racism In America</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the professed bigot Nick Cannon has helpfully demonstrated not only what racism actually is and what it sounds like, but what form of racism is still acceptable in society. Also Five Headlines including the heroic young boy who rescued his sister from a dog attack and paid the price. We all can learn something from this kid. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss an article on the African American History Museum’s website which says that objectivity, politeness, and science are hallmarks of white culture. Sounds pretty white supremacist to me.

      <title>Ep. 521 - Cowardice Fuels The Cancel Culture</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the cancel culture mob feeds on cowardice. The more that people cowardly bow to it, the more it will grow in size and strength. We’ll talk about some very recent examples of egregious cowardice in the face of the mob. Also Five Headlines including an alleged “rape” case at a university that proves what a sham that consent rules are. And today in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the blatantly racist anti-white comments made by the bigot Nick Cannon.

But the actual facts about the virus make it clear that schools can and should be re-opened. Also Five Headlines including Bill De Blasio fretting over his BLM mural while babies are shot dead in the street. And today for our Daily Cancellation, long overdue, I will be canceling mommy bloggers.

      <title>Ep. 519 - The Left Introduces The Racial Version Of 'Believe All Women'</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, believe all women has been reborn, except now it has been racialized. Before we were told that we must believe any woman who claims she was sexually assaulted or harassed. Now we are told that we must believe any non-white person who claims they were the victim of racism. But this idea is just as dangerous and irrational as “believe all women.” Also Five Headlines, including a true American hero who stood up against two women hectoring him over not wearing a mask. You have to see the video. And in our daily cancellation, I cancel the makers of a children’s toy, for causing me life threatening injuries.

      <title>Ep. 518 - Tearing Down Statues Of Heroes, Putting Up Murals Of George Floyd</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, statues of historical heroes are going down while murals and memorials to George Floyd go up. But if we’re having “difficult conversations” about the sins of the dead people we choose to honor, isn’t it time that Floyd is given the same scrutiny? Also Five Headlines and in our Daily Cancellation I finally cancel, once and for all, the entire country of Canada.

      <title>Ep. 517 - The One And Only Way To Defeat Cancel Culture</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a bunch of liberal academics have signed a letter speaking out against cancel culture. Most everyone else on the Left is furious about the letter. But letters and respectful dialogue aren’t going to put a stop to the madness. There is a solution to cancel culture, but it’s not for the faint of heart. I’ll explain what it is. Also Five Headlines and our Daily Cancellation.

      <title>Ep. 516 - Your Oppression Is Imaginary</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the country is being ripped to shreds and dismantled by people who claim they are the victims of oppression and persecution. But the oppression is imaginary. Their claims are verifiably and obviously false. So why is this really happening? Why is our society, which is freer and richer than any other society that has ever existed, coming apart at the seams? I want to spend this show analyzing these questions.

      <title>Ep. 515 - The BLM Fraud</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Black Lives Matter is a far left political group with far left political goals. It is not concerned at all with preserving black life. Also Five Headlines including mentally unbalanced college students saying they are too traumatized to return to school because someone tweeted a joke about George Floyd. And some Jimmy John’s employees were fired for making a “racist” video. The only problem is that there is nothing racist in the video at all.

      <title>Ep. 514 - Was America Built On "Stolen Land"? It's Not Nearly That Simple</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left now says Mount Rushmore has to go because it was carved on stolen land. But the reality isn’t nearly as simple as that. In fact, the whole narrative of white settlers “stealing land” isn’t that simple. We’ll try to inject some historical context into this discussion today. Also Five Headlines including the bloodbath in our cities over the weekend. Where is Black Lives Matter? And an education council meeting in New York descends into leftist insanity.

      <title>Ep. 512 - We Need Law And Order, Not "Police Reform"</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Republicans are trying to appease the Left with “police reform” measures, but I have an idea for different reforms that should be our priority before we talk about reforming the police. Also Five Headlines including the Michigan prosecutor who still has not arrested and charged the man who brutally assaulted a Macy’s employee on camera. And we’ll also discuss a video of a white protester trying to explain racism to black police officers. It doesn’t go well for her.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Republicans are trying to appease the Left with “police reform” measures, but I have an idea for different reforms that should be our priority before we talk about reforming the police. Also Five Headlines including the Michigan prosecutor who still has not arrested and charged the man who brutally assaulted a Macy’s employee on camera. And we’ll also discuss a video of a white protester trying to explain racism to black police officers. It doesn’t go well for her.

      <title>Ep. 511 - The Noose That Wasn’t</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it wasn’t a noose as any intelligent person already knew. But still the Left, the media, and Bubba Wallace are trying to hang onto the narrative even as it’s exposed as fraudulent. We’ll sort through this today. And I want to pay special attention to the fact that the FBI sent 15 federal agents to investigate a rope. Also Five Headlines including “protesters” tearing down a statue of an abolitionist. Why? I’ll explain the real reason why all of these statues are coming down.

      <title>Ep. 510 - A Rash Of Attacks Against White People. None Are Called Hate Crimes.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, there has been a slew of assaults against white people recently. The media doesn’t care and the crimes aren’t being charged as hate crimes. Why not? We’ll discuss today. Also Five Headlines including NASCAR coming out fully in support of the black driver who says someone left a noose in his garage. But there are several strange aspects to this story. Is it a hoax? We’ll talk about it. And finally in today’s cancellation, I’m cancelling the Karen meme.

      <title>Ep. 509 - Macy’s Employee Brutalized. Media Doesn’t Care Because He’s White.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a Macy’s employee was viciously assaulted on camera in a racially motivated attack. But you haven’t heard about it because the victim was white. Also Five Headlines, including a male transgender fighter bragging about how much he “enjoyed” fracturing the skull of a female fighter. Plus, Teddy Roosevelt is the latest historical figure to lose a statue. And in today’s Daily Cancellation, we’ll cancel Brett Favre for calling Kaepernick a “hero,” and comparing him to Pat Tillman (who died serving his country).

      <title>Ep. 508 - The White Privilege Myth</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are told that all white people are the beneficiaries of privilege. But I have some examples of white people that would appear to have no privilege at all of any kind. That’s because our notion of privilege is too simplistic and literally black and white. Also Five Headlines and today in our Daily Cancellation, I cancel the mayor of Oakland for claiming that a swing in a playground is a hate crime.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, in one of the worst injustices we’ve seen in recent memory, the officer who shot Rayshard Brooks in self-defense is being charged with murder. We’ll talk about this case and why the charges are insane. Also, the media is attempting to make a saint out of Brooks, so we’re going to discuss the actual truth about this man. Also Five Headlines. And in our Daily Cancellation, in honor of my birthday, I will be canceling cake. Just hear me out on this.

      <title>Ep. 506 - Democrat Senator Thinks America Invented Slavery. We Didn't. Not Even Close.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a Democrat senator claims that the United States invented slavery. This seems to be a common view among leftists. It’s nonsense of course. An honest look at history shows that white people certainly don’t carry unique guilt for the sin of slavery. Today we’ll take that honest look. Also Five Headlines including a vicious assault on an elderly woman by a man who has been arrested up to 100 times already in the past. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’ll be canceling the public apology.

      <title>Ep. 505 - Law And Order Is Officially Dead</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are told that an armed right wing militia member shot a “protester” who was trying to tear down a statue. But there is a lot more to this story, and it shows how law and order is dead in our country. We’ll talk about that. Also Five Headlines including the Left’s attempts to cancel a man because they don’t like the shirt he wore while fishing. And the Supreme Court magically discovered transgenderism in the Civil Rights Act.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are told that an armed right wing militia member shot a “protester” who was trying to tear down a statue. But there is a lot more to this story, and it shows how law and order is dead in our country. We’ll talk about that. Also Five Headlines including the Left’s attempts to cancel a man because they don’t like the shirt he wore while fishing.

      <title>Ep. 504 - Atlanta Riots Over Justified Police Shooting Of An Armed, Violent Man</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, another police shooting has sparked protests. But while the Left, Democrats, and protesters put all the blame on the police officer as usual, I think we need to start asking some questions about the personal responsibility of the suspects in these situations. Are they not responsible for their own behavior? Also Five Headlines including a “Black Trans Lives Matter” protest over the weekend. What was the point of this protest and why was it needed? It wasn’t needed, and I’ll explain why. Plus our Daily Cancellation and much more.

      <title>Ep. 503 - The United States Of America No Longer Exists</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, years ago I wrote that the United States of America no longer exists. Sadly, recent events have only proven my point. We are not united and that is not going to change anytime soon. Also Five Headlines including insurrectionists taking over Seattle and now trying their hands at building a self-sustaining commune in the middle of the city. It’s going about as well as you’d expect. And later we’re going to play a new game I invented called the Cringe Challenge. It’s a difficult game, and the winner loses.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are told the privilege in this country is reserved for white people, especially white males. But I think the real privilege in our modern culture is leftist privilege. I’ll explain why. Also Five Headlines including the mob coming to cancel cartoon dogs, and Ilhan Omar claiming that she is oppressed, despite being one of the most powerful women in the country. Plus our Daily Cancellation and more.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, I want to talk about a story from Stalin’s Soviet Russia that seems harrowingly relevant today. Also Five Headlines including the rampaging mob tearing down a statue of Christopher Columbus and HBO banning “Gone With The Wind” because it isn’t racially enlightened enough. We have officially entered the book burning phase of our societal collapse. And today in our Daily Cancellation, sadly, my wife must be canceled again, for the fifth time. You will be truly horrified and outraged when you hear what she did.

      <title>Ep. 498 - Leftism Is A Religion Of Self-Loathing</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, leftism is a religion of self-loathing. That has been made clear this week as white people across the country have gone out of their way to announce and advertise their white guilt. But the self-loathing goes way beyond race. Also Five Headlines including AG Barr revealing Antifa’s role in the riots. And in our Daily Cancellation, we cancel a maniac who went on CNN to announce that white children “don’t deserve innocence.”

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, leftism is a religion of self-loathing. That has been made clear this week as white people across the country have gone out of their way to announce and advertise their white guilt. But the self-loathing goes way beyond race. Also Five Headlines including AG Barr revealing Antifa’s role in the riots. And in our Daily Cancellation, we cancel a maniac who went on CNN to announce that white children “don’t deserve innocence.”

      <title>Ep. 497 - The Protesters Are Killing My Grandma</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the same people who fearmongered about the coronavirus for months are now applauding and celebrating mass protests. So were they lying about the virus, or are they okay with protesters infecting themselves and others with a deadly virus? Which is it? Also, Five Headlines, including Drew Brees apologizing for saying we should respect the flag. And in our Daily Cancellation, I address yet another false narrative that has been spread widely online.

      <title>Ep. 496 - If This Is What A Peaceful Protest Looks Like, What Is A Non-Peaceful Protest?</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, many people, even conservatives, are claiming that the protests are “mostly peaceful” and they have an “important message.” I think both of these claims are delusional. I’ll explain why. Also, Five Headlines, including the retired police captain who was gunned down by rioters in St. Louis. The victim is a black man. Does his life matter? Plus our Daily Cancellation and more.

      <title>Ep. 495 - The "Racist Police" Narrative Is False</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are told that racist cops are out hunting and killing black people. But is this narrative true? Is there any actual evidence for it? Today we will look at the evidence and see where it points. Also Five Headlines, including a CNN “journalist” going to desperate extremes to justify rioting and looting. And in our Daily Cancellation, I cancel the FBI. I’ll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 494 - The Rioters Aren't "Protesters." They're Violent, Nihilistic, Scumbags.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the country is in flames. Many in the media and on the Left have insisted that we must sympathize with the people setting the fires. But the attempt to justify and romanticize looting and arson is morally deranged. I will speak some plain truths about the issue today. Also Five Headlines including celebrities helping to fund and support the destruction of poor minority neighborhoods. Finally, I thought it was dangerous to protest during a pandemic? Isn’t that what the media spent three months insisting? What happened to all of that?

Also, James Fairbanks confessed to a murder, but there’s precedent to support letting him go home.

      <title>Ep. 490 - NYT Claims "Believe All Women" Is A Right Wing Conspiracy</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an article in the New York Times now claims that feminists never said “Believe All Women.” That was a devious right-wing trick, apparently. Also Five Headlines, including the extraordinary, not to mention counter-productive and stupid, measures some businesses and people are putting into place ostensibly to offer protection from the coronavirus. And in our Daily Cancellation, the time has finally come to cancel the UN. I’ll explain why.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, some states are coming out of lockdowns while others are extending them for no medically justifiable reason. What’s one thing the extension states have in common? They’re run by Democrats. What does that tell us? Also, Five Headlines, including NASA’s plan to intentionally create a meteor shower and CNN bringing Greta Thunberg onto their “expert” coronavirus panel. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will finally be cancelling the hero worship of nurses.

      <title>Ep. 486 - The Curve Is Flattened But The Goalposts Have Moved</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the goalposts have shifted in a massive way. Originally they told us we were locking down to “flatten the curve.” Now it seems they want us to stay inside until nobody is dying from COVID-19 anymore, which is insane. Also Five Headlines including The Price Is Right raising money for baby butchers. And in our Daily Cancellation we will cancel a New York Times writer who thinks that the sport of running somehow discriminates against black people.

      <title>Ep. 484 - Don't Listen To The Media. Andrew Cuomo Has Done A Terrible Job.</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a lot to discuss. First, we’ll talk about the media’s love affair with Andrew Cuomo. He’s being painted as the hero of the pandemic, but the reality is closer to the opposite. Also, some girls are suing to prevent boys from competing in girl’s sports. But the judge has instructed their lawyers that biological boys must be referred to as “female” in his courtroom. We’ll discuss that insanity. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’ll cancel a NYT writer who thinks mothers should be getting paid to be mothers.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a lot to discuss. First, we’ll talk about the media’s love affair with Andrew Cuomo. He’s being painted as the hero of the pandemic, but the reality is closer to the opposite. Also, some girls are suing to prevent boys from competing in girl’s sports. But the judge has instructed their lawyers that biological boys must be referred to as “female” in his courtroom. We’ll discuss that insanity. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’ll cancel a NYT writer who thinks mothers should be getting paid to be mothers.</p><p><br></p><p>If you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Ep. 483 - If You're Still Scared, Stay Home. The Rest Of Us Will Get Back To Our Lives</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media claims that many Americans still don’t want to leave their homes and get back to their lives. If that’s true, fine. That’s why I propose that everyone who wants to go back to work and their lives should be allowed to. If you want to stay home, you can. What’s the problem? Also Five Headlines including the arrest of the two men who shot Ahmaud Arbery. And in our Daily Cancellation, I cancel a news channel that shamed a man for the crime of operating his ice cream truck.

      <title>Ep. 482 - It's Your Job To Pay For Your Own Birth Control</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Supreme Court will once again decide whether religious employers should be allowed to decline contraception coverage. The Left is screeching that there’s a plot afoot to steal women’s birth control. We’ll talk about why those claims are absurd. Also, a video of a man being shot in Georgia has provoked very strong reactions. We’ll try to sort through the situation and get to the truth. And finally, I’ll pass along some helpful gift ideas for Mother’s Day.

      <title>Ep. 481 - The Cost Of The Government's Failure To Protect Nursing Homes</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a huge portion of COVID deaths across the world have been in nursing homes. So why didn’t the government focus especially on protecting those vulnerable groups rather than shutting down all of society? And why did New York actually force nursing homes to take coronavirus patients? We’ll talk about that today. Also Five Headlines including a heroic salon owner who now faces jail time for refusing to close her business.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, gay activists campaigned against a Christian field hospital that was treating coronavirus patients in New York. They apparently succeeded in having the hospital shut down. We’ll talk about the incredible arrogance, pettiness, and bigotry of left wing gay activists. Also Five Headlines including a video of NYPD officers making a violent social distancing arrest. And finally, many musical artists have released coronavirus-themed songs in the last month. Today we will listen to some of the songs and rate them.

And in our Daily Cancellation, I must cancel my own child. I hate to do it, but I have no choice.

      <title>Ep. 478 - The World Health Organization Preys On Children</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden finally addresses the rape allegations against him, and it goes about as well as you expected. Also, many leftists were mad at Trump for defunding the World Health Organization, but today I want to talk about a good reason to defund WHO that has nothing to do with the coronavirus. In fact, the organization has been for many years a leading advocate for sexualizing and grooming children with radical "sex ed" courses. Also Five Headlines, and in today’s Daily Cancellation I finally cancel feminism. Long overdue.

      <title>Ep. 476 - A Fake Reopening</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, don’t be fooled by the “re-opening” that’s happening in many states. It’s not a real re-opening. I’ll explain what’s actually going on. And Five Headlines including Stacey Abrams defending an accused rapist and a Bishop claiming that “God doesn’t punish.” And in our Daily Cancellation, I deliver perhaps the most well deserved cancellation yet.

      <title>Ep. 475 - Criticize The Lockdown, Get Censored</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, two ER doctors committed the sin of criticizing the lockdowns and their video was removed from YouTube because of it. We’ll talk about the effort to censor anyone who doesn’t toe the party line on the coronavirus. Also, Five Headlines, including newly released footage of alien spacecraft, and the Washington Post twists itself into knots to avoid reporting on the Biden sex assault allegations. And in our Daily Cancellation, I must once again cancel someone very close to me. I hate to do it, but it must be done.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, bombshell video surfaces, seeming to lend support to the sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden. Of course the media isn’t treating it like a bombshell, though. Also, Five Headlines, including a police sting operation to bust a couple of hairdressers. And in our Daily Cancellation, we cancel a CNN correspondent who wrote a letter to his newborn son to inform him that the Earth has been destroyed by climate change.

      <title>Ep. 473 - The Media Openly Roots Against America</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media continues to openly root against the United States, which is something they’ve been doing for decades, of course, but it’s been even more grotesque during this crisis. Also Five Headlines including a whole bunch of congressmen who need to be reported for not social distancing correctly. And today in our Daily Cancellation, I cancel everyone. It’s time. It needs to be done.

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://bit.ly/2z2j1NB. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <title>Ep. 472 - The Attack On Parental Rights</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an upcoming anti-homeschooling summit at Harvard will be moderated by a professor who believes that “the state confers legal parenthood.” He is not alone in this view. The anti-homeschool position is an anti-parental rights position. Also, Five Headlines, including Andrew Cuomo’s absolutely deranged defense of the lockdown policy. And in our Daily Cancellation, I must play for you, and discuss, possibly the most disturbing video footage you will ever see in your life.

Also, Five Headlines, including a mother arrested on a playground, and airlines coming up with a pretty horrifying way to reconfigure their seating arrangements in response to the coronavirus. Plus, the Daily Cancellation and your emails.

      <title>Ep. 470 - Don't Sneer At The Lockdown Protestors If You Still Have A Job</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the people protesting the lockdowns across the country have been called “selfish.” The interesting thing is that most of the people making that accusation still have jobs and incomes. Also, Five Headlines, including Trump’s immigration moratorium, and apparently fake fliers for an anti-lockdown protest meant to discredit the anti-lockdown movement. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, I have to once against cancel someone near and dear to me.

      <title>Ep. 467 - Saving Adults While Killing Children</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are told that the shutdowns are worth it because they are allegedly saving lives. In fact, we are told that even if “just one life is saved” that would be enough to justify the destruction of the economy. Well on that note, I know of one type of business we could shut down and save a million lives a year. Also, Five Headlines, including the governor of New Jersey admitting that he “didn’t think about the Bill of Rights” when crafting his stay at home order. And in our daily cancellation, we’ll examine the idea that only white people can be racist. Events in China would seem to contradict that claim.

      <title>Ep. 466 - Our Rights Are Essential</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, police in North Carolina broke up a peaceful protest and arrested protestors who had gone to the state capital to speak out against the governor’s shut down order. The police department explained that protesting “is not essential.” I very much disagree. I’ll explain why. Also, Five Headlines, including Attorney General Barr siding with churchgoers in Mississippi who were fined for attending a drive in service. And at the end of the show I want to tell you about the most incredible and inspiring email I’ve ever received from a reader. You’ll want to hear this story.

Also Five Headlines including CNN anchor Chris Cuomo making some interesting admissions about his job. And in our Daily Cancelation, the executive editor of the New York Times offers an absolutely ridiculous justification for why his paper treated the allegations against Biden so differently from the allegations against Kavanaugh.

      <title>Ep. 464 - Your Rights Are Suspended</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, religious liberty has been canceled for the foreseeable future. Or, as one police officer explained, your rights are “suspended.” But what makes us think the government will politely restore our rights once the pandemic is over? And is it a good idea to give it the power to suspend our rights in the first place? Also Five Headlines including the New York Times exonerating Joe Biden of sexual assault.

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <title>Ep. 463 - Bernie Finally Quits</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the ancient communist, Bernie Sanders, has dropped out of the race finally. He says he “won the ideological struggle,” which is clearly not the case. But will his ideology prevail in the future? And will these shutdowns ultimately move us towards becoming a more socialist country, or will they have the opposite effect? Also Five Headlines including the new unemployment numbers. They are ghastly. And today it brings me no pleasure, but I must cancel the pope.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, some of the mayors in major cities that are under lockdown have decided that they are allowed to break their own rules. Apparently, as Orwell wrote, some animals are more equal than others. Also Five Headlines including a dad being arrested in front of his six-year-old daughter for playing t-ball in a park. And today we cancel the media outlets that have decided to become propaganda arms for the Chinese government.

      <title>Ep. 461 - The One Size Fits All Fallacy</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media is pushing for a one size fits all approach to the coronavirus, but a few states have refused to issue stay at home orders and they prove why the one size fits all approach is foolish. Also Five Headlines including some of the most desperate and absurd fear mongering we’ve yet seen from the media. And today we cancel Alyssa Milano, who went from championing the Me Too movement to calling for due process for men. Guess what changed her mind?

      <title>Ep. 460 - The Police States Of America</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, America has become a collection of police states where the Bill of Rights is effectively nullified and citizens can get arrested or fined for engaging in activities that have no plausible chance of spreading the virus. Is all of this worth it for the possible reward of safety? Also today we cancel AOC for claiming that the virus is targeting minority populations because of racism. And I read emails from people who’ve had run-ins with law enforcement because of the stay-at-home orders.

      <title>Ep. 459 - Presidents Birx And Fauci</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Dr. Fauci has seemed to imply that the president should enact a national stay-at-home order, which of course would be wildly unconstitutional, not to mention redundant and useless. Meanwhile Dr. Birx is lecturing Americans for failing to follow her instructions. Are we giving too much power and trust to the medical experts? Also, Five Headlines, including new recommendations that we “socially distance” from our own families at home. And today I have the distinct honor and privilege of canceling Mayor Bill de Blasio.

      <title>Ep. 457 - How We Are Setting A Precedent For Future Democratic Administrations To Exploit</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, with the government seizing unprecedented power in the name of a “national emergency” and a threat to “public health,” we must consider what might happen when the next Democratic president gets into office and decides that, for example, climate change is a national health emergency. Also, Five Headlines, including medical experts saying “Oops, turns out masks are actually pretty effective,” after weeks of saying the opposite. And today we cancel a school principal who warned parents that they should not attempt to teach their own kids during quarantine. Plus, a whole bunch of people write to tell me why I’m wrong to object to the government arresting pastors who hold worship services.

      <title>Ep. 454 - Time To Hold Joe 'Believe All Women' Biden To His Own Standard</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden has been, as the media would say if it was a Republican, 'credibly accused' of sexual assault. The media and the Me Too movement have tried to ignore this. But Joe Biden is on the record saying we should believe women. Shouldn't we hold him to his own standard? Also, Five Headlines, including the media celebrating over the fact that the US supposedly has the most coronavirus cases of any country in the world. But there's a big problem with that stat. And today we cancel a police department for trying to turn a 'Black Mirror' plot line into real life.

      <title>Ep. 453 - Pro-Abortion Governors Pretend To Believe Life Is Precious</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, government officials are justifying their draconian lockdowns by saying “life is precious” and it’s all worth it “just to save one life.” But many of these officials are Democrats and therefore pro-abortion. There seems to be a disconnect here. Also, Five Headlines, including the official jobless numbers from last week. They are historically bad, and that’s an understatement. Plus our Daily Cancellation and an email from someone who wants to tell me why I’m wrong about the arguments I presented on my show yesterday.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, government officials are justifying their draconian lockdowns by saying “life is precious” and it’s all worth it “just to save one life.” But many of these officials are Democrats and therefore pro-abortion. There seems to be a disconnect here. Also, Five Headlines, including the official jobless numbers from last week. They are historically bad, and that’s an understatement. Plus our Daily Cancellation and an email from someone who wants to tell me why I’m wrong about the arguments I presented on my show yesterday.

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <title>Ep. 452 - The Media Misses Trump's Point, Episode 98,618,012</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, President Trump yesterday compared the coronavirus to car accidents. He’s been mocked and derided for this comparison, but I think people are missing the very important ethical point that Trump was trying to make. We’ll take a deep dive into it today. Also, Five Headlines, including Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden both babbling nonsensically during TV interviews about the virus. And today we’ll cancel a feminist lawmaker who thinks the coronavirus is a weapon of the patriarchy.

      <title>Ep. 451 - Destroying The Economy Is Not A Good Way To Save Lives</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, many of us are worried that our current lockdown strategy is leading us quickly into an economic collapse unlike anything this country has ever seen. But the left wing media says if you’re worried about the economy in a time like this, then you are a heartless Scrooge putting money over people. That’s nonsense. Also Five Headlines including, for a change of pace, rather than toilet paper, an altercation in a supermarket over Mountain Dew. And a listener writes to explain why I’m wrong in advocating that we open the economy back up to avoid a depression.

      <title>Ep. 450 - When The Cure Is Worse Than The Disease</title>
      <description>As the economy teeters on the brink of collapse, and many Americans are already finding themselves having to choose between paying their mortgage or feeding their kids, some government officials are hinting that the shut downs might last many more weeks. President Trump, on the other hand, is suggesting that we should get the economy going again soon. I think Trump is on the right path here. And I'd like to talk about what opening up the economy again could look like, and what steps we might take in order to protect the vulnerable as we get back to our lives. Also, Five Headlines, including Madonna’s insightful video, shot from her bathtub. And in our Daily Cancellation, I cancel yet another media outlet for maybe the most egregious fear mongering headline we’ve yet seen.

Instead we get vague platitudes while lives are destroyed. Meanwhile, some members of Congress have been dumping stocks based on information they receive in private briefings. How can we trust these people and their decision to lock down the whole economy? Plus Five Headlines. I will attempt to find five that have nothing to do with the China Virus.

      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, some are claiming that Trump's plan to send stimulus checks to Americans is "socialism" or "welfare." It is neither of those things. I'll explain why. Also, the media has performed shamefully and stupidly during this crisis. This raises the question: in the Age of Disinformation, how can we know who to trust? Also, Five Headlines including the cringiest cringe-fest of a video you'll ever see. And in today's Daily Cancellation, I am, with great trepidation, canceling my wife. I'll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 447 - The Ethical Dilemma Of The China Virus Response</title>
      <description>Today on the show, I have a question that deals with the ethical issues tied up in the response to the China Virus. Lots of people think the response is overblown and will do more harm than good. They might be right. Which is why I hope this question might help clarify things. Also, Five Headlines, including some expert medical advice from the esteemed scholar and thinker Vanessa Hudgens. And the Philadelphia police department has officially canceled itself. 

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <title>Ep. 446 - Let’s Stay Quarantined Forever</title>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show: People fear that staying inside for a few weeks, educating their own kids, and eating dinner at home will destroy our economy. Perhaps it will, but what does that say about our system? Is it time to rethink some things on a fundamental level? Also, Five Headlines, including Tom Brady leaving the Patriots to deflate footballs elsewhere. And Bernie Sanders supporters are whining about voter suppression. But is voter suppression real? And if it is, is it bad?

This makes it hard for people to know who to trust and where to go for information. We'll try to sort through that fog today. Also, Five Headlines, including the grumpy old men debate last night. And a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate was busted with drugs and a male escort. Will this hurt or help his political future in the Democratic Party?

      <title>Ep. 444 - Incompetence And Partisanship In The Midst Of A Pandemic</title>
      <description>Today on the show, we’re in the midst of a global pandemic and the bad news is that our elected leaders do not seem interested in or capable of leading us through this. Also, Five Headlines, including a vile product that was being sold by Amazon. It's off the site now, but the fact that it was ever sold in the first place should tell us something. And handshakes have been canceled for the foreseeable future. But what greeting should take its place? We'll sort through that important issue today.

      <title> Ep. 442 - Pornhub Facilitates The Corruption And Abuse Of Children</title>
      <description>Today on the show, the world's largest porn site, Pornhub, exposes millions of young kids to hardcore porn. It makes no attempt to verify the ages of its users. Should it be required to? Also Five Headlines, including Biden's big wins last night, and Biden nearly getting into a fist fight with a voter who questioned him on gun rights. And in our Daily Cancellation, AOC says it's racist to avoid Chinese restaurants because of the coronavirus. This claim is stupid for about five different reasons. We'll explore them all.

Should it be required to? Also Five Headlines, including Biden's big wins last night, and Biden nearly getting into a fist fight with a voter who questioned him on gun rights. And in our Daily Cancellation, AOC says it's racist to avoid Chinese restaurants because of the coronavirus. This claim is stupid for about five different reasons.

      <title>Ep. 441 - The Extraordinary Cowardice Of Left Wing Campus Protestors</title>
      <description>Today on the show, I'll talk about my experience at the University of Maryland last night. Leftists protested the talk and handed out pamphlets encouraging people to stay away. How has our university system turned students into such intellectual cowards? We'll discuss. Also, five headlines including the attempt by thousands of people to have Pornhub shut down. Are they in the right? And Andrew writes in to tell me why I'm wrong about my stance on gay marriage.

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <title>Ep. 439 - The Reward For Selling Your Soul</title>
      <description>An actress brags that killing her child enabled her to have a career. But the fact that she traded in her child and her soul for a career on the D-list only shows how foolish and tragic the pro-abortion mentality is. Also, five headlines including the supposedly controversial execution of a man convicted of killing three police officers even though he didn't pull the trigger. And today I cancel MSNBC for what is perhaps the stupidest segment ever to be aired on cable news.

      <description>Abortion enthusiasts were shouting, ranting, and threatening at the Supreme Court yesterday.

Or is the problem that most people don't want a socialist to be president? Plus, five headlines, and we discuss what is perhaps the most damning footage of a politician ever to be released to the public.

      <title>Ep. 436 - The Left's Bastardization And Degradation Of Faith</title>
      <description>On one hand, the Left tries to appropriate faith and bastardize it for their own ends. On the other, they degrade and mock it. These two strategies seem to contradict. Also today we'll go through five headlines, including one of the best questions I've ever heard anyone ask at a town hall. And some emailers attempt to explain why I'm wrong.

      <title>Ep. 435 - The Collapse Of Western Civilization In Two Viral Videos</title>
      <description>Two viral videos provide more evidence that western civilization is in rapid decline. One shows a woman giggling and smiling as she goes into a Planned Parenthood to kill her child. The other shows a drag queen dancing suggestively for a young girl as her parents look on and applaud. We'll discuss all of this. Also, coronavirus news, election news, and California's heroic efforts to battle gender segregated toy stores.

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <title>Ep. 434 - The Criminalization of Childhood</title>
      <description>A 6 year old girl was cuffed, arrested, and charged with criminal assault for having a tantrum at school. This is part of a trend where childhood misbehavior is treated as a criminal matter. Meanwhile, other childhood behaviors are treated as symptoms of mental illness. Why are we doing this to our kids? Plus, Elizabeth Warren says the best way to fight a pandemic is to open our borders. And the House has just made lynching illegal. But wasn't it already illegal?

      <title>Ep. 433 - Billionaires And Millionaires Gather For A Debate</title>
      <description>Another embarrassing Democratic debate last night. We'll discuss the lowlights. Also, isn't it interesting that the party of progress and inclusion put on a debate featuring two billionaires, three millionaires, three people over 70, only one person under 50, and no minorities? And, speaking of embarrassing, the Democrats blocked a bill yesterday that would have required abortion clinics to provide basic medical care to infants born alive after abortion.

      <title>Ep. 432 - Church of Cowards</title>
      <description>I'll discuss my book "Church of Cowards," which was released today. Complacency and cowardice are destroying the church in the West, but what can we do about it? Also, the student debt crisis will be one of the central issues of the 2020 election. But one of the groups most responsible for driving the crisis has mostly escaped the public's wrath. And we'll go over 5 other news stories worth knowing about, plus today I have to cancel a surprising person.

      <title>Ep. 431 - Can Bernie Win?</title>
      <description>Bernie Sanders is probably going to be the nominee. On the surface, this seems like great news for Trump. But I have a word of caution for conservatives who think Bernie has no shot of winning. Also, Pete Buttigieg pulls one of the creepiest and most tasteless political stunts I've ever seen. And I'll explain why Clint Eastwood is officially canceled.

      <title>Ep. 430 - Lie Or Be Fired</title>
      <description>A college professor is now being told that he must use female pronouns to refer to a male student or be fired. The court says that this requirement does not infringe on free speech. Of course it does. We'll discuss. Also, a video of a bullied child has gone viral. But I have a question: what kind of parent takes a video of their child's emotional trauma and posts it online?

      <title>Ep. 429 - The Biggest Loser</title>
      <description>Conventional wisdom says Bloomberg was the debate's biggest loser. I think he was only the second biggest. The real loser was Bernie Sanders, who is such a weak and vulnerable candidate that even Bloomberg landed a shot on him. Also, if "consent" is all that matters then what exactly is wrong with incest and polygamy? And AOC says billionaires shouldn't exist. Shouldn't we be creeped out to hear agents of the state say that certain types of people shouldn't exist?

      <title>Ep. 427 - Modern Eugenics</title>
      <description>Richard Dawkins provoked outrage by saying eugenics would be effective. But why should anyone who supports abortion be upset by such a statement? Planned Parenthood has been engaged in a eugenics program for decades. Also, is it possible to win the presidency in modern American without a personality cult supporting you? And "drag kid" Desmond continues to be abused and exploited in public, for all to see, while the Left applauds.

      <title>Ep. 426 - The Absurdity Of The Equal Rights Amendment</title>
      <description>Democrats in Congress are trying to revive the Equal Rights Amendment, which supposedly will guarantee equal rights for women in America. The problem is that women already have equal rights, so what will this amendment really do? We'll talk about it. Also, are people who recline their seats on airplanes sociopaths? We discuss. And I answer emails from some listeners who think I'm a bad Christian for saying that we should teach our children to fight back against bullies.

      <title>Ep. 425 - Bad Parenting And 'Transgender' Children</title>
      <description>Former NBA star Dwyane Wade wants us to admire his good parenting because he's allowing his son to become his daughter. But this is precisely the opposite of good parenting, to put it mildly. Also, are Dems really on the verge of nominating an 80 year old communist? And should we teach our kids to fight fire with fire against bullies, or "be the bigger person"?

      <title>Ep. 423 - The Incredible Heroism Of Hollywood</title>
      <description>Hollywood's moral heroism was on display at the Oscars last night. The whole world was inspired, as always. Also, Joe Biden releases the most tone deaf ad of the campaign season. And is it still too early to talk about Kobe's rape case? Lots of people seem to think so.

      <title>Matt's Podcast Pick - The Cold War: What We Saw</title>
      <description>The Berlin Airlift. The Korean War. The Cuban Missile Crisis. The Space Race. Vietnam. Detente. Reagan. Solidarity. Gorbachev. The tales of these earth-shaking milestones have been always been told as a series of individual events, completely apart from each other. But they were not individual events; they were individual threads in the tapestry of the Apocalypse That Didn’t Happen. And because they were all part of the same ongoing story, they need to be treated that way. Check out the new 12-part podcast series, "The Cold War: What We Saw." Available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and anywhere you listen to podcasts!

      <title>Ep. 422 - The Barbaric Extremism Of The Democratic Party</title>
      <description>Pete Buttigieg was given the opportunity to come out against killing fully developed infants moments before birth, but declined. He is a coward and an extremist. Just like the rest of the Democratic field. Also, AOC says it's impossible to "pull yourself up by the bootstraps." Interesting point coming from a bartender-turned-congresswoman. And David Hogg continues to be brainwashed by his college education. It's a fascinating process to watch.

      <title>Ep. 420 - The Rip Heard Round The World</title>
      <description>Trump delivered a magnificent speech last night packed with made-to-go-viral moments. He also spoke about life and faith issues in a way that most other Republicans wouldn't dare. This should be our focus today, but instead everyone is talking about Nancy Pelosi tearing up the speech afterwards. I'll explain why Pelosi's stunt, while petulant and childish, may have been a brilliant political move. Also, a straight woman "politically opposed to heterosexuality" writes to Slate asking for advice. And I'll answer your emails.

Also, an exciting new business venture gives you the chance to pay two women $2,500 to tell you that you're racist. And a dangerous sociopath is released from prison only 11 months after causing someone's death. Is this another example of female privilege?

      <title>Ep. 418 - Feminists Celebrate Empowering Strip Tease</title>
      <description>Jennifer Lopez flashed her crotch and danced on a stripper pole during the Super Bowl. Feminists have hailed the performance as empowering and liberating, but I'm not sure that description quite fits. Also, is it crazy to suggest that maybe the Super Bowl should be appropriate for the whole family? And in other Super Bowl news, multi-millionaire couple Beyonce and Jay Z sit during the Anthem, which makes sense because they have been treated so badly by this country.

      <title>Ep. 417 - Fighting The Coronavirus With Diversity And Tolerance</title>
      <description>As the gap between parody and reality narrows more and more each day, CNN complains that Trump's coronavirus task force lacks diversity. Also, a billionaire is donating millions to fight the disease and Gizmodo has found a reason to complain about that. Plus, we talk about an Orwellian brainwashing session at a pre-school in New York. And we continue the debate over spanking.

      <title>Ep. 415 - The Staff Of Color</title>
      <description>Pete Buttigieg, the most spiteful and divisive man in politics, recently sent a memo to his "staff of color" soliciting complaints about their white colleagues. We'll talk about why this is one of the more racist things an American politician has done in recent years. Also prosperity televangelist Paula White, President Trump's spiritual advisor, prays for "miscarriages" (though she says she was taken out of context) and sends curses upon aquatic demons in "the marine kingdom." And finally we'll discuss the refreshingly wholesome #girldad trend on social media.

      <title>Ep. 414 - CNN Makes Campaign Ad For Trump</title>
      <description>CNN aired a segment ruthlessly mocking Trump supporters as a bunch of illiterate rednecks. This of course is disgraceful bigotry, but it's great news for Donald Trump. CNN seems intent on doing everything it can to get him reelected. Also, Stephen King continues his apology tour after committing the sin of saying that art should be judged on quality and not on the race of the person who produced the art. And a female CEO argues that sports talk should be banished from the workplace so as to be more inclusive of women.

      <title>Ep. 413 - The Significance Of Celebrity Deaths</title>
      <description>NBA legend Kobe Bryant is dead at the age of 41. Today we'll talk about why celebrity deaths tend to hit us so hard. Also, some especially disgraceful people in the media decided that Kobe's death was a good time to start talking about his rape case 15 years ago. And Joe Biden declared that "transgender equality" is the "civil rights issue of our time." Biden is nearly 80 years old and just now decided that men are women. What explains this radical change?

      <title>Ep. 411 - A Major Milestone</title>
      <description>President Trump will become the first president to address the March For Life in person. It's great that he's doing this, but it also highlights the cowardice of previous Republican presidents, who preferred to hide in the White House rather than come outside and acknowledge the pro-life movement. But as significant as this moment will be, there is something far more significant Trump could do: defund Planned Parenthood. Also, are stay-at-home moms engaged in a white supremacist conspiracy?

      <itunes:summary>President Trump will become the first president to address the March For Life in person. It's great that he's doing this, but it also highlights the cowardice of previous Republican presidents, who preferred to hide in the White House rather than come outside and acknowledge the pro-life movement. But as significant as this moment will be, there is something far more significant Trump could do: defund Planned Parenthood. Also, are stay-at-home moms engaged in a white supremacist conspiracy? That's the theory put forward by a PhD student. We'll discuss.

      <title>Ep. 410 - AOC's Cartoon Version Of Reality</title>
      <description>Today we'll discuss the Left's cartoonish demonization of "the rich." And we'll also talk about the Right's response to that demonization, which is to present a sometimes equally cartoonish narrative about the free market. Somewhere in the midst of all of this oversimplification is the truth. Also, speaking of cartoonish ideas, a gay media outlet has dubbed a male trans MMA fighter "the bravest athlete in history" for beating up a bunch of women.

      <description>Democrats and the media were pushing for violence at the gun rights rally but it didn't happen. Now Governor Ralph Northam owes an explanation as to why he declared a state of emergency. Also, AOC makes the most horrifyingly honest statement we've heard from a politician in quite some time. And why are we all addicted to social media? I have a theory.

      <title>Ep. 408 - Another Media Narrative Falls Apart</title>
      <description>Last week a story went viral about a girl getting expelled from a Christian school solely for having a rainbow cake on her birthday. Lots of people took that version at face value. Turns out, unsurprisingly, there's a lot more to the story. When will people stop being so easily fooled by fake news? Also, the Women's March has faded into irrelevance while the March For Life continues going strong after four decades. We'll look at the difference between those two movements.

      <title>Ep. 407 - Welfare For the Upper Class</title>
      <description>Democrats want to wave the magic wand and "cancel" student loans. But if we have a magic wand to wave, why are we doing it for the sake of upper class people? Why not cancel car loans, or credit card loans, or mortgages, for the working class? Also, an "abortion storyteller," whatever that is, gives advice on how to talk to kids about abortion. It's as horrifying as you expect.

      <description>A woman goes to abort her twins and brags about it in the most depraved way imaginable. In fact there is a whole online community dedicated to people who hate children and want to brag about killing them. What does that tell us about our culture at large, and the pro-abortion movement specifically? Also, Democrats very somberly celebrate as they sign articles of impeachment. And Stephen King bows before the PC altar in penance for speaking the truth.

      <title>Ep. 405 - It's Sexist Not To Believe Warren, According To Her Supporters</title>
      <description>Elizabeth Warren's supporters are defending her claims about Bernie Sanders on the basis that we should "believe women." According to them, women literally never lie about anything. This is the dumbest kind of emotional blackmail. Also, an art exhibit in New York seeks to prove that "abortion is normal." The effort fails in spectacular fashion.

      <title>Ep. 404 - Socialist Fight!</title>
      <description>Sanders and Warren are at each other's throats. I have no dog in the fight, but it should be noted that Warren is a known liar. Also, another journalist is assaulted by a raging SJW. And a college professor explains why it's racist for white people to ask for evidence before they believe a claim. Finally, following JK Rowling's lead, Stephen King just got himself canceled.

      <title>Ep. 403 - Worse Than A Slippery Slope</title>
      <description>A pedophile claims he's really an eight year old girl trapped in a grown man's body. If biological sex is fluid and changeable, on what basis do we deny his claims? Also, I asked people if they'd save their dog or a person from a fire. The results are disturbing. And do human beings really have free will? I answer an email about that and several other subjects.

      <title>Ep. 402 - Despicable Bordering On Traitorous</title>
      <description>Democrats and the media are now blaming the US and Trump for the fact that Iran shot down a passenger jet. Their continued defense of our nation's enemies has gone from merely despicable to borderline traitorous. Also, a video of animal rights activists "rescuing" a dog by stealing it from a homeless man perfectly encapsulates our culture. We'll discuss why so many people value animal life over human life. And we'll debate the ethical implications of Justin Trudeau's beard.

      <title>Ep. 400 - Trump's Masterstroke</title>
      <description>Trump's Iran gambit turned out to be a massive win for America and for him. This is what peace through strength looks like. Also, speaking of massive wins, CNN was forced to settle with Nick Sandmann after slandering him. And is the lack of black coaches in the NFL a symptom of racism? Of course not. But the media claims otherwise.

Also, Colin Kaepernick really wants America to stop oppressing him. And we're told that we have to eat bugs to save the planet, so I will do my part on the show today.

      <title>Ep. 398 - Hollywood Gets The Treatment It Deserves</title>
      <description>Ricky Gervais ruthlessly mocked Hollywood at the Golden Globes last night. It was hilarious and well deserved. And to prove Gervais' point, Michelle Williams proceeded to get on stage and deliver a lengthy speech about the glories of feminism and abortion. We'll sort through all of this on the show today. Also, a leftist claims she was verbally assaulted by a Trump supporter at Costco. Her story is the most absurdly fake one yet. It makes Smollett seem believable by comparison.

      <title>Ep. 396 - The Media's Anti-Gun Narrative Collapses</title>
      <description>We start the new decade talking about the collapse of the media's anti-gun narrative. Also, Pope Francis viciously assaults a woman. At least that's how people on Twitter are framing it. And we discuss one of the great mysteries of our time: why do people stand out in the cold for 10 hours just to see a shiny ball descend down a pole?

      <title>Ep. 393 - The Myth Of Fiscal Conservatism</title>
      <description>While everyone is blabbering about impeachment, Congress is getting ready to pass a 1.4 trillion dollar spending bill. This is yet more evidence that fiscal conservatism simply does not exist anymore. The spending bill also raises the age for buying tobacco to 21. We'll talk about all of the reasons why that is arbitrary, pointless, and stupid. And a female Fight Club is in the works. But there's one huge problem with the idea.

      <description>Netflix has a new "comedy" special about a "gay Jesus." We'll talk about Christians should respond when a company spits directly in their faces. Also, Obama says women are better leaders than men. But his own gender ideology precludes him from saying things like that. And Democrats in Seattle hire a transgender stripper to solve homelessness.

      <description>Cadets at the Army-Navy game played the Circle Game and now everyone is owed a punch. But the media, upset that it lost the Circle Game, is retaliating by pretending that the cadets are white supremacists. Also, Bernie Sanders says that teachers should be paid more because baseball players make a lot of money. We'll do our best to analyze that non-sequitur. And I give tips for cooking the perfect bacon.

      <title>Ep. 390 - The Anti-Porn Argument No One Has Addressed</title>
      <description>The debate about porn has been fascinating this week, with conservatives coming down on either side of the discussion. But there's one argument for porn prohibition or regulation that I haven't heard anyone on the other side of the debate address. I want to lay it out today. Also, a depressing video shows college students supporting Medicare for all, even though they have no idea what it entails. And we debate: what is the worst Christmas song of all time?

      <title>Ep. 389 - A Hate Crime The Media Doesn't Want To Talk About</title>
      <description>Members of a black supremacist group shot up a Jewish grocery store in a racist and anti-Semitic attack. The media isn't very interested in the story, for obvious reasons. Also, Trump trolls Greta Thunberg and the woke-ified version of "Baby It's Cold Outside" fails hilariously. All of that and your emails today on the show.

      <description>Greta Thunberg is named person of the year, but I'm concerned the choice isn't woke enough. Also, AOC trots out a bizarre argument in defense of her insane family leave policy idea. And speaking of not being woke enough, Megan Rapinoe scolds Sports Illustrated after they give her an award.

      <title>Ep. 387 - Actress Insists She's Happy After Abortion, Nobody Is Fooled</title>
      <description>An actress sent a series of tweets bragging about her abortion and claiming she's wonderfully happy now that her child is dead. But she's lying to herself, of course. Speaking of lying to yourself, the singer Lizzo went to an NBA game wearing a dress with a huge hole cut out at the butt. This is supposed to show her "self-confidence," but it actually shows the opposite. And I respond to a few of the many, many emails I received from my show yesterday.

      <title>Ep. 385 - A Heart Full Of Love</title>
      <description>Nancy Pelosi invokes her Catholicism again, saying her "heart full of love" and her Catholic faith prevent her from hating the president. Everything about this claim is bogus. Also, Joe Biden calls a potential voter fat. It's his best sales pitch of the campaign so far. And CBS wants to save boys from "toxic masculinity." I think they need to be saved from people who preach about toxic masculinity.

      <title>Ep. 384 - Identity Politics In Disarray</title>
      <description>A college professor made the lamest joke in recorded history at the impeachment hearing yesterday. But what's even more lame are the conservatives pretending to be offended by it. Also, a rally for Pete Buttigieg descends into chaos as the Left's system of identity politics continues to collapse around them. And a NYT article advocates being your own soul mate. We'll talk about why the whole notion of self-love is flawed.

Also, a school board in Illinois voted to allow boys in the girl's locker room. A very upsetting video of one girl at the school reacting to the vote should put the debate to rest.

      <title>Ep. 374 - Chick-fil-A's Cowardly Cave</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep374</link>
      <description>Of course the big story of today is Fart Gate, which we will analyze in depth. But also, Chick-fil-A caved to the rage mob after seven years. We'll talk about why this move is not only shameful but completely counter productive. Surrendering to the mob never pays off. And an LGBT publication accuses me of "transphobia" and "racism" (again). But did they meet their burden of proof in validating that claim? We'll take a look. (The answer is no, not even close.)

      <itunes:summary>Of course the big story of today is Fart Gate, which we will analyze in depth. But also, Chick-fil-A caved to the rage mob after seven years. We'll talk about why this move is not only shameful but completely counter productive. Surrendering to the mob never pays off. And an LGBT publication accuses me of "transphobia" and "racism" (again). But did they meet their burden of proof in validating that claim? We'll take a look. (The answer is no, not even close.)

But if 100 billion dollars can do that, why hasn’t it already happened? The government already brings in 4 trillion dollars a year. Also, Boomers complain that they’re being made fun of too much.

      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep348</link>
      <description>Today we remember the great Christopher Columbus and talk about why it's important to acknowledge and appreciate those who built western civilization, no matter what the PC brigade says. Also, controversy over a new pro-Trump meme. But the outrage is absurdly hypocritical. I'll explain why. And should parents spank their kids? We'll discuss. Date: 10-14-2019

Democrats and Republicans have switched sides on the impeachment issue since 1998, but the real problem is that the same Democrats and Republicans have been in office since 1998. Mattel established world peace by releasing a line of gender neutral dolls. And Rep. Rashida Tlaib makes crazy, anti-science claims in an effort to ban e-cigs. Date: 09-26-2019

      <description>Drew Brees is being attacked by the outrage mob for recording an "anti-gay" video. In reality, the video promotes the Bible and says nothing at all about gays. We'll discuss how "anti-gay" and "Christian" have been synonymous terms in our culture. Also, more stores are banning open carry. My opinion on the subject may put me at odds with most conservatives.

      <description>Walmart has caved to the left and will stop selling ammunition for semi-automatic firearms. It is also asking customers not to open carry in their stores. Both of these measures are absurd and pointless. I'll explain why. Also, a woman brings an emotional support horse on a flight and Calvin Klein competes with Gillette for the most insufferably stupid ad campaign. Finally I respond to the very colorful emails from our Harry Potter discussion yesterday. Date: 09-04-2019

      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep306</link>
      <description>Today on the show, Democrats rush to the defense of Al Sharpton just a day after insisting that Baltimore is a wonderful and safe city. We’ll talk about how the Democrats are managing to lose every argument with Trump by insisting on taking the extreme opposite position in every case. Also, should cops be pulling people over to give out prizes for following the law? And a student is accused of sexual assault because he "cajoled" a woman into sex with "flattery." Date: 07-30-2019

      <title>Ep. 302 - The Media Wants Us To Forget About The Discredited Erica Thomas Race Hoax</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep302</link>
      <description>Today on the show, as we all suffer through another Robert Mueller news cycle, I’d like to turn our attention back to the story of Erica Thomas. She claimed she was verbally assaulted by a racist white man, but now the police report is out, and it’s very bad for her. When a race hoax is exposed, I think we should talk about it, rather than simply move on. Also, an actress comes out as pansexual, even though the term pansexual has no meaning. And finally, Forever 21 comes up with the most unintentionally hilarious marketing gimmick of all time. Date: 07-24-2019

      <title>Ep. 297 - Squad Member Makes Outrageously Bigoted Statement</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep297</link>
      <description>Today on the show, the Left continues to eat itself. Now the president of Planned Parenthood has been kicked to the curb for the crime of believing that only women can get pregnant. Also, Ayanna Pressley made one of the most bigoted statements we've heard from an American politician in decades. And I asked a left wing doctor to define the word "man." He couldn't do it.

      <description>An Antifa member just waged a terrorist attack against a government facility. Prominent Democrats absolutely refuse to condemn the act. We'll talk about why. Also, Joe Biden reveals his stunning historical ignorance. And I'll explain why we should all stop watching Disney movies. It's not a boycott. This is about self-respect. Date: 07-16-2019

      <title>Ep. 295 - Trump Bails Out The Democrats Again</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep295</link>
      <description>Today on the show, the Democrats are self-destructing. Trump's best move is to get out of the way and let them watch each other. Instead, he brings the attention back to himself with a stupid tweet. We'll talk about why this strategy is incredibly foolish and counterproductive. Also, utterly embarrasses herself at a hearing on immigration. And some people plan to storm Area 51 to find aliens. I think that's probably not a good idea. Date: 07-15-2019

Also, a GOP candidate refuses to be alone with women on the campaign trail. Is this a smart precaution?

      <title>Ep. 290 - The Truth About The "Gender Pay Gap" In Soccer</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep290</link>
      <description>The US women’s team won the World Cup. Now they’re saying they deserve equal pay to the men. But that’s extremely absurd. In fact, if you look at the numbers, women are overpaid. I’ll explain why. Also, the media invented another controversy to try to make conservatives look stupid. This one has to do with a mermaid. Finally, if we have the right to an attorney in this country, why don’t we have the right to a doctor? I'll tackle that question. Date: 07-08-2019

      <description>Today on the show, Colin Kaepernick is offended by the flag. He thinks it stands for racism and slavery. At what point does he just leave the country for one that is not so racist and terrible? Also, a congresswoman says it should be illegal to make fun of politicians.

Well there are too many to list but we’ll try. Also, the NBA is getting rid of the term "owner" because it’s racist, apparently, and replacing it with "governor," which is way weirder and creepier than "owner." Date: 06-25-2019

Also, we’ll look at a powerful yet heartbreaking video of an incident that happened outside of an abortion clinic. And finally, Taylor swift has a new song out.

      <title>Ep. 274 - Congress Has Done Absolutely Nothing To Deserve A Raise</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep274</link>
      <description>Congress wants to give itself a raise. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez insists that they need a raise or else they’ll be corrupt. We'll talk about why that argument is insane. Also, Justin Trudeau babbles nonsensically. I'll play that clip because it’s hilarious. And 60 percent of male managers say they’re uncomfortable around women in the workplace. Gee, I wonder why.

      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep273</link>
      <description>Today on the show, there is a straight pride parade planned in Boston. We’re told that this event is offensive and stupid, but if it's stupid to have straight pride parade, then isn’t it stupid to have a gay pride parade? Also, the LGBT lobby has not stopped harassing Jack Phillips. We’ll talk about the latest in that ongoing saga. Plus, your emails. Date: 06-11-19

      <description>Today on the show, people in this country don’t seem to understand Christianity. That’s why today there is outrage because a pastor prayed for the president and outrage because a Catholic bishop came out against gay pride parades. Nobody would be shocked by either thing if they had a basic understanding of Christian teaching. Also, Texas bans red light cameras. I'll explain why that is the right decision. Plus I'll answer your emails. Date: 06-04-19

      <description>Today on the show, the Daily Beast decided to take vengeance on a random guy who made a Nancy Pelosi meme. They doxxed and shamed him, but that’s not even the most disturbing thing about this story. The most disturbing thing is Facebook's participation in all of this. Also, Budweiser is celebrating asexual pride. What in God's name does that mean? We'll try to figure it out today. Date: 06-03-19

      <description>Today on the show, I’ve been called racist because I did a segment on the show yesterday discussing some very troubling allegations about Martin Luther King Jr. I want to address that accusation. Also, the HBO series Chernobyl is a searing indictment of socialism, but the Left says it’s about Donald Trump. And “Old Town Road” is the worst song ever recorded but it’s a huge hit. Is everyone just pretending to like it? Is this some kind of ironic joke? We’ll get to the bottom of that question today. Date: 05-31-19

Also, I have a couple of things to say about the media’s absurd attempts to tie Ben Shapiro to Nazism. And feminists say that we need to start talking more about periods.

      <title>Ep. 266 - Speaking In Code</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep266</link>
      <description>Today on the show, NPR issues an Orwellian language guide for discussing abortion. I’ve got my own language guide that I’d like to offer. Also, Tarantino is accused of sexism because women don’t spend enough time talking in his latest film. Jeff Daniels says our Democracy is coming to an end if Trump is reelected. And Michael Avenatti is charged with fraud. We’ll take a trip down memory lane and remember all the time the media spent hyping this guy as the savior of the Republic. Date: 05-23-19

      <title>Ep. 265 - The Shocking Attack On The Press That The Press Is Ignoring</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep265</link>
      <description>Today on the show we'll discuss a real attack on the press. But this is one that the press itself ignores, and maybe even defends, because of their ideological allegiances. Also, in the wake of an embarrassing Ben Carson video, we'll try to figure out why Trump made Carson head of HUD rather than appointing him Surgeon General or head of Health and Human services. And finally, why have we decided that it's smart for young married couples to begin their lives together by bankrupting themselves on expensive rings and fancy wedding receptions? Date: 05-22-19

      <title>Ep. 264 - Why Religious Married Couples Are Happier</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep264</link>
      <description>Today on the show, in a shocking development, the NYT published an article claiming that religious women are happier in their marriages than non religious women. I believe this is true, but why is it true? We’ll talk about it. Also Republicans want to raise the smoking age to 21. 18-year-olds can still die on the battlefield or be executed, but they aren't old enough to buy tobacco products apparently. I’ll talk about why this is very stupid. And finally, what’s the preferable living situation — urban or rural?

      <description>The democrats have once again proved that they are a radical anti-science cult with the passage of a bill that would, among other things, force women’s sports teams to allow men. Also, Mayor Pete is supposed to be a moderate Democrat, so why is he advocating for abortion in the third trimester? Date: 05-20-19

      <description>Today on the show, pro abortion zealots have been threatening me and wishing rape and death on my children for the past two days. I want to talk about this and explore why the defense of the unborn would provoke such a satanic reaction. Also, Tucker Carlson is yet again being unfairly attacked. We'll try to clear that up. And is it true that pro lifers don’t care about born people? Are we just "pro birth"? I'll put that claim to rest today. Date: 05-17-19

      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep260</link>
      <description>Today on the show, a law in Alabama would outlaw abortion in almost every case, making no exceptions for rape. The left is of course panicking. I sense that the tide on the abortion issue is turning in America. Am I being too optimistic? Well that would be a first. Also, someone emails and asks whether conservatives are putting their heads in the sand about gun violence. Is that true? Are we? I’ll address the question today. Date: 05-15-19

      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep259</link>
      <description>Today on the show we will talk about anti-natalism, which is the belief that human life is a curse and no one should ever have babies again. How does this tie into the overpopulation myth and environmental apocalypticism? We'll discuss. Also, the fake scientist Bill Nye is back in the news. And someone emails with a simple question: why did God create the world. I'll take a stab at answering it. Date: 05-14-19

      <title>Ep. 258  Feminists Take Celibacy Oath To Own The Cons</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep258</link>
      <description>Today on the show, feminists have discovered the value of abstinence. They’re going on a sex strike to protest abortion restrictions, and personally I think it’s a great idea. Also, a democratic congresswoman says something horrific and bizarre yet again, and yet again she’s the real victim because people are quoting her. Finally, someone emails with a question: are there contradictions in the Bible? Date: 05-13-19

      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep250</link>
      <description>Today on the show: The Left now claims that the Attorney General committed obstruction of justice for Trump. The only problem is that the exact opposite is the case. Also, does the President's love for tweeting help or hurt his reelection chances?

      <title>Ep. 249 - Rebranding The Burqa</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep249</link>
      <description>Today on the show, does it make sense for feminists to celebrate burqas? Also, an Evangelical leader takes a bold stand, proclaiming that there is no Gospel argument for white supremacy. Except nobody is making a Gospel argument for white supremacy, so what’s the point of declaring something like that? And should we look at historical figures in the context of their times or should we judge them by modern standards? Date: 04-30-2019

      <description>An Uber driver is fired for refusing to take a woman to get an abortion. I believe the driver is heroic. But should Uber have fired him? And does the woman have a legal case against the driver, as she claims? We’ll talk about it. Also, Charlize Theron says her three year old son discovered he was a girl. And do I lack sympathy for college graduates because I don’t want their loans forgiven? All of that and more on the show today. Date: 04-24-2019

Also we’ll try to figure out why certain prominent Democrats are going out of their way to avoid acknowledging that Christians are the ones who were attacked. And I have been smeared by a British publication for comments I made about gay adoption. It's a pretty outrageous and dishonest smear and I want to address it. Date: 04-22-2019

      <title>Ep. 242 - The Mueller Report Is Here And The Goal Posts Are Magically Shifting</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep242</link>
      <description>The Mueller report is finally here. Nobody has read the whole thing. Why are we talking about it? Well I think there are a few basic takeaways we can already ascertain, and not ones the Left will like. Also, why are socialists like Bernie Sanders so stingy with charitable giving? And should teachers physically intervene when students fight? One teacher is getting flak for not intervening in a fight caught on camera. I'll explain why the criticisms are likely unfair. Date: 04-18-2019

      <itunes:summary>The Mueller report is finally here. Nobody has read the whole thing. Why are we talking about it? Well I think there are a few basic takeaways we can already ascertain, and not ones the Left will like. Also, why are socialists like Bernie Sanders so stingy with charitable giving? And should teachers physically intervene when students fight? One teacher is getting flak for not intervening in a fight caught on camera. I'll explain why the criticisms are likely unfair. Date: 04-18-2019

      <description>It is a great tragedy that the Notre Dame cathedral burned yesterday. But what is it about that church, and those like it, that we find so awe inspiring? And why don’t we build churches of that sort anymore? Today I want to talk about the need for beauty in the church, and why we should start building beautiful churches again. Also, I’m going to defend someone I don’t usually defend. And I’ll answer your emails, including one about the rapture. Date: 04-16-2019

      <title>Ep. 233 - Toilet Seat Oppression</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep233</link>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, is it “white nationalism” to expect immigrants to assimilate? No, obviously, but some people think so. Also, a feminist in a college newspaper says that leaving the toilet seat up is patriarchal oppression. And what about the economic argument for abortion? How do we respond to that? Finally, I will address some very angry emails. Date: 04-05-2019

Also, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez says that the minimum wage should be raised because croissants are so expensive. Uh, what? And who struggles more in the school system — boys or girls? That's an important question we will try to address today. Date: 04-02-2019

It’s absurd but also kind of hilarious. And a pro-life movie earns an R rating. Is this justified or is it a ploy to prevent people from seeing it? (Definitely the latter.) Date: 04-01-2019

We’ll talk about the blatant double standards there. Also, the latest on Jussie Smollett. Date: 03-28-2019

      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep224</link>
      <description>Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left is in mourning as Mueller finds no evidence for collusion. But what does It say about the Left that they’re upset the President DIDN'T collude? And what does it say about our media that they pushed this conspiracy theory for two years? Nothing good, that’s for sure. Also, Kamala Harris says all teachers need a raise. Is she right?

      <title>Ep. 221 - Beto Comes Out For Third Trimester Abortions</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep221</link>
      <description>Today on the show, Elizabeth Warren shares her favorite Bible verse. The only problem is that her positions — especially on abortion— completely contradict that verse. Also, Beto comes out for third trimester abortion, which is a required position in the Democrat Party now. Also, a child is groped by a TSA agent. Finally, a kid is accosted by liberals after wearing a MAGA hat to a vigil for the mosque shooting victims. Some conservatives are treating him like a martyr. Personally, I’m tired of the attention seeking trolling on both sides. Date: 03-20-2019

We'll talk about why this is child abuse, and also why the left’s theories on gender are contradictory, insane, superstitious, and incoherent. Also, what is it about the internet that makes people depressed? I have some thoughts. Finally, Elizabeth Warren says abolish the Electoral College. Does she have a point? Date: 03-19-2019

      <title>Ep. 208 - In Quest To Destroy Trump, Democrats Are Setting A Dangerous Precedent</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep208</link>
      <description>The Left went fishing during the Cohen hearing and came up empty. But they will keep trying until they find a way to rid themselves of President Trump. This is a very dangerous precedent they are setting. We'll talk about where it might lead. Also, a Democratic presidential candidate is accused of being abusive to her staff. But feminists say she’s only being criticized because she’s a woman. That's absurd, of course, and we'll discuss why. Date: 02-28-2019

Also, two biological males just won first and second place in a girls' track and field championship. Almost everyone thinks this kind of thing is crazy, yet it keeps happening.

Also, Panera bread’s experiment with socialism was an abysmal failure. And I’ll answer your emails, including an email from a guy who claims that real men don’t wear beads. I will spend some time debunking that hateful and insane notion. Date: 02-07-2019

      <description>Mike Pence’s wife, Karen, is the target of outrage today because she got a job at a Christian school. The media claims the school is"anti-LGBT." Why? Because it affirms Christian teaching on sexual morality. Also, is it ever really necessary to apologize for an opinion? I say no. Finally, Kamala Harris shared some deep thoughts with the world.

      <title>Ep. 175 - Pastor Loses Job For Biblical Position On Marriage/Gender</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep175</link>
      <description>On the show today: A California pastor lost his job because he took a Biblical position on sex and gender. Many members of his church apparently expected their pastor to reject Scripture's authority on those subjects. Also, we need to talk about proof texting. It is possible to justify, or dispute, any theological position by cherry picking Bible quotes completely out of context. We'll talk about why that is a dangerous thing to do, and where it leads.

      <link>https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep157</link>

As a few recent cases demonstrate, there is a serious problem here. Too many innocent people have lost their lives at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve them. Why? That's the question I'll try to tackle on the show today. Date: 12-06-2018

      <title>Ep. 130 - Should Christians Support Open Borders?</title>
      <description>There is a caravan of 7,000 migrants headed for the United States. Today we'll tackle two questions related to this issue: 1) As many of these migrants appear to be grown men, wouldn't it be better if they stayed home and helped to rebuild their own countries? 2) The Left claims that Christians are required to support open borders. Is that true? (Hint: no, it's not).

      <description>You cannot logically oppose the killing of born infants if you do not oppose the killing of unborn infants. As a society, we have to decide where we stand on murder. Either we celebrate it or we condemn it. We can't do both.

      <title>Ep. 128 - Why The Gosnell Movie Is Being Ignored By The Media</title>
      <description>The Gosnell movie was dropped from a third of its theaters in its second week, despite a very strong box office performance. The media and the Left have been stonewalling this film from the beginning, and they haven't let up. But why are they so terrified of the Gosnell story? Why have they ignored it? I think the reason is pretty clear. We'll talk about it now.

Christianity is completely rational, completely logical, and grounded in a real historical event. The evidence for that event is overwhelming. Let's look at the evidence now.

      <title>Ep. 126 - Why I'm Not A Young Earth Creationist</title>
      <description>Young Earth Creationism -- the belief that the universe was made in six 24 hour days less than 10,000 years ago -- is quite common among Christians in America. I think it's wrong and comes from a misreading of the Biblical text and a misunderstanding of science. I also think Young Earth Creationism is an unnecessary stumbling block which prevents non-believers from taking Christianity seriously. I'll explain why.

      <description>A male cyclist competed in a women’s cycling event and won. The left says this is a great victory for trans rights. But yet again, victories for trans rights must come at the expense of women’s rights. And speaking of rights, a great victory for religious liberty happened this week. We’ll discuss that important case as well.

      <title>Ep. 124 - Why Is The Genocide Of Christians Being Ignored?</title>
      <description>Why are Trump's enemies always doing stupid and self-destructive things? And why are white Americans always so desperate to prove that they have non-white or non-American heritage? What's wrong with just being a white American? Also, we'll talk about Pastor Andrew Brunson, who was released from a Turkish prison last week after spending two years behind bars for "Christianization." Why is the persecution and genocide of Christians across the globe ignored by people in this country?

And why are white Americans always so desperate to prove that they have non-white or non-American heritage? What's wrong with just being a white American? Also, we'll talk about Pastor Andrew Brunson, who was released from a Turkish prison last week after spending two years behind bars for "Christianization." Why is the persecution and genocide of Christians across the globe ignored by people in this country?

For that matter, why hasn't anyone in her life -- parent, family member, friend -- come forward to vouch for her emotional state in the weeks, months, and years after the supposed attack, when she claims she was traumatized and failing school because of it?

      <title>Ep. 114 - Kavanaugh FBI Investigation a Witch Hunt</title>
      <description>Democrats don't care about the truth. That's not why they insisted on this FBI investigation. This is about digging up more dirt on Kavanaugh, even if it has nothing to do with sexual assault. Republicans never should have agreed to it.

      <description>The most insane narrative to come out of the Kavanaugh hearings is that Kavanaugh is an unfit judge because he was angry. Well, let's think about this. Why might a guy be angry at a bunch of smear merchants who have been trying to ruin his life, end his career, and destroy his family?

      <description>A public school student in Texas was expelled for repeatedly refusing to stand for the Pledge. For me, the problem with kids sitting during the pledge isn't that they lack patriotism, but that they lack respect for their elders and obedience to authority.

They'd flip us the bird and do what they want. And that is exactly what Republicans should do. Republicans need to stop being cowards and confirm Kavanaugh.

      <title>Ep. 108 - Kavanaugh's Accuser Continues To Discredit Herself</title>
      <description>Christine Ford, Kavanaugh's accuser, has presented a list of demands. The demands are silly and manipulative. And they raise a question: Is Christine Ford acting like a traumatized woman seeking justice, or is she acting like a political agent seeking to prevent a conservative from being appointed to the Supreme Court? I think the answer to that question is clear.

      <title>Ep. 105 - Democrats Conjure Up Last Minute Allegations Against Brett Kavanaugh</title>
      <description>At the very last minute, Democrats have conjured up sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. There are several very good reasons to doubt the story. I will outline those reasons. Also, we have to tackle another question: even if Kavanaugh is guilty, should he necessarily lose the Supreme Court position because of a bad thing he did as a kid three decades ago? Let's talk about it now.

      <title>Ep. 104 - Saving Sex For Marriage Solves Lots of Problems</title>
      <description>Abstinence before marriage is not just a religious idea. It is a strategy that could solve or greatly reduce many of our most serious societal problems. Advocating “safe sex” has not solved anything. Maybe it’s time to rethink some things.

      <title>Ep. 103 - Why It's Impossible To Have Fruitful Debates In Our Culture</title>
      <description>Norm MacDonald is the latest public figure to feel the wrath of the outrage mob for making a perfectly valid point about a contentious issue. This is how things go in America now. Nobody is allowed to think for themselves or introduce a divergent opinion into the mix. Nuance and subtlety are rejected. People just want to hear their own shallow thoughts repeated back to them. Fruitful debate will be impossible in this country until we learn how to engage ideas that differ from our own.

      <description>There have been several stories in the news recently about men who were falsely accused of rape. Some of them went to prison. All of them had their lives and reputations ruined. The problem of false accusations is very real and must be addressed by prosecuting and sentencing false accusers just as harshly as we do rapists.

      <title>Ep. 101 - Why Serena Williams' Tantrum Has Nothing To Do With "Women's Rights"</title>
      <description>Serena Williams had a hysterical temper tantrum and then claimed that she was "fighting for women's rights." The idea of "rights" -- especially women's rights -- has been so degraded in our society that now a wealthy athlete can pretend she's fighting for rights as she smashes her tennis racket and screams at an umpire. Let's talk about what "rights" really are, and why we need to stop cheapening them.

      <title>Ep. 100 - The Republicans Demonstrate Cowardice By Funding Planned Parenthood</title>
      <description>Planned Parenthood is essentially a money laundering scheme for the Democrat Party. They are given millions of dollars in tax money ever year, and they spend millions trying to get Democrats elected. And if all of that isn't bad enough -- Republicans are financing the efforts.

      <title>Ep. 99 - Is Monogamy Unnatural?</title>
      <description>These days we are told that monogamy is "unnatural" or "unrealistic." As the argument goes, being faithful in a marriage can be hard which means it is impossible and against our very nature. This is the logic of a weak, cowardly age. Monogamy is, in fact, far more "natural" for humans than the other option. And it's perfectly feasible and even pretty easy if you are willing to exercise a little bit of self-restraint and selflessness.

      <title>Ep. 98 - Colin Kaepernick Is No Hero</title>
      <description>The hype around Colin Kaepernick is overblown on both sides. The Right has turned him into some kind of historic villain, and the Left has turned him into a martyr who "sacrificed everything." Both of these characterizations are ridiculous, but the latter is most ridiculous. Kaepernick did not sacrifice everything. In fact, he sacrificed nothing. On the contrary, his political crusade has profited him tremendously. And that's simply not how sacrifice works.

      <title>Ep. 97 - Why Moral Relativism Is False</title>
      <description>Yesterday we talked about why there can be no objective morality without God. The only logical position for an atheist to hold is moral relativism. Now today I want to discuss why moral relativism -- which is a position many atheists and secular people do openly hold -- is nonsensical and false. We do not get to invent our own moral systems. There is only one true moral system, and it is a system that everyone, everywhere, knows and recognizes.

      <itunes:summary>Yesterday we talked about why there can be no objective morality without God. The only logical position for an atheist to hold is moral relativism. Now today I want to discuss why moral relativism -- which is a position many atheists and secular people do openly hold -- is nonsensical and false. We do not get to invent our own moral systems. There is only one true moral system, and it is a system that everyone, everywhere, knows and recognizes.

      <title>Ep. 96 - Without God There Can Be No Objective Morality</title>
      <description>An atheist cannot logically make objective moral claims. He cannot logically say that any action at all is objectively right or objectively wrong. Yet, many atheists do make such claims. Many atheists do believe that things like rape, murder, theft, etc., are not just subjectively wrong, but actually wrong. Atheists seem to recognize a moral code, even though no such moral code could exist without God. What does that tell us about atheism, God, and morality? Let's talk about that now.

      <title>Ep. 95 - The Problem with the ‘Body Positivity’ Movement</title>
      <description>These days we are told to embrace and celebrate everything about ourselves and our bodies. Even the morbidly obese are encouraged to be "positive" about a physical state that may well kill them. I think this is the wrong approach. For one, it prevents honest self-assessment which prevents self-improvement. For another, it encourages us to remain obsessively focused on ourselves.

If this is true, Francis must resign. But is it true? We will talk about that today.

      <title>Ep. 90 - We Need To Reclaim Sexual Morality</title>
      <description>Our culture did away with the concept of sexual morality and now we have no way of dealing with, or even describing, all of the sexually immoral behavior we see around us. We lump it all together under the umbrella of 'rape' and 'abuse' because consent is the one remaining moral rule governing our sex lives. We say that sex is only immoral if it lacks consent, but this is false and confusing. A properly ordered sex life requires a lot more than just consent.

There are many other statues of controversial figures in our country, yet they all remain standing. Is it because those other problematic monuments commemorate liberal heroes?

      <title>Ep. 88 - Progressivism Descends Further Into Insanity</title>
      <description>The LGBT camp wants us to call vaginas "front holes" so that we don't offend trans people. Animal rights activists demanded that animal crackers be freed from their cage. These two stories again demonstrate the fact that Leftism is plunging into total insanity. But why? Let's talk about that now.

      <title>Ep.87 - Tolerance is A False Virtue</title>
      <description>There is too much tolerance in the Church. We have been indoctrinated into the idea that a Christian should never show intolerance or hatred towards anything. But this is false. Hatred and intolerance are parts of love. If we love people, and if we love God, then we will have a real, profound hatred for sin and evil.

      <description>The Colorado Civil Rights Commission is once again coming after Masterpiece Cakeshop and Jack Phillips. This time he is being accused of discrimination for refusing to bake a cake celebrating a "gender transition." This is not about defending the rights of LGBT people. It never was. This is about punishing Christians for being Christians. That's all.

      <description>The Left is mad that the actor portraying a gay character in a new Disney film is not himself gay. They're also mad that the actress portraying a lesbian Batwoman is not herself lesbian enough. Here we see two facts demonstrated: 1) Identity politics is insane. 2) The Left will never be satisfied, no matter how much ground is surrendered to them.

      <title>Ep. 80 - Why 'Love Yourself' Is Horrible Advice</title>
      <description>We are far too focused on self-love these days. People have come to believe that self-love is the starting point, and goal, of human life. It isn't. Self-love hardly even makes sense as a concept, and in practice it almost always translates into narcissism. Let's talk about why we should stop worrying about loving ourselves and focus instead on loving others.

      <title>Ep. 79 - How Social Media Helps Turn Us Into Narcissists</title>
      <description>A new mental disorder called "Snapchat dysmorphia" has been invented to describe people who get plastic surgery so that they look better on Snapchat. There is a simple and more accurate term for this: narcissism. Social media fuels narcissism because it encourages us to focus intently on our image, our appearance, ourselves.

      <title>Ep. 77 - The Left Claims Only White People Can Be Racist</title>
      <description>The Left is defending the racist tweets of a New York Times reporter on the basis that she can't be racist because she isn't white. In the Leftist mind, only those with "institutional power" can be racist, and only white people have that kind of power. This is wrong and nonsensical on several different levels. Let's dissect the wrongness now.

      <title>Ep. 76 - Is The Pope Right About The Death Penalty?</title>
      <description>Pope Francis is attempting to overturn 2,000 years of Church teaching on the death penalty. Christianity has always taught, and Scripture says, and men like Aquinas and Augustine have affirmed, that the death penalty is morally permissible. The Pope disagrees. Is he wrong? We'll talk about that on the show today. (But yes, he's wrong).

If life is objectively meaningless, and we are but physical matter headed into an eternal oblivion, why do you care what other people believe? Why are you trying to convert us into unbelief? What does it matter? What does anything matter? Let's talk about it.

      <title>Ep. 74 - Jesus Is Not A Socialist</title>
      <description>I can't believe I have to say this, but, no, Jesus is not a socialist. He does not see poverty as a social disease to be cured by a power from on high. He could do that Himself if He wanted to. But that's not the point. The point is that we as individuals are supposed to CHOOSE to help and love our fellow humans.

      <title>Ep. 73 - The New York Times Just Published An Extraordinarily Racist Article</title>
      <description>The New York Times published an article lamenting the fact that there are so many white people in New Hampshire. The Left continues to engage in blatant bigotry against white people under the guise of pushing "diversity." But socially engineered diversity is wrong and self-defeating. It's also extremely racist, for many reasons. We will discuss those reasons now.

      <title>Ep. 72 - Voters Should Be Required To Take A Civics Exam</title>
      <description>We say that it's everyone's civic duty to vote. That's not exactly true. It's everyone's civic duty to be informed and contributing members of society. If they haven't fulfilled that duty, then it's extremely bad for them to vote. An ignorant, self-centered vote serves only to cancel out the votes of informed people. We could easily solve this problem by holding voters to a very basic standard of awareness and maturity.

We are often accused of being "anti-social," and "hating people," and so on, but none of that is true. We just have no need for, and do not enjoy, constant noise and pointless chatter.

      <title>Ep 70 - Inventing Another Fake Environmental Crisis</title>
      <description>Supposedly, our plastic straws are destroying the environment. We are told that we use 500 million straws a day, and many of them somehow end up in the ocean. Both of these claims are false. Let's now debunk this hysteria, and discuss why people engage in environmental hysterics, and how they hurt their own movement in the process.

      <title>Ep. 69 - The Church Is Plagued By Cowardice</title>
      <description>The disease that infects the church in America is cowardice. Many Christians are afraid to stand for moral truth. The persecution we face is very light, yet we cower from it in fear. There can be no resurgence of faith in America until there is a resurgence of courage.

      <description>Trendy liberal parents are raising their kids "gender neutral." They even have a name for gender neutral kids: theybies. This is not only illogical, ridiculous, and insane -- it is also child abuse.

      <title>Ep. 67 - The Inconvenient Truth About The Catholic Church Sex Scandal</title>
      <description>The Catholic Church started admitting a significant percentage of gay priests in the 60s and 70s. It was right at this time that the sexual abuse of altar boys became a huge problem. These two things are not unrelated. The one leads to the other. This is the glaringly obvious fact that any rational person can recognize, but few will say out loud. Christianity in the West is infested with cowards who will not even admit the truths that are right in front of them.

      <title>Ep. 66 - The Secularization of Christianity</title>
      <description>I got an email from a Christian who tells me that I should save the God stuff for church and talk about other subjects. I hear this kind of thing a lot from Christian readers/viewers. It is a symptom of the secularization of faith in America. We treat faith and "the real world" as two entirely separate things that should not cross over into one another. But I don't think that is the right approach, and here's why.

      <title>Ep. 65 - Our Country Needs More Masculinity, Not Less</title>
      <description>A new campaign seeks to "evolve masculinity" by turning men into emasculated weaklings. But this does not represent an evolution. The new version of masculinity is a devolution from the traditional version. And that's a problem because this country desperately needs masculine men.

      <title>Ep. 64 - We're All Mentally Disordered</title>
      <description>The drug companies and the psychiatric industry have turned nearly every human emotion, trait, characteristic, and weakness into symptoms of mental diseases. Often they do so by pushing thoroughly debunked theories like "chemical imbalancement." Before long, we will all be mentally disordered.

      <title>Ep. 63 - Why Is God Hidden?</title>
      <description>Today I want to address what I think is maybe the best atheist argument against the existence of God. It's also a question that we Believers have been grappling with for centuries: Where is God? Why does He remain invisible to us? Why doesn't He reveal Himself unmistakably to all of us? I don't claim to have THE answer to that question. Nobody does. But here are my thoughts on the subject.

      <title>Ep. 61 - The PC Mob Gets Another Head For Its Trophy Case</title>
      <description>The PC mob's latest victim is Papa John. He said the N-word, while quoting someone else who said the N-word, and now he has been forced to resign in disgrace because of it. This is absurd. A word itself cannot be racist. A word is just a word. But this is really about the Left's mission to control language and thus control society.

      <title>Ep. 60 - The Left Won't Stop Pushing Its Religion On Us</title>
      <description>We Christian conservatives are accused of "pushing religion" whenever we make pretty much any argument, but especially when we argue against abortion. But the argument against abortion has nothing at all to do with religion. It has to do with science, and with the universal moral law. It is the argument for abortion that is based on religion. That is, the Left's satanic religion of self-worship.

      <description>An atheist asked me how I can believe that God exists, and is good, considering all of the terrible stuff that happens in the world. This, of course, is one of the most common objections people have been making against God for millennia. I think it is worth addressing.

      <description>Tomi Lahren insists that conservatives need to let go of the pro-life cause and stop trying to overturn Roe. She's wrong. Any so-called conservative who adopts the Left's position on abortion is wrong. And they aren't actually conservative in any meaningful way.

      <description>In the west, we are constantly told that we must apologize for our history and tear down the statues and monuments of our historical heroes. The pioneers who built our civilization must all be posthumously indicted for their alleged crimes and we must spit on their graves and express no admiration for their achievements. Only white western countries are required to be so ashamed of their past. It is not expected of anyone else. I think this attitude is nonsense, and disgraceful, and I want to explain why.

      <description>I have been told that it's not "compassionate" for the government to catch illegal immigrants and deport them. But it's not the government's job to be compassionate. The government's job is to make and enforce laws. Individuals should be compassionate and generous. The Left has been trying for years to relieve the individual from the burden of personal virtue and charity, and that's really what this debate is all about.

      <description>It's hard to have a discussion about immigration law with people who think there shouldn’t be any immigration laws at all. The Left is being disingenuous. They say they have a problem with separating kids, but really they have a problem with immigration enforcement of any kind. But we cannot have a country if we do not have clearly defined, and strictly enforced, borders. The process of defining and enforcing the border will not always be pleasant. But it can be just. Those two things are not the same.

      <title>Ep. 51 - We Have Ceased To See The Purpose</title>
      <description>The crisis in American culture is twofold: we do not know WHO we are, and we do not know WHY we are. We are confused about our identity and our purpose. But a person cannot live, and he certainly cannot be happy, unless he knows who he is and where he is going. We need to restore our sense of identity and purpose.

      <title>Ep. 49 - How Conservatives Can Win Back The Culture</title>
      <description>Conservatives lost the culture because they stopped fighting for it. Now we brag about our "silent majority" while we cower in the corner, too terrified to meaningfully resist the Left and its agenda. If only we had a little bit of courage. That is all we need, and it would be enough to change everything.

      <description>Whenever suicide is in the news, well intentioned people say really horrible and dangerous things about it. In an effort to be kind and generous to the dead, they end up justifying, glorifying, and promoting suicide, which is very harmful to the living. Today I want to talk about two of the great lies people tell about suicide, thinking they are being helpful, when really they are causing enormous harm.

      <title>Ep. 46 - You Don't Give Up Your "Freedom" When You Have Kids</title>
      <description>The "child-free movement" says that the only way to be free and happy is to avoid having kids at all costs. Many people in my generation have taken this idea to heart, and as a result the birth rate has dropped to cataclysmic lows. But the "child-free" mentality is wrong, and leads only to emptiness and sadness, and I'll explain why.

      <title>Ep. 45 - Guilt Is Good</title>
      <description>The Church today treats guilt as a bad thing. Many Christians think that they ought never feel guilty, and that feelings of guilt should be rejected and overcome through positive-thinking. But this is a serious error. Guilt is our soul's response to sin. It is good that we have that response if we are in fact guilty of something. But what do we do with guilt? What can we learn from it and where should it lead us? That's what I want to talk about today.

      <title>Ep. 44 - Stop Blaming Millennials For Everything</title>
      <description>Millennials are generally blamed for everything in our society, even though our country was already financially and culturally and spiritually ruined before my generation came of age. Yes, many of us tend to be entitled and selfish. But they learned it from their entitled, selfish parents, who seem to always get off the hook somehow. Maybe it's time to stop foisting all the blame on Millennials and start looking at our situation honestly.

      <title>Ep. 33 - The Cancer In The Bloodstream Of American Culture</title>
      <description>People think that our society is plagued by "hatred" and "division." They're wrong. Hatred isn't our problem. Our problem is indifference, which is worse than hatred and the true opposite of love.

Maybe it's time to cut our losses and go back to the old fashioned way, which is the only way that works.

      <title>Ep. 31 - Does Christianity Have Too Many "Rules"?</title>
      <description>I have been told that Christianity's moral laws are too constricting and oppressive. I have been told that they deprive us of our freedom. But the opposite is true. It is through living moral lives, and walking the path that Christ laid down for us, that we can really enjoy true freedom and happiness. "Freedom" without morality always turns into slavery and death. Here's why.

      <title>Ep. 28 - What A Man Should Do For His Family</title>
      <description>These days men are encouraged to be emotional and vulnerable and to constantly share their worries with those around them. But a masculine man, especially when he becomes a husband and father, should not always be venting his anxieties. He should have quiet strength. He should be willing to carry his cross, and sacrifice for his family, without whining. This is what we used to call "dignity."

      <title>Ep. 26 - How To Destroy The "Best" Pro-Abortion Argument</title>
      <description>Every pro-abortion argument really boils down to this: "my body, my choice." Or, as pro-aborts call it, bodily autonomy. The bodily autonomy argument is supposed to be unassailable and logically bullet proof. It is supposed to end the discussion. It doesn't. Let me demonstrate how to completely annihilate the Left's "best" argument for abortion. I can do it in 5 simple steps.
