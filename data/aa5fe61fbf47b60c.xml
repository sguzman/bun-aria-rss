   <media:description>The collection of fossils and their placement in chronological order (e.g., through the location of the sedimentary layers in which they are found or through radioactive dating) is known as the fossil record. It documents the existence, diversity, extinction, and change of many life forms throughout the history of life on Earth.

   <media:description>The internet is a tool that we use every day - in addition to learning information, it's also how many of us shop, manage finances, and stay connected with others. But that connectivity comes with risks. In this course, Khan Academy interviewed Google’s top security experts to bring you videos packed with powerful tips to help you stay safe. There are articles and practice exercises to help you test what you’ve learned about how to keep your information and devices secure, and how to recognize and avoid common scams. You'll also have the opportunity to learn more about the technological underpinnings of internet safety.

In sexually reproducing organisms, each parent contributes half of the genes acquired (at random) by the offspring. Individuals have two of each chromosome and hence two alleles of each gene, one acquired from each parent. These versions may be identical or may differ from each other.
