      <title>#42: Looking Back ... to the Future (of Everything) </title>
      <description>In a special encore presentation, a look back at the WSJ Future of Everything Festival, the three-day event filled with speakers, panels and demos showing us where the world is going-for better or worse. Lots of Hyperloop, self-driving vehicles, AR and VR, good AI, bad AI... all the AI, really. So now Joanna and David present a few of their favorite moments from the festival: a chat with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, a performance from Imogen Heap and a rousing debate about whether the tools that make us "more productive" are actually good for us.</description>

      <title>#41: Fancy Phones and Fancier Credit Cards </title>
      <description>David and Joanna discuss the new Samsung Galaxy Note 10, the phone for people who get stuff done. (Stuff. Not other words.) It has a new stylus and some new software and a bunch of new cameras. Later, WSJ reporter Liz Hoffman comes in to talk about the new Apple Card, which David has been using to recklessly spend money all week. Is this the future of how we spend money? In this week's Today I Learned, David plans his wedding... at a Taco Bell. And wonders what the phrase "sauce bouquet" could possibly mean. Last, David interviews Dave Asprey, the founder of Bulletproof and the so-called "godfather of biohacking," about how he experiments on his own body and how others can do the same as safely and thoughtfully as possible.</description>

      <title>#40: Where Are the Good Netflix Movies? </title>
      <description>David, Joanna and Christopher start by discussing the future of retail, which at least partly involves all those brands you see in Instagram ads suddenly showing up in a store near you. (The gang also learns a new word: "omnichannel.") Next, WSJ reporter RT Watson hops on to discuss Netflix's upcoming slate of blockbuster-hopeful films, and to answer the big question: Why are streaming services so good at TV and so bad at movies? In this week's TIL, Joanna discovers Apple's old Find My Friends app and finds her friends. Too many friends. Last, David interviews Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger about his "Declaration of Digital Independence" and the future of social media.

      <title>#39: The Fight For Faster Internet  </title>
      <description>This week, it's all about how to make the internet faster--and how the world changes when we do. David, Joanna and Christopher talk about Joanna's nationwide test of the new 5G network. Later, WSJ's Scott McCartney comes on to talk about the race to make airplane Wi-Fi better. (Though we'd even settle for "less bad.") In this week's Today I Learned, David explains the new tech behind the new "The Lion King." Finally, David interviews Marc Porat, the former CEO of General Magic, the company that tried to invent the smartphone in the '90s. And might have pulled it off, if the company had understood the internet.</description>

      <title>#38: How the Moon Landing Changed Tech Forever</title>
      <description>This week marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Even if you don't care about space travel, there's a good chance the work NASA did to get men on the moon affects your life even now. First, David and Christopher chat with Al Gross, a former NASA engineer who helped design the Apollo spacesuits, then went on to use the materials and techniques to design early versions of the sturdy, super-comfy shoes we all wear now. After that, Jennifer Levasseur, the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum's space history curator, talks about the cameras used on Apollo - and how all the tech required to broadcast a TV show live from the lunar surface may have led to the tiny camera in your smartphone.</description>

Dan Bricklin, creator of VisiCalc - the Lotus and Excel predecessor that was so successful people bought Apple computers just to use it - joins to talk about why number-crunching was such a killer app. Then WSJ reporter Julia Carpenter comes on to talk about family cellphone plans - how they came to be the most popular plans, and why even non-families use them. Finally, David interviews Troy Hunt, creator of Have I Been Pwned, about whether your data is secure (probably not) and what you can do about it (plenty).</description>

      <title>#36: How to Survive Holiday Travel </title>
      <description>With Christopher on vacation (again), David and Joanna go through their best tips for surviving the coming July 4th travel craziness. They each bring their best gadget, app, and tip for getting where you're going a little more easily. Later, WSJ reporter Tripp Mickle joins to talk about the departure of legendary Apple designer Jony Ive-and what it means for Apple, and the Apple products you use, going forward. On this week's Today I Learned, the gang rediscovers Tumblr thanks to an online brawl between Taylor Swift and Scooter Braun. Finally, David interviews Andrew Blum, author of "The Weather Machine," about the global system for understanding and predicting the weather. And maybe, someday, hopefully, controlling the weather as well.</description>

      <description>David, Joanna and Christopher unpack the coming fight between tech companies and regulators, and get into the messy meaning of an important term in the antitrust world: "consumer harm." Next, Katie Bindley joins to talk about how she discovered millions of fake listings on Google Maps-and why that's such a big problem for people looking for plumbers, electricians and urgent care centers. On this week's Today I Learned, Joanna replaces your driver's license. Or it is driver license? Drivers' license? Finally, David talks with Peter Jensen, Moleskine's head of digital, about the future of paper notebooks in an increasingly screen-based world.</description>

      <title>#34: Call Him Mr. 'Fortnite' </title>
      <description>Joanna and David didn't want to talk about Facebook, but they had to: Facebook launched a new digital currency, Libra, that could upend the way we pay for things. With the help of WSJ reporter AnnaMaria Andriotis, Joanna and David pick apart what that means for normal people. Next they chat with WSJ reporter Sarah Needleman, who recently wrote a profile of Tim Sweeney, chief executive at Epic Games, the company that created "Fortnite" and changed gaming forever. In this week's Today I Learned, David explains the strange world of waterproofing standards. Last, David interviews Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, about the so-called "Right to Repair" movement, and why there's a war over who gets to fix your gadgets.</description>

      <title>#33: Facebook's Potentially Problematic Privacy Practices: A Recap </title>
      <description>This week, WSJ broke news of internal Facebook Inc. emails that suggested the company lacked urgency to stop data leaks. With David out in Hong Kong at the Journal's Asia tech conference, Joanna and Christopher take you down Memory Lane with some of WSJ's reporters. After catching up on the news, they revisit a chat with Sam Schechner, who broke a story about how much information app makers share with Facebook-without telling you. Then they go back to a talk with Katie Bindley, who downloaded a pregnancy app then found herself targeted by maternity ads on Facebook and Instagram. Finally, they recap Facebook's most recent developer conference, in which the company promised users more privacy-but not privacy from Facebook.</description>

      <title>#32: The World According to Apple </title>
      <description>Apple's annual developer conference, WWDC, was this week, and there's a lot of news that could impact you come the fall. David, Joanna and Christopher sort out the game-changers from the who-caresers.

In this week's Today I Learned, Christopher has a story about password hacking and quantum computing. It confuses everybody. Finally, David interviews Fred Chesnais, the CEO of Atari (still a thing!) about what the decades-old brand might have to say about the future of gaming.</description>

      <description>This week, it's all about how we buy stuff and how that stuff gets to us. David, Joanna and Christopher bring on WSJ reporter Katie Bindley to talk about how to make sure you're getting the best deals on Amazon-and all the ways what you see on the page might not be what you think. Next, Julie Jargon, the team's new Family &amp; Tech columnist, comes on to talk about a project she worked on before she took up her new gig: The Journal's Delivery Wars series looked at the tension between customers who want everything on their doorstep and businesses who want to actually make money. Finally, Christopher interviews Yariv Bash, CEO of Flytrex, about whether drones could one day deliver everything we need right into our hands.</description>
