  <title>Valuation of commodity structures in co-integrated futures markets</title>
  <description>In this paper, Dan Mahoney and Krzysztof Wolyniec show that in co-integrated 
(mean-reverting) futures markets, active dynamic hedging is required to realise the quadratic variation of the underlying spread process. Using static hedges/portfolios yields significantly different values from those available with dynamic strategies no matter what risk adjustment or penalty is adopted. The implications for pricing, hedging and optimal trading strategies in commodity markets are discussed</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/derivatives/commodity-derivatives/2171725/valuation-commodity-structures-co-integrated-futures</link>
