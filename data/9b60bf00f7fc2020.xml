In this deep-and-comedic interview, Jelly Roll talks a lot of common sense on his path to Fred selecting a bourbon perfect for his palate. The fact Jelly Roll liked all the flavors he suggested made it easier to pick a great bourbon.

If you're not following Jelly Roll, you're missing out on one of the hip hop scene's most unique individuals. He recently did a film with Chelsea Handler and has collaborated with  Tech N9ne, Lil Wyte, Haystak and Struggle Jennings. But full warning: This interview contains explicit language. Do not listen to around children.

This week's trivia question: What major whiskey brand hired a salesman to follow around and supply a famous musician with their whiskey?

Also, a heckler heckles Fred during his reads. Can he handle the insults?

I remember a lot of random things from this year, including this moment.  Jimmy Kimmel looked into the camera and said: “Our next guest is the most popular Jewish rapper since MC Hammer…. from Brooklyn, New York. welcome Hasidic hip hop reggae of Matisyahu.”</p>
<p>What my ears heard and my eyes saw forever burned a memory into my brain. Matisyahu broke new ground for the genre now known as Jewish hip hop.</p>
<p>Today, on the Fred Minnick Show, we celebrate Matisyahu’s latest album, named ‘Matisyahu,’ which, in my opinion, breaks away from his traditional style. And we don’t sip whiskey on this episode. We drink coffee. In fact, you may recall this coffee from a previous episode, I have become such a fan of the Wynn Coffee that I’ve brought them into the tasting room. If you’d like to join a long with us, you can get a 10% discount on on wynn coffees. Enter FREDMINNICK10 has been set up. Here's a shareable link: https://nguyencoffeesupply.com/discount/FREDMINNICK10</p>
<p>But for the most part, this episode is a back and forth of a couple coffee lovers and learning about a musician who changed the game. Enjoy this week’s interview</p>
<p>More on Matisyahu</p>
<p>Like only the most gifted storytellers, Matisyahu spins the rare kind of stories that simultaneously enlighten and enthrall and expand the audience’s sense of possibility. On his eponymous new album, the Grammy Award-nominated singer/songwriter/rapper shares his most autobiographical work to date, merging that personal revelation with a shapeshifting collision of reggae and hip-hop and boldly inventive pop. Produced by Salt Cathedral (a Brooklyn-based duo comprised of Colombian musicians Juliana Ronderos and Nicolas Losada), the result is an undeniably transformative album, one that invites both intense introspection and unbridled celebration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Throughout my life so much of my music has come from struggling with a sort of existential loneliness, even though a lot of the music is very joyful,” says Matisyahu. “I ended up in a place where I’ve found the person who’s my soulmate and made a beautiful life with her, and that’s the place where this record was born.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The seventh studio album from the New York artist, Matisyahu arrives as the latest achievement in an extraordinary career that’s included landing a #1 hit on alternative rock radio (with his Billboard Hot 100-charting breakthrough single “King Without a Crown”), collaborating with the likes of reggae legends Sly and Robbie, and amassing a global following largely on the strength of his transcendent live show. In bringing the album to life, Ronderos and Losada joined Matisyahu at his former home on the Hudson River in Nyack, where the three musicians soon immersed themselves in an unfettered and improvisation-fueled creative process. “Working with Juli was the first time I’ve ever had a female producer, and it influenced the record in an amazing way,” says Matisyahu, who first collaborated with Salt Cathedral on his 2016 EP Release the Bound. “I felt free to bring more sensitivity or sensuality to my vocals, and really explore the subtleties of my voice.”&nbsp;</p>

My team and I sought this answer not through public voting.

For the past three months, we’ve asked in surveys and open questions: What is an everyday bourbon? And what price feels right?

The answers varied, but the debate came down to $60 vs. $40, with the latter winning the majority. I was surprised on how difficult choosing an “everyday” price was. Many felt that if the bourbon is in stores and available across the U.S., it should be considered. Perhaps this is the story of our time: Some can buy $200 bourbons every day. And most cannot.

In addition, pricing varies per market, because of state taxes and how distributors set case sales. Rare Breed is a great example. Many believed it should be in the vote. However, it’s more than $45 in most of the country, while controlled states keep Rare Breed around $40. So, this examination of price point led to an interesting snapshot of time of bourbon pricing. With inflation and wheat prices on the rise, who knows if these prices hold?

For determining the bourbons for this list, we applied the $40 price point on Total Wine & More’s website, easily coming up with hundreds of products. Then, we culled whiskeys, narrowing it down by availability, price and allocation. We considered products that would sit in the “bourbon” aisle; thus, we allowed straight bourbons, bottled-in-bond, blends of straight bourbon and barrel finishes in this data grab. From there, we triple checked allocation and availability status.

Lastly, we put it to a vote.

After more than 5,000 votes, here are the winners, as ranked by the public. On March 18, I will blind taste the Top 10 to determine my favorite of the list.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[What’s the best bourbon around $40? My team and I sought this answer not through public voting.

While he's continued to imbibe with wine and other spirits, whiskey, he was told, to stay away from. Today, the soulful artist blind tastes three whiskeys-- A) Angel's Envy Rye; B) Liberty Pole Corn Whiskey; and C) Larceny Barrel Proof C921. 

In addition, Amos and Fred talk about their mutual experiences with depression and seeking mental health help. The show is a long one, which often happens when two friends catch up.

In an interview in Fine & Rare in New York, which Tommy owns, Tardie talks about his new product--The Morning Dram. They eat dinner over, sip whiskey, talk about the New York whiskey scene and enjoy a French press of the barrel aged coffee.

PRESS RELAESE
The Morning Dram, a new line of barrel-aged coffee brought to you by the owner and operator of The Flatiron Room and Fine & Rare, announces its official launch in time for the holiday season. Founded by Tommy Tardie, The Morning Dram is a collection of coffees created for the spirits drinker. Launch products include Bourbon Barrel Aged Coffee, Rye Barrel Aged Coffee, Apera Sherry Barrel Aged Coffee, and House Blend No. 1 along with options such as a subscription box, starter kit, and The Morning Dram merchandise available for purchase exclusively at www.TheMorningDram.com. The Morning Dram is also served at Tardie’s New York landmark establishment Fine & Rare.
For more than a decade Tommy has owned and operated spirits-focused restaurants in New York City with some of the country’s largest selections of whiskey and spirits. The Flatiron Room, which celebrates its tenth anniversary in 2022, was awarded “Best Whisky Bar” in 2021 by Whisky Magazine. Inspired by the commonality between fine spirits and quality coffee, where aficionados enjoy savoring the experience and each note and layer of their drink, Tardie created a coffee with the spirits drinker in mind.
“Good coffee and fine spirits have so much in common, you want to appreciate each sip,” shared Tommy Tardie, Owner & Operator of Goodnight Group. “The Morning Dram offers a balance of complex notes and simple joy, robust flavors of coffee beans cradled in these spirits barrels.”
Appropriately named after the term for a small pour of alcohol, usually referring to whiskey, The Morning Dram utilizes high-quality beans aged in barrels from top distilleries. Rather than setting a standard time to age each coffee, Tommy uses his senses to determine the appropriate time to remove the beans to achieve a rich, smooth finish. This can vary for each batch, since all barrels are different, and achieves distinct tasting notes for each coffee blend.
Bourbon Barrel Aged: Honduras
• Caramel corn, vanilla fudge, toasted marshmallow, sweet bourbon
Rye Barrel Aged: Colombia & Mexico
• Milk chocolate, orange zest, ginger candy, cinnamon toast, sweet oak
Apera Sherry Barrel Aged: Guatemala
 
• Cherries dipped in milk, chocolate, Brazil nuts, figs, strawberry preserves
There is no alcohol in The Morning Dram, and no flavorings or additives. The only ingredient: coffee beans. The distinctive flavor of each coffee is a result of the beans’ time in the barrel, a process that mirrors the whiskey-making process, where barrels are carefully chosen to provide flavor and finish to the liquid aged within.
“The Morning Dram is truly designed for spirits enthusiasts, those who have a passion for exploring the subtle notes and complex flavors resulting from the mastery of a distiller and the barrels they choose for the aging process,” added Tardie. “And with The Morning Dram, that experience can be enjoyed anytime of the day. It’s always eight o’clock somewhere.”
For the holidays and beyond, The Morning Dram has curated a collection of gift items at www.themorningdram.com/collections/gifts.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tommy Tardie and Fred are longtime friends.

But coffee founder Sahra Nguyen, 35, teaches Fred how to taste coffee like a pro and discusses the state of the coffee business and how she is bringing back Vietnamese coffee beans.

Nguyen is successfully transforming coffee culture with a focus on diversity, inclusion and sustainability.  She launched Nguyen Coffee Supply in 2018 in Brooklyn, NY. It's the first specialty coffee company in the U.S to celebrate, champion and import beans directly from family-owned coffee farmers in Vietnam—the second largest coffee producer in the world—roasting 'single-origin' clean and organic beans prized by coffee connoisseurs. The daughter of Vietnamese refugees, this 35 year old coffee pioneer is helping to bridge communities by promoting cultural awareness and sharing stories of the underrepresented.  Nguyen's accomplishments have been widely recognized by her industry and the media; this summer she graced the cover of Food & Wine magazine as one of "25 Game Changers." 

Food & Wine writes that "Vietnamese coffee culture is having its own moment here in America, in large part due to Nguyen."

But coffee founder Sahra Nguyen, 35, teaches Fred how to taste coffee like a pro and discusses the state of the coffee business and how she is bringing back Vietnamese coffee beans.

Nguyen is successfully transforming coffee culture with a focus on diversity, inclusion and sustainability.  She launched Nguyen Coffee Supply in 2018 in Brooklyn, NY. It&#39;s the first specialty coffee company in the U.S to celebrate, champion and import beans directly from family-owned coffee farmers in Vietnam—the second largest coffee producer in the world—roasting &#39;single-origin&#39; clean and organic beans prized by coffee connoisseurs. The daughter of Vietnamese refugees, this 35 year old coffee pioneer is helping to bridge communities by promoting cultural awareness and sharing stories of the underrepresented.  Nguyen&#39;s accomplishments have been widely recognized by her industry and the media; this summer she graced the cover of Food &#38; Wine magazine as one of &#34;25 Game Changers.&#34; 

Food &#38; Wine writes that &#34;Vietnamese coffee culture is having its own moment here in America, in large part due to Nguyen.&#34;

Clay Walker Bio
Discovered in a Beaumont area bar by noted producer and head of Giant Records James Stroud (Toby Keith, Tracy Lawrence, Tim McGraw, Kenny Rogers), Clay Walker was in his early twenties when he started rattling off a string of smash hits: “Live Until I Die,” "Dreaming With My Eyes Open," “This Woman And This Man,” "Hypnotize The Moon," "Rumor Has It," “Then What,” "I Can't Sleep" and "She Won't Be Lonely Long." 

Four platinum albums, more than 30 charted singles and 11 No. 1’s later, Texas-native Clay Walker has built a storied career blending country’s timeless themes with music-of-the-moment timeliness. Nowhere is this more apparent than on Walker’s debut Show Dog Nashville album ‘Texas To Tennessee’ (7.30). Certainly, the realities of place are as central as this comeback album's name implies: Nashville - busily working toward the next fresh hit; Texas - moving at its inimitable and familiar pace.  

Embracing the role of social media in today’s music industry, Walker has built a following of more than 1 million fans on TikTok.

Produced by Michael Knox (Jason Aldean) and chart-topping songwriter Jaron Boyer, ‘Texas To Tennessee' delivers smooth bore country that would feel right at home on any of Walker's four platinum CDs. It’s a modern album that nods at an earlier era in its time economy.

Oh yeah, and they sip six, count them, six whiskeys. (Note: This interview was recorded early in the covid pandemic.)

Whiskeys tasted:
Jack Daniel's Taster's Select (16:28)
Jack Daniel's Single Barrel (22:14)
Wild Turkey Revival (27:30)
Russell's Reserve 10 Year Barrel Pick (39:59)
Four Roses Single Barrel (45:38)
Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (52:27)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Craig talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
Craig uses a friend's house for the interview because the internet service at his place is "terrible."
Craig's daughters are big fans of TikTok, a space Fred hasn't mastered yet.
Campbell jumps into a song before the whiskey comes out, performing "The Whiskey's Fine."
The first whiskey poured is Jack Daniel's Taster's Select, and Craig has to grab a glass (although, to be fair, drinking whiskey straight from the bottle is probably pretty darn country).
Jack Daniel's Single Barrel comes next, and Fred chose JD because of Campbell's affinity for cinnamon and banana pudding.
They talk about why the word "whiskey" appears in a lot of country songs - Craig notes that it's a "man's drink," and if you drink it, "that means you're a bad-ass."
While Craig admits he can't find the banana flavor, he promises Fred he will try to dig into the bourbons more offline to try and train his palate.
Craig talks about being an independent artist versus having record deals.
Campbell explains that while he is often his own worst critic, he also is a big fan of himself. He believes when he listens to his own songs, he can spot ways to improve.
On the Wild Turkey Revival, Craig says, "The Turkey was ... stout."
It's onto the Russell's Reserve, and Campbell's palate finds the cinnamon almost immediately.
Craig is a coffee drinker, and he and Fred compare tasting coffee versus tasting bourbon. Only one involves actively slurping.
Campbell says when he sees Four Roses bourbon, he thinks of a "not-good whiskey." Fred tells him the fascinating history of why for some people, Four Roses once was not seen in a positive light. Of course, Jim Rutledge changed that.
Fred then dispels the myth that to be bourbon, it must be made in Kentucky. As a bonus, he drops a funny anecdote.
Craig's wife Mindy makes an appearance to jokingly make sure Fred isn't getting Craig drunk.
Campbell chooses his favorite as the Jack Daniel's Tasters Select, calling it the smoothest for his palate.
Craig closes out the session by playing his song, "You Can't Drown Misery With Whiskey."

QUOTABLES

Craig Campbell, on being signed to a record label: "The upside to having a record label is that if you are one of their guys, they will make it happen. But if you're not one of their guys, it will not happen."

In his 14 seasons in the league, Bradshaw helped lead the Steelers to four Super Bowl wins in a career that would lead him to induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989. Since 1994, Bradshaw has been an NFL analyst on Fox NFL Sunday. On the show, Fred and Terry sip some whiskey and talk about many things, from Bradshaw's brand of bourbon to his football career and plenty more.

I.W. Harper Vintage 1933 (1:10:00)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Jay talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
Terry is immediately impressed by the Fred Minnick logo mini-bottles.
He tells Fred how he came to release his bourbon, emphasizing the importance for him that he loved the bourbon he ultimately chose to release under his name. "I wanted it to have a wow impact. I wanted it to taste to last and not fade out on me."
Terry notes he didn't know anyone in the industry, nor did he have any clue how to launch a whiskey brand, before jumping in. He started by watching the film "Neat."
He doesn't like the fact it was immediately termed a "celebrity bourbon," but says, "Hey, it is what it is."
The 51.9 proof in the bourbon is also Bradshaw's career completion percentage in the NFL.
Fred says the Bradshaw Bourbon tastes more mature than its two years of aging.
There is a long and involved discussion of smelling things. Fred notes when he was in the agriculture business, he could smell fertilizer from five miles away.
When Terry first got into the bourbon business, he didn't know who Fred was, and then he discovered that Fred was "important" to what he was doing. "When I heard you liked me bourbon," Terry tells Fred, "it was like ... oh my god."
They try the Bradshaw Rye, and Fred gets sugar cookies and lots of spice. (Terry admits he's never been a "rye guy.")
Fred notes that two other former NFL stars - Peyton Manning and Charles Woodson - also are in the bourbon business now. Terry says he heard Manning's bourbon is highly expensive, and to Terry that means he isn't a "serious player" in the business. Bradshaw's bourbon hits around $40.
They move to the vintage Old Grand-Dad, which Fred says it is a "throwback" to when National Distillers was making its hay releasing 86-proof whiskeys. The one being tasted dates back to the 1970s, when Bradshaw was lighting up the NFL.
Fred talks about how distilling is different today than when the Old Grand-Dad was made, much the way football is different today than it was then. Fred then asks Terry if this particular whiskey reminds him of any game or play from the 1970s. "If I could drink a bunch of this, I could go back and tell you about some times," Terry says, laughing.
Terry: "I call it bourbon, I don't call it whiskey. Bourbon is a little sexier than whiskey."
Fred tells Terry he got into the bourbon business at just the right time. Terry then tells the story of how he picked his first barrel. Terry's pretty sure the master distiller who helped him was none other Jim Rutledge at Four Roses. He ended up doing it two more times - while also donating profits to Wounded Warriors - which is how he ultimately decided to get into the business.
Terry: "I have a little problem with my preacher. They think I am some kind of heathen."
Terry: "I get the feeling I would become an alcoholic before I ever got good at this."
Terry talks about a scene he wants to shoot a scene that has a James Bond theme. Sadly, Bond was a vodka drinker. Terry chimes in: "I don't like vodka. I can't stand gin. Tequila, you can have. If I drink beer I have one beer and that's enough for me. I'm a bourbon drinker."

Waybill was front man for 1970s-1980s hitmakers The Tubes and also worked with artists such as Toto, Richard Marx and Bryan Adams. He also has appeared on television and film, including a cameo in "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure." He sits down with Fred to talk about his diverse career, getting back to touring, the band's reputation for being over the top and, of course, he tastes some bourbon.

Whiskeys tasted:
Chapin and Gore Vintage (06:10)
291 Colorado Whiskey (19:33)
Barrell Bourbon 15 Year Old (53:14)
Diplomatico Rum (1:06:00)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Fee talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
They start with the Chapin and Gore whiskey from the 1970s, which is around the time when The Tubes were just bursting onto the music landscape.
Fred gives Fee a quick education on what bourbon is versus whiskey.
Fee talks about performing in the early days, telling the story of his stage manager Chopper always having a joint rolled and ready for him when he walked off stage. When he started drinking, it began with Jack Daniel's. These days, it's single malt Scotch whisky.
Fred asks about Fee's on-camera chemistry with David Letterman. Turns out Fee knew Letterman's girlfriend, who was a huge fan of The Tubes.
They move to the 291 Colorado Whiskey, and Fee immediately exclaims, "Oh, it's hot!" But his taste buds quickly acclimate.
Talk turns to the inability for artists to make money from streaming. "The only way we can make money these days is by live performance and selling merchandise," Fee says. Of course, the pandemic wiped out most of that income.
Fee talks about the timeline of The Tubes, which broke up in the 1980s, but got back together in 1994. They're still together, although they haven't played a live show since January 2020, thanks to covid. Plans are in the works for live shows later this summer.
Fee recalls when the band "ruled" San Francisco, back in the days when they would put topless girls onstage to dance during shows. In Kansas City, they had to play under a $10,000 "obscenity bond." But fee insists there was no truth to the rumors of live sex onstage.
He talks about meeting Richard Marx and about recording the Tubes' hit "She's a Beauty." The two became good friends, and Fee has written many songs with him. Much of their work culminated in a Fee Waybill solo album.
The Barrell Bourbon is broken out, but Fee admits he's "Pretty much done already." The high-proof Colorado Whiskey tends to do that.
Then Fee starts talking about Pavarotti and a duet he did with James Brown. Pavarotti sang his part in Italian, and the Tubes ended up performing a parody of it.
Fred goes to the subject of Fee's acting career, and Fee says he is "obsessed" with making it to Broadway. Specifically, he wants to play the part of the King in "Hamilton." He then tells the story of being cast as Frankfurter in a production of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Fee's dog Daisy makes a brief appearance.
They go to the final pour, Diplomatico rum.
Fee picks the Barrell Bourbon as his favorite of the session.

Waybill was front man for 1970s-1980s hitmakers The Tubes and also worked with artists such as Toto, Richard Marx and Bryan Adams. He also has appeared on television and film, including a cameo in "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure." He sits down with Fred to talk about his diverse career, getting back to touring, the band's reputation for being over the top and, of course, he tastes some bourbon.

Whiskeys tasted:
Chapin and Gore Vintage (06:10)
291 Colorado Whiskey (19:33)
Barrell Bourbon 15 Year Old (53:14)
Diplomatico Rum (1:06:00)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Fee talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
They start with the Chapin and Gore whiskey from the 1970s, which is around the time when The Tubes were just bursting onto the music landscape.
Fred gives Fee a quick education on what bourbon is versus whiskey.
Fee talks about performing in the early days, telling the story of his stage manager Chopper always having a joint rolled and ready for him when he walked off stage. When he started drinking, it began with Jack Daniel's. These days, it's single malt Scotch whisky.
Fred asks about Fee's on-camera chemistry with David Letterman. Turns out Fee knew Letterman's girlfriend, who was a huge fan of The Tubes.
They move to the 291 Colorado Whiskey, and Fee immediately exclaims, "Oh, it's hot!" But his taste buds quickly acclimate.
Talk turns to the inability for artists to make money from streaming. "The only way we can make money these days is by live performance and selling merchandise," Fee says. Of course, the pandemic wiped out most of that income.

E-40, whose given name is Earl Stevens, is well known as a pioneer of West Coast rap, the founder of Sick Wid it Records, and a collaborator with artists like Tupac Shakur, Lil Jon, Snoop Dogg and countless others. E-40 also is a purveyor of spirits, from wine to cognac to tequila to his new bourbon brand, Kuiper Belt. During this week's interview, Earl and Fred sip whiskey (obviously) and discuss topics such as his spirits brands, how hip hop would be different if Tupac was still alive, San Francisco 49ers football, and a lot more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Russell's Reserve Barrel Pick (12:34)
Eagle Rare Vintage 1970s (31:48)
Old Schenley Vintage 1940s (53:54)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and E-40 talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
They start things off by talking about E-40's bourbon, Kuiper Belt 8 Year Whiskey, which Fred calls one of the better sourced bourbons he's had in some time. Look for more releases coming soon.
Among his many ventures, E-40 even has a cookbook coming out under the moniker Goon With a Spoon.
The first whiskey in the session is a Russell's Reserve barrel pick, which Fred says has a similar flavor profile to Kuiper Belt. They do a side by side tasting, and E-40 quickly exclaims, "Kuiper Belt got 'em!"
Fred shifts to talking football, and the recent draft pick by the San Francisco 49ers, of which the Bay-area native E-40 is a big fan. The rapper predicts big things for Trey Lance. Talk then turns to Steve Young and Joe Montana. And then? Colin Kaepernick.
Talk then turns to E-40's life in the 1990s, when he was making his ascent, along with what he was drinking in those days. Back then, he always mixed bourbon with Coca-Cola. "I wanted it to last all damn day," he says. "All gas, no brake pads."
Fred asks what Tupac was drinking during the day, and E-40 offers some interesting commentary at around the 23:00 mark. The choice in those days was Hennessy Cognac. Today? E-40 feels sure it would be his brand, Tycoon Cognac. Why? Because Tupac was all about supporting black-owned business and products.
E-40 mentions that he misses his friend, and also brings up another friend, Biggie Smalls. He and Fred talk about what the hip hop industry would be like if they were alive today. "One thing 'Pac did was uplift the inner-city spirits," E-40 says. "Whether it was female or male. No matter what you were going through, he had something to say that was going to uplift your spirits."
Branching off a conversation about family, Fred talks about how the international bourbon community has become a family. At that point, E-40 says, "Can I stop you for a minute? I'm drunk!" He then says, "I'm getting in the studio tonight! I'll probably write the dopest rap ever." It's been a while since Fred has laughed this hard on the show.
As they head into tasting the vintage Eagle Rare, E-40 collects himself and talks about why he likes to help young rappers, such as Jeezy. E-40's son Droop-E, also a rapper, comes into the conversation, along with the evolution of hip hop.
We briefly get into what would happen if E-40 was a deep sea fisherman on Clubhouse.
He talks about growing up with a single mother - after age 8, at least - and how life for his family was difficult. As the oldest of four, however, he knew he had to "figure it out." But, he said, "I did it." They bust out the Old Schenley to toast to E-40's mom.
Then check out a story about the fate of one of his platinum records, as well as some other personal belongings. It's a story he clearly is still frustrated by, but he vowed to let it go. Fred responds with a story of his own that turned out better, but was similarly frustrating.
Will Fred ever launch his own bourbon brand? Two or three years ago, he would have said "never." But covid helped change his thinking....]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, the great E-40, the legendary rapper and hip hop artist, joins the show.

Ndamukong Suh Tells All</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[On this edition of The Fred Minnick Show, NFL defensive end Ndamukong Suh joins Fred for an interview and a few whiskeys. Suh was a No. 2 overall draft pick by the Detroit Lions who has gone on to be a five-time All-Pro, as well as Defensive Rookie of the Year in his first season, 2010. During this episode, Fred Ndamukong talk about what it's like to win a Super Bowl, the ongoing saga with Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Portland, Oregon, and whiskey.

Whiskeys tasted:
Spirits of French Lick Four Grain (7:04)
291 Colorado Whiskey (9:31)
Chapin & Gore Vintage 1960s (18:49)
Gregarious Grump Rum 12 Year (24:23)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Ndamukong talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
First things first: What's it like to win the Super Bowl? Ndamukong says it was nice to "get the monkey off his back" after being unsuccessful in his first attempt with the Rams. His hope is his current team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, can get back there again after the 2021 season as well.
He says the defense executed its game plan to near perfection in the dominant win over the Kansas City Chiefs. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was running for his life all evening.
They discuss Lori Locust and Maral Javadifar, female coaches in the NFL who work for the Buccaneers.
Peyton Manning comes into the conversation. His comment on Suh was that he wanted to say only nice things so as not to make Ndamukong mad.
Ndamukong talks about projects he's working on in his home of Portland, Oregon. He has developed a company with a friend that, among other things, is to help facilitate affordable housing for those who need it.
Suh's philosophy is to empower people by giving them a sense of ownership in their community.
He then describes the 291 Colorado Whiskey as "definitely powerful."
Fred jokingly compares the 1960s-era Chapin & Gore to 1960s football, when you could "poke a guy in the eye and smoke a cigarette on the sideline."
They talk about free agency and the off-season NFL drama. Suh follows it mostly because it's hard not to, given how much moves and situations get talked about.
He calls the Aaron Rodgers situation "interesting." Like most of us, he would be interested in hearing some of the details. "It seems like it's a little bit of a fractured relationship," Suh says. "Get some charcuterie boards and some cheese, and have a nice sit-down with some bourbon."
They talk about playing a season during covid and playing on a team with Tom Brady. Suh describes what he terms "a challenge," from constant masking, daily testing and staying focused. But he described a team in which everyone focused on doing their jobs and achieving a team goal.
They then discuss the difficulty of having to "pivot" to change a game plan at the last minute. He, of course, is referring to the team nearly losing to the Washington Football Team and quarterback Tyler Heinecke.
Fred tells Ndamukong the high-proof flight he prepared for the show was "the equivalent to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' defensive line."

QUOTABLES

Ndamukong Suh on Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers: "Ton of respect for him. I think he's been able to do a lot of successful things in his career - a quarterback I would consider for sure playing with, even though we've had our own feuding on the field. ... We've lipped quite a bite. All in good fun on the football field."

They talk about playing a season during covid and playing on a team with Tom Brady. Suh describes what he terms "a challenge," from constant masking, daily testing and staying focused. But he described a team in which everyone focused on doing their jobs and achieving a team goal.
They then discuss the difficulty of having to "pivot" to change a game plan at the last minute. He, of course, is referring to the team nearly losing to the Washington Football Team and quarterback Tyler Heinecke.
Fred tells Ndamukong the high-proof flight he prepared for the show was "the equivalent to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' defensive line."

QUOTABLES

Ndamukong Suh on Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers: "Ton of respect for him. I think he's been able to do a lot of successful things in his career - a quarterback I would consider for sure playing with, even though we've had our own feuding on the field. ... We've lipped quite a bite. All in good fun on the football field."

Suh was a No. 2 overall draft pick by the Detroit Lions who has gone on to be a five-time All-Pro, as well as Defensive Rookie of the Year in his first season, 2010. During this episode, Fred Ndamukong talk about what it&#39;s like to win a Super Bowl, the ongoing saga with Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Portland, Oregon, and whiskey.

Whiskeys tasted:
Spirits of French Lick Four Grain (7:04)
291 Colorado Whiskey (9:31)
Chapin &#38; Gore Vintage 1960s (18:49)
Gregarious Grump Rum 12 Year (24:23)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Ndamukong talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
First things first: What&#39;s it like to win the Super Bowl? Ndamukong says it was nice to &#34;get the monkey off his back&#34; after being unsuccessful in his first attempt with the Rams. His hope is his current team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, can get back there again after the 2021 season as well.
He says the defense executed its game plan to near perfection in the dominant win over the Kansas City Chiefs. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was running for his life all evening.
They discuss Lori Locust and Maral Javadifar, female coaches in the NFL who work for the Buccaneers.
Peyton Manning comes into the conversation. His comment on Suh was that he wanted to say only nice things so as not to make Ndamukong mad.
Ndamukong talks about projects he&#39;s working on in his home of Portland, Oregon. He has developed a company with a friend that, among other things, is to help facilitate affordable housing for those who need it.
Suh&#39;s philosophy is to empower people by giving them a sense of ownership in their community.
He then describes the 291 Colorado Whiskey as &#34;definitely powerful.&#34;
Fred jokingly compares the 1960s-era Chapin &#38; Gore to 1960s football, when you could &#34;poke a guy in the eye and smoke a cigarette on the sideline.&#34;
They talk about free agency and the off-season NFL drama. Suh follows it mostly because it&#39;s hard not to, given how much moves and situations get talked about.
He calls the Aaron Rodgers situation &#34;interesting.&#34; Like most of us, he would be interested in hearing some of the details. &#34;It seems like it&#39;s a little bit of a fractured relationship,&#34; Suh says. &#34;Get some charcuterie boards and some cheese, and have a nice sit-down with some bourbon.&#34;

Born in Atlanta, the 25-year-old Lorin began singing at age 12 and went on to launch her career by way of the reality singing show, "Next Big Thing." Her newest single "Shoot a Man" is out now. On the show, she and Fred discuss pot stills, southern food, skiing, the music business and, of course, bourbon.

Whiskeys tasted:
Willett Pot Still (6:45)
291 Colorado Whiskey (16:29)
Lagavulin 16 Year Old (26:43)
Foursquare Rum 12 Year Old (38:43)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Rachel talk about a wide variety of subjects, such as:
Rachel's first taste of whiskey came when she was a baby and her dad put whiskey on her gums to help relieve teething pain.
Fred describes what a pot still is for Rachel as they start to sip the Willett Pot Still.
She talks about her new song, "Shoot a Man," which is a fictional story set in a saloon.
Fred goes through his standard tasting techniques to get Rachel started on her flight. Then she tastes it and says, "Whoo! This is going to put hair on my chest!"
Her standard spirit while touring is Hennessy cognac.
Rachel is hopeful she can embark on another tour this year, with covid restrictions lifting across the U.S. "It's going to be good to be back on stage. It's going to feel weird."
They talk about pairing fried chicken with bourbon. Rachel suggests throwing in some waffles for good measure. Fred jokes that this episode is sponsored by the American Heart Association. (Hear that, AHA? It was just a joke.)
They then go to the 291 Colorado Whiskey, which is over 130 proof. Fred warns her that it's likely going to come in hot, or as he put it, it's "more in a feisty zone." She takes a drink and admits it "has a bite."
They talk about her hit tune "Kerosene" briefly, which recently hit 1 million streams on Spotify, which leads them to talk about the music streaming industry.
She then talks about how the sometimes slow pace of releasing music can drive her a little nuts.
The peaty aroma of the Lagavulin catches Rachel off guard; she decides to "let it breathe for a minute."
She talks about her musical influences as she was growing up, which, interestingly, leaned toward classic rock. She notes she was in a Journey cover band when she was a teen-ager. But the band she's seen perform live the most is Muse.
Fred says his favorite concert of all time was a birthday surprise from his wife to see Garth Brooks in a small setting in Las Vegas.
They finish the session with the Barbados-made Foursquare rum. Rachel's response is "Wow."
When it's all said and done, the Lagavulin is Rachel's favorite.

Rodney and Fred talk about his new book, "Rodney Scott's World of BBQ," chicken thighs, cooking with bourbon, shopping for meat, and of course, pairing meat with bourbon.

Michter's 10 Year (7:43)
Woodinville Finished in Port Casks (14:10)
Blood Oath Finished in Cognac Casks (29:18)
291 Colorado Whiskey (49:29)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Rodney talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
Fred starts right off with the hard-hitting questions, asking Rodney if he drinks bourbon while is in the barbecue pit. Rodney confirms that he does.
The first pour, the Michter's, was Fred's first bourbon in four days. "When you drink for a living, sometimes you have to schedule some off time," he notes.
The Michter's inspires Rodney to pair it with pulled pork or maybe dark meat chicken, like a thigh, then he explains the optimal way to smoke chicken thighs. Fred admits he's already getting hungry.
Fred asks Rodney for the "secret sauce" to making great barbecue and doesn't get much out of Rodney. Hey, why give away trade secrets?
They talk about using bourbon as a marinade and how to utilize it in grilling.
Mustard slaw or mayonnaise slaw? Rodney was raised on the latter: "I am an adult today because of mayonnaise slaw." Fred leans mustard-style.
Fred talks about his days raising pigs.
They ponder what's special about barbecue and why it brings people together. Rodney attributes it to natural human curiosity.
They talk about what Rodney's accomplishments as a barbecue chef have affected the world of barbecue overall.
They agree the Blood Oath would be a great pairing with barbecue - Rodney jokes that it might be best to enjoy that one when you're not in charge of dinner because "it invites you back in." Nevertheless, Rodney thinks smoked turkey and beans would be good pairings.
Fred circles back to Rodney's "secrets," and insists he's holding out. "You gotta put on the right tunes. You gotta be in a good mood," Rodney says.
Fred opines that restaurants will never go away because they are too important to our culture. Rodney agrees.
They talk about the recent "attack" on meat. Rodney says, "Say what you want about meat, I'm going to eat meat. I'm going to cook meat."
Fred: "You want to be a vegan, eat a carrot." But why vilify meat? And why try to copy it by turning plants into fake meat? Carnivores can relate.
Rodney suggests pairing steak with the 291 Colorado Whiskey. Something like a bone-in ribeye.
The barbecue chef talks about what he looks for when buying meat - pay attention, backyard barbecuers. (One hint: Always get the jumbo wings.)
Rodney compartmentalizes his bourbon flight, saying he would choose the Michter's 10 Year first if a friend came over. But he would be selfish with the 291.

QUOTABLES

Rodney Scott on why barbecue brings people together: "One of the things that strikes our curiosity to draw us into barbecue so much is the fact that, one, you're cooking with fire; two, we know that you're cooking some type of protein. And the last thing that's going to keep you there is how is your protein going to be different than what I had before? That curiosity is such a natural thing. It's almost automatic."

Fred asks Rodney for the &#34;secret sauce&#34; to making great barbecue and doesn&#39;t get much out of Rodney. Hey, why give away trade secrets?
They talk about using bourbon as a marinade and how to utilize it in grilling.
Mustard slaw or mayonnaise slaw? Rodney was raised on the latter: &#34;I am an adult today because of mayonnaise slaw.&#34; Fred leans mustard-style.
Fred talks about his days raising pigs.
They ponder what&#39;s special about barbecue and why it brings people together. Rodney attributes it to natural human curiosity.
They talk about what Rodney&#39;s accomplishments as a barbecue chef have affected the world of barbecue overall.
They agree the Blood Oath would be a great pairing with barbecue - Rodney jokes that it might be best to enjoy that one when you&#39;re not in charge of dinner because &#34;it invites you back in.&#34; Nevertheless, Rodney thinks smoked turkey and beans would be good pairings.
Fred circles back to Rodney&#39;s &#34;secrets,&#34; and insists he&#39;s holding out. &#34;You gotta put on the right tunes. You gotta be in a good mood,&#34; Rodney says.
Fred opines that restaurants will never go away because they are too important to our culture. Rodney agrees.
They talk about the recent &#34;attack&#34; on meat. Rodney says, &#34;Say what you want about meat, I&#39;m going to eat meat. I&#39;m going to cook meat.&#34;
Fred: &#34;You want to be a vegan, eat a carrot.&#34; But why vilify meat? And why try to copy it by turning plants into fake meat? Carnivores can relate.
Rodney suggests pairing steak with the 291 Colorado Whiskey. Something like a bone-in ribeye.
The barbecue chef talks about what he looks for when buying meat - pay attention, backyard barbecuers. (One hint: Always get the jumbo wings.)
Rodney compartmentalizes his bourbon flight, saying he would choose the Michter&#39;s 10 Year first if a friend came over. But he would be selfish with the 291.

QUOTABLES

Rodney Scott on why barbecue brings people together: &#34;One of the things that strikes our curiosity to draw us into barbecue so much is the fact that, one, you&#39;re cooking with fire; two, we know that you&#39;re cooking some type of protein. And the last thing that&#39;s going to keep you there is how is your protein going to be different than what I had before? That curiosity is such a natural thing. It&#39;s almost automatic.&#34;

During the interview, she and Fred talk about life during Covid, her book The Firsts: The Inside Story of the Women Reshaping Congress, women's roles in history, meatloaf, the beef industry and plenty more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Old Forester 117 Series (14:59)
Johnnie Walker Green Label (28:11)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Steve touch on plenty, such as:
Jennifer offers a look at her 2020 book and how it pays tribute to the women coming up through U.S. Congress.
Fred admits he prefers working with women, in part because of communication. Steinhaur offers interesting insights.
Talk briefly turns to sexual misconduct and harassment in the military (a topic Jennifer covers often) and Fred's experience working with women during his service in the Army.
The whiskey comes out, and they talk about how women tend to be excellent tasters and why.
Jennifer loves the tough-to-find Old Forester 117 Series, describing it as "her new favorite thing ever." Fred suggests Old Forester 1920 as a whiskey that's easy to find and has a similar flavor profile.
On the Johnnie Walker Green Label, Jennifer says it tastes like a "high school bonfire."
Along the way, Fred offers up a brief history of Scotch whiskey.
About halfway through, Jennifer goes into her love of meatloaf and the meatloaf cookbook she co-authored. Bottom line, it's easy to make and it's affordable.
They then talk about the future of eating beef amid environmental concerns about how it is raised.
Conversation then turns to the current difficulty of, well, having productive conversations. Fred posits that it would be great if whiskey could be the universal conversation conduit.
Fred talks about drinking certain whiskey neat versus with ice or in cocktails.
They briefly delve into the world of book nerds and the difficulty of writing a book proposal. Jennifer asserts that the proposal often seems more difficult than writing the book itself.
Fred talks about "the return of rye," rye history and MGP's role.
The topic of glassware comes up. Fred prefers a glass that "shows the whiskey." He of course then sings the praises of the Glencairn glass.
Ultimately, Jennifer chooses Old Forester as her favorite of the flight.

QUOTABLES

Jennifer Steinhaur, on women's likelihood to be good collaborators and problem-solvers: "I think women naturally, in the workplace and in their family lives, have to find themselves in that kind of mediator mode. Sometimes it is the role we have to embrace in very male spaces. ... Sometimes, perhaps that plays out in the legislature and the workplace in a way that can be favorable to outcomes."

Czaban is a veteran of Fox Sports Radio, Yahoo Sports Radio and others, and his Steve Czaban Show currently airs on 97.3 The Game in Virginia. During the interview, he and Fred discuss what might happen if Fred's bourbon fell off the shelves, mindfulness, Stitzel-Weller, modern sports media and more, all while tasting and comparing three different whiskeys.

Whiskeys tasted:
Belfour Straight Rye (8:20)
Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond 8 Year (20:14)
Doc Swinson's 15 Year Old (24:37)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Steve touch on plenty, such as:
They come right out of the gate trying to name Fred's studio space, starting with the possible name "The Bunghole." Let's hope that one doesn't stick.
The Belfour sparks conversation about the "Kentucky chew."
They engage in conversation about mindfulness and applying it to aromas and flavor.
Pappy Van Winkle bourbon comes into the conversation briefly.
Fred talks about how high whiskey can go in terms of proof and why.
Steve compares a non-soccer fan watching soccer to a rookie whiskey drinker drinking whiskey - you know whether you like it or not, but you can't really explain why.
Fred talks about his grading system for spirits.
They then engage in conversation about modern sports media ... and how bad so much of it is. They take well deserved shots at Stephen A. Smith and Skip Bayless, and ESPN shows like Around the Horn. Steve calls it, "Completely non-nutritious for a thinking person."
They agree that the best way to enjoy whiskey is with friends. It provides a nice transition from making fun of yelling sports talk hosts to agreeing on enjoying whiskey any way you choose.
That said, don't be mixing Coke with your Pappy.
Yes, Jack Daniel's is technically bourbon.
Steve chooses the Belfour as his favorite because the bottle reminds him of the Stanley Cup.
Fred proclaims that "whiskey rocks are lame."

QUOTABLES

Steve Czaban, on modern sports talk broadcasting, "The stuff that is churned out by ESPN every day is so laughably bad. I say to myself, who on Earth watches this and thinks, 'Yeah, Stephen A. [Smith], that's a perfectly solid opinion.' Nobody with a brain."

The former tackle for the Baltimore Ravens, Tennessee Titans and Carolina Panthers talks with Fred about his playing career, the well-known film, overcoming obstacles, barbecue and more, while also sipping a few select whiskeys, including some Pappy Van Winkle.

Whiskeys tasted:
Old Fitzgerald 14 Year 2020 Fall (7:17)
Michter's 10 Year (12:38)
Penelope Four Grain Cask Strength (29:13)
291 Colorado Whiskey (36:30)
Jefferson's Rye Finished in Cognac Barrels (43:04)
Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year (48:59)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Michael touch on a variety of subjects, such as:
Fred immediately puts Michael on the spot by asking which of his former teammates would be most likely to steal his Pappy Van Winkle. Michael only goes so far as saying it would probably be a defensive lineman.
Fred sent Michael six whiskeys. Michael said he isn't a big drinker but that he thinks socially drinking whiskey is the way to go.
Oher says the physical rigors of football mean there wasn't much alcohol in the locker rooms he was in.
He also talks about current Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson and his athleticism and elusiveness. Oher also expresses plenty of respect for former Ravens signal caller Joe Flacco.
Oher: "Fans don't realize they're the ones making all this go."
The movie "The Blind Side" was preceded by the book "The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game" by Michael Lewis.
Michael talks about his plan to open a school for at-risk youths. His hope is to offer the "push" to young people like he got when he could have gone down the wrong path. "You have to give them the benefit of the doubt, give them that chance."
Inevitably, the Popeye's chicken sandwich enters the conversation. Michael says he hasn't had one in a while because he's trying to lose his "covid 25."
Fred compares the 133 proof 291 Colorado Whiskey to a "raunchy" defensive lineman, name dropping the Rams' Aaron Donald.
Michael talks about how his football injuries and other life difficulties set him back at times and that a new book project he is working on is about overcoming obstacles of all kinds. "This will be the best [book] yet for people who can't get over the hump," he says, adding, "You can do whatever you put your mind to." He also says, "You can find all the answers in the mirror."
Fred then shares how he overcame his issues with PTSD after returning home from serving in Iraq.
Fred notes that the Jefferson's Rye finished in cognac barrels is one of his favorite whiskeys of the year.
The conversation turns to barbecue. Michael is a brisket guy and says he's mostly into dry rubs for seasoning the meat. "I want you to taste my hard work," he says, explaining why he doesn't sauce up the smoked goods.
They taste the Pappy 20 year and Fred admits that he may like it better than his preferred 15 year expression.
Fred asks Michael what it felt like to be drafted into the NFL. Michael says, given the difficult road he traveled to get there, "to finally hear my name called, tears of joy just poured down. ... I still can't believe to this very day that I got drafted. I can't get used to the things it provided to me. ... I can't describe it because I still can't believe it."

QUOTABLES

Oher, on his feelings about the film and the part of his life it depicts: "It's very inspiring, very motivating. There are so many other Michael Ohers out there that need a way out. ... I could have dropped out of school in sixth grade. ... I didn't have anybody to show me the way out, so I had to do it on my own."

Michael talks about how his football injuries and other life difficulties set him back at times and that a new book project he is working on is about overcoming obstacles of all kinds. "This will be the best [book] yet for people who can't get over the hump," he says, adding, "You can do whatever you put your mind to." He also says, "You can find all the answers in the mirror."
Fred then shares how he overcame his issues with PTSD after returning home from serving in Iraq.
Fred notes that the Jefferson's Rye finished in cognac barrels is one of his favorite whiskeys of the year.
The conversation turns to barbecue. Michael is a brisket guy and says he's mostly into dry rubs for seasoning the meat. "I want you to taste my hard work," he says, explaining why he doesn't sauce up the smoked goods.
They taste the Pappy 20 year and Fred admits that he may like it better than his preferred 15 year expression.
Fred asks Michael what it felt like to be drafted into the NFL. Michael says, given the difficult road he traveled to get there, "to finally hear my name called, tears of joy just poured down. ... I still can't believe to this very day that I got drafted. I can't get used to the things it provided to me. ... I can't describe it because I still can't believe it."

QUOTABLES

Oher, on his feelings about the film and the part of his life it depicts: "It's very inspiring, very motivating. There are so many other Michael Ohers out there that need a way out. ... I could have dropped out of school in sixth grade. ... I didn't have anybody to show me the way out, so I had to do it on my own."

The former tackle for the Baltimore Ravens, Tennessee Titans and Carolina Panthers talks with Fred about his playing career, the well-known film, overcoming obstacles, barbecue and more, while also sipping a few select whiskeys, including some Pappy Van Winkle.

Whiskeys tasted:
Old Fitzgerald 14 Year 2020 Fall (7:17)
Michter&#39;s 10 Year (12:38)
Penelope Four Grain Cask Strength (29:13)
291 Colorado Whiskey (36:30)
Jefferson&#39;s Rye Finished in Cognac Barrels (43:04)
Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year (48:59)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Michael touch on a variety of subjects, such as:
Fred immediately puts Michael on the spot by asking which of his former teammates would be most likely to steal his Pappy Van Winkle. Michael only goes so far as saying it would probably be a defensive lineman.
Fred sent Michael six whiskeys. Michael said he isn&#39;t a big drinker but that he thinks socially drinking whiskey is the way to go.
Oher says the physical rigors of football mean there wasn&#39;t much alcohol in the locker rooms he was in.
He also talks about current Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson and his athleticism and elusiveness. Oher also expresses plenty of respect for former Ravens signal caller Joe Flacco.
Oher: &#34;Fans don&#39;t realize they&#39;re the ones making all this go.&#34;
The movie &#34;The Blind Side&#34; was preceded by the book &#34;The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game&#34; by Michael Lewis.
Michael talks about his plan to open a school for at-risk youths. His hope is to offer the &#34;push&#34; to young people like he got when he could have gone down the wrong path. &#34;You have to give them the benefit of the doubt, give them that chance.&#34;
Inevitably, the Popeye&#39;s chicken sandwich enters the conversation. Michael says he hasn&#39;t had one in a while because he&#39;s trying to lose his &#34;covid 25.&#34;
Fred compares the 133 proof 291 Colorado Whiskey to a &#34;raunchy&#34; defensive lineman, name dropping the Rams&#39; Aaron Donald.

Bryan, who was named an "Artist of Tomorrow" at the 2016 Grammys, drops her new album Fresh Start this week, and that was a big part of the conversation. They also rapped about surviving the covid pandemic, staying creative in the face of uncertainty, her first song, her evolving influences, learning about bourbon, sipping whiskey from a bowl and plenty more. Enjoy!

Whiskeys tasted:
Kuiper Belt 8 Year Kentucky Bourbon (4:03)
Westland American Single Malt 2015 Barrel Pick (18:44)
Wyoming Whiskey National Parks Limited Edition Bourbon (31:49)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Bailey talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
The first order of business was to talk about Bailey's new album Fresh Start, which drops May 7. She said the album is about "life, love and the pursuit of confidence."
The second order of business was to get to drinking, starting with Fred giving Bailey his tutorial on bourbon sipping. The first whiskey they tasted was a new one to the market: Kuiper Belt.
Bailey talks about how she first knew she was going to be a musician. It includes her being 4 years old and singing the first song she ever wrote, "Pickles in the Forest."
The 23-year-old started playing guitar at age 12, and for the next three or four years she "just wanted to be Taylor Swift."
They talk about the fact that musical genres have opened up in recent years, so that performers aren't pressured into "fitting into a box."
One of Bailey's bourbons got shifted from her glass into a bowl. Hey, she didn't want to waste good whiskey.
Fred re-ruins Chipotle for Bailey.
Bailey accidentally drinks the Westland a little too quickly. Oops.
They talk coffee and lavender for a couple of minutes, relating to Bailey's growing up near Seattle.
Bailey talks about the transition of moving from the Pacific Northwest to Nashville and the things she misses - like the beach.
They go into pairing whiskeys with Bailey Bryan songs.
Kuiper Belt ends up being Bailey's favorite - she also learns she is not a fan of peaty whiskey.
They circle back to talking about Fresh Start, the title track and the concept behind the album. She goes into how 2020 shaped the album, and her writing style, creatively, as well as what she has learned: that life is a series of fresh starts.

QUOTABLES

Bailey on becoming a singer-songwriter: "I can't remember a time when I didn't want to do music. It's the only thing I'm super good at and enjoy ... I always have written songs and made up dances, and made my parents and my friends watch them. I've always liked attention, and that bodes well for me as an artist."

He and Fred dive into Derek's new book, "Over the Fire Cooking," sip bourbon and enjoy some lively conversation. Along the way, they hit on topics like pairing whiskey to grilled meats, being a grilling god, cooking on an open fire and types of woods best for attaining "clean smoke." Grab some grilled meat and a bourbon and join them.

Whiskeys tasted:
Maker's Mark Private Selection USO Warrior Spirit (6:44)
Nashville Barrel Co. Small Batch Rye (27: 27)
Elijah Craig Barrel Proof A121 (39:47)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Derek dig into a variety of topics:
The Maker's Mark private barrel pick opens up the show with a discussion of oak and aging techniques employed by the distillery.
They talk about the similarities of tasting bourbon versus tasting food. Wolf compares high-proof whiskey and getting adventurous when seasoning food. (He recommends cinnamon on steak to accentuate peppery spice.)
Fred asks Derek what he would grill to go with the Maker's Mark, and he immediately goes to lots of garlic and peppercorn steak.
Derek talks about his joy of testing the boundaries of flavor pairings.
Wolf talks about his shift from Corporate America (he worked at an accounting firm in Nashville) to becoming an open-fire cook. He is quick to point out that he has no formal culinary training. "You don't have to be a chef to do this," he says.
Derek calls himself "the Ron Swanson of social media," calling out the beloved if gruff Parks & Recreation TV character.
Fred calls Derek a "grilling god," while Derek himself claims only to be "a pyro and a meathead."
The Nashville Barrel Rye conjures apple and cinnamon notes, according to Derek, and Fred notes it is unlike most MGP ryes.
Fred has Derek list his five favorite seasonings per protein. Take notes on this one, folks. Don't sleep on the smoked tequila salt.
Derek then talks about the best woods to use for open-fire cooking. Much like with bourbon, white oak is a go-to, he says. He also notes red oak and white oak, while hickory can be "overpowering" and mesquite can be overly smoky. The goal? Clean smoke.
They go back to do side-by-side tastings of the three whiskeys in their flights, and Derek chooses Elijah Craig as his favorite of the session. Fred concurs.
They then talk about the art of tasting and identifying specific flavors in various spirits.
Derek tells the story of arguing with his wife's grandmother about how to cook steak. Awkward but funny. And the payoff is that Nana was right and Derek was right as well, thanks to how cooking techniques have evolved over the decades.
Interested in getting into open-fire cooking? Derek Wolf has some tips for you.

He and Fred dive into Derek&#39;s new book, &#34;Over the Fire Cooking,&#34; sip bourbon and enjoy some lively conversation. Along the way, they hit on topics like pairing whiskey to grilled meats, being a grilling god, cooking on an open fire and types of woods best for attaining &#34;clean smoke.&#34; Grab some grilled meat and a bourbon and join them.

Whiskeys tasted:
Maker&#39;s Mark Private Selection USO Warrior Spirit (6:44)
Nashville Barrel Co. Small Batch Rye (27: 27)
Elijah Craig Barrel Proof A121 (39:47)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Derek dig into a variety of topics:
The Maker&#39;s Mark private barrel pick opens up the show with a discussion of oak and aging techniques employed by the distillery.
They talk about the similarities of tasting bourbon versus tasting food. Wolf compares high-proof whiskey and getting adventurous when seasoning food. (He recommends cinnamon on steak to accentuate peppery spice.)
Fred asks Derek what he would grill to go with the Maker&#39;s Mark, and he immediately goes to lots of garlic and peppercorn steak.
Derek talks about his joy of testing the boundaries of flavor pairings.
Wolf talks about his shift from Corporate America (he worked at an accounting firm in Nashville) to becoming an open-fire cook. He is quick to point out that he has no formal culinary training. &#34;You don&#39;t have to be a chef to do this,&#34; he says.
Derek calls himself &#34;the Ron Swanson of social media,&#34; calling out the beloved if gruff Parks &#38; Recreation TV character.
Fred calls Derek a &#34;grilling god,&#34; while Derek himself claims only to be &#34;a pyro and a meathead.&#34;
The Nashville Barrel Rye conjures apple and cinnamon notes, according to Derek, and Fred notes it is unlike most MGP ryes.
Fred has Derek list his five favorite seasonings per protein. Take notes on this one, folks. Don&#39;t sleep on the smoked tequila salt.
Derek then talks about the best woods to use for open-fire cooking. Much like with bourbon, white oak is a go-to, he says. He also notes red oak and white oak, while hickory can be &#34;overpowering&#34; and mesquite can be overly smoky. The goal? Clean smoke.
They go back to do side-by-side tastings of the three whiskeys in their flights, and Derek chooses Elijah Craig as his favorite of the session. Fred concurs.
They then talk about the art of tasting and identifying specific flavors in various spirits.
Derek tells the story of arguing with his wife&#39;s grandmother about how to cook steak. Awkward but funny. And the payoff is that Nana was right and Derek was right as well, thanks to how cooking techniques have evolved over the decades.
Interested in getting into open-fire cooking? Derek Wolf has some tips for you.

QUOTABLES

&#34;You can tell a lot about a person by how they season their steak when no one&#39;s looking. Whether they&#39;re just doing straight salt and just classic/traditional, they can&#39;t do anything else, all the way to being adventurous with their flavor profiles.&#34; -Derek Wolf, on comparing tasting bourbon to tasting food

During their 43-minute session, they talk about their shared love of music and how it is both different and similar to whiskey. In addition, at one point they disagree about the finish of a certain Old Forester bourbon they taste. Finally, Jackie's dog Ingo joins the party to liven things up a bit.

Whiskeys tasted:
Old Forester "L-House Roulette No. 1" (20:02)
Barrell Jamaican Rum (29:18)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Jackie hit on several topics, like:
Since Ingo is in the house, Fred offers a shout-out to his beloved dog Remo, who he's had for 14 years.
And almost immediately, they forsake whiskey talk to discuss cheeseburgers. Jackie professes her love of Smashburger and Five Guys. Fred does love Five Guys, despite all the peanuts sitting around. Fred also shouts out WW Cousins, with its tubs full of condiments.
Fred suggests making a fermented ketchup spirit and asks Jackie what it would be called. Her response? "Gross." This parlays into a discussion of contraband mustard.
Getting around to discussing music about 10 minutes in, Jackie says that rather than having a favorite genre, she knows what she specifically doesn't like: pop country.
But she was influenced by her father's vinyl collection, which included albums by bands like Led Zeppelin. Her first ever cassette was a greatest hits collection by Canadian band The Guess Who.
Teen-age dating is a topic that rarely makes it into an episode of The Fred Minnick Show, but it makes this one.
Comparing music to whiskey, they agree tastes can often be affected by moods. Also, there is some music that is churned out for mass consumption while some music is more carefully crafted and is typically destined for a smaller audience.
At around the 20-minute mark, they pop open an untasted Old Forester expression that was sort of a warehouse straggler. Fred immediately is hit with banana notes on the nose. Jackie calls it "angry." Fred likens the whiskey to Metallica playing acoustic. But they definitely disagree on the finish - luckily, it doesn't lead to fisticuffs. (If you want to find out for yourself, Jackie said bottles will be for sale in the distillery's gift shop.)
Fred notes he is in the middle of tasting through his new spirits awards. Look for more on that coming later this spring.
Fred offers up a taste of one of his many bourbons, and Jackie declines, saying she's already tasted way too many bourbons that day. Instead, she requests a "weirdo, funky little rum." So, Fred breaks out the Barrell Bourbon Jamaican Rum finished in Isla Scotch barrels.
The rum prompts a discussion of the spirits industry crossing over with barrel finishes, and Jackie hints that there are some crossover projects happening at Old Forester.
To bring the loose music-meets-spirits theme full circle, they come to the conclusion that if the Barrell Rum were music, it would be "Vaseline" by Flaming Lips.

QUOTABLES

Jackie expressed some disbelief that Fred didn't like the finish on the proprietary Old Forester she brought to the interview: "I don't know how you think that finish is flat. It's very warm, and it is definitely there. It sinks way back into the throat. It is not a front-loaded finish by any means, palate-wise - it sits way in the back. Backseat driver."

Formed in New Albany, Indiana, in 2011, the band consists of Matt Myers, Zak Appleby and Shane Cody. On the show, they talk about touring, 10 years of being headquartered in downtown New Albany, they sip everything from Michter's 10 to 291 Colorado Whiskey and they perform two songs -- one of which is slated to be on their forthcoming new album.

Whiskeys tasted:
Michter's 10 Year (14:24)
291 Colorado Whiskey (23:40)
Penelope Four Grain Bourbon (44:12)
Peerless Rye (47:00)
Old Fitzgerald 14 Year Bottled in Bond (55:46)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and the members of Houndmouth talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
Fred gives the band a moment to decide whether to perform before drinking the whiskey or after. It is noted that performing pre-whiskey would be a foreign experience; predictably, they choose post-whiskey.
There's a quick discussion of thrift stores and haunted dolls.
The band is headquartered in an old house in downtown New Albany which sits next to a fire station, making it sometimes difficult to record.
They tell the story of how the band name came about, and it is directly related to the fact sound bleeds into the old house.
Fred takes the band through his method of tasting bourbon.
Fred says mindfulness - paying close attention to what you're eating or drinking - can work even for something as mundane as a McDonald's cheeseburger. Talk then turns to chicken sandwiches and later hot chicken. Because it's so freaking good. Fred then somehow waxes eloquent about Tanzanian cashews.
The band agrees they've never tasted anything quite like the 291 Colorado Whiskey. Aspen staves will do that. (They loved it.)
Fred talks about some of the many flavors he's encountered in whiskey: Drywall, plastic and even dead cat.
The origins of Houndmouth, which first began to take shape in 2011, are explored. Interestingly, each of the original members primarily played guitar, so they were forced to diversify.
The band performs a song at around the 37:00 mark.
Fred gets to the Penelope Four Grain and the group already had consumed it. Oops. The Peerless Rye comes out.
There is a discussion about the benefits of having a great mother-in-law.
Before covid, Houndmouth toured so relentlessly that in one year they played 280 shows.
They already drank the Old Fitz as well. As for the overall favorite? Penelope Four Grain was the winner ... which is why they essentially finished it before the show was recorded.
Look for a new album from Houndmouth this spring.
The band performs a song from the forthcoming album at around the 55:00 mark.

Named for the Whitechapel district of London, where Jack the Ripper famously went on his killing spree, the Knoxville, Tennessee, metal band has released seven studio albums to much acclaim. Fred talks with Crisp about the role of a bass player, his career, his love of bourbon, the covid era, heavy metal fandom and plenty more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Distillery 291 Colorado Whiskey (12:44)
Henry & Sons Cask Strength (18:26)
Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond 9 Year (26:50)
Knob Creek 15 Year Old (40:07)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Gabe talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
Gabe says it was the pandemic lockdown that made him a bourbon fan. The band would sometimes get Blanton's on the road, but it was a trip to Kentucky for a bachelor party, a trip that involved several distillery tours, that initially got him hooked.
While the pandemic shut down Whitechapel's 2020 tour, it gave the band the bandwidth to write and record its new album.
Per usual, Fred gives Gabe a tutorial on his method for tasting whiskey, starting with Distillery 291 Colorado Whiskey.
Fred, a wannabe bass player himself, asks Gabe if he thinks Whitechapel would ever go full-on Spinal Tap/"Big Bottom" wherein the bass takes over entirely. Gabe essentially says "maybe."
Crisp was inspired to play bass by listening to Green Day, a bass-forward band featuring Mike Dirnt on bass that got big in the 1990s.
There's a brief discussion about why Gabe doesn't sing in the band. In short, singing in a deathcore band isn't as easy as many might think.
Fred professes his love for Old Fitzgerald bourbons: "If this was football, [Old Fitz bourbons] would be Pro-Bowlers."
Fred also notes that the interview was recorded on the anniversary of the Bottled in Bond Act, which was passed in 1897. They celebrated with an Old Fitzgerald bottled in bond whiskey.
Fred and Gabe talks about parallels between bourbon and music when it comes to hype driving popularity.
Crisp says he feels metal fans, in general, are more devoted than other fans and are "there for the long haul."
Crisp says he doesn't listen to much music, but rather listens to the same music he did in high school: 1990s pop punk and 1960s rock like the Beatles and Creedence Clearwater Revival.
Gabe narrows his favorite of the flight down to the Old Fitzgerald and Knob Creek, ultimately going with Knob Creek, with a nod to J. Henry for its finish.
Expect the new album from Whitechapel before the end of 2021.

On why he sticks to playing bass guitar and doesn't sing for Whitechapel: "One time, back in the very beginning of the band, we were just messing around and I tried to do some sort of actual scream. It was something you could still laugh about today. It's a lot harder than people think it is. To scream and yell and make it sound forceful, and actually articulate and make it sound like something, and do that for an hour ... It's a skill for sure."

Named for the Whitechapel district of London, where Jack the Ripper famously went on his killing spree, the Knoxville, Tennessee, metal band has released seven studio albums to much acclaim. Fred talks with Crisp about the role of a bass player, his career, his love of bourbon, the covid era, heavy metal fandom and plenty more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Distillery 291 Colorado Whiskey (12:44)
Henry & Sons Cask Strength (18:26)
Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond 9 Year (26:50)
Knob Creek 15 Year Old (40:07)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Gabe talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
Gabe says it was the pandemic lockdown that made him a bourbon fan. The band would sometimes get Blanton's on the road, but it was a trip to Kentucky for a bachelor party, a trip that involved several distillery tours, that initially got him hooked.
While the pandemic shut down Whitechapel's 2020 tour, it gave the band the bandwidth to write and record its new album.
Per usual, Fred gives Gabe a tutorial on his method for tasting whiskey, starting with Distillery 291 Colorado Whiskey.
Fred, a wannabe bass player himself, asks Gabe if he thinks Whitechapel would ever go full-on Spinal Tap/"Big Bottom" wherein the bass takes over entirely. Gabe essentially says "maybe."
Crisp was inspired to play bass by listening to Green Day, a bass-forward band featuring Mike Dirnt on bass that got big in the 1990s.
There's a brief discussion about why Gabe doesn't sing in the band. In short, singing in a deathcore band isn't as easy as many might think.
Fred professes his love for Old Fitzgerald bourbons: "If this was football, [Old Fitz bourbons] would be Pro-Bowlers."
Fred also notes that the interview was recorded on the anniversary of the Bottled in Bond Act, which was passed in 1897. They celebrated with an Old Fitzgerald bottled in bond whiskey.
Fred and Gabe talks about parallels between bourbon and music when it comes to hype driving popularity.
Crisp says he feels metal fans, in general, are more devoted than other fans and are "there for the long haul."
Crisp says he doesn't listen to much music, but rather listens to the same music he did in high school: 1990s pop punk and 1960s rock like the Beatles and Creedence Clearwater Revival.
Gabe narrows his favorite of the flight down to the Old Fitzgerald and Knob Creek, ultimately going with Knob Creek, with a nod to J. Henry for its finish.
Expect the new album from Whitechapel before the end of 2021.

Members Ray Marte, John Carbone and Vincent Romanelli talk about their song "Awe at All Angles," which is the new musical backdrop for Fred's podcast and other creative efforts. The band members also discuss their many musical projects, creating new songs, what they drink (and sometimes eat) while on the road, Pappy Van Winkle and much more. Along the way, of course, they sip some fine whiskey - and even some brandy - with Fred.

Spirits tasted:
Spirits of French Lick Hoosier Apple Brandy (18:10)
Sonoma Rye (30: 53)
Old Tub (40:31)
Old Forester 1897 Bottled in Bond (54:30)
Old Forester 1920 (1:21: 52)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and the band talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
Fred starts the guys off with the unexpected, kicking things off with an apple brandy instead of a whiskey.
He then professes his belief that bass players are woefully underrated, and he asks Vincent what he does to make the band or a certain song sound the best it can.
John talks about how a song comes together - and how important it is that the members of Moon Tooth are so often on the same page.
John talks about his singing influences from Maynard Keenan of Tool to Delta blues and soul singers like Otis Redding. He also touches on taking care of one's singing voice.
The band talks with Fred about how whiskey can help - or hinder - a live performance. Long story short, Moon Tooth isn't going onstage drunk.
Fred introduces the band to Old Tub, a newer Jim Beam product that Fred has touted as outpacing its modest $23 price tag.
Everyone talks about what got them through the covid shutdown of 2020 and how so many people have come to the realization that they probably drank way too much during that time - Fred included. "And I'm a professional!" Fred exclaims.
Ray discusses the fact that covid also was a time when many musicians created a lot of new music, something that will benefit all of us going forward.
Fred talks with Moon Tooth about how tough it has been to not be able to tour. Playing on stage is what being a musician is about.
They talk about playing a show at the Thompson House in Newport, Ky. The early-19th century mansion is commonly believe to be haunted, thanks to numerous deaths that occurred there.
Fred gives the guys a lesson in the history of bottled in bond.
Ray gets a chance to talk about why the drummer is typically, as Fred words it, "the heartbeat of the band." The band agrees that "everything starts with drums."
Fred gushes about how much he loves Moon Tooth's music. He then calls John King, the guy who hooked Fred up with the band, to offer confirmation.
The conversation turns to a general discussion of the importance of doing what one loves.
John promises to work the word "bourbon" or the name of a bourbon of Fred's choice into a song on the upcoming Moon Tooth album.
Fred gets the band to tell the story of how they came to the band Moon Tooth.
The discussion briefly turns to country music at around the 1:40:00 mark.
Fred has the band go back and re-taste every spirit from the flight and pick their favorite: Vincent chooses Old Fo 1920; John picks the 1897, and Ray, the band's recognized "whiskey geek," liked the apple brandy. For Fred, it was the 1897, which was something of a surprise, given his love of the 1920.

John Carbone, lead singer of Moon Tooth, on playing live music: "When it comes to performing live, pursuing this has been the most difficult thing I've done in my life.

Fay has a long resume in the film industry with more than 30 credits, and is perhaps best known for his work on the films The Hangover (2009), 300 (2006) and Independence Day (1996). During the interview, they talk about filmmaking in general, experiences on specific films he produced, how the pandemic will affect the movie industry going forward, whiskey (of course) and much more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Eagle Rare 10 Year (14:37)
Henry McKenna Bottled in Bond 10 Year (26:58)
Michter's 10 Year Bourbon (33:27)
King of Kentucky (48:57)
291 Distillery Colorado Whiskey (1:03:22)
H. Hirsch 16 Year (1:11:39)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Bill talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
Bill Fay talks about "nudity riders" in film contracts, remembering the scene from "The Hangover" when Ken Jeong leaps out of the trunk of a car and starts beating people up.
Naturally, Fred asks if there's ever bourbon on the set. "Oh yes," Bill says. "Actors know how to take care of themselves pretty well."
Fay talks about a new spirits venture he's launching with a friend, which involves a proprietary method of filtration to improve the flavors in alcohol. Sort of a ramped-up chill filtration process. He then makes a few comparisons between the movie industry and the spirits industry.
Bill tells Fred it's intimidating to taste with him, likening it to having a professional basketball player ask him how to break down a zone defense.
Fay talks at length about the making of "300" and how he and director Zack Snyder worked to make the film as much like the graphic novel as possible. When they were finished, they believed they'd made the ultimate "guy" movie - and it turns out, women loved it too.
While sipping the Henry McKenna, they talk about acquiring a taste for fine spirits - and how when you first try it, it can seem a bit harsh. Also, it takes Bill a few minutes to get the wax top off the Michters 10 Year, which is pretty standard.
He talks about how he came to produce "Independence Day" and why it remains one of his favorite films he's ever worked on. The film also had another very interesting sports-related "first." He also tells the story about how the movie's title came to be - or how it was saved.
Bill takes Fred through the process of making a movie, step by step. It might be different than you think.
They also talk about how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the movie business - and it has quite a lot, as studios are shifting to releasing movies via streaming services.
Michter's and Henry McKenna finish in a tie in the 10-year taste-off. Fred even admits that, at least during this particular session, the Michter's edged out his old favorite, the McKenna.
Fred then gets an education on what the key roles are in the movie business. Fay likens the producer to a general manager of a baseball team, the person who puts the team together, hires the coach, manages the finances, etc. The director is like manager or coach of the team, who is on the field in real time working with the players. And it gets more nuanced from there.
They talk about how different the movie industry will be five years from now.
Fred on A.J. Hirsch: "Anytime I get to bust this one out, it's a treat." The 16-year Hirsch, of course, is considered by many to be the finest bourbon ever made.

QUOTABLES

Bill Fay, on executive producing a film: "It's really an amazing operation, because every film you do is completely different. It's like you're almost starting a new business. And that new business is not the same as the last business you did."

Bill tells Fred it's intimidating to taste with him, likening it to having a professional basketball player ask him how to break down a zone defense.
Fay talks at length about the making of "300" and how he and director Zack Snyder worked to make the film as much like the graphic novel as possible. When they were finished, they believed they'd made the ultimate "guy" movie - and it turns out, women loved it too.
While sipping the Henry McKenna, they talk about acquiring a taste for fine spirits - and how when you first try it, it can seem a bit harsh. Also, it takes Bill a few minutes to get the wax top off the Michters 10 Year, which is pretty standard.
He talks about how he came to produce "Independence Day" and why it remains one of his favorite films he's ever worked on. The film also had another very interesting sports-related "first." He also tells the story about how the movie's title came to be - or how it was saved.
Bill takes Fred through the process of making a movie, step by step. It might be different than you think.
They also talk about how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the movie business - and it has quite a lot, as studios are shifting to releasing movies via streaming services.
Michter's and Henry McKenna finish in a tie in the 10-year taste-off. Fred even admits that, at least during this particular session, the Michter's edged out his old favorite, the McKenna.
Fred then gets an education on what the key roles are in the movie business. Fay likens the producer to a general manager of a baseball team, the person who puts the team together, hires the coach, manages the finances, etc. The director is like manager or coach of the team, who is on the field in real time working with the players. And it gets more nuanced from there.
They talk about how different the movie industry will be five years from now.
Fred on A.J. Hirsch: "Anytime I get to bust this one out, it's a treat." The 16-year Hirsch, of course, is considered by many to be the finest bourbon ever made.

QUOTABLES

Bill Fay, on executive producing a film: "It's really an amazing operation, because every film you do is completely different. It's like you're almost starting a new business. And that new business is not the same as the last business you did."

Fay has a long resume in the film industry with more than 30 credits, and is perhaps best known for his work on the films The Hangover (2009), 300 (2006) and Independence Day (1996). During the interview, they talk about filmmaking in general, experiences on specific films he produced, how the pandemic will affect the movie industry going forward, whiskey (of course) and much more.

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Bill talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
Bill Fay talks about &#34;nudity riders&#34; in film contracts, remembering the scene from &#34;The Hangover&#34; when Ken Jeong leaps out of the trunk of a car and starts beating people up.
Naturally, Fred asks if there&#39;s ever bourbon on the set. &#34;Oh yes,&#34; Bill says. &#34;Actors know how to take care of themselves pretty well.&#34;

Oh, And She Loves Smoke Wagon</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, singer-songwriter Alyssa Bonagura sits down with Fred to sip some whiskey and rap. She started singing at age 2, and by age 10 was recording a duet with Kenny Rogers. She has worked with artists as varied as Steven Tyler and Jodee Messina, and also is a producer. As an artist, Bonagura has released four albums since 2008. On the show, she and Fred talk about her career, her unique name, social media, the pandemic ... and she also performs a tune from her forthcoming album.

Whiskeys tasted:
Smoke Wagon 12 Year (13:22)
Bardstown Bourbon Company Fusion Series (26:00)
Four Gate Batch 10 Rye (51:50)
Montanya Rum (1:02:03)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Alyssa get into many subjects, such as:
Fred comments Alyssa on her positivity, something she says she learned from her mother.
She talks about how by the time she was three weeks old, she was on the road touring with her parents' band, Baillie and the Boys. Literally, music has been part of her life almost since birth.
They reminisce about meeting at Hometown Rising and the pre-covid fun.
Alyssa says Smoke Wagon reminds her of Scotch, calling it "light" - even though its 110 proof. She gives it a "10 out of 10."
Fred bangs the drum again for Knob Creek 9 Year, which he feels is ignored because "it's everywhere." Thus, it will never have a cult following like, say, Blanton's or Weller. He compares it to an artist in the 1980s that consistently had hits but was never the flavor of the month.
The Bardstown Bourbon Company blend gets compared to hanging out with friends around the bonfire drinking from Solo cups.
Talking seasonal cocktails, Fred brings up the Mint Julep. "If the Kentucky Derby didn't come around, five people in the world might be drinking Mint Juleps."
Alyssa talks musical influences, from Casey Kasem's Top 40 to vintage country to more modern female country and folk artists. She also was into Coldplay. She also was big into the Beatles thanks to her father, and she spent three years in Liverpool, England, studying music engineering. She eventually goes full "fan girl."
Fred and Alyssa talk about how in country music, the opening line is more important than ever and more important in country than other genres. They also discuss writing for one's self rather than to appease a specific audience, whether it's a song or a new book.
At about the 45:00 mark, Alyssa plays a new song she wrote during covid quarantine. It's titled, "End of the World." (Don't worry, it's a positive song.)
After the song, she admits she's getting tipsy from the whiskey and she notes she's glad she didn't wait 10 more minutes to perform.
They bond over how awful the final season of "Game of Thrones" was. Alyssa compares one particular scene as being like an adult version of "The NeverEnding Story." And not in a good way.
Fred and Alyssa talk about their "fur babies" and it transitions into emotional songs that can make them cry.
When they break out the rum, she randomly brings up when she was in Spain, on tour with Steven Tyler. "My life is weird," she says, laughing.
By the time the show winds down, Alyssa circles back to her "breakup boots." It's a story worth hearing about.

QUOTABLES

Alyssa Bonagura on drinking with friends: "I always feel like it's the same thing with any kind of alcohol that you have in a setting where you're with your friends and ... it becomes like some kind of camaraderie, sharing something together because you really start to see and connect with someone in a different way - and that's why I love music so much, that you connect with someone on this crazy deep level."

Parker released her debut single, "Do Over," in September 2020 and received 25,000 downloads in the first five weeks of its release. The fun-loving artist was subsequently named "Next Big Thing" by Country Music Television's Casey Clarke. During her visit with Fred, they talk about Cross Fit, journalism, relationships, whiskey and more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Maker's Mark (23:42)
Bulleit Bourbon (33:09)
Appleton Jamaican Rum (47:02)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Parker get into a number of topics, such as:
Fred has heard the term "six-pack," referring to toned abs. On the show, Parker explains what a "37-pack" is.
They bond over a spirited discussion about crispy tofu.
Parker talks about becoming a songwriter, as well as her first two singles, "Do Over" and "Before You Leave."
Fred bemoans the fact he couldn't ship bourbon to Parker thanks to Canada's laws on shipping alcohol. The result? She is Fred's first show guest who had to go out and buy her own bourbon.
Later they bond over getting detained at the Canadian border.
Parker gets a lesson in waxed bottle tops and how wax was used in that way before the red wax became a Maker's Mark signature. And, yes, every bottle of Maker's is hand-dipped. Fred then tells the story of The Great De-Proofing Maker's tried to push through in 2013, and the New Coke-esque backlash that followed.
Quoth Parker: "You could just bury me in bourbon, and Bulleit, and I'd be a happy girl."
In between sipping, Parker talks about her next single, which she refers to as the final installment of a trilogy, preceded by her first two releases. They're all about a difficult relationship she endured.
Parker talks about writing solo versus writing songs with others.
As they get into tasting the Appleton rum, Fred explains the process of rum distillation. Parker, meanwhile, learns in real time that she likes a rum, and the difference between a good rum and, say, Bacardi. (Mezcal is her first love.)
Fred puts her on the spot to choose a favorite, and she chooses the Appleton. "I'm actually so shocked," she says. "I was very afraid of this."

QUOTABLES

On making the switch from pop to country music, Parker says, "I grew up on country music, so I should have just done that to begin with, but I think, where I was in life, I was really just passionate about pop music. Now, what's amazing is that I'm taking those two worlds and just jamming them together."

Parker talks about becoming a songwriter, as well as her first two singles, &#34;Do Over&#34; and &#34;Before You Leave.&#34;
Fred bemoans the fact he couldn&#39;t ship bourbon to Parker thanks to Canada&#39;s laws on shipping alcohol. The result? She is Fred&#39;s first show guest who had to go out and buy her own bourbon.
Later they bond over getting detained at the Canadian border.
Parker gets a lesson in waxed bottle tops and how wax was used in that way before the red wax became a Maker&#39;s Mark signature. And, yes, every bottle of Maker&#39;s is hand-dipped. Fred then tells the story of The Great De-Proofing Maker&#39;s tried to push through in 2013, and the New Coke-esque backlash that followed.
Quoth Parker: &#34;You could just bury me in bourbon, and Bulleit, and I&#39;d be a happy girl.&#34;
In between sipping, Parker talks about her next single, which she refers to as the final installment of a trilogy, preceded by her first two releases. They&#39;re all about a difficult relationship she endured.
Parker talks about writing solo versus writing songs with others.
As they get into tasting the Appleton rum, Fred explains the process of rum distillation. Parker, meanwhile, learns in real time that she likes a rum, and the difference between a good rum and, say, Bacardi. (Mezcal is her first love.)
Fred puts her on the spot to choose a favorite, and she chooses the Appleton. &#34;I&#39;m actually so shocked,&#34; she says. &#34;I was very afraid of this.&#34;

QUOTABLES

On making the switch from pop to country music, Parker says, &#34;I grew up on country music, so I should have just done that to begin with, but I think, where I was in life, I was really just passionate about pop music. Now, what&#39;s amazing is that I&#39;m taking those two worlds and just jamming them together.&#34;

Rather than a one-to-one interview with another person, he asked his YouTube members to ask him questions they seek answers to. Most of those questions were about bourbon, whiskey, distilling and music, but some veered into other territories. Hold on to your hats.

EPISODE SUMMARY

You get to hear Fred's answer to these (and other) YouTube member questions:
What would be your go-to album and bourbon pairing to relax after a long day?
What kind of music do you like?
What is the first real concert you went to?
For a distillery other than differences in aging time or mash bill, are costs to get their product into a bottle somewhat similar across all their labels?
Has Heaven Hill six year old been discontinued?
Best MGP bourbon under $75 that is attainable?
Whiskeys that have surprised or disappointed to you in 2021 so far?
Curious if you have tried Joseph Magnus or Murray Hill Club?
Top three drink categories and why?

QUOTABLES

"I'm married to bourbon. I'm in it for bourbon, bour-bour-bour-bour-bourbon. After that, it's scotch and rum."

Trace starred in the film "Charlie's Christmas Wish" in 2020, and has been involved with several other films. He's also well known for producing TikTok content, for which he has amassed a huge fan base, with more than 2 million followers. He also does a lot of celebrity impressions, as we learn during the interview. During the show, he and Fred also discuss topics like being an influencer, pairing characters with whiskey, dealing with social media followers, a new YouTube show idea and plenty more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Success 13 Year Kentucky Bourbon (17:27)
Frey Ranch (30:40)
Four Gate Rye (41:21)
Michter's 10 Year (57:51)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Ethan get into many diverse topics during the nearly 90-minute interview, such as:
Ethan became a whiskey fan after thinking aloud, "There has to be more to life than beer."
He and Fred address a perception that becoming an influencer doesn't require hard work - and Ethan talks about how he went about it. (Yes, it requires a lot of work.)
Ethan also talks about how frustrating it can be to put several days of work into a production and only get a small response, versus doing an impromptu short video with his phone that blows up. "It's hit or miss," he says.
Ethan says everything is on TikTok - there's even Welding TikTok. Fred cautions viewers to shield their eyes when watching Welding TikTok.
Ethan's response to the Success 13 Year Bourbon (127 proof): "Woooah! Did somebody turn pure electricity into a drink?"
Trace talks about finding the "sweet spot" as an influencer, and how to maintain popularity.
Ethan unveils an idea he has in the works for a new YouTube interview show that involves whiskey. Fred agrees that whiskey "opens people up."
Fred made an oops - he sent Ethan one bourbon, and Fred was tasting another. Same distillery, though, so it worked out.
Ethan talks about his work in film production as well as his introduction into acting. Looking for him in upcoming films like "The Next 24" (he plays a bad guy) and "Christmas at the Grey Horse Inn." Also? He relates his desire to one day play The Joker on the big screen, and shows off his best Joker laugh. Be wary, Batman.
Ethan, when asked about the film "Ace Ventura," says it is, "Jim Carrey at his Jim Carry-est." And be sure to listen to the story behind Carrey's role as The Grinch.
Things go down a rabbit hole when they start talking about dry counties and the religious folks in the south.
Ethan follows up this spirited discussion about religious conservatives by tasting the Michter's 10 Year and exclaiming, "Sweet Mary, Mother of God. Holy crap, that's good."
Fred talks about how he became a writer, going way back to his days in FFA and faxing stories to the local newspaper. He originally wanted to be a veterinarian.
A discussion of the social media outlet OnlyFans leads to a discussion of prostitution and marijuana legalization.

QUOTABLES

Ethan Trace, talking about the work that goes into creating content as an influencer: "If you knew how much people who actually take this seriously as a job ... do off-screen, it would blow your mind. ... Social media is no different than how other people work a job."

Figgers is the founder of Figgers Communications, a company that provides cell phone service to neaerly 100 countries, from China to South America, and also specializes in rural areas of America that have subpar or no cell service, and a holder of many patents. On the show, he and Fred talk about Freddie's inventions, his tech prowess, his company, his charitable foundation and plenty more. And, of course, Fred has him sipping some select whiskey.

Whiskeys tasted:
Lucky 7 Jokester (16:31)
Lot 40 Canadian Rye Whiskey (30:03)
Wilderness Trail 6 Year Old Barrel Pick (37:24)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Freddie talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
This is the first episode of the Fred Minnick Show in which he didn't partake in the tasting.
Freddie talks about his passion for reading and technology as a kid, and tells the story of how he essentially rebuilt a Macintosh computer.
He also talks about how he worked his way up as an IT engineer from an early age.
They talk about Figgers' company competing in the tech realm and the challenges therein, as well as his strategy of providing service to underserved areas.
They also talk about the uniquely secure F3 phones Figgers Communication offers.
Figgers talks about his many patents, including one he invented for his father who had Alzheimer's and later sold for $2 million. Another invention prevents texting and driving internally. "I've got a whole bunch of them," he says.
He tells Fred about building technology to help store the Pfizer vaccine that never was put to use.
Freddie also offers tips to inventors and explains the types of patents available for certain products.
He also addresses how telecom has changed since the voice-forward focus of the 1990s.
Freddie also talks about being a private company and his desire to not go public.
And while he isn't normally a drinker, Freddie says he likes all three of the selections, ultimately choosing Wilderness Trail Year over Lucky 7 Jokester as his narrow favorite of the flight.

QUOTABLES

Figgers, who isn't usually a whiskey drinker, gets Fred's tutorial on sipping whiskey while telling Fred of the different aspects of his company's portfolio, ranging from tech to healthcare to aviation. Fred comments that these are "things that actually matter in the world." Figgers responds nicely with: "Whiskey matters."

Investors/marketers Patrick Ductant and William Benson talk with Fred about how they have tailored and targeted their brand along with other topics, like the 1996 Chicago Bulls, diversity in the spirits industry, growing a brand in a pandemic and much more.

Liquids tasted:
Billionaires Row Champagne (19:05)
Billionaires Row Brandy and Champagne Blended (28:16)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and the Billionaires Row owners talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
Patrick and William look at markets and brands as they relate to each other and then try to stay out and front of other brands in those specific markets with competitive price points.
Marketing in a pandemic, which for them was actually successful.
They talk about favorite cocktails to make with Billionaires Row brandy.
Marketing these products in a pandemic has meant exploring strategies such as focusing on specific markets and hosting events like virtual cocktail parties, backed with online strategy.
Billionaires Row, internally, calls themselves the '96 Bulls, with them referring to each other sometimes as "Scotty" and "Jordan."
Fred offers his appreciation for bringing added diversity, as a black-owned business, to the wine and spirits industry. As for them, they hope to learn about the industry and grow into it, as well as to create opportunities for continued diversity.
Integrating music and celebrity into the Billionaires Row brand and how it fits with the lifestyle focus.
Southern rap briefly comes into the conversation with Fred's mention of Killer Mike.
Fred on the champagne: "I want to eat some oysters with this."
Fred blends the champagne with the brandy for an impromptu cocktail and he's impressed, calling it a "beautiful marriage" and musing that it might even be better with a dash of bitters.
Patrick and William offer up a few tips to potential investors (no, not GameStop). Some suggestions include high-end spirits, cannabis, energy and water.

QUOTABLES

"We focus on the experience that we give the consumer. Even if you are home by yourself and you're enjoying this cognac, your experience - and I can see it right now on your face - it takes you places. And that's what we want to do with our consumers, we want to take them places." -William Benson on the Billionaires Row brand

The country singer-songwriter is a Capitol Records artist who has written songs for artists like Dan + Shay, Justin Moore, Lindsay Ell, the Eli Young Band and others. In 2019, his solo single "Rockin' All Night Long" hit No. 4 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. His latest EP, Give Her a Rose, was released in December 2020. On the show, Adam and Fred talk songwriting, Nashville, Elvis Presley, whiskey, cellphones and plenty more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Angel's Envy Finished in Tawny Port Casks (21:16)
Old Forester Rye (22:49)
Kentucky Owl 11 Year Rye (22:49)
Michter's 20 Year (38:09)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Adam touch on a number of points, such as:
Fred starts the show by noting this bonus interview with Adam Hambrick happened in person, pre-Covid.
Adam talks about the writing of the Lindsay Ell hit, "I Don't Love You," which he co-wrote, and how he got into writing songs.
Adam talks about singing and how he's been singing since age 3, followed by his shift into songwriting - and then back into being a recording artist.
Adam says it's "the Wild West" in terms of putting out music in modern times.
Adam's impression of Will Ferrell impersonating Harry Caray is a highlight at around the 17:36 mark.
Hambrick says he's a slow sipper and details his relationship with whiskey. Fred then breaks down Adam's palate by asking his food and flavor preferences. The verdict: Sweet tooth - but not too
Adam: "I'm sneaky old. I've got two kids at home and a mortgage."
Adam explains how songwriters do what they do and tells Fred he essentially does something similar with his whiskey and bourbon writing.
They talk about how modern phones have become a constant distraction and shortened our attention spans, changing how we think and how we process information. Adam admits this knowledge has given him a "healthy disdain" for his phone.
Fred notes that he is in the "eyeballs" business - attracting people's eyes - while Adam is in the "earballs" business, drawing chuckle from the songwriter.
Of the Michter's 20-year-old bourbon, Adam says, "Oh my goodness. Holy cow." That about sums it up.
They talk "special occasion" whiskeys. Fred says, "You know what's a special occasion to me? Waking up in the morning."
On the way out, Fred and Adam decide to "solve some world problems." At that point, the conversation turns back to how cell phones have taken over our world. Adam notes that positive reinforcement on social media offers a hit of dopamine, which makes it a literal addiction. But then they talk about bologna sandwiches and mayonnaise.

QUOTABLES

Asked if he considers himself more singer or songwriter, Adam responds, "It's kind of all one river. When I'm writing songs, I'm always writing for myself in some way. And sometimes those songs don't fit the project, they don't fit what you're going to put out, so you just leave it open-handed and, like, if this fits for somebody else, by all means please record it."

Hambrick says he&#39;s a slow sipper and details his relationship with whiskey. Fred then breaks down Adam&#39;s palate by asking his food and flavor preferences. The verdict: Sweet tooth - but not too
Adam: &#34;I&#39;m sneaky old. I&#39;ve got two kids at home and a mortgage.&#34;
Adam explains how songwriters do what they do and tells Fred he essentially does something similar with his whiskey and bourbon writing.
They talk about how modern phones have become a constant distraction and shortened our attention spans, changing how we think and how we process information. Adam admits this knowledge has given him a &#34;healthy disdain&#34; for his phone.
Fred notes that he is in the &#34;eyeballs&#34; business - attracting people&#39;s eyes - while Adam is in the &#34;earballs&#34; business, drawing chuckle from the songwriter.
Of the Michter&#39;s 20-year-old bourbon, Adam says, &#34;Oh my goodness. Holy cow.&#34; That about sums it up.
They talk &#34;special occasion&#34; whiskeys. Fred says, &#34;You know what&#39;s a special occasion to me? Waking up in the morning.&#34;
On the way out, Fred and Adam decide to &#34;solve some world problems.&#34; At that point, the conversation turns back to how cell phones have taken over our world. Adam notes that positive reinforcement on social media offers a hit of dopamine, which makes it a literal addiction. But then they talk about bologna sandwiches and mayonnaise.

QUOTABLES

Asked if he considers himself more singer or songwriter, Adam responds, &#34;It&#39;s kind of all one river. When I&#39;m writing songs, I&#39;m always writing for myself in some way. And sometimes those songs don&#39;t fit the project, they don&#39;t fit what you&#39;re going to put out, so you just leave it open-handed and, like, if this fits for somebody else, by all means please record it.&#34;

Rival Sons Singer Jay Buchanan Weighs in and Talks Modern Masculinity</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, lead singer of rock band Rival Sons, Jay Buchanan, joins Fred. Buchanan, previously a solo artist, helped form Rival Sons in 2008 with guitarist Scott Holiday. Since 2009, the band has released one EP and six full-length albums, citing musical influences ranging from Prince to Van Morrison. During this week's interview, Jay and Fred sip whiskey (because, of course) and discuss topics such as the band's forthcoming album, side projects, ascots, drinking on stage and even modern masculinity.

Whiskeys tasted:
Michter's Straight Bourbon (14:22)
Peerless Rye Cherry Cola (26:20)
M.B. Roland Single Mash (45:06)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Jay talk about a wide variety of things, such as:
Jay doesn't think rock music is as prevalent as it once was, citing several reasons including recording technology and the way labels promote music today. "Hip hop rules the world," he tells Fred.
He also talks about rock bands "locking arms" and uniting, per an interview he did with Rolling Stone, as a way of lifting up all rock acts.
Fred gets Jay to come clean on drinking all the Michter's straight bourbon Fred had sent him for the show. The two agree that it's a great "every day pour."
American whiskeys versus Scotch whiskeys and other non-American whiskeys.
Life as a rock band during the ongoing pandemic, and Jay losing part of his identity. "It's forced us to be more introspective and take stock in why we really do what we do," he says.
Fred talks about his life during the pandemic, losing Bourbon & Beyond and other opportunities, and going from that to remaking himself into a YouTube streamer.
Fred quickly discovers that Jay has quite the whiskey palate.
Jay talks about his minimalist approach to drink before and during shows.
In introducing the Peerless Rye to the tasting, Fred talks about the difference between sour mash fermentation and sweet mash.
They talk about the slow emergence of rye whiskey and where it might head, and that leads them to talking about trends in alcohol and drinking in general. White Claw rears its head. A spirited discussion of modern American masculinity then takes place.
The M.B. Roland they taste only saw a release of 86 bottles.
Quote of the show: "When you're drunk, you can't do much ... except drink more."
Jay talks about Rival Sons coming together in 2008 and how he originally expected it to simply be a side project to his solo career, as well as what's next for the band.
The show wraps with Fred asking Jay which of the three whiskeys was his favorite. His answer is extensive, but the Peerless barely eked out the win.

QUOTABLES

Jay compares rye whiskey to modern American masculinity: "With men, you see the urban lumberjack aesthetic come up everywhere - guys want to have beards, guys want to wear flannel, guys want to wear jeans that will last longer than they will. Guys want to have one pair of boots that are going to the best pair of boots. I think that the return to the masculine culture with men in America, along with that, we're going to watch rye come up because rye is directly related to that rugged individualism."

Fred and NFL Great Charles Woodson Conclude</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, Fred welcomes NFL great Charles Woodson. Woodson, who retired after the 2015 season following a career that included a Defensive Player of the Year Award, a Super Bowl championship and four first-team All Pro honors with the Oakland Raiders and Green Bay Packers. He is a current finalist for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021. Woodson also won a national college football title and a Heisman Trophy while at the University of Michigan. He and Fred sat down this week to talk about his new Woodson Bourbon Whiskey, his wines, his career, ascots, the NFL playoffs, his Hall of Fame future and more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Woodson Bourbon Whiskey (15:38)
The Senator Rye 6 Year (26:04)
Rolling Fork Rum (35:02)
Vintage 1945 Kentucky Tavern Bottled in Bond (43:30)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Charles hit on a number of topics, such as:
They both share their stories of how they came to wear them and why they like them so much.
Fred asks Charles if, in his prime, he could have shut down Kansas City wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Woodson's answer was no surprise.
His brand of Intercept wines and, of course, plenty of whiskey talk, along with his interest in getting into the alcohol and spirits industry. His love of wine began after he was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the late 1990s and his discovery of Napa Valley.
His love of bourbon came from being introduced to Scotch whiskey - Woodford Reserve became his gateway into the world of bourbon whiskey and ultimate led him to create his own Woodson brand.
He talks about the proprietary accelerated aging process used in his new bourbon, which are later finished in French oak wine barrels. Fred chimes in with a comment on the growing acceptance of rapid-aging in whiskey, along with how the products have improved.
Charles talks about what he misses most about football. He says going on the road during the season, he remembers only having what you absolutely need and the challenge of not having everything he needed at arm's length. He talks about how it changes the dynamic and relates it to going into battle.
Woodson also talks about his approach to being an NFL analyst, and how he tries to stay upbeat and be himself rather than critical of teams, players or situations.
Fred tells Charles about the differences between Jamaican rum and others, noting that there is never sugar added to meet the perceptions of consumers that rum has to be sweet. In short, the Rolling Fork rum they tasted is not Bacardi.
The vintage Kentucky Tavern didn't hold up well. Fred and Charles likened it to an old leather football helmet and shoe polish. And sweat. And jock straps.
Fred: "It's not every day I get to send an NFL Hall of Famer a jock-strap-forward whiskey."
Finally, Charles talks about what it will mean when he inevitably is inducted to the Hall of Fame and what he feels his career has meant to his many fans over the years.

QUOTABLES

Charles Woodson, talking about his new Woodson Bourbon Whiskey, "No. 1, I wouldn't put my name on it, and No. 2, I probably wouldn't come on your show if I didn't think I had something that was quality and that I really wanted people to try."

Instead of an interview and whiskey tasting with a guest, Fred took to the airwaves to vent, in a way. Think of it as podcast therapy for Fred's soul. His gripe? That Billy Idol never won a Grammy AND has never been inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. Hey, we all know Fred is a music nerd, and when he learned this news recently, well, he decided to let off some steam in defense of the 1980s hit-maker, whose tunes include "White Wedding" and "Rebel Yell," among others. For the spirits aspect of the show, he pairs bourbon and whiskey with some of his favorite Billy Idol songs.

Whiskey Pairings:
"Dancing With Myself" - Woodinville
"Rebel Yell" - Rebel Yell (duh!)
"Mony, Mony" - Maker's Mark
"White Wedding" - Jack Daniel's
"Night Crawling" - Weller 12 Year Old
"Eyes Without a Face" - Booker's
"Cradle of Love" - Tequila
"Flesh of Fantasy" - Pappy Van Winkle
"Catch My Fall" - Blade & Bow

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred covers these topics:
Fred's two passions: Whiskey and music, which is why his show exists in the first place, to pair the two.
Three Grammy nominations in his career? No wins. Fred's not happy, and he calls out the industry for snubbing the spike-haired rocker. (Although in 1984, Idol lost to Bruce Springsteen, who pretty much owned America that year. But to lose in 1986 to Robert Palmer? Come ON.)
Fred then moves through his favorite Billy Idol songs, pairing them with bourbons (see pairings above). During the podcast, he explains why he made his choices. (There's one big surprise.)
Also, Fred reminds listeners to check out his new show on DASH Radio, called "Minnick Minute."
He also urges everyone to check out his new whiskey club at CraftShack.com.
Fred reveals his favorite Billy Idol song may just be "Eyes Without a Face," in part because it was his first taste of the artist's music.
He pairs "Flesh of Fantasy" with Pappy Van Winkle because he feels the song showed the world Idol's true singing talent, while Pappy bourbon showed the world the true promise of bourbon.
Fred also notes that he has some exciting guests coming up, including NFL legend Charles Woodson, along with plenty of musicians with names you'll know.

QUOTABLES

"I look at Billy Idol's career and I think to myself, 'This guy is a rock/pop icon.' He completely changed the culture of what we think of as punk ... He's just got so many things that changed music."

The band's co-founder and rhythm guitar player, Ian also is an author and spoken-word story teller. He also was a host on the VH1 show Rock Show for 48 episodes, interviewing rock greats such as Ozzy Osbourne, Ted Nugent and Tenacious D. When he and Fred get together, topics range from his first taste of whiskey (it didn't go well) to warning labels on music in the 1980s and '90s to a strange, private jet journey with Tommy Lee of Motley Crue. Naturally, whiskey is shared and discussed along the way.

Whiskeys tasted:
Maker's Mark 101 (7:14)
Spirits of French Lick Unpretentious High Rye Bourbon Finished in Port Casks (17:54)
Angel's Envy Finished in Tawny Port Casks (24:15)
Barrell Bourbon Finished in Pear Brandy Barrels (42:14)
Barrell Bourbon Armida finished in Pear Brandy, Jamaican Rum, and Sicilian Amaro Casks (52:18)
Michter's Small Batch (1:00:39)
Distillery 291 Whiskey (1:04:16)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Scott cover a number of topics, such as:
Scott's first whiskey ever was a Jack and Coke with Lemmy Kilmister from Motorhead. He saw Lemmy in a pub in London, offered to buy him a drink and Lemmy steered him toward the whiskey mixer. The story didn't necessarily end well. He later began to drink whiskey more regularly with Dimebag Darrell of Pantera.
Fred shares the story of how Brown-Forman came to create the Woodford Reserve brand of bourbon.
Scott loves the Spirits of French Lick Unpretentious and is surprised to learn that it sells for up to $1,000 on the secondary whiskey market. In fact, the whiskey got popular with bourbon lovers even before Fred knew about it.
While tasting the Angel's Envy Port Barrel finished whiskey, Fred talks about it being a "creative" whiskey, noting the distillery started aging in port barrels around 2013 that, at the time, was pushing the boundaries of whiskey-making. He notes that as recently as 2010, the finished whiskey market didn't really exist. "I think Angel's Envy deserves a lot of credit for everything that they have done to kind of propel the category," he says.
That said, Fred doesn't believe such finished whiskeys should be called "bourbon."
Fred also talks with Scott about Mexican whiskey and how the products continue to evolve. Of course, we all know Fred is a big tequila and mezcal fan, and Mexico is where those spirits truly begins.
Scott's wife Pearl Aday makes a surprise appearance and they discuss the duo's acoustic performance at Fred's virtual Repeal Day Expo back in December.
Scott likens Fred's preference for straight bourbon to his own liking of black coffee. "I want to taste the bean ... Same with whiskey. I wanted to taste IT."
Fred again shares his disdain for vodka, a fact Scott already knew from following Fred's work. "The reason why, it's not because that the spirit truly genuinely in my heart sucks, it's because of the business behind vodka, and the history behind vodka and what it did to bourbon in the 1960s, taking it off the shelf." He also hates that vodka distillers are paying for placement in liquor stores and that distributors often require retail outlets to buy vodka products in order to procure allocated bourbons. "There's not a vodka magazine. You don't see vodka groups. It's an intoxicant and that's it. ... I would probably drink vodka over prisoner toilet wine, but that's about it."
The conversation leads to Scott's experiences as a teen-ager getting ripped on vodka and telling his mom he had "the flu." He was hung over for four days with fevers, chills, no appetite ... now THAT'S a hangover. As a result, he stayed sober through the early years of Anthrax.
When tasting the Barrell Bourbon Armida, both agree it's unique but not necessarily one they want to drink often - or more than one. Both felt the pear brandy casks were too...]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, Scott Ian of the seminal thrash-metal band Anthrax takes time to chat with Fred.

He talks about buying bourbon gifts for family and friends based on their musical tastes. What musical genres do your loved ones prefer? Fred might just have the perfect pour to pair with their whiskey tastes. Better yet, what's the best whiskey to pair with your favorite music? Sipping good whiskey and listening to good music is a good way to spend an evening.

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred dishes on:
His forthcoming website that will help promote his previous musical guests.
The way music - like whiskey - connects with the brain to create specific memories that will return with repeated experiences. In other words, hearing a familiar song can have a similar effect as re-tasting a favorite whiskey.
The best whiskey for a jazz fan - Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, because it's a fine sipper and also can inject some life into a party.
Country music -trucks, prison, infidelity, deceased pets ... well, it might be best not to drink to that particular area of country-western music. Maybe go for the boot-scootin' type of country, which might go well with George Dickel, which is "a very country music-tasting whiskey."
Yes, it's true, Fred used to participate in rodeo, and the smell of Dickel reminds him of the smell of a tack room. He sucked at roping, however.
With hip hop music, it's like a cocktail from your favorite bartender - it might be different than what all the other bartenders are making. There are a lot of variations of hip hop, just like with, say, an old fashioned. "It's one of the most flexible forms of art," Fred says. The call here? Barrell Bourbon, because it's all blends, all the time, with whiskeys from around the world.
If it's hardcore rap you're listening to, go for something barrel-proof, like a stiff shot of Distillery 291's Bad Guy (120 proof!).
Into rock 'n' roll? There's only one iconic brand you need to know: Jack Daniel's. 'Nuff said.
For classical music, it's a bit tougher. Fred believes you want complexity. Even with an artist like The Beatles, it's music that will make him want to sit and think. That's complexity. How about a Michter's 20 year or a Pappy Van Winkle 15 year old? Or a well-aged Macallan? (Of course, it's a lot easier to find a copy of the Beatles' White Album than, say, a bottle of King of Kentucky.)
What of pop music? It's another variable, and very visual. Think Lady Ga Ga. And Katy Perry would be a very different pairing. Or Madonna, the queen of pop. But in the end, Fred suggests basing the pairing on what they like most out of four flavors: Cinnamon (Four Roses), nutmeg (Buffalo Trace), caramel/vanilla (Elijah Craig Small Batch) and grains/bread (Knob Creek).

QUOTABLES

"This is my passion, I love whiskey, I love talking about it and I love complementing the whiskey with music."

Ludacris broke into the national spotlight in 2000 with his album Back for the First Time, featuring the singles "Southern Hospitality" and "What's Your Fantasy," and has since released seven more albums. Ludacris, whose given name is Chris Bridges, also is a veteran actor, having had a starring role in the "Fast & Furious" franchise, among many other roles in film and television. On the show, he and Fred talk about the exploration of spirits, working out during a COVID lockdown, learning to enjoy a life lived mostly at home, and Ludacris drinks a $15,000 whiskey straight from the bottle. Southern Hospitality indeed.

Whiskeys tasted:
Vintage Eagle Rare 10 Year Old (8:20)
Catoctin Creek Maple Barrel Rye (16:18)
Larceny Barrel Proof (23:45)
Michter's Celebration Sour Mash (31:13)
291 Colorado Bourbon Whiskey (43:38)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Ludacris tasted and talked about several topics. Here are some highlights:
Ludacris refers to the vintage Eagle Rare as "grown man shit," adding, "This is the type of stuff that will grow hairs on your chest if you don't already have some."
He also paired his whiskey flight with some chili, prompting Fred to speak of his fondness for pairing whiskey with barbecue.
Ludacris talks about how much the music business has changed during his career, and how he has matured along with it.
He also talks about balancing music with acting and how he manages to prioritize his passions. "It's complex," he says.
Fred tells Ludacris that he believes the best film of the 21st Century was "Crash," which won an Oscar for best picture and in which Ludacris had a major role.
Of the Catoctin Creek Maple Barrel Rye, Ludacris says, "I'm definitely making pancakes tomorrow and I'm definitely pouring this on them."
Ludacris is adamant that the best day to drink is Monday. "It's whiskey Monday. You'll feel like it's Saturday."
If you watch the video feed on YouTube, be sure to watch Ludacris' reaction to the 120-proof Larceny Barrel Proof, who says it is "not for the week."
They also talk about world-class whiskies like The Macallan, Balveny, Glenfiddich, Glenlivet, Lagavulin and others. "Every day, you should have a different whisky, that's how I feel," Ludacris says.
Fred teaches Ludacris in the ways of cleansing the palate, using his time-tested method involving Muenster cheese, soda water and almonds.
Fred tells Ludacris, who is amazed to be gifted a $15,000 bottle of bourbon, "It's the hardest American whiskey to get because there's so few of them. For this one, there are less than 300 bottles." Ludacris then proceeds to drink it from the bottle after nosing it and describing it as smelling "like heaven and teen spirit mixed together." Needless to say, he enjoyed the flavor as well, saying, "It gives you this warm feeling."
Fred reveals his fascination with the McRib, the faux-food abomination McDonald's unleashes upon America on a rotating basis.
Ludacris talks about his new children's content project, Kid Nation.

QUOTABLES

In opening the show, Ludacris starts things off on a positive note, saying, "This is the best quarantine ever when you have whiskeys like these literally in front of you, and when you have good friends and good individuals that you trust and know about rare things that you've never tried. Those are the days that we live for - for all the people watching, that's what I'm about. I love it."

They also talk about world-class whiskies like The Macallan, Balveny, Glenfiddich, Glenlivet, Lagavulin and others. &#34;Every day, you should have a different whisky, that&#39;s how I feel,&#34; Ludacris says.
Fred teaches Ludacris in the ways of cleansing the palate, using his time-tested method involving Muenster cheese, soda water and almonds.
Fred tells Ludacris, who is amazed to be gifted a $15,000 bottle of bourbon, &#34;It&#39;s the hardest American whiskey to get because there&#39;s so few of them. For this one, there are less than 300 bottles.&#34; Ludacris then proceeds to drink it from the bottle after nosing it and describing it as smelling &#34;like heaven and teen spirit mixed together.&#34; Needless to say, he enjoyed the flavor as well, saying, &#34;It gives you this warm feeling.&#34;
Fred reveals his fascination with the McRib, the faux-food abomination McDonald&#39;s unleashes upon America on a rotating basis.
Ludacris talks about his new children&#39;s content project, Kid Nation.

QUOTABLES

In opening the show, Ludacris starts things off on a positive note, saying, &#34;This is the best quarantine ever when you have whiskeys like these literally in front of you, and when you have good friends and good individuals that you trust and know about rare things that you&#39;ve never tried. Those are the days that we live for - for all the people watching, that&#39;s what I&#39;m about. I love it.&#34;

The Alabama-born YelaWolf, whose given name is Michael Wayne Atha, released his sixth studio album, Ghetto Cowboy, last fall on Eminem's Shady Records label. On the podcast, he and Fred sip bourbon and talk about topics like Creek Water Whiskey - YelaWolf's whiskey brand - musical collaborations, work ethic, Slumerican life, his connections in the music industry and more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Creek Water Whiskey (8:46)
MB Roland (48:57)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and YelaWolf cover a number of topics, such as:
YelaWolf talks about how his whiskey brand, Creek Water Whiskey, came to be.
He tells Fred about how he has enjoyed whiskey in the past, with well known brands like Jack Daniel's, and shares that he took a trip with his father to Woodford Reserve.
Fred congratulates YelaWolf on creating what, essentially, is his own personal culture, known as "Slumerican," which has its own clothing and jewelry line and more. Generally speaking, a slumerican, according to UrbanDictionary.com, refers to someone "who was born and raised in the ghettos or slums of the United States of America."
YelaWolf shares his gratitude toward not only his mother and grandfather for his work ethic, but also his friend, rapper Jelly Roll.
He also talked about his family culture growing up. There was no sleeping in, no milling about the house in pajamas - when you wake up, you get up and get ready for the day.
YelaWolf was friends with Winona Judd and Shooter Jennings as a kid, and had a lot of music connections through his mother that helped him in his music career.
When Fred tells YelaWolf he drinks whiskey for a living, he elicits a laugh - then YelaWolf says, "That's a hell of a way to make a living. You know what? I do too, actually."
As true whiskey nerds are wont to do, Fred and YelaWolf talk about condensation in the necks of whiskey bottles.
Fred tells YelaWolf the story of how he became a whiskey writer.
They also talk about how both have intense senses of smell - and how there's always one guy who farts on the tour bus. This leads to what happens when a tour bus toilet is dumped while the bus is moving. Listen carefully for the yacht party story.
Did you know you can't get Foster's beer in Australia? So says YelaWolf.
YelaWolf talks about the evolution of hip hop from sampling to now, and tries to speculate on where it might go from here, noting that there are fewer rules than in pretty much any other genre of music.
He talks about having a new record ready to drop, that will also have a companion film that will be shot in Mexico. Look for a non-traditional release. Oh, and it's a rock 'n' roll album.
Fred thanks YelaWolf for pushing him to find a creative way to conduct their interview.
YelaWolf also talks about his trips to Russia, including his latest one just as the coronavirus pandemic was breaking in the U.S. YelaWolf said he had COVID-19.
Fred revisits his interview with Killer Mike and the story of him attending YelaWolf's birthday party, when a group rendition of "Sweet Home Alabama" broke out.
They finish things out by trying whiskey straight from a five-year-aged barrel at MB Roland Distillery ... with Sasquatch.

QUOTABLES

YelaWolf on his work ethic: "I just think that working is the best way to show gratitude for being alive. I think that laziness is the ultimate sin, if there is such a thing. I work hard because I have a lot of ideas and I have a lot to do in my lifetime. I have more ideas than I could ever really get done. ... My work ethic is not for the sane. I think you have to be a little crazy to think about the impossible being actually possible."

Along the way, they talk ice fishing, driving in traffic without the benefit of a Monster Truck, the intentional craziness of the motor sport, Titan Games, healing from the sport and more. Fred, of course, loves to enjoy Monster Jam with his sons, so having Gauthier on the show was a can't-miss proposition.

Whiskys tasted:
Shelter Point Lot 40 (14:11)
Forty Creek Barrel Select (17:28)
Stock and Barrel Rye (20:03)
Shelter Point Smoke Point (27:27)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Cynthia talk about a number of topics, such as:
Fred extols the virtues of Canadian whisky and discusses the difference between it and American whiskey.
Cynthia reveals she took a bartending class when she was younger and that she likes to enjoy many different types of spirits - focusing on whiskey when she isn't feeling well.
She does clarify, however, she doesn't really drink while on the road with Monster Jam, choosing to focus on her health.
Gauthier notes that part of not drinking when touring with the sport is because, obviously, drinking and driving don't mix. To which Fred quips, "You said in your profession it's hard to drink a lot; in my profession, it's hard to drive a lot."
In addition to ice fishing, Cynthia likes plenty of other outdoor activities, including paddle boarding and longboarding.
The two make their way through Canadian whiskeys and when they hit the 92-proof Stock and Barrel Rye, Cynthia says, "This will take paint off your wall." (It's fair to note the interview and tasting happened at 10 a.m., so perhaps her palate was still waking up.)
A self-described adrenaline junkie, Cynthia admits how much she appreciates being able to compete in Monster Jam along with a number of other women in the sport.
She says her passion for motor sports originates with her dad, who is a mechanic.
While she studied to be a CPA, she actually became a welder and started her own welding business.
Cynthia ultimately picks Shelter Point Lot 40 as her favorite of the flight.

QUOTABLES

Cynthia Gauthier compares Monster Jam to a UFC fight - it's about the action. "It's the only sport that we're actually crashing on purpose. Other sports, they always want to finish first, but we want the wild moments and so we actually sometimes go out of control to get that, that special moment where you get on one wheel and then come back on four. It's a special sport."

Suffice to say, if you're into the Pappy Van Winkle legacy, you're going to love this inside look into Thompson's relationship with Julian Van Winkle, who he shadowed for parts of three years to learn about what makes the Van Winkle family tick. Wright and Fred talk about the book, bourbon and, most importantly, the Van Winkle way. No whiskey tasting this time - Fred was sipping coffee, as it was a morning interview - but there was plenty of whiskey talk.

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Wright cover a number of topics, such as:
"It was a story about writing a book as much as anything," Thompson tells Fred about his relationship with Julian Van Winkle and the process of getting to know him and the family's history while writing Pappyland. He notes that much of the story he learned mirrored many things that were happening in his own life at the time.
He also notes that he drank "a lot of good whiskey" during the research process and was able to reflect his tastes off Julian Van Winkle's, noting that Julian was "unsentimental" toward much of the bourbon they tasted.
And for those who don't believe in the scarcity of Pappy Van Winkle and Old Rip Van Winkle products, Thompson says they'd better change their thinking. Because the scarcity is real. Speaking of Julian, Thompson tells Fred, "I certainly thought, 'Well, this guy's got a basement full of this stuff,' and, ah, he doesn't. ... That was really interesting to see, that the scarcity is real."
That said, before loaning much of it to Frazier History Museum, Julian had a huge stash of priceless whiskey hiding in his basement.
Fred and Wright also talk about tasting some of the white dog from the original Stitzel-Weller Distillery and finding it to be even smoother than some aged bourbons.
Thompson says Julian's goal is to create bourbon that is "the closest approximation" to Stitzel-Weller whiskey. "It was interesting to me to see how much the process for him is dancing with the ghost of that."
He talks about events coming up through which bourbon fans can win Van Winkle products (get involved at Wright's Website.
They talk about how fake Pappy often is sent back to Buffalo Trace, and Julian often tastes (and likes!) the faked bourbon, to see what people are passing of as Pappy Van Winkle.
On how covering sports is similar to covering bourbon, Wright says, "One, people are very, very passionate about it and have long, deeply felt opinions." He talks about how bourbon, in a way, embodies the American spirit.
Ultimately, the book is about why people make bourbon and why so many people want to drink it, he says. "I hope in my heart of hearts that maybe I have articulated something that a lot of people like you and I ... have felt but never fully articulated. I think people will say, 'That's me on the page. Hopefully.'"
Fred offers that being a fan of a sports team that isn't successful is almost the opposite of one's love of whiskey: "Bourbon is largely joy; being a fan is mostly heartache."
Thompson buys bourbon to drink, not to collect or re-sell: "I would love a world in which everybody's decanter whiskey was Old Rip. For $60 a bottle."
And Wright teaches us all how to make a VanHattan (good luck finding the ingredients, though).

QUOTABLES

"I don't know if I have a complex enough whiskey palate to separate my desire for something to be great from it's actual greatness," Thompson says, speaking of his relationship with whiskey.

About Kelley....

 

 

Kelley Swindall's path to music stardom sounds a lot like the plot of a country song. The now-New Yorker moved from Atlanta to the Big Apple to pursue an acting career and the bright lights of Broadway. There, Swindall got her heart broken and decided to learn to play guitar and write a few songs about her ex to get revenge. The rest is history...a history that launched the career of a singer/songwriter that has wowed audiences and critics, appearing everywhere from American Songwriter to Guitar Girl. As she releases her debut album, You Can Call Me Darlin' If You Want, on Velvet Elk Records, Swindall is garnering big attention with a vintage look and sound that's fun, feisty, and unflinchingly honest. With Darlin', Swindall combines the elegance, outspokenness, and stellar songwriting of classic country icons like Dolly Parton and Patsy Cline with a swagger and style that's all her own. The album kicks off with "I Ain't For You You Ain't For Me," a fierce and fiery country-rocker, before changing gears for "California," a tongue-in-cheek, cross-country Thelma and Louise-style adventure that recalls the raucous storytelling in Johnny Cash's "A Boy Named Sue." As she recalled in an interview with Lolly Dude of KICKS 96, Swindall didn't originally intend to write country songs; she simply poured her heart into her guitar. The result was stunning sound and a breakout star who has wowed audiences with her honest songwriting and gritty, stirring vocals. From the rambling "Meet Me Half Way" to the bluesy "Come On Back My Way," Swindall has penned an addictive lineup of songs that will make converts of music fans across the board. Classic country sound runs deep through everything Swindall does, from holding photoshoots decked out in fabulous vintage styles to penning songs that hearken back to country's golden era. Swindall cites Patsy Cline as a major influence on her sound, and she deftly channels the Queen of Country in the swinging "Refuse to Be Blue." The first moments of "My Minglewood Blues" consist of goosebump-inducing echoes of Swindall covering Hank Williams' "Your Cheatin' Heart" before she launches into a raucous, big-band hoedown that demands listeners near and far drop everything and hit the dance floor. Closing out the record, the title track showcases what audiences love best about Swindall. "You Can Call Me Darlin' If You Want" puts her songcraft on full display in a song that's undeniably new while playing like a time-honored classic. Just like a favorite pair of well-worn jeans, Kelley Swindall's sound is one that music fans are finding fits them just right.

GWAR, of course, is the legendary heavy metal band formed in 1984 made up of barbaric interplanetary warriors whose home base on Earth is Antarctica. Jizmak has his own story: He is a beast of great power who was frozen in a block of ice before being thawed to replace former GWAR drummer Nippleus. He comes from a planet where, apparently, there are "many frisbees" and also seems to like whiskey. Fred was lucky to make it through the interview alive, as GWAR is notoriously hell-bent on destroying the human race. During the interview, Jizmak talks about decapitation, missing killing humans on stage and his love of Earth whiskey, while tasting and ranking five bourbons. Along the way, Jizmak gets a taste of what some consider the best bourbon ever made and chooses his favorites.

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and the GWAR drummer cover a number of topics, such as:
Jizmak notes that while it's possible to write good music while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, it's impossible to play music well, so the band doesn't drink prior to a show. (That said, when they slaughter humans, they're usually wasted.)
When talking about COVID-19 keeping them from touring and performing live, Jizmak does concede the band enjoys watching thousands of humans die from Antarctica. "It's like reality TV for us," he says.
Jizmak notes that one of the blind-tasted bourbons obviously had lots of alcohol content. "This tastes like driving school," he says, meaning that particular bourbon is a great way to get a DUI.
His first love in whiskey was Maker's Mark, but around 2010 he began to try other bourbons and expanding his palate beyond just Maker's, blood and human flesh.
Fred and Jizmak agree to have some GWAR Glencairn glasses produced. Gotta like fan swag.
At about the 34-minute mark, Fred realizes he poured one of the bourbons wrong, which makes him wonder aloud if he's had too much bourbon already.
Jizmak offers to have Fred as a guest on his YouTube show Cocktail Corner with Jizmak. Fred asks if he'll wear an ascot on the show, and Jizmak quickly says no way. "You don't tell me, I tell you. I'm the god here."
Here's a scoop: GWAR has a whiskey in the works, so expect it to be released to the public in 2021. No word yet on whether there will be blood in the mash bill or if it will be finished in human carcasses.
Fred compares the endurance of GWAR's popularity to heritage brand bourbons. For Jizmak the popularity relates directly to the interactive nature of the band's shows. While most bands just stand up on stage and play, he says, "Our show and music, we ... hit you in the face with a big bucket of goo, whether its blood piss or semen. It's not a spectator sport, so to speak."
Jizmak doesn't much care for vodka as a spirit, much to Fred's relief. "It seems like it's for college people."
Jizmak rants about how difficult it is to get good bourbon, thanks to state-controlled liquor stores and the folks who stalk the liquor stores buying up all the good stuff to sell on the secondary market. No wonder he enjoys slaughtering humans so much.
Jizmak finally chooses Elijah Craig Barrel Proof as his favorite of the flight, following a final taste-off.

QUOTABLES

Jizmak notes that his species doesn't have an advanced sense of taste of sight, which makes it tough to taste and see, but easy to just take care of business: "Humans look blurry. I can't tell if you're a cow or a human being, so that's why we just slaughter everything in our path."

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Matt touch on a wide range of topics, like:
Jim Beam was Matt's first bourbon crush - partly because he heard Hank Williams Jr. singing about it. He mixed it with Dr. Pepper in his younger days.
Fred talks about getting old, having "an efficient liver" and his doctors telling him repeatedly to lose weight.
Fred talks about the many taxes distillers pay on their products, noting that one specific tax is earmarked for education while another is for roads. For that reason, he jokes, "When you buy bourbon, you're helping the children of Kentucky. ... This is straight up philanthropic efforts."
Matt learns for the first time, thanks to Fred's tutorial, that whiskey gets its color from the oak barrels in which the liquid ages. Fred also imparts that the finish - how long the flavor and sensation stays on the palate - is the most important part about any whiskey.
When the band's on tour, Uncle Kracker generally is packing Crown Royal whiskey on the trip. Sometimes Jameson takes its place.
On making music, Matt said while his first love was rap, he began ignoring genre, just adding all types of flares to his music, from pop to soul to country, "like making gumbo." He adds, "Genre is only important to people who are trying to sell it."
On his 2020 pandemic-inspired single, he said, "The song was just this fun song I had never really finished. I wrote it with a couple of my buddies." They were talking one night and decided to finish the song with lyrics about the pandemic, and the result was the single, "No Time to Be Sober."
Fred notes that he makes it a point to no longer drink, or specifically pay drinking games, during presidential or vice presidential debates: "I don't get riled up, I get depressed."
Fred relates his love of Eazy-E when he was young and tells the story of getting busted listening to the notorious profane rapper by a very hairy principal at his school. The principal calls Fred's mom and sells him down the river. "It was like I had just introduced Satan into our middle school."
As usual, Fred educates his guest on the ins and outs of whiskey, and Matt admits several times that he's learned things he never expected to know about bourbon and rye. Part of Fred's purpose in educating Matt is so he will "never touch vodka again."
Fred then explains what vodka truly is, about its dirty dealings and why he hates it so much.

QUOTABLES

Matt says he began listening to rap at around age 10, and he recalls watching a late-night cable access show on which he first saw the rap act the Fat Boys and their video "Jail House Rap." "When they came on the scene, it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen in my life. It was these three big dudes rapping about food and getting in trouble for eating food -- I fell in love immediately. Rap music had me at 10."

Scott and musical partner Ken Jordan founded the band in 1993, becoming pioneers of EDM (Electronic Dance Music). The due released its debut album, Vegas, in 1997, and that record would go on to achieve platinum sales. The Crystal Method would go on to release five more club music albums, including 2018's The Trip Home. On the show, Scott talks with Fred about creating a new musical style, touring, Louder Than Life, keto dieting, tequila, movies and much more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Smooth Ambler Old Scout (18:36)
Blanton's Single Barrel (29:18)
Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Barrel Pick (38:56)
Barrell Bourbon 15 Year Old (1:15:56)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Scott discuss a variety of topics, such as:
Scott explains how The Crystal Method grew from attending dance party shows in small L.A. clubs back in the early 1990s.
He also recalls that as grunge died down toward the middle 1990s, Rolling Stone put an EDM band - before the term EDM existed - on the cover of Rolling Stone and declared the style "the next big thing." The Crystal Method's first album was released shortly thereafter, propelling the duo from the clubs into mainstream entertainment channels.
Scott also relates that his music is for more than just dancing - the band's goal was always to make music that could be enjoyed in any situation.
While tasting Old Scout, Scott reveals he's more of a tequila guy, but also talks of once upon a time enjoying a party drink called Flaming Dr. Pepper. (If you've not heard of this cocktail mix, it's worth looking up.)
Scott also shares a memory of spending time at a friend's house in Oklahoma and getting to try dozens of vintage bourbons in specialty decanters.
Along the way, Fred shares some Blanton's with Scott - from a bottle that he says is one of the best he's had in quite a while, citing the bourbon's inconsistency in contrast to its scarcity.
They veer into a quick chat about their love for ice cream. And hot sauce. But not necessarily together.
Scott and Fred apparently narrowly missed meeting each other last year at Louder Than Life - The Crystal Method played before GWAR, which almost dusted Fred's white suit with blood spray. Fred also related that somehow GWAR were able to sip bourbon through their costumes. Impressive.
After trying the Jack Daniel's Single Barrel - which was bottled at barrel proof - Scott proclaims it "shakes everything out of the tree."
Fred relates how, while serving in Iraq, he would have friends ship Listerine bottles refilled with whiskey to him to work around the no-drinking policy in the Army. He also discusses other memories and revelations from his time there in 2004-2005.
They then move into a discussion about how America is, as Fred puts it, "at a tipping point," and he compares the state of the country today to how Iraq was 15 years ago, from civil unrest to kidnapping schemes on government representatives.

QUOTABLE

Scott tells Fred that early on, a prospective manager wanted the band to change its name due to the perceived drug reference. They were told, "OK, you guys gotta change your name. There's no radio station that's going to play your music because of your name. We were young and stupid, and we were, like, 'But you remember it though, right?'"

B-Line (Northern Kentucky Bourbon...]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, musician and co-founder of The Crystal Method Scott Kirkland stops in to chat with Fred and sip some whiskey. Scott and musical partner Ken Jordan founded the band in 1993, becoming pioneers of EDM (Electronic Dance Music). The due released its debut album, Vegas, in 1997, and that record would go on to achieve platinum sales. The Crystal Method would go on to release five more club music albums, including 2018's The Trip Home. On the show, Scott talks with Fred about creating a new musical style, touring, Louder Than Life, keto dieting, tequila, movies and much more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Smooth Ambler Old Scout (18:36)
Blanton's Single Barrel (29:18)
Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Barrel Pick (38:56)
Barrell Bourbon 15 Year Old (1:15:56)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Scott discuss a variety of topics, such as:
Scott explains how The Crystal Method grew from attending dance party shows in small L.A. clubs back in the early 1990s.
He also recalls that as grunge died down toward the middle 1990s, Rolling Stone put an EDM band - before the term EDM existed - on the cover of Rolling Stone and declared the style "the next big thing." The Crystal Method's first album was released shortly thereafter, propelling the duo from the clubs into mainstream entertainment channels.
Scott also relates that his music is for more than just dancing - the band's goal was always to make music that could be enjoyed in any situation.
While tasting Old Scout, Scott reveals he's more of a tequila guy, but also talks of once upon a time enjoying a party drink called Flaming Dr. Pepper. (If you've not heard of this cocktail mix, it's worth looking up.)
Scott also shares a memory of spending time at a friend's house in Oklahoma and getting to try dozens of vintage bourbons in specialty decanters.
Along the way, Fred shares some Blanton's with Scott - from a bottle that he says is one of the best he's had in quite a while, citing the bourbon's inconsistency in contrast to its scarcity.
They veer into a quick chat about their love for ice cream. And hot sauce. But not necessarily together.
Scott and Fred apparently narrowly missed meeting each other last year at Louder Than Life - The Crystal Method played before GWAR, which almost dusted Fred's white suit with blood spray. Fred also related that somehow GWAR were able to sip bourbon through their costumes. Impressive.
After trying the Jack Daniel's Single Barrel - which was bottled at barrel proof - Scott proclaims it "shakes everything out of the tree."
Fred relates how, while serving in Iraq, he would have friends ship Listerine bottles refilled with whiskey to him to work around the no-drinking policy in the Army. He also discusses other memories and revelations from his time there in 2004-2005.
They then move into a discussion about how America is, as Fred puts it, "at a tipping point," and he compares the state of the country today to how Iraq was 15 years ago, from civil unrest to kidnapping schemes on government representatives.

QUOTABLE

Scott tells Fred that early on, a prospective manager wanted the band to change its name due to the perceived drug reference. They were told, "OK, you guys gotta change your name. There's no radio station that's going to play your music because of your name. We were young and stupid, and we were, like, 'But you remember it though, right?'"

THE 2013 PRESS RELEASE ON FOUR ROSES 125TH

Four Roses Distillery announces the second 2013 limited edition bourbon to mark the brand's year-long celebration of its 125 years in distilling. The first was a single barrel bourbon released in the spring and the second will be the 2013 Limited Edition Small Batch Bourbon, to be released this fall.

Four Roses Master Distiller Jim Rutledge personally chose three of Four Roses' ten unique bourbon recipes to create the new barrel strength, small batch bourbon. The recipes, each with different flavor characteristics, include an 18-year-old selection of Four Roses' recipe coded OBSV (featuring delicate fruit, spicy and creamy characteristics), a 13-year-old OBSK (rich in spiciness, full body), and a 13-year-old OESK (spicy, full body).   The bourbon exhibits aromas of creamy vanilla, light oak and cherry cordial, with hints of nutmeg and cocoa. The palate offers flavors of raspberries and apricots, encompassing a long, luxurious vanilla bean and cherry finish.

This anniversary bottling offers a taste straight from the barrel when the bourbon is uncut and non-chill filtered. Approximately 8,000 bottles of the Four Roses 2013 Limited Edition 125th Anniversary Small Batch Bourbon are planned for distribution in September to U.S. markets. 

"I'm always coming across some really amazing bourbons during the selection process," said Rutledge.  "And for this special release, I was presented with quite the challenge to make a selection...]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[#WhiskeyTube #FredMinnick #BestBourbon

Trey has been with ESPN for two decades, having hosted SportsCenter, NFL Prime Time and been a co-host of Golic and Wingo. He also is on the celebrity board of Ronald McDonald House Charities. On the show, he talks with Fred about his love of bourbon, they talk whiskey aroma and flavor, Pappy Van Winkle's legacy, NFL legend Mike Singletary, bourbon folklore and much more.

Whiskeys tasted:
Old Fitzgerald 14 year Bottled in Bond (8:58)
Elijah Craig Toasted Barrel (18:43)
Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (33:01)
Knob Creek Rye (40:54)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Trey cover a number of topics, such as:
Trey grew up in the Northeast and ended up going to college in Texas and his first week at Baylor he met four other people named Trey - he'd never met another Trey until then.
Legendary linebacker Mike Singletary's record of cracking helmets when he played college football.
Elijah Craig's legacy as the "father of bourbon," which Fred says is just marketing mumbo jumbo. "Bourbon labels have as much bullshit per square inch as a political ad," Fred notes.
Fred talks about how he went from a sports copy editor to his current career as a bourbon expert.
Trey then tells Fred how he first became a broadcaster for ESPN in 1997, and how he had to wait longer than he'd hoped to be hired by the sports network.
They talk about how the masses on social media, and even some sports broadcasters (looking at you, Skip Bayless), can be overly critical of athletes. Trey notes, "Twitter can be an amazing tool or it can just be a tool." Ouch.
Trey talks about a high school friend who wrote an essay about his favorite beers - yes, in high school - and got an "A." That wouldn't happen today.
They also talk about how America treats alcohol differently than most other countries around the world, and the social ramifications associated with how alcohol is perceived in various places.
The conversation eventually turns to sports in the age of coronavirus and how hungry people were for anything sports related by the time the NFL draft rolled around in the spring, leading to a record audience of 56 million viewers over three days.
Vodka sucks.

QUOTABLES

In talking about ESPN's roots, Wingo reveals a fascinating back story about how ESPN was never intended to be a wide-reaching medium, it was meant to cover Connecticut sports. "ESPN really was never supposed to be the Worldwide Leader in Sports, it was going to be a Connecticut cable station. From a very simple idea came a monolith, for lack of a better term."

Trey has been with ESPN for two decades, having hosted SportsCenter, NFL Prime Time and been a co-host of Golic and Wingo. He also is on the celebrity board of Ronald McDonald House Charities. On the show, he talks with Fred about his love of bourbon, they talk whiskey aroma and flavor, Pappy Van Winkle's legacy, NFL legend Mike Singletary, bourbon folklore and much more.

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Trey cover a number of topics, such as:
Trey grew up in the Northeast and ended up going to college in Texas and his first week at Baylor he met four other people named Trey - he'd never met another Trey until then.
Legendary linebacker Mike Singletary's record of cracking helmets when he played college football.
Elijah Craig's legacy as the "father of bourbon," which Fred says is just marketing mumbo jumbo. "Bourbon labels have as much bullshit per square inch as a political ad," Fred notes.
Fred talks about how he went from a sports copy editor to his current career as a bourbon expert.

Well, Jordan Pettit is the answer. He's the artist relations representative who helps decide who gets onto the stage at the country music tradition, so he's seen a little of everything over his years spent in the music industry in Nashville. In this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, Jordan sits down with Fred to talk about the music business, bourbon, the city of Nashville, and of course to sip some fine whiskey.

Whiskeys tasted:

Thomas Handy (26:56)
Elijah Craig 17 Year (29:52)
Glenlivet 20 Year (38:27)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Among the topics Fred and Jordan discuss are:
Jordan remembers seeing country star Chris Stapleton playing a small room to people who had no idea who he was. This was not long before he broke and became a star.
He also talks about how "so many things have to line up" for an artist to "make it" in country music. It isn't always about talent, but rather also about having the right support and marketing. "What I try to tell artists early in their careers ... if you're doing this for the right livings and you can earn a living the rest of your life, you have made it."
Jordan compares bourbon to music insomuch is that it's an art form.
Fred picked bourbons to taste that are cinnamon- and caramel-forward, and he hit Jordan's palate right on the money. (He particularly liked the Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch.)
Jordan talks about blending Old Forester 1920 with Old Forester 1920 to make an Old Fo 1915. Blending, of course, is a common practice for bourbon lovers, Fred included.
Fred doubles down on a previous declaration of the Elijah Craig being "absolute bliss."

QUOTABLES

Speaking about watching up-and-coming artists performing on the Grand Old Opry for the first time, Jordan said, "When you get to see an artist step into that lineage, to step into honoring those artists' legacies, and carrying this Opry show into the next 95 years of where we're going, you see their faces and you get to see raw emption happen because it's truly like a coming of age for them."

In this episode, they talk a little football and sip a little whiskey. Jared talks about how he got into bourbon, talks about some of his favorite quarterbacks to sack, Irish Whiskey, running back Adrian Peterson, Bounty Gate, fan-free football during a pandemic and plenty more.

EPISODE SUMMARY

Allen used to be a beer guy ("banquet beers" with some Crown Royal once in a while), but he came to love bourbon while he was still playing in the NFL. He was in Capetown, South Africa, and went to a whiskey bar, where his eyes were opened. So was his palate. Along the way, he and Fred talk about several topics:
Speaking about his former teammate Brett Favre, his one-time teammate, Jared said his main takeaway was they you could see why he was great - namely, his work ethic, the love of his craft and his knowledge of the game.
Allen also said that while he loved playing against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field because of the history and nostalgia there, he hated when Vikings fans would sell their tickets to home games, meaning often it seemed there would be more Packers fans than Vikings fans when the teams played at Minnesota.
Fred explains the marketing term "brand" comes from the practice of the physical brands on whiskey barrels. People knew which of those brands would typically hold the best whiskey, as opposed to whiskey that was laced with, to be kind, unsavory filler ingredients.
Fred also talks with Jared about the "shenanigans" that go on in American whiskey, specifically touching on the practice of companies buying barrels, bottling the product and then using marketing to sell off bottles. He also relates how, for instance, Wild Turkey marketed itself as a "tough guy" whiskey, and the image stuck for years.
Fred relates how Jim Beam taking away the ages statement from Jim Beam Black was the beginning of his "curmudgeon" phase in terms of whiskey. "I don't like when things change," he says.
"Benchmark is awful. God awful." -Fred
The Red Breast 27 Year Old gets the distinction as "the whiskey drinker's whiskey" by Fred, and Jared chimes in, "I've never gotten into the Irish whiskys, but this is delicious."
On the other hand, martial artist/boxer Conor McGregor's Proper No. Twelve Irish whisky is not, according to Fred, who can't seem to express his distaste enough: "By the way, that's shit whisky. I don't know if you're friends with Conor McGregor, but ... He did something that no other celebrity in whisky has done. He sold 250,000 cases like that. And it tastes like horse piss. It might be the worst whisky release this century. It's so bad. ... I respect alcohol; I'm trying to get people to respect it. That's just trying to get people drunk." Turns out Jared was teammates with McGregor's manager in college.
On the topic of Adrian Peterson, Allen says, "I've never seen anybody with that type of ability. Even through all the ups and downs, you can't help but root for him. He's genuinely kind to his core and his heart."
Jared talks about the NFL's handling of situations like DeflateGate and BountyGate, and how if they had been handled in the moment, it would have changed the outcome of the respective games.
Late in the show, Fred reveals his love for Monster Trucks and Jared declares the Henry McKenna is his favorite of the show.

Speaking of Henry McKenna 10 Year, Allen says, "This is smooth. This is asleep-by-seven-o'clock smooth."

Fred also talks with Jared about the &#34;shenanigans&#34; that go on in American whiskey, specifically touching on the practice of companies buying barrels, bottling the product and then using marketing to sell off bottles. He also relates how, for instance, Wild Turkey marketed itself as a &#34;tough guy&#34; whiskey, and the image stuck for years.
Fred relates how Jim Beam taking away the ages statement from Jim Beam Black was the beginning of his &#34;curmudgeon&#34; phase in terms of whiskey. &#34;I don&#39;t like when things change,&#34; he says.
&#34;Benchmark is awful. God awful.&#34; -Fred
The Red Breast 27 Year Old gets the distinction as &#34;the whiskey drinker&#39;s whiskey&#34; by Fred, and Jared chimes in, &#34;I&#39;ve never gotten into the Irish whiskys, but this is delicious.&#34;
On the other hand, martial artist/boxer Conor McGregor&#39;s Proper No. Twelve Irish whisky is not, according to Fred, who can&#39;t seem to express his distaste enough: &#34;By the way, that&#39;s shit whisky. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re friends with Conor McGregor, but ... He did something that no other celebrity in whisky has done. He sold 250,000 cases like that. And it tastes like horse piss. It might be the worst whisky release this century. It&#39;s so bad. ... I respect alcohol; I&#39;m trying to get people to respect it. That&#39;s just trying to get people drunk.&#34; Turns out Jared was teammates with McGregor&#39;s manager in college.
On the topic of Adrian Peterson, Allen says, &#34;I&#39;ve never seen anybody with that type of ability. Even through all the ups and downs, you can&#39;t help but root for him. He&#39;s genuinely kind to his core and his heart.&#34;
Jared talks about the NFL&#39;s handling of situations like DeflateGate and BountyGate, and how if they had been handled in the moment, it would have changed the outcome of the respective games.
Late in the show, Fred reveals his love for Monster Trucks and Jared declares the Henry McKenna is his favorite of the show.

EPISODE SUMMARY

Here a few highlights from this week's episode of The Fred Minnick Show:
Fred commends Mike on his social leadership, in particular becoming a social leader after becoming a rapper
Mike's fourth grade teacher urged him to not become a rapper because he was such a good student and leader. Although, he considers himself a "reluctant leader."
Mike had a role on Adult Swim's "Frisky Dingo," and relished being an "arch villain" on the show.
In talking leadership, he emphasizes recognizing we are all human beings - even our leaders. "Most leaders aren't Superman, they're more like Bruce Wayne ... They can get hurt."
Mike also states he hopes Americans will be led by morals and principles and not led by men, a notion that would mean everyone does their part so that no one has to do too much.
He also points out that slavery is so recent that it's only "two Mitch McConnells ago." He still believes racism is "curable."
Fred chimes in that he still wonders why American society doesn't function as a unit as was the case when he was in the military. "We are one America. We're all Americans."
Killer Mike calls Johnny Walker Blue Label his "Tom Brady of whiskey." Nevertheless, he remains a Falcons and Packers fan, thanks in part to a guy named Brett Favre.
Mike also talks about which rock bands and songs he would like to sample and/or collaborate with in the future, and also points out that rappers and country artists have a lot more in common that most realize, calling both "blue collar music."
Fred and Mike talk about the possibility of a Killer Mike whiskey happening someday. Fred tells Mike, "We can make that happen. I know a guy."

QUOTABLES

"It brings further possibility of inclusion on all levels from all of us. ... If more people in this country were less concerned with protecting their whatever it is and more with connecting with one another, I think that much like sipping a good whiskey together and talking some shit that you know great understanding and empathy comes from those things. ... This whiskey like any good whiskey is going to bring people together, should be bringing people together, and creating an atmosphere of talks that will progress us in a way that I don't think politicians and arguments will." -Killer Mike, talking about how the recognition of Nearest Green's whiskey legacy can apply to current events.

Golic Sr. is a veteran of ESPN, and was one half of the long-running Mike and Mike in the Morning radio show, which lasted 18 years. Golic Sr. was part of the show Golic and Wingo from 2017-2020. Golic Jr. also is a commentator on ESPN Radio. Both appreciate good bourbon, which made them a natural fit as guests on the show. Along the way, the conversation runs from broadcasting to beef jerky.

Orphan Barrel 24 year old (34:04)
Willett Single Barrel 15 year old (37:34)
Wild Turkey Revival Rye (43:20)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Here a few highlights from this week's episode of The Fred Minnick Show:
Both Mikes were surprised to learn that smelling bourbon with one's mouth open relaxes the olfactory and lets in more aroma. In the process, Mike Jr. learned that his right nostril is his "go-to nostril."
Fred admits to Mike Sr. the he has always admired the example he set for young fathers.
Mike Sr. talks about his life as a public figure and how it became an integral part of his life and who he is. Mike Jr. adds that having his dad as such a high profile figure meant he knew more eyes were on him as he played college football at Notre Dame and later went into broadcasting.
Both Golics were a bit unprepared for the depth and complexity of the bourbons they were tasting, as they had started out doing shots of Wild Turkey in their respective youths.
Fred gave the Golics a brief history of what a blended bourbon is, part of what make the Barrell 15 year old a unique product. Naturally, Fred points out the marzipan note in the whiskey's flavor.
Golic Jr. reflects on his attempts to stick in the NFL, which included bouncing around from the New Orleans Saints to the CFL and XFL, crashing on couches and ultimately deciding to hang up his cleats and pursue broadcasting.
also admits his enjoyment working at ESPN. He says it's "like working in Candyland" much of the time.
Fred tells the Golics that working out for a whiskey taster means eating a lot of pies and baked goods and Mike Jr. jokes he may have to consider a career change.
Golic Sr. says he gets beef notes from the Wild Turkey Revival, to which Mike Jr. says, "beef?" It was narrowed down to smoky notes, which may have conjured notions of brisket. Fred says, "I could go for some brisket at the moment."

QUOTABLES

On talking about his kids while on the air during his career, Golic Sr. said it was never difficult to blend the show with stories of his family. "It was great talking about them on the air because it was content. I knew it was going to help the show because they did such stupid stuff."

Ellis, a Kentucky native, appeared on Rolling Stone's "Artists To Watch" list, while CMT named her one of their "Next Women of Country." The outgoing singer spoke with Fred after a show, and they talked palate preferences, bananas foster and tasting whiskey. Wayne, meanwhile, as a 2019 'Listen Up' Artist by CMT, while Rolling Stone Country touted Nick in late 2018 as its 'Artist You Need To Know.' The laid back Nick talks with Fred about the music business and his songwriting process, and of course, whiskey comes into play as well.

Whiskeys tasted:
Jack Daniel's Barrel Pick (8:18)
Barrell Bourbon 1 (32:59)

EPISODE SUMMARY

Not only did Hannah go to school with one of Fred's former colleagues, Nick is a bourbon enthusiast who has a song series titled "Bourbon Neat." Here are a few of the topics Fred landed on with his dual guests:
Hannah revealed her love of pizza and charcuterie - anything and everything savory - so Fred did his best to find bourbons to meet her palate halfway.
She partook of a Jack Daniel's barrel pick, which satisfied her love of bananas foster and banana-flavored cocktails. I couple of drops of water helped smooth out the whiskey for her.
Along the way, Fred points out that Jack Daniel's whiskey is actually a bourbon, but JD chooses to call it a Tennessee Whiskey for marketing purposes. They also get into the prevalence of marketing in a broad sense. As Fred notes, "Most of everything in this world is marketing, and most marketing is bullshit."
Hannah also reveals that her first drink was a margarita, not whiskey, mostly because her dad was a margarita drinker on family vacations.
Fred spoke with Nick about songwriting and why we don't hear the word "bourbon" in song often.
They also talked about themes in country music, and the prevalence of trucks, tractors and the actual word "country" in today's current songs.
Nick talks about his songs that were recorded by Keith Urban and Tim McGraw/Faith Hill.
Once the whiskey starts flowing, Nick compares the BCS Bourbon 1 to Stagg Jr., "but without the burn." On the road, he typically drinks Buffalo Trace on the rocks. Nothing wrong with "budget bourbon."
He also reveals that Wayne is his middle name and not his last name (his real last name is Richardson), and won't admit that he wishes his first name was Bruce. Who wouldn't want to be called "Bruce Wayne"?

QUOTABLES

Hannah, talking about her "breakup" with bourbon a few years ago, blamed it on a single session of overindulgence: "A bottle of Wild Turkey did me in." Perhaps the quote of the show came from Nick, however, came as he talked about sharing stories over whiskey: "Bourbon is a sharing spirit but also there's a spirit in it that you start sharing."

On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, Grammy-winning guitarist and songwriter Derek Trucks joins Fred for a spirited conversation with plenty of whiskey sipping along the way. Trucks, co-founder of the Tedeschi Trucks Band (with wife Susan Tedeschi) and member of the Allman Brothers Band, has been a professional musician since his teen-age years, when he performed with Bob Dylan, Joe Walsh, Stephen Stills and others.

Here are the bourbons they tasted:
Weller Single Barrel (16:38)
Jefferson's Reserve (21:13)
Parker's Heritage (34:57)
Vintage Four Roses (45:16)

During the show, Derek tells the story of "The Viking," a man he knew in Kentucky who helped turn him onto bourbon in the early days, before the bourbon boom. Derek was smart enough to stock up back when things like Weller 12 year were common place. (Smart guy!) And Fred tells how he and his sons watch live music performances together on YouTube every weekend - including some Derek Trucks shows.

EPISODE SUMMARY

Some of the topics Fred and Derek get to while tasting whiskey together, such as:
Fred's wife Jaclyn keeps sneaking bourbon from his office, which threw a slight monkey wrench into this week's show.
Derek loved the Weller Single Barrel Fred sent him, saying, "I would never not want to drink that bourbon."
The legendary guitarist talks about the bourbon stashes of bands he's toured with, from the Allman Brothers (no alcohol, so he sneaked in his own Kentucky Spirit by Wild Turkey) to Eric Clapton (also not a drinker) to his own band.
Trucks also talks about being on the road as a child - he started touring at age 9 - and those who mentored him.
He talks at length about his dad and others keeping him grounded, including Willie Nelson and B.B. King. He also notes that not all the stars he met were terribly nurturing or friendly.
Fred recounts one of his favorite (and funniest) Parker Beam memories.
And Derek talks about some of his favorite music venues, such as Red Rock and The Fox in Oakland.
Fred tells a fascinating back story about the 1942 bottle of Four Roses, a blend of whiskeys from a variety of unknown distilleries, he and Derek tasted together. And then Fred drops his glass and spills it, so he promises to lick what's left off the floor.

The whiskey-centric show starts with a brief discussion about beard grooming, then gets into Jordan's first hand experience with Jefferson's Ocean barrels, Fred's 1-year-old son Julian and his fascination with Fred's stuff, the evils of bad whiskey, Jordan's family's whiskey bootlegging traditions and plenty more, including the pandemic's effect on music and musicians.

Here are the bourbons they tasted:
Wyoming Whiskey Cask Strength (7:50)
Larceny Barrel Proof B520 (14:11)
Parker's Heritage Collection 11 Year Old Single Barrel (18:55)
Distillery 291 Colorado Rye Whiskey (31:37)

Fred also showed a lot of interest in Jordan's experience on a boat at sea with the Jefferson's barrels. He tells Jordan he asked the distillery to have that experience and "they invited me to go swimming with the sharks." Oops. Not this time.

EPISODE SUMMARY

This episode takes a lot of interesting turns. Here are a few highlights.
Thanks to the pandemic, Jordan admits he has learned to groom his own beard - and what a beard it is.
Jordan talks about what he and his band drink on the road - Basil Hayden - and how many bottles they go through a night.
Fred and Jordan bond over their idea of an ideal night by a fire.
Fred gives Jordan a few pointers about finding fruit pie in bourbon.
Jordan asks Fred about how he got into bourbon, a story which goes back to 2005 after Fred returned home from his tour of military duty in Iraq.
Jordan later reminisces about his dad's love for bourbon and calls it "a special liquid." Fred agrees, saying, "Bourbon transcends every race, every creed, every political belief. ... Imagine a place in this work right now where you don't have to talk politics." Over bourbon, that's possible.
Jordan confesses that his wife isn't a whiskey fan - but he's trying. Fred laments that his wife Jaclyn likes to steal his best bourbon, sometimes for making whiskey sours, much to Fred's chagrin.
They talk about a cocktail called the Brown Derby, which was a Hollywood bar where the cocktail of the same name originated. Fred tells the story of going to Disney's re-creation of the bar - which didn't even have a Brown Derby on the cocktails menu. (Insert eyeroll here.)
Jordan tells the story of finding one of his favorite guitars, on which he wrote two hit songs, as well as how the pandemic has affected him and all musicians.
They wrap it up with Jordan ranking the whiskeys they tried: Parker's, Larceny, Colorado Rye and Wyoming Whiskey.

QUOTABLES

When Fred notes that Jordan is from Shreveport, Louisiana, he mentions he knows folks in his town like to drink whiskey. Jordan doesn't fight back for a minute: "We do like to tip a bottle back." Of course, Jordan likes his cigars and meat, too. His ideal evening would be a campfire, a fine whiskey, a cigar and "meat with a side of protein." Fred agrees, "This isn't a place for vegetables."

During their time together, they cover a number of diverse topics, Kyla - who is a tequila fan - gets a lesson in how to taste whiskey, and they also talk about life during the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted her to write more songs and to set up a music studio so she can record at home since she isn't able to go on the road to perform.

Here are the bourbons they tasted:
Blood Oath Pact 6 (13:15)
Elijah Craig rye (25:05)
Town Branch Barrel & Bottle (40:22)
Barrell Bourbon Batch 21 (50:16)

An episode highlight is when she relates when she first saw her tasting bottles, she saw one of the bourbons was 120 proof. She quickly tells Fred he is responsible for her medical bills if such a strong whiskey ruins her vocal cords. "You couldn't possibly ever want me to sing again," she jokingly sasses Fred at one point.

EPISODE SUMMARY

Fred and Kyla didn't just talk music and whiskey, however - the conversation takes all sorts of interesting turns:
She and Fred kick off the show with a spirited discussion about their shared love of the classic science fiction show Star Trek, from the original featuring Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Uhura to Voyager.
In revealing that one of her favorite characters is Scotty, she relates that she likes him because he was always stressed, yet he always got the job done. "Everybody needs a Scotty," she says.
She talks about her fans and about being the oldest contestant on "The Voice," saying some of her fellow contestants "could be my babies."
The Topeka, Kansas, native talks at length with Fred about growing up with tornadoes.
Kyla talks about what she has learned from therapy and how it has helped her further embrace the passion she feels for music.
She and Fred talk about her religious faith, and her belief that simply being kind to everyone we meet can transform the world we live in.
Finally, Kyla pairs each of the whiskeys they tasted with one of her songs; for example, "You Don't Own Me," the Lesley Gore cover, was her choice for the Elijah Craig.

QUOTABLE

After Kyla throws back her first pour, even as Fred instructs her how to taste bourbon, the two wind up giggling like kids when she gets embarrassed over her lack of whiskey drinking knowledge. "I am the worst taster ever," she says through laughter and tears. "I swallowed it immediately. This should literally come with children's instructions - I need a pop-up book."

One key topic of conversation is just how much our culture misses live music during the age of coronavirus. Of course, whiskey was involved, as Emerson is huge fan and an experienced taster, and the two made their way through a flight of four, discussing everything from Cracker Jacks to American history.

When it was all said and done, Emerson picked a Kentucky Owl Rye 11 year as his favorite, saying, "That is a really beautiful whiskey. ... It's such a mouthful of all the stuff you need."

Oh, and did you know where the term "Fitz" originally came from? You'll learn that in this episode too.

One key topic of conversation is just how much our culture misses live music during the age of coronavirus. Of course, whiskey was involved, as Emerson is huge fan and an experienced taster, and the two made their way through a flight of four, discussing everything from Cracker Jacks to American history.

When it was all said and done, Emerson picked a Kentucky Owl Rye 11 year as his favorite, saying, "That is a really beautiful whiskey. ... It's such a mouthful of all the stuff you need."

Oh, and did you know where the term "Fitz" originally came from? You'll learn that in this episode too.

Peerless Rye (7:24)

Kentucky Owl Rye 11 year (17:15)

Meghan surprisingly picks Woodinville Whiskey over contenders like Russell's Reserve Single Barrel, Smooth Amber Contradiction, Weller Antique Collection and Elijah Craig 12 year old, prompting Fred to excitedly declare it "an upset of epic proportions." And, of course, they agree that vodka sucks.

Neil also gives advice to rising musicians and talks about his new venture--a spirits company--including a solid whiskey called Three Chord.

NEIL GIRALDO

Neil is a professional musician, producer, and film composer with over four decades experience. A songwriter with a back catalog of more than 100 songs and more than 45 million records sold, he has worked with some of the greatest artists in the music industry, including Rick Derringer, Pat Benatar, John Waite, Kenny Loggins, Steve Forbert, The Del Lords, and Beth Hart. His work has produced many Grammy-nominated and Grammy-winning hits, and he holds the distinction of being the first guitar player appearing on MTV. Today, he continues to expand his creative portfolio: in addition to writing new songs for stage and screen, he is writing screenplays for feature films, touring, and reaching out into the community to work with musicians young and old.

Giraldo began his professional career in 1978 as a key member of the Rick Derringer band after competing against 200 other guitarists for the position. It wasn't long before Rick discovered Giraldo's piano playing prowess and quickly put those skills to work in the studio for the recording of Guitars and Women. In the spring of 1979, Mike Chapman introduced Giraldo to an up-and coming singer named Pat Benatar who had recently signed to Chrysalis Records. While impressed with the young vocalist, Chapman felt she needed a musical partner who could facilitate the creation of a sound both identifiable and powerful. Over the years Neil has produced some of their biggest hits, including "Love is a Battlefield" and "We Belong."

With a back catalog of more than 100 songs written and more than 45 million records sold, Giraldo has written, produced, arranged, and recorded for Pat Benatar, John Waite, Rick Springfield, Kenny Loggins, Steve Forbert, The Del Lords, Beth Hart, The Coors, and others, which included many Grammy-nominated and Grammy-winning hits.

Neil was born in 1955 in Cleveland, Ohio. Immersed in the culture of his beloved Sicilian ancestry, his parents Anthony and Angela instilled the love of music at a young age, giving Neil his first guitar at the age of six, with the hopes that he and his sister, Priscilla, who played the accordion, could entertain family and friends with songs from the old country after church on Sundays. As Neil got older, his mentor, Uncle Tim, introduced him to revolutionary bands like The Yardbirds, The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, and all the other great guitar-driven rock 'n' roll bands of the 1960s. Finding new and innovative ways to shadow path his way into songs, Neil developed a discipline early on of not just playing along to his favorite artists, but creating different parts for himself within those tracks. At the same time, the budding guitar artist also became proficient on piano by continuously practicing along to Chuck Berry (Johnnie Johnson), Fats Domino, and Jerry Lee Lewis records. His interest in percussion instruments soon followed; practicing the drums to Simon & Garfunkel albums, he explored how different rhythms could alter the complexion of songs. These practices and disciplines created the basis for his future success as an innovative record producer and musician.

She's penned "I Drive Your Truck" recorded by Lee Brice, which won Song of the Year from the 2013 CMA Awards, 2014 ACM Awards and 2013 NSAI Awards. Jessi also wrote the hit No. 1 Blake Shelton songs  "Mine Would Be You" and "Drink On It," as well as Miley Cyrus' "The Climb," which became the anthem for her box office hit "The Hannah Montana Movie" and won the 2009 MTV Movie Awards 'Best Song From A Movie'. 

In addition, she's written songs for Tim McGraw, Celine Dion, Dierks Bentley, Miranda Lambert, Thomas Rhett, Trisha Yearwood, and Ashley Monroe, among others.

Hit after hit, Jessi's become the envy of songwriting Nashville. Now after all the songwriting cred, Jessi launches her own album, Decatur County Red, with a song called 'Momma Drank.' 

Jessi's a huge bourbon fan!

In this interview, Jessi drinks the last of Fred's King of Kentucky and gives him all the secrets to the songwriting trade.

 About Raelyn Nelson Band (from her website)

As an emerging female country artist in Nashville, history suggests that the quickest path to success is somehow aligning oneself with one of the major publishers, producers, songwriters, labels, or managers that are the heart of Music Row. So what do you do if you are an emerging female country artist in Nashville, and also happen to be the granddaughter of musical icon, Willie Nelson? You hook up with an independent producer and veteran of the rock/punk scene, write some songs that are part Loretta Lynn, part Cheap Trick, and form the Raelyn Nelson Band. Raelyn Nelson has been singing since she can remember. Having been raised on a steady diet of traditional country and gospel music, a gift from her grandpa in the form of a guitar during her teenage years was the inspiration she needed to begin writing her own country and folk songs. Looking for a place to record these songs, a mutual friend suggested JB (Jonathan Bright), a veteran of the underground rock scene and independent producer. After recording some of these early songs, they decided to try to write some things together and see what happened. The result? A completely fresh and original sound, a true hybrid referred to by some critics as "Country/Garage Rock." When they aren't recording their songs or making music videos, they are on the road taking their high energy live show to the people. Having shared the stage with such diverse musical acts as country superstar Tim McGraw, indie rock icons Drivin' n Cryin', and jam band supergroup Hard Working Americans, the RNB is proving that you don't have to fit neatly into any particular "genre" to find success.

"I don't really have any desire to be a 'solo-artist'. Everyone in my family who plays music has always placed a lot of importance on band chemistry, on stage, off stage and in the studio. Our band can almost read each other's minds. Why would I mess with that? We try to keep it simple: Write songs we like, record them, make a video, then go out and play them for people."- Raelyn Nelson

Having shared the stage with such diverse musical acts as country superstar Tim McGraw, indie rock icons Drivin&#39; n Cryin&#39;, and jam band supergroup Hard Working Americans, the RNB is proving that you don&#39;t have to fit neatly into any particular &#34;genre&#34; to find success.

&#34;I don&#39;t really have any desire to be a &#39;solo-artist&#39;. Everyone in my family who plays music has always placed a lot of importance on band chemistry, on stage, off stage and in the studio. Our band can almost read each other&#39;s minds. Why would I mess with that? We try to keep it simple: Write songs we like, record them, make a video, then go out and play them for people.&#34;- Raelyn Nelson

ABOUT Greensky Bluegrass (From their website)

Listen to their latest release.

Follow Greensky Bluegrass

Catch them at: https://www.campgreensky.com/ After 18 years together, up to 175 shows per year, nearly 1,000 different setlists, six studio albums, and a litany of live releases, Greensky Bluegrass embodies more than just music for members Anders Beck [dobro], Michael Arlen Bont [banjo], Dave Bruzza [guitar], Mike Devol [upright bass], and Paul Hoffman [Mandolin]. Truthfully, it embodies an ironclad creative bond, familial brotherhood, and a lifelong commitment to fans. At this point, it goes without saying the band means everything (and more) to the Kalamazoo, MI bluegrass mavericks. So, with a wink and a smile, they offer up a cleverly titled seventh full-length, All For Money, in 2019.

ABOUT Fred Minnick

He's the host of the Amazon Prime show Bourbon Up and Spirits Network's Frontier Filmmakers. In addition, the Wall Street Journal-bestselling author wrote seven books, including Whiskey Women, Rum Curious, Bourbon Curious, MEAD, and Bourbon: The Rise, Fall & Rebirth of An American Whiskey.

Minnick is a co-founder to Bourbon & Beyond and curates both B&B and the Hometown Rising Festivals, as well as being 1/3 of the popular Bourbon Pursuit podcast. But most importantly, he wears ascots.

Working cattle, hauling water, driving combines, tractors and eighteen wheelers from a young age all were a part of everyday life. When your closest neighbor is six miles away, and many hours are spent behind the wheel of a John Deere Tractor on the family farm, a work ethic becomes ingrained in your soul. During the miles burned up hauling water to cattle, Clare dreamed of creating her own music.

Fred talks to Clare about life in Colorado and nails down her palate as a cornbread fan. This interview is like two friends catching up.

Yeah, he loves nachos and it shows around his belly. 

After the nacho affair, an incredible interview commences with Ed Kowalczyk, the lead singer for LIVE, who's celebrating 25 years of its hit album "Throwing Copper." Fred confesses to Ed how a LIVE song deeply touched him as a teenager. Then, it was whiskey time, and Ed's a dynamic whiskey fan, who may have snuck a red solo cup on stage from time to time. Ed, a banana fan, gets accurately paired a Jack Daniel's barrel pick and gets the last drops of Fred's Elijah Craig barrel proof. That made Ed happy.

After answer a series of food flavor questions, Ed ends up sipping three beautiful bourbons and wanted to take them home.

TRIVIA Answer: President William Howard Taft 

When President William Howard Taft took office in 1909, there was mass confusion as to what whiskey was. The Pure Food & Drug Act had placed some limitations on medicinal marketing and given consumers an added layer of protection, but it really didn't define whiskey types. So many distillers were adding food coloring to distilled molasses and calling it bourbon. In what became known as the Taft Decision, the president gave whiskey its first federal definitions. In his lengthy writings, he specifically called out the quality, noting:

"Some time during the Civil War it was discovered that if raw whiskey as it came from the still, unrectified and without distillation, and thus containing one-half to one-sixth of 1 percent of fusel oil, was kept in oak barrels, the inside of the staves of which were charred, the tannic acid of the charred oak which found its way from the wood into the distilled spirits would color the raw white whiskey to the conventional color of American whiskey, and after some years would eliminate altogether the raw taste and the bad odor given the liquor by the fusel oil and would leave a smooth, delicate aroma, making the whiskey exceedingly palatable without the use of any additional flavoring or coloring. The whiskey thus made by one distillation and by the aging in charred oak barrels came to be known as "straight whiskey," and to those who were good judges came to be regarded as the best and purest whiskey..."

For this decision, Taft is in the Kentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame.
