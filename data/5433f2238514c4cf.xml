  <description><![CDATA[<div>The Borden murders are the most infamous double murders in American History, but there's more to the story than you've been told. On the morning of August 4, 1892, Lizzy's step mother, Abby, was bludgeoned to death in an upstairs bedroom of the family home. A few hours later, Lizzie's father, Andrew, met the same fate on the couch in the downstairs family room. Lizzie and the maid were the only other people home. But Lizzie swore she didn't do it--and there was little evidence to prove that she did.  So who did killed these people? And why? Detectives in 2021 are taking another look at the case.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Amanda was a single mother –struggling financially and working tirelessly– when she came home one day in 2011 with her daughter and turned on the news. A movement had been building in her town of El Paso, Texas around the wrongful conviction of Daniel Villegas. So, she wrote him a letter, turned her life upside down and made history. Here’s how one woman fought for someone else and found herself in the process.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Maggie Freleng is one badass journalist. As a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and producer, she gravitates toward telling the stories of underdogs – specifically the wrongfully convicted. So, when she heard about the 1999 murder of Yvonne Lane – a young mother from a the small town of Alliance, Ohio – and her ex-boyfriend who was blamed for the crime but had maintained his innocence for over a decade, Maggie started digging. And what she’d learn along the way in this investigation would test her mind, heart, and stamina in ways no one saw coming.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>August 11th, 2012 was a murky night for many in the town of Steubenville, Ohio as local high school students scattered themselves among a handful of parties that took a turn for the worse. A 16-yr-old girl – who would come to be known as Jane Doe – was repeatedly sexually assaulted at the hands of football players and bystanders alike, and it would take an outsider to follow the digital footprints and piece together that night as well as the wider web of rape culture in the town’s social hierarchy. Here’s how crime blogger and legal advocate Alexandria Goddard turned this story into a necessary storm.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In the early 1990s, fear and rumor swirled through New York’s LGBTQ community about a serial killer who targeted inebriated men leaving the city’s gay bars late at night. Their bodies, or rather body parts, were found wrapped in garbage bags and dumped at highway rest stops, far from the urban environs where they were last seen. Dubbed “The Last Call Killer,” it would take authorities almost an entire decade to stop him.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Lise Lotte-Lublin didn’t recall being sexually assaulted until 20 years after the fact while watching an interview with a famous model whose story seemed familiar. When she went to authorities only to learn nothing could be done, she decided to take the law into her own hands. She went on to change three sex crimes laws in her home state of Nevada, including the statute of limitations. She helped fellow survivors in other states do the same. And then, she testified before the man that she says attacked her all those years ago: Bill Cosby. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In 2005 a painting appeared in a gallery in New Orleans. it was believed to be from the 1500s and painted by a student of Leonardo Da Vinci. It was purchased for a little over $1,000. Within 5 years, this painting would be deemed a TRUE lost work of Leonardo Da Vinci--painted by the master himself--and sold for $400 Million. Is it possible that this painting had gone missing for hundreds of years and resurfaced in America? And if so, where had it been? IS THIS A TRUE LOST WORK OF THE GREATEST ARTIST OF ALL TIME? <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>When Roberta Blevins casually bought a pair of buttery soft, printed leggings from a fellow young mom on Facebook, she never could have imagined the journey that would follow. The rise and fall of LulaRoe –a multi-level marketing company that denies allegations of being a pyramid scheme and still exists today– coincided with Roberta’s experience, carrying her up the Lula-ranks and back down again when she discovered the dark side of direct sales. Come along, hun! We're deconstructing the lifestyle of the Almighty Girlboss.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In the late ‘90s, Anna Vasquez, Cassandra Rivera, Elizabeth Ramirez, and Kristie Mayhugh all received phone calls accusing their lesbian friend group of a crime that never actually happened. What followed was a modern-day witch trial, landing the San Antonio Four –as they’d come to be called– in prison for over a decade. When Anna unexpectedly got out on parole ahead of the others, she had no choice but to lead the fight for their innocence. Now, she’s dedicated her life to preventing similar stories from happening.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Gemma Hoskins remembers high school fondly, thanks in large part to her favorite teacher Sister Cathy Cesnik. So, when the beloved nun disappeared one November night in 1969 only to eventually be discovered dead in the woods, grief took hold over this ambiguous story for decades. And then, truth-telling around abuse in those hallowed halls merged with Gemma’s outstanding questions. 40 years after the murder, she got to work with the help of a former classmate of hers, and together they’d uncover more about the past than anyone expected.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Long before the hit podcast <em>Serial </em>spurred the world into podcast-listening, Rabia Chaudry was on a mission. The 1999 murder of a high school student named Hae Min Lee left a community grieving and a family friend of Rabia’s, 17-year-old Adnan Syed, in the crosshairs. He was sentenced to life in prison, where he still is to this day. In this episode, we’ll trace Rabia’s decades-long fight to free Adnan, find Hae’s killer and champion the truths of so many others along the way.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Connie Walker is a journalist on a mission to tell the stories of missing &amp; murdered indigenous women in Canada.

And the resulting journey of producing the podcast <em>Missing &amp; Murdered: Finding Cleo</em> would prove to be about so much more than one family’s fate.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On a cold day in 1983, a plumber was called to an apartment building in the Cranley Gardens neighborhood of North London. The building drains were clogged. And when he climbed down into plumbing "man hole" he saw what was causing the blockage: human flesh and bone. What followed was essentially an elaborate confession by one of the building's tenants: Dennis Nilsen who explained to the police that he had murdered and dismembered at least 12 men and boys and disposed of them both UNDER HIS FLOORBOARDS AND DOWN THE DRAINS. How is it possible that at least 12 people could vanish and be murdered and nobody noticed?<br>

In each case, their deaths are ruled hypothermia even though there's evidence of foul play. How could they have been missed by searchers? Were they abducted, murdered, and then brought back to the place they vanished? Loni Coombs investigates. <br>

<strong>FAM!! Season 2 of the Obsessed Network Original Podcast "Strange &amp; Unexplained With Daisy Eagan" launches today!</strong><br>
<br>
In case you aren't familiar, “Strange &amp; Unexplained is a podcast about all the things that make us wonder. Each week host Daisy Eagan tells the tale of something strange–sometimes it’s paranormal like a haunting or alien encounter, other times it Earthly like an unexplained disappearance or an unsolved murder. But it’s always a twisted tale of something just beyond what we can easily understand.  And each story is told with Daisy’s trademark blend of  humor, sass, and skepticism. <br>
<br>
In this episode, Daisy investigates what lurks inside the walls - Hidden Rooms: <br>
Have you ever had one of those dreams where you discover other rooms in your <br>
apartment? Like, suddenly there’s a door you never noticed before, and beyond it<br>
is all the extra space you always wish you had? Or maybe you’ve had the <br>
nightmare version where you open your closet door and instead of your clothes, <br>
you’re looking at some kind of medieval torture dungeon. What would you do if <br>
you actually found a hole in your home leading to somewhere else. <br>
<br>
Find and follow "Strange And Unexplained With Daisy Eagan" wherever you get your podcasts.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On the evening of June 7, 2021, Alex Murdaugh, a member of one of the most powerful families in South Carolina, came home to a brutal scene: The bodies of his 21 year old son, Paul, and 52 year old wife, Maggie. Both of whom had been shot multiple times. Could this be connected to the death of Paul's friend Mallory, who had been thrown from a boat Paul had been driving while drunk? And as the authorities dig deeper, they find TWO OTHER murders connected to the family that remain unsolved. What is going on here? Why do people connected to this rich and powerful family keep dying?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Adrienne Shelly was a writer and actress best known for writing and co-starring the film <em>Waitress</em>, which was later turned into a Broadway musical. But on the evening of November 1st, 2006 she was fond dead--hanging in the bathroom of her West Village, NYC office. The initial assumption by investigators was suicide, but her husband Andy didn't believe it and pushed the cops to work the case like a murder. Ultimately Andy was right, and the killer was found. But why did he do it? This documentary examines both the murder and the extraordinary life of the woman who was killed. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Between 1971 and 1983, meek and mild Robert Hansen seemed to have it all; a loving wife and children, a successful bakery business, and world-record hunting trophies bringing him respect from his peers. But behind this carefully cultivated exterior lurked a cold-blooded serial murderer who confessed to killing 21 women, 17 of which were recovered. It was only due to the actions of a few dedicated Anchorage, Alaska detectives (one of whom is the literal embodiment of LET THE WOMEN DO THE WORK!)  that "The Butcher Baker" was finally brought to justice.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>6 years ago, Aaron Quinn and Denise Huskins were woken in the middle of the night. It was a male voice who said, "wake up, this is a robbery." They were both drugged and bound, and Denise was kidnapped and heled for 48 hours before being released. The ordeal was horrific, but even more terrifying: Nobody believed them. The cops insisted the whole thing was a hoax, even as the kidnapper made it clear that he was still out there, and could come back at any time. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Hey, Fam!!  Today the Obsessed Network is launching Season 2 of “Crimes of the Centuries” - the true crime podcast from award-winning reporter Amber Hunt.</div>
<div>
<br>
Recently named by Rolling Stone as one of the 10 Best Crime Podcasts of 2021, “Crimes of the Centuries” rediscovers the true crime stories that shocked the nation—cases so unbelievable that we thought we’d never forget them, but somehow did. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>We’re starting off the second season with an episode about the Cleveland Torso Murders - when a series of headless torsos began appearing in that city.  Who was behind these gruesome killings, and would they be caught and brought to justice?</div>
<div>
<br>
We’re bringing you the first part of this episode here in this feed. To hear the rest, <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/Cleveland">click here</a> to find and follow Crimes of the Centuries wherever you get your podcasts.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>It's been 18 years since Scott Peterson was convicted of killing his pregnant wife, Laci. In that time, some members of his family have been working tirelessly to prove his innocence--that he couldn't have killed Laci. Some of their evidence is compelling, but so much of Scott's story still doesn't make sense. But Scott's attorneys are certain that if he's granted a new trial--which seems more and more likely--they'll be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that their client is innocent.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On a February night in 1994, Lamar Woods came home. The door to his apartment was open and his 10 month old son was screaming. In the bedroom, Lamar found his girlfriend, Brandi Henderson, brutally murdered. For a local detective, the murder sounded eerily similar to other killings that had happened in the area in recent years. It was clear that a serial killer was on the loose and it was only a matter of time until he killed again. <br>

At first they thought it was a joke. But when the man called back in the morning with the same demand, they knew 21-year-old son was in trouble. Later that day, the police would call the Bakers to tell them their son had been found. Dead. Murdered in the infamous "Manson Tunnel" outside of LA. But who could have done this? And Why? <br>

<br>
</strong>From 1974 – 1991, a serial killer tormented the people of Kansas. He called himself BTK, which stood for BIND, TORTURE, KILL. He wanted to incite fear and panic, and so his killings were especially brutal. He taunted police with postcards, letters, and voice messages, but no matter how many clues the madman gave them, they still couldn’t catch him. But then, in 2005, after 10 murders and more three decades of terrorizing the locals, they got him. And suddenly it was clear how he’d managed to hide in plain sight for so long. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On February 14, 2017, the bodies of 14 year old Abigail Williams and 13 year old Liberty German were found near the Manon High Bridge trail in Delphi, Indiana. The girls had disappeared from the trail the day before. Soon it was revealed that one of the girls, Libby, had captured audio and video of their presumed killer on her smart phone. But even with a mountain of evidence including audio of the killer's voice and a composite sketch, the girls' murder remains at large. Is he hiding in plain sight?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Fam! We're super excited to share this episode of "Strange and Unexplained" with the TCO fam. I (Patrick) helped research and write this episode and it tells two stories I've been OBSESSED with for decades. As the title says, these two stories are about two really important people who were hiding in plain sight. Amazingly, they lived about a hundred years apart in time, but only a few blocks apart in geography. One was a prominent member of society, the other a marginalized group. And they both had a secret they desperately wanted to keep. <br>
<br>
If you're looking for more stories like these, find and follow "Strange and Unexplained With Daisy Eagan" wherever you get your podcasts. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In the middle of the night on Nov. 20, 1969, a group of mostly young Native Americans escaped to Alcatraz, landing on the shores of Alcatraz Island, in the middle of San Francisco Bay. They occupied the former prison for 19 months, demanding that the federal government turn over the island to Indigenous Americans.

<strong>This is part 2 of our 2 part coverage of West of Memphis. </strong><br>
<br>
THE DOCUMENTARY WE ALWAYS SAID WE'D NEVER DO!</div>
<div>
<br>
The film focuses on the 18-plus year plight of the “West Memphis Three”: Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley who, in 1993, were convicted of the murders of three young boys in West Memphis, Arkansas.  Jason and Jessie each got life, Damien was sentenced to death. The film brilliantly chronicles the movement that fought for their release, shows the evidence that can prove their innocence, and points to a possible new suspect. AND. WE. ARE. OBSESSED<br>

<strong>It's the most famous--and most obsessed over--missing person's case of our time: <br>
</strong>On February 9, 2004, Maura Murray, a promising young nursing student, left her college dorm, emptied her bank account, and drove to a remote New Hampshire town where she didn't know a soul. Just after 7pm, her car crashed into a tree. A witness spoke to her, offering help, which she refused. And then she vanished into thin air. Nobody has seen or heard from her since.  Everybody has a theory: The family knows more than they're saying, the police botched the case and are covering it up, Maura fled her life and started over in Canada. This documentary series attempts to solve the mystery. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>It's been 18 years since Scott Peterson was convicted of killing his pregnant wife, Laci. In that time, some members of his family have been working tirelessly to prove his innocence--that he couldn't have killed Laci. Some of their evidence is compelling, but so much of Scott's story still doesn't make sense. But Scott's attorneys are certain that if he's granted a new trial--which seems more and more likely--they'll be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that their client is innocent. <br>

<div>Let us say right up front, Patrick and Gillian have never watched an episode of The Housewives, SO THIS WAS A REAL EDUCATION….And now Patrick identifies as Housewives Curious. OK,  so Beverly Hills Housewife Erik Jane (you guys, I could watch that XXPEN$IVE video allllll dayyyyy, and if you don’t know what that is, just you wait) and her husband, legal titan Tom Girardi are in super big trouble. It seems that Griardi has been stealing huge sums of money from his clients WHICH INCLUDE PLANE CRASH AND BURN VICTIMS. Yikes, Tom. Also, Erika maybe was in on it? There’s a lot to unpack here. BUT ALSO THE HOUSEWIVES!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>During its 1980s and 1990s heyday, New Jersey’s Action Park earned a reputation as the most insane — and possibly the most dangerous — amusement park that ever existed. It was known as a lawless land, ruled by drunk teenage employees and frequented by even drunker teenage guests. The rides were experimental and illogical, and seemed to ignore even the most basic notions of physics or common sense—not to mention safety. And this documentary spills ALL. THAT. DRUNK. NEW. JERSEY. TEA!<br>

Remember how she went a little bananas and tried to poison the entire town in Oregon where the cult was based and then she plotted to assassinate a Senator, and then went into hiding after leaving the cult. WELL GUESS WHAT, SHE’S GETTING HER OWN DOCUMENTARY! After 35 years, she’s headed back to India to promote her book.

<br>
Can a building be evil? (Gillian: “NO, IT’S JUST A BUILDING!”). Can web sleuths solve a truly bizarre death? (Patrick: “NO! GET OFF FACEBOOK AND GO. OUT. SIDE.). And what exactly is a hotel general manager’s job? (Patrick and Gillian: (“UNCLEAR!”)  Welcome to the Cecil Hotel—a once grand hotel which rotted from the inside and became a place where “dreams go to die” and “serial killers let their hair down.”<br>
<br>
Elisa Lam knew none of that, of course, when she checked in on  January 28, 2013. She went missing a few days later. And two weeks after that, out of desperation to find her, the LAPD released the now infamous “elevator video” of her which set the internet ablaze. Join us and the investigators and internet…sleuths?...as we all try to put together the pieces of her disappearance and death. And I promise, we land on an answer as to what happened to her.<br>

<br>
If you live in a city, there was a time you saw a WeWork on just about every corner. It was the co-working space where all the cook kids went to, like, make stuff and drink coffee. But who even knew the whole thing was a cult-meets-pyramid-scheme with all you can drink "summer camps" and a leader who looks like the low rent Ashton Kutcher. OH BUT THEN REAL ASHTON KUTCHER SHOWS UP. This one is ridiculous. AND WE HAVE SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT OUR TIME WORKING AT A WEWORK. Dive in, lovelies. <br>
<br>
<strong>FAM! WE LAUNCHED A NEW PODCAST!</strong> <a href="https://lnk.to/98BXWuip">Check  out "Murder in Alliance."</a> It's a "Serial"-style active investigation into who killed 26-year-old Yvonne Layne in Alliance, Ohio. The murder was brutal and personal. Her ex-boyfriend, David Thorne, was convicted of the crime, but he couldn't have done it--he was two counties away at a class with several people who saw him. Host Maggie Freleng and her team of investigators--including Jason Baldwin of the West Memphis Three--are on the ground in Alliance tracking down witnesses, finding new evidence, and reporting in REAL TIME as they track down the real. Killer. <a href="https://lnk.to/98BXWuip">Binge the first 4 episodes here!</a><br>

As a teenager, Kemper killed his grandparents, was sent to a mental hospital WHERE HE WAS RELEASED ON GOOD BEHAVIOR 6 YEARS LATER. He would go on to kill 8 more people--including 6 young women and his own mother. But when he was caught, he agreed to spill alllllllllllllllll the tea about how and why he became a killer in a formal sit-down interview. And so of course they  made a documentary about it.<br>

</div>
<div>On the morning of September 7, 2012 Faith Hedgepeth’s roommate Karena Rosario found her dead in her bed in the apartment they shared near their college, UNC Chapel Hill. She’d been brutally beaten over the head with a liquor bottle and left to die. Nothing made sense. Faith was beloved at her school. Who would want her dead? Was this a random act of violence? Or, as police would quickly wonder, was it revenge?<br>

<div> </div>
<div>Sometime after midnight on February 6, 1985, 68-year-old Helen Wilson was raped and brutally murdered in her small apartment in downtown Beatrice, Nebraska. In an era before DNA testing, all investigators had to go on was the fact that the killer had a very rare genetic marker in his blood type. But there were no other viable clues. But four years after the crime, arrests started being made, one after another—six in total. And though they all claimed to have had nothing to do with the crime—and none of them had the rare genetic marker—they were all convicted. But when DNA evidence eventually exonerates them, the real killer is found out. <br>

<strong>OOPS WE DID IT AGAIN! This is Part 2 of our 2-part series covering "Framing Britney Spears."</strong><br>
<br>
How does a talented, productive, and financially successful pop star lose complete legal control of her life? Imagine, one minute you’re a singer at the top of you game—touring the world, selling millions of albums—and the next minute a father you have no relationship with is in full control of your finances, can decided who you can and can’t talk to, and can have you committed to a mental hospital with no explanation necessary.  That is the story of Britney Spears and the #FreeBritney movement.

<strong>OOPS! We accidentally made this a two-part series! WE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY! Part 2 is available right now and ad free at the $5 level on Patreon. It will be our regular episode next week!</strong><br>
<br>
How does a talented, productive, and financially successful pop star lose complete legal control of her life? Imagine, one minute you’re a singer at the top of you game—touring the world, selling millions of albums—and the next minute a father you have no relationship with is in full control of your finances, can decided who you can and can’t talk to, and can have you committed to a mental hospital with no explanation necessary.  That is the story of Britney Spears and the #FreeBritney movement. Come hear us scream about it for 2 episodes, won’t you?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On March 3rd, 2010, 48 year old Barbara Beach-Hamburg was found murdered in the side yard of her house in the wealthy town of Madison, Connecticut. The murder had been brutal and personal, and it completely changed the lives of Barbara’s two kids—18-year-old Madison and 16-year-old Ali. As years passed, Barbara’s murder remained unsolved and rumors swirled about who could have done it. Was it Barbara’s ex-husband, with whom she’d had bitter divorce? Was it her sister Conway who always lived in Barbara’s shadow? Could Ali have done it? Or could someone else have wanted Barbara dead? Over the course of 8 years, Madison, Barbara’s son, investigated her death by interviewing everyone in his family in a desperate quest to finally figure out what happened.<br>

She was expected home later that night, but has never been seen again. <strong>But there are lots of clues to suggest that Phoenix is alive and is out there somewhere. </strong>This two-part series investigates what happened to Phoenix: did she get fed up with her life and leave on purpose? Was she kidnapped and forced into the sex trade? Or did she die the day she vanished? <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>From 1974 – 1971, a serial killer tormented the people of Kansas. He called himself BTK, which stood for BIND, TORTURE, KILL. He wanted to incite fear and panic, and so his killings were especially brutal. He taunted police with postcards, letters, and voice messages, but no matter how many clues the madman gave them, they still couldn’t catch him. But then, in 2005, after 10 murders and more three decades of terrorizing the locals, they got him. And suddenly it was clear how he’d managed to hide in plain sight for so long. <br>

The same would happen if Hall tried to escape. Kiritsis called the police from Hall's office and told them that he had taken Hall as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage">hostage</a>. Through archival footage and interviews with people who were there, we watch first-hand the terror of this 3-day standoff between Kiritsis and cops.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In May and August of 1989, two toddlers were stolen from the same New York city playground. The playground was full of witnesses, but, seemingly, nobody saw anything. Were the kidnappings connected? Was there a "baby selling ring" as rumors suggested? And 30 years later, is there still a chance that these families can find their missing children? <br>

<br>
On the night of January 12, 2010, JoAnn Matouk Romain vanished from the parking lot of her church after an evening prayer service. The police on the scene were convinced she'd walked across the 4 lane highway behind the church, walked into a lake, and killed herself. But this explanation never made sense to her adult children. Her body was found 70 days later, 35 miles downriver--a development that screamed foul play to the family. Suddenly stories emerge about JoAnn not feeling safe in the days before she disappeared as a team of private investigators, police, and family members try to figure out what happened.<br>

<strong>THIS IS THE CASE PATRICK’S BEEN WAITING TO COVER ALL YEAR!<br>
</strong>On the afternoon of November 24, 1971 a man using the name Dan Cooper boarded a passenger flight at Portland international airport, and hijacked the plane. He demanded $200,000 in cash and 4 parachutes. And then, money in hand, he jumped out of the plane at 10,000 feet. No trace of Cooper was ever found—though some of the money eventually was. For nearly 50 years, people have been OBSESSED with this case. Did Cooper survive the fall? And who the hell was he—or she! And that is what this documentary attempts to find out.<br>

<strong>It's a weird one, you guys, but I really think it's one of our best episodes yet: </strong><br>
<br>
Ted Haggard was living the life. As the founder and head, like, Pastor (?) of the New Life Church, Haggard was one of the most rich, famous, influential Evangelicals in America. He, his wife Gayle, and their two kids had it all. <br>
<br>
<strong>And then Ted Haggard got busted buying Crystal Meth from and paying for sex with a gay male sex worker. WHOOPS! </strong>Haggard, who quickly "admitted" he'd been "struggling with this sexual problem" all his life was quickly ex-communicated from the church and his family was BANISHED--YES, BANISHED--from the state of Colorado. In this film, documentarian Alexandra Pelosi (name sound familiar, yeah, Nancy is her mom) basically follows Haggard around while he tries to pick up the pieces of his life. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In November, 1965, Lester Eubanks brutally murdered 14 year old Mary-Ellen Deener. He was swiftly convicted of the crime and sentenced to death. However in 1973, he was able to just walk away from his sentence while out of the prison on a shopping trip that had been arranged for inmates on an honor program. He hasn't been seen since. Lester Eubanks has been on the run for more than 40 years, and ever time the police close in, he remains a step ahead. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On July 10, 2015, two-year-old DeOrr Kunz vanished while on a camping trip with his young parents. The circumstances were...bizarre to say the least. The family was in the middle of the woods, miles from the nearest road. Little DeOrr had been walking with his parents, then turned to walk the 100 or so feet back to his grandfather. It was broad daylight. And in the split second that nobody was looking at the boy, he vanished, No trace of him was ever found. The case sounds odd until you discover that there are hundreds of cases just like this one, with many of the same circumstances. <strong>That's right, over the last 50 years, hundreds of people--many of them children--have vanished in broad daylight from campsites and national forests all over the country. </strong>Missing 411 tries to figure out what the hell is happening. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>At 10:44pm on May 31, 1995, a woman named Jennifer Fairgate checked into the Plaza Hotel in Oslo, Norway. It was the most exclusive hotel in Norway at the time. Two days into her stay, a security officer at the hotel knocked on the door to her room. Within seconds a gunshot rang out. When the police arrived, they found the woman dead on the bed. It turned out that she'd given a false name at check in. So who was this woman? Did she die by suicide or was she the victim of a murder? Was she a secret agent who had been assimilated on the job? PATRICK AND GILLIAN HAVE A LOT OF STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT THIS ONE!<br>

But on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981, she disappeared from the yacht she was sharing with her husband Robert Wagner and actor CHRISTOPHER FREAKING WALKEN.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>
<em>"Go out and kill, commands father Sam. I am here on Earth to create havoc and terror."--</em>letter to cops from The Son of Sam. 1977.<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1977, a serial killer is targeting young couples. He stalks them late at night. He waits until they get into their car, he shoots, and then runs into the shadows. With six people dead and New York City paralyzed by fear, the cops have no leads. And then then the taunting letters to the cops and the newspapers start, "I love to hunt.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On the night of September 1, 1969 residents of Berkshire County, Massachusetts witnessed UFOs--and they're recounting their experiences in EVERY. TERRIFYING. DETAIL. Some were abducted, some are missing hours of their lives, some are telling their stories for the very first time. Is this real? Many of these people have never met--to this day--but their accounts are shockingly similar. What really happened on that night 50 years ago?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On April 3, 2004, 23 year old Alonzo Brooks and 3 friends drove to a party in La Cygne, Kansas--about 50 miles from where they lived in Garner Kansas. It would later be said that Alonzo was the only black person at the party, and though by all accounts he was having fun, racial slurs had been directed at him. Later that night, Alonzo's three friends left the party, unknowingly stranding him there. When Alonzo didn't show up at home, the police eventually got involved and did search of the area near the party, but didn't find him. A month later, when the family was allowed to do their own search, they found Alonzo's body within minutes--and just behind the house where he was last seen. <br>

Charles Manson WAS NOT AN EVIL GENIUS. He was, as Gillian describes him, a puny little twerp. HOWEVER, the crimes committed at his behest are infamous. And surely you've heard the stories before, but this time we're hearing them FROM THE WOMEN WHO WERE THERE!! Squeaky, Gypsy, A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD NAMED SNAKE, you can't make this stuff up. Anyway,  buckle up and pull the hell over, the Manson Girls have the floor. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In early April, 2011—nobody knows the exact date—a prominent family vanished from their lavish townhome in Nantes, France. A few day later, close family members and friends of the family received a typewritten, unsigned letter from the mother and father stating that they had relocated to the Unitec States with their four children. They were now deep undercover working with the US government and would not be able to make further contact. Many accepted that it was possible, while others thought it was suspicious (BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY). After three weeks, when local police are convinced to take a closer look, a terrifying discovery is made that unlocks one of the WILDEST mysteries we’ve ever covered. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND BLAZER HOLES ARE BACK!<br>
<br>
On July 13, 2011, the body of 32 year-old Rebecca Zahau was found naked, bound, and hanging from a balcony at the Spreckels Mansion in Coronado, California. The death was quickly ruled a suicide, but many strange facts surround the case. The son of Rebecca's boyfriend, the Billionaire Jonah Shacknai, had fallen from a staircase inside the mansion just 2 days before and was now in critical condition. Jonah's brother, his ex-wife, and ex-wife's sister all had access to the mansion and felt that Rebecca was at least partially responsible for the accident. In episode 2, we have to deal with some audio hack trying to sell us "voice finger printing" AND prepare for the return of the garbage minute!!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>FAM!! SPOOKY SEASON IS HERE! To celebrate, we're adding an extra episode each week for the next 12 week to cover the FREAKING GLORIOUS NETFLIX REBOOT OF "UNSOLVED MYSTERIES!"<br>
<br>
Episode 1 delves into the mysterious death of Rey Rivera. On May 16, 2006 Rey was seen leaving his home in a hurry after getting a phone call. His wife was away on a business trip, so it was a house guest who heard him say "Oh!" before darting out of the house in flip flops. 8 days later, his decomposing body was found in an abandoned area of the Belevedere Hotel in downtown Baltimore. He seemed to have come through the lower roof, as though he had jumped--or been pushed?--off of the upper roof of the hotel. Was this murder or suicide? And what could possibly have been the motive for either? <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Here's the gist: During its 1980s and 1990s heyday, New Jersey’s Action Park earned a reputation as the most insane — and possibly the most dangerous — amusement park that ever existed. <br>
<br>
It was known as a lawless land, ruled by drunk teenage employees and frequented by even drunker teenage guests. The rides were experimental and illogical, and seemed to ignore even the most basic notions of physics or common sense—not to mention safety.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Lying somewhere between <em>Lord of the Flies </em>and a <em>Saw </em>movie, Action Park is remembered as a place so insane and treacherous that, decades later, anybody who ever stepped foot in it is left wondering whether their memories could possibly be true. It became a nearly perfect breeding ground for urban legends and myths.<br>

For episode 1, Maggie is telling the story of Ronnie Long. AND YOU NEED TO KNOW, AFTER MAGGIE WAS THROUGH REPORTING THE STORY, THERE WAS MAJOR NEWS IN THE CASE! SO STAY TUNED TILL THE END TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED! <br>
<br>
In 1976 Concord, NC, a man broke into the home of a prominent white widow and violently beat and raped her. Ronnie Long, a 20-year-old black man, was given consecutive life sentences for rape and burglary. In a mostly segregated town, Ronnie was convicted by an all white jury, with no evidence linking him to the crime, an alibi, and only a shaky witness ID from the survivor. Since then, it was revealed that the prosecution witheld exculpatory evidence for Ronnie. There is also DNA evidence Ronnie is trying to get tested to prove who the real attacker was. Ronnie, now 64, has spent 44 years in prison; however, major updates happened during this case while we were reporting it.<br>
<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The title of Ava DuVernay's extraordinary and galvanizing documentary refers to the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which granted freedom to enslaved people. Except, it didn’t really. The drafters of the amendment included a loophole that allowed for the re-enslavement of any person convicted of a crime. 13th explores The progression from that loophole to the horrors of mass criminalization and the sprawling American prison industry. With a potent mixture of archival footage and testimony from a dazzling array of activists, politicians, historians, and formerly incarcerated women and men, DuVernay creates a work of grand historical synthesis.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>A little after 8:45 am on the morning of July, 15, 1997, famed fashion designer Gianni Versace was shot execution-style on the front steps of his Miami Beach mansion. The assassin was 28 year old Andrew Cunanan--a hanger on who claimed to have met Versace in San Franciscio a few years before (though nobody knows if this is true.). When Cunanan flees the scene of the murder, a week long manhunt ensues as authorities come to realize that Cunanan had murdered four other men in his cross country journey to assassinate Versace.  <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On July 10, 2015, a 28 year-old black woman named Sandra Bland was pulled over in a small Texas town for failing to use a turn signal when she changed lanes. She was ultimately arrested and taken to the county jail. Three days later, she was found dead in her cell. The official coroner's report ruled the death a suicide, but many people believe that Sandra Bland was murdered. Sandy, as she was known to her family and friends, became a national figure in the Black Lives Matter Movement and "Say Her Name" attempts to uncover the truth behind her arrest and death.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Israel Keyes is the most terrifying serial killer you’ve maybe never heard of. <br>
<br>
Here’s what we know about him: He was methodical—he left “kill kits” hidden all across the country. He hid them years before using them, so he was also patient and self controlled. He picked his victims at random to avoid detection and is believed to have murdered at least 11 people across the United States between 2001 and 2012. He was a meticulous serial killer who constantly morphed his modus operandi and the location in which he killed which helped him evade capture for years. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In this bone chilling documentary, we actually see him kidnap his final victim, and we watch him being arrested. We go into the interrogation room with him as the police and FBI try to get the names and locations of his victims. But it’s all a game to Keyes, and he’s only willing to divulge a few of his secrets.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Brittany Murphy was a rising star who had it all, beauty, fame, and success … but she also had secrets. When she was found dead in her Los Angeles home at just 32 years old, Hollywood and legions of fans are left in disbelief. While her autopsy revealed that she died of natural causes, many believe foul play was involved. Details of her life and death emerge after her husband, Simon Monjack, and mother, Sharon Murphy, embark on a bizarre media blitz, creating more questions than answers. Then, within months, Monjack perishes under strikingly similarly circumstances – in the same bed he and Brittany once shared, only this time, allegedly with Brittany’s mother sleeping beside him. <br>

<strong>YOU GUYS WE REALLY LIKE THIS ONE!! WE ALMOST NEVER SAY THAT!</strong><br>
<br>
Marvin Heemeyer was a beloved resident of Granby, Colorado. He was a welder by trade and he loved his work. But slowly he came to believe that the town was out to get him. And then, according to Marvin, God told him to “get” the town first. So he bought a bulldozer and secreted himself away. For months he worked on the “Dozer” turning it into killing machine that the media would call a Kill-Dozer. And on June 4, 2004, he took his sixty-three ton machine on a rampage of the town. And the footage is as unbelievable as the story.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In 2003, The Dixie Chicks were on top of the world. They were the number 1 selling female band of all time, They were Grammy winners, and all around darlings of the country music scene. But then, at a club date in London, the band's lead singer, Natalie Manines, told the crowd that the band was "ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas." The backlash from their American fans was immediate. People burned their CDs, country music stations banned their music, and the band members received death threats. And we have A LOT to say about all of it<br>
<br>
<strong>WARNING! PLEASE READ BEFORE LISTENING! </strong>It won't come as a shock that this episode deals with politics. It also won't come as a shock that Patrick and Gillian love the Dixie Chicks and think they were on the right side of history. Patrick and Gillian also believe that if you disagree with them, you are entitled to your opinion. Believe it or not, we don't get too into the politics here, though, obviously it's in there. We hope all of our listeners can enjoy this episode. However, if the discussion of Bush-era politics and hearing Natalie Maines call The President a dumb fuck is going to upset you, no hard feelings if you want to skip this one. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div> In 2001, Robert Fisher murdered his wife and two young kids. And then vanished into thin air. Is he dead, or did he escape to a new life…THIS IS THE QUESTION POSED TO THE PSYCHIC WHO CLOSES OUT THIS….”DOCUMENTARY?” This film, amateur as it is…and we complain about it the whole time…tells the story of the events leading up to the murders and explores ALL the theories of where Robert Fisher could be today. It’s exactly as fascinating and exasperating as it sounds. <br>

But we also can’t wait for you to meet his wife Rhonda, who definitely didn’t win the Mrs. Pennsylvania 1998 pageant, no matter what she tells you. And look, there’s no getting around it, there’s a lot of polka and super old people in this one. But also fraud and a SUPER PISSED accordion player. Also, The Pope (do you capitalize the The in The Pope? Whatever) makes an appearance, and Patrick gets a new drag name. This one is jam packed with laughs at just the right time, so enjoy and then CALL YOUR MOTHER, she’s wondering how you’re doing.<br>

<strong>HERE'S EPISODE 1 OF OUR FIRST-EVER SPINOFF PODCAST! For Patrick, this new podcast has been year long labor of love! Please take a listen!</strong><br>
<br>
It's been a year since the smash hit documentary <em>Abducted in Plain Sight</em> premiered on Netflix and set the internet ablaze with shock, fascination, disbelief, and rage over the story of 12 year-old Jan Broberg who was kidnapped TWICE by her neighbor and family friend Bob Berchtold. This four-part series goes behind the scenes of the documentary and shares new interviews with Jan and her parents, deleted scenes, shocking plot lines cut from the film, never-before-heard audio journals from the kidnapper and his wife recovered by the FBI, and so much more.<br>
<br>
In episode 1, we catch up with Jan who shares how her life has changed in the year since <em>Abducted in Plain Sight</em> premiered and she shares new insight into how she found the courage to tell her story. We also learn how the filmmakers got ahold of the kidnapper's audio journals and we share more of these never-before-heard tapes.<br>
<br>
All four episodes of <em>Obsessed With</em> <em>Abducted in Plain Sight</em> are available to binge right now! To learn more about Skye Borgman and <strong>Top Knot Films</strong>, <a href="http://www.topknotfilms.com/">go here.</a> And if you're looking for more great podcasts, <a href="https://www.obsessednetwork.com/">go here</a> to see all the podcasts made by the <strong>Obsessed Network. </strong>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Mary Kay Letourneau is garbage. What else is there to say? I mean for context, she was a 35 year old teacher who had an affair with her THIRTEEN YEAR OLD student....and had two babies with him. She served (not enough) jail time and then then, after years and years of grooming, convinced him to marry her. AND FOR SOME REASON A&amp;E FELT THAT SHE SHOULD GET TO TELL HER OWN STORY IN HER OWN WORDS! OH! OH! AND SHE HAS A BUNCH OF GARBAGE FRIENDS IN THIS WHO WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S ALL FINE BECAUSE HER VICTIM HAD A MUSTACHE! Whatever, Gillian is so freaking mad the whole time and we don't want her to suffer, but it's hilarious. <br>

<div>What can we say, the 60s in Los Angels were ROUGH! Lots of drugs and crappy eating, not to mention the terrible music. So it just seemed fitting that when the 70s rolled around and a guy named Jim Baker opened a bunch of popular health food restaurants on the Sunset Strip that he should parlay that into a full on cult…WITH A ROCK BAND! Soon hundreds of members of “the family” are crammed into a 3 bedroom / 2 bath house and it all goes exactly how you imagine. BUCKLE UP, YOU GUYS, THIS ONE IS BANANAS. <br>

She'd married the love of her life and had a thriving career and a loving family. But on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981, she disappeared from the yacht she was sharing with her husband Robert Wagner and actor CHRISTOPHER FREAKING WALKEN. Hours later, her body was recovered in a nearby cove. Was it an accidental drowning or was it murder? DID I MENTION THAT CHRISTOPHER WALKEN IS WRAPPED UP IN THIS?<br>

<strong>Who in gay hell exercises in a room heated to 105 degrees?!?!<br>
</strong><br>
Sweating and stretching isn't our jam, but Bikram Chaudry (we have a request into Jesus to have his last name changed--WE WILL NOT HAVE RABIA'S LAST NAME BESMIRCHED!!!) recruited thousands of people to try his so-called "new" brand of yoga. He broke them down physically and mentally at his training workshops, which served as recruitment centers for his sexual predator ways. Girl - smells like a cult to us!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>For 13 summers, Timothy Tredwell journeyed into the Alaskan wilderness to spend four months living among the grizzly bears. Though Treadwell believed that he and the bears had an understanding--he considered them his close friends--he and his girlfriend Amy Huguenard were eventually killed and devoured by one of the bears. For the five summers before his death, he took a video camera on his trips and shot over 100 hours of tape. "Grizzly Man", the brilliant documentary by master filmmaker Werner Herzog, tells the story of Treadwell's fascinating life and terrifying death--and uses much of treadwell's own footage to do so.  <br>

<strong>Wrinkles The Clown is a REAL-LIFE bogeyman. He’s here to haunt your nightmares. </strong><br>
<br>

</div>
<div>It started with a silent black and white surveillance video uploaded to YouTube which depicted a child sleeping peacefully. Suddenly, a hand appeared and deranged man disguised as a clown pulled himself out from beneath her bed. Afterward, similar videos started appearing online—a terrifying looking clown pushing a cart in a parking lot, waving alongside a busy highway, holding balloons in front of a suburban home, and, most shocking of all, terrorizing a family who had gathered for a game night. Who is he? Why is he doing this? What will it take to stop him?<br>

<strong>THIS IS ABOUT THE SPORTS AND STILL SOMEHOW ONE OF OUR FAVORITE DOCS WE’VE EVER COVERED! <br>
</strong><br>

</div>
<div>Welcome to Florida, land of swamp dinosaurs, tanning salons, and, like, humidity.  But did you also know it was ground zero for the high-profile doping scandal that rocked Major League Baseball? They say South Florida is a sunny place for shady people and this is certainly true of steroid peddler Anthony Bosch and his most notorious client, Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees. While Bosch's medical credentials may be lacking, his storytelling skills are first rate as he hilariously details the rise and fall of his "health clinic", including mob connections, financial chicanery, his cocaine habit, and Rodriguez's eccentric behavior. AND A BUNCH OF ADORABLE LITTLE KIDS DO ALL THE REENACTMENTS. IT’S HILARIOUS!<br>

<strong>SEX. LIES. MURDER.<br>
<br>
</strong>What happened to 30 year old Travis Alexander? His friends found him dead on his bathroom floor. He'd been stabbed, shot, and nearly decapitated. When police asked who in Travis's life would want him dead, everyone said the same person: his ex-girlfriend, Jodi Arias. But Jodi hadn't seen Travis in weeks and claimed to be thousands of miles away at the time of the murder. But then the cops found the camera--the camera with the sexy pictures...and the proof.<strong><br>
<br>
</strong>In Part 2, Jodi Arias takes the stand herself, an unusual step in what is already one of the most salacious and talked about trials of all time.<strong><br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Israel Keyes is the most terrifying serial killer you’ve maybe never heard of. <br>
<br>
Here’s what we know about him: He was methodical—he left “kill kits” hidden all across the country. He hid them years before using them, so he was also patient and self controlled. He picked his victims at random to avoid detection and is believed to have murdered at least 11 people across the United States between 2001 and 2012. He was a meticulous serial killer who constantly morphed his modus operandi and the location in which he killed which helped him evade capture for years. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In this bone chilling documentary, we actually see him kidnap his final victim, and we watch him being arrested. We go into the interrogation room with him as the police and FBI try to get the names and locations of his victims. But it’s all a game to Keyes, and he’s only willing to divulge a few of his secrets. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>FAM!! Lady RuPaul (Charles) herself narrates this one!!<br>
<br>
This episode is an affectionate look at everyone's favorite televangelist / Gay Icon / Face Tattoo-er, Tammy Faye Bakker. The eldest of eight children in rural Minnesota, Tammy Faye married Jim Bakker in 1960, and soon they found a following on the gospel circuit. Riding a tide of religious fundamentalism, the Bakkers reached their gaudy heights with the PTL Network and the spinoff Christian theme park Heritage USA. Then the roof caved in. Jim was forced to pay hush money to future Playboy centerfold , Jessica Hahn, and then was submitted to rival Jerry Falwell's hostile take-over of the network. Soon Jim was in jail for fraud, and Tammy was at Betty Ford for addiction to prescription drugs. You guys, We have A LOT to say about this one.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In Steubenville, Ohio, high school football players are untouchable. So when two players are accused of assaulting an underage girl at a pre-season party, it seems almost impossible to get the real story. But when an amateur crime blogger uncovers disturbing evidence on the players’ social media accounts, the town—and quickly the country—are forced to face what these boys have done. With unprecedented access to police documents, exhibits, and evidence, the documentary feature unflinchingly asks: "why didn't anyone stop it?"<br>

It's one of the most shocking disappearances in recent history. A young mother vanishes from her home in Utah. Her husband is the only suspect. His behavior is so bizarre that it has to be him, right? But there's no evidence. Then a second suspect emerges and things only get stranger. What happened to Susan Cox Powell?<br>

<strong>It's the most famous--and most obsessed over--missing person's case of our time.<br>
<br>
</strong>On February 9, 2004, Maura Murray, a promising young nursing student, left her college dorm, emptied her bank account, and drove to a remote New Hampshire town where she didn't know a soul. Just after 7pm, her car crashed into a tree. A witness spoke to her, offering help, which she refused. And then she vanished into thin air. Nobody has seen or heard from her since. Everybody has a theory: The family knows more than they're saying, the police botched the case and are covering it up, Maura fled her life and started over in Canada. This documentary series attempts to solve the mystery. </div>

Everybody has a theory: The family knows more than they're saying, the police botched the case and are covering it up, Maura fled her life and started over in Canada. This documentary series attempts to solve the mystery. </div>

<strong>THIS IS NOT A DRILL! AND THIS IS NOT A RERUN! </strong>For our 100th episode, we're remaking our very first episode AND IT MIGHT BE OUR FUNNIEST, MOST PERFECT EPISODE YET!<br>
<br>
Nicholas Barclay was 13 years old on the day he disappeared—June 13, 1994. Three and a half years later he is found alive, thousands of miles away in a village in southern Spain. He says he was kidnapped and has suffered unimaginable torture. His family is overjoyed to bring him home. But all is not quite as it seems: The boy bears many of the same distinguishing marks he always had, but why does he now have a strange accent? Why does he look so different? And why doesn't the family seem to notice these glaring inconsistencies?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Their crimes resemble high-octane Hollywood action movies: a sports car speeds through a Dubai shopping mall, crashing into the windows of a Graff jewelry store. Masked, gun-wielding men jump out of the car and stuff fistfuls of diamonds into their satchels before screeching off. In London, they took all of three minutes to make off with $30 million in diamonds. Dubbed the Pink Panthers, they're captured - on surveillance tapes that record their astonishing lightning strikes with hypnotic accuracy. We see the tapes and we meet the thieves and hear about their heists in their own words.<br>

<strong>Eliot Spitzer was a rising star in the Democratic Party...But then he got caught having sex with escorts. </strong><br>

Client 9, as you might imagine, introduces us to a host of fascinating characters. From the take-no-shit escorts who love their jobs, to the weirdo downtown artist who....well, we're still not quite sure why he's here...to Spitzer himself--a powerful man with great intentions who simply thought the rules didn't apply to him. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In July 2014, 18-year-old Conrad Roy died by suicide in his car at a parking lot in Fairhaven, Mass. Police soon discovered a series of alarming text messages from his girlfriend, 17-year-old Michelle Carter, that seemed to encourage him to kill himself. This discovery sparked sensational headlines nationwide, leading to a trial that raised difficult questions about technology, social media and mental health, while asking if one person can be held responsible for the suicide of another.  <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Part 2 follows the defense as they present their case and the shocking new information they present may force us to see the case, and the suicide, in a new way.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In the 1990s, boy bands were king. Groups like N'SYNC and the Backstreet Boys were international sensations. But that wasn't the whole story. To tell the whole story, you have to talk about Lou Pearlman--the producer behind the pop explosion of the early 90s. Produced by Lance Bass, "The Boy Band Con" features interviews and never-before-told stories about how Pearlman conned the young artists--and countless others--out of hundreds of millions of dollars before becoming an international fugitive. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On July 10, 2015, a 28 year-old black woman named Sandra Bland was pulled over in a small Texas town for failing to use a turn signal when she changed lanes. She was ultimately arrested and taken to the county jail. Three days later, she was found dead in her cell. The official coroner's report ruled the death a suicide, but many people believe that Sandra Bland was murdered. Sandy, as she was known to her family and friends, became a national figure in the Black Lives Matter Movement and "Say Her Name" attempts to uncover the truth behind her arrest and death. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On October 7, 1998, University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard was brutally beaten, tied to a fence and left to die because he was gay. It was one of the most notorious hate crimes in US history. Years later, Michele Josue, a close friend of Matt's, revisits the shocking case with never-before-seen photos and rare video footage as Matt's all-too-brief life is remembered through the vivid testimonies of his family and closest friends.  Through the film, new revelations about the murder are revealed and the notions of forgiveness, loss, and redemption are explored by those who were there. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE EARTH IS FLAT? <br>
<br>
Turns out, there are LOTS of people believe it is. Is their evidence compelling? Not really, but their conspiracies run deep and cross over into everything from being anti-vaccination to, you know, believing that the school systems invented dinosaurs to keep kids dumb...or something like that. For us, this was 90 minutes of rage, and that always makes for a great episode. Enjoy. ALSO THE EARTH IS FLAT. <br>

  <description>## FAM! QUEEN GILLIAN GOT SUPER SICK THIS WEEK AND SO WE HAD TO RUN A CLASSIC EPISODE! First please note that, unbeknownst to us before we picked this episode to rerun, **THIS IS THE EPISODE WHERE WE INVENTED BOTH OUR THEME SONG AND…WAIT FOR IT…THE GARBAGE BELL!!** Any-who, Gillian is much better now and we'll be back next week with that bonkers #FlatEarthDoc &quot;Behind the Curve. ENJOY!

Meet Joyce McKinney, a former Miss Wyoming with an IQ of 168\. 30 years ago, she fell in love with a young Mormon named Kirk. When Kirk disappeared and then turned up a few months later in the UK, Joyce was convinced he’d been kidnapped and was being held against his well. Determined to get him back, Joyce set off on a journey that would lead her across the globe, into jail, and onto the front pages of the most popular tabloids of the time. Her crusade for love took her through a surreal world of kidnapping, manacled Mormons, risqué photography, magic underwear, and celestial sex. Oh AND to the 1977 after party for the film “Saturday Night Fever.”

<p><strong>It's the most famous--and most obsessed over--missing person's case of our time:</strong></p>


<p>On February 9, 2004, Maura Murray, a promising young nursing student, left her college dorm, emptied her bank account, and drove to a remote New Hampshire town where she didn't know a soul. Just after 7pm, her car crashed into a tree. A witness spoke to her, offering help, which she refused. And then she vanished into thin air. Nobody has seen or heard from her since. Everybody has a theory: The family knows more than they're saying, the police botched the case and are covering it up, Maura fled her life and started over in Canada. This documentary series attempts to solve the mystery. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Southwest of Salem: The Story of the San Antonio Four excavates the nightmarish persecution of Elizabeth Ramirez, Cassandra Rivera, Kristie Mayhugh, and Anna Vasquez - four Latina lesbians wrongfully convicted of gang-raping two little girls in San Antonio, Texas. The film begins its journey inside a Texas prison, after these women have spent nearly a decade behind bars. They were 19 and 20 years old at the time the allegations surfaced. Using the women's home video footage from 21 years ago combined with recent verité footage and interviews, the film explores their personal narratives and their search for exculpatory evidence to help their losing criminal trials.</p>

  <description>Who killed Marsha P. Johnson?

When the beloved, self-described &quot;street queen&quot; of NY's gay ghetto was found floating in the Hudson River in 1992, the NYPD chalked it up as a suicide and refused to investigate. But Marsha was a lover of life and many who knew her refused to believe she would have taken her own life. 

Now, a quarter century later, at a time of unprecedented visibility and escalating violence in the transgender community, Marsha's old friend and fellow activist Victoria Cruz has taken it upon herself to reexamine what happened to Marsha. Dipping deep into jaw-dropping archival footage of another era of New York City life, The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson follows as this champion pursues leads, mobilizes officials, and works to tell the story of Marsha's life and get to the bottom of Marsha's death.

  <itunes:summary>Who killed Marsha P. Johnson?

When the beloved, self-described &quot;street queen&quot; of NY's gay ghetto was found floating in the Hudson River in 1992, the NYPD chalked it up as a suicide and refused to investigate. But Marsha was a lover of life and many who knew her refused to believe she would have taken her own life. 

Now, a quarter century later, at a time of unprecedented visibility and escalating violence in the transgender community, Marsha's old friend and fellow activist Victoria Cruz has taken it upon herself to reexamine what happened to Marsha. Dipping deep into jaw-dropping archival footage of another era of New York City life, The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson follows as this champion pursues leads, mobilizes officials, and works to tell the story of Marsha's life and get to the bottom of Marsha's death.

<p>Studio 54 was the epicenter of 70s hedonism--a place that not only redefined the nightclub, but also came to symbolize an entire era. Its co-owners, Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell, two friends from Brooklyn, seemed to come out of nowhere to suddenly preside over a new kind of New York society. Now, 39 years after the velvet rope was first slung across the club's hallowed threshold, a feature documentary tells the real story behind the greatest club of all time and the crimes that brought it down.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>This podcast episode covers episodes 3 &amp;  4 of the Netflix series</strong>. <a href="https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/episodes/75-conversations-with-a-killer-the-ted-bundy-tapes">Listen to Part 1 (covering episodes 1 &amp; 2 of the Netflix series) HERE.</a></p>


<p>In this episode, Ted Bundy breaks out of prison TWICE. He terrorizes south Florida where he takes at least 6 more victims. When he's finally caught, he decides to represent himself in court--in America's first-ever televised murder trial--and the shenanigans that ensue are almost too bizarre to be believed.</p>


<p>On the 30th anniversary of his Florida execution, CONVERSATIONS WITH A KILLER: THE TED BUNDY TAPES brings the infamously twisted mind of serial killer Ted Bundy into the light for the very first time in a fresh yet terrifying way through exclusive, never-before-heard interviews from the "Jack the Ripper of the United States," himself. This unique and gripping doc series, focuses on the man whose personality, good looks and social graces defied the serial-killer stereotype, allowing him to hide in plain sight as he committed the brutal sex-crime slayings of more than 30 women before being caught in 1978.   </p>

  <description>It's Daisy's school vacation week, so Patrick is on full time dad duty! We'll be back with a brand new episode next week covering episodes 1 &amp; 2 of Netflix's &quot;The Ted Bundy Tapes.&quot; The following week, we'll cover episodes 3 &amp; 4!

**Mommy Dead And Dearest:**  
Late on the evening of June 14, 2015, deputy sheriffs in Greene County, Missouri, found the body of Dee Dee Blancharde laying facedown in a pool of blood from the stab wounds that had killed her several days earlier. There was no sign of her teenage daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blancharde, suffered from leukemia, asthma, muscular dystrophy, and several other chronic conditions, and had the mental capacity of a 7-year-old. In the days and weeks that followed, the police came to understand the crime and the treacherous web of lies, child abuse, mental illness, and forbidden love that set the stage for this horrendous and brutal murder.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>For 13 summers, Timothy Tredwell journeyed into the Alaskan wilderness to spend four months living among the grizzly bears. Though Treadwell believed that he and the bears had an understanding--he considered them his close friends--he and his girlfriend Amy Huguenard were eventually killed and devoured by one of the bears. For the five summers before his death, he took a video camera on his trips and shot over 100 hours of tape. "Grizzly Man", the brilliant documentary by master filmmaker Werner Herzog, tells the story of Treadwell's fascinating life and terrifying death--and uses much of treadwell's own footage to do so.  </p>

Marketing for the 2017 music event went viral with the help of rapper Ja Rule, instagram stars, and models, but wound up being an epic failure as it stranded thousands of people in the Bahamas. <strong>Featuring an exclusive interview with Billy McFarland</strong>, the convicted con-man behind the festival, FYRE FRAUD is a true-crime comedy documentary bolstered by a cast of whistleblowers, victims, and insiders. And we have LOTS of feelings about it. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Seinfeld mocked it. Letterman ranked it in his top ten list. And more than fifteen years later, its infamy continues. Everyone knows the McDonald's coffee case. It has been routinely cited as an example of how citizens have taken advantage of America's legal system, but is that a fair rendition of the facts? Hot Coffee reveals what really happened to Stella Liebeck, the Albuquerque woman who spilled coffee on herself and sued McDonald's, while exploring how and why the case garnered so much media attention, who funded the effort, and to what end.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 1977, Jim Jones, leader of The Peoples Temple, moved nearly 1,000 of his followers to a plot of land in Guyana, South America. Less than a year later, on November 18, 1978, 908 of the followers died after drinking Kool-Aid laced with poison. Was it murder or suicide? And what had made all of these people follow Jones to their deaths?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>BEWARE THE SLENDERMAN tells the story of the internet's elusive Boogeyman and two 12-year-old girls who would kill for him. Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier lured their best friend into the woods, stabbed her 19 times, then set out on an odyssey to meet the tall and faceless man known online as Slenderman. Shot over 18 months with heartbreaking access to the families of the would-be murderers, the film plunges deep down the rabbit hole of their crime, a Boogeyman. and our society's most impressionable consumers of media. The entrance to the internet can quickly lead us to its dark basement, within just a matter of clicks. How much do we hold children responsible for what they find there?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On November 22, 1963, John F. Kennedy, President of the United States, was assassinated in broad daylight in front of hundreds of people--at least 55 of whom were filming or taking pictures. And yet we still don't know what happened. Lee Harvey Oswald was the prime suspect. But then he too was killed in the middle of the day in front of almost 100 people. </p>


<p>Was it a lone gunman? The CIA? Fidel Castro? And will we every know the truth? We have some thoughts.....</p>


<p>This week's Palate Cleanser is from the 2004 Broadway Cast Recording of "Assassins" and features Neil Patrick Harris and Dennis O'Hare.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On October 17, 1974, 12 year old Jan Broberg was kidnapped by her next door neighbor and parents’ best friend—a man they all loving called “B.” B, unbeknownst to them, was a pedophile who had become obsessed with Jan and would stop at nothing to have her. This story is so full of of jaw-dropping twists, you really do have to hear it to believe it.  OOH! It's important to note that Jan today is alive and well (and looking like a million bucks). She is one of the major story tellers here, and goddamn is she a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>EVERYONE BE COOL, KATHLEEN ZELNER IS IN THE HOUSE!!!</p>


<p>Before she became a household name with her work on the Steven Avery case in season 2 of "Making A Murderer," Kathleen Zelner used her brilliant, no-nonsense bad-assery to exonerate Ryan Ferguson. Ferguson had been convicted in 2005 at the age of 19 of a murder he didn't commit. There was no physical evidence, the "eye witnesses" were unreliable to say the least, and Ferguson was failed by an incompetent lawyer. AND. KATHLEEN. ZELNER. IS. NOT. HERE. FOR. IT. </p>


<p>Come for Zelner, but stay for Ryan's dad who's a super adorable Inspector Gadget type who learns how to use google and get on the online in an obsessive attempt to save his son.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In 2015, NYC Police Officer Gilberto Valle was convicted of conspiring to kidnap and eat young women. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT: KIDNAP AND EAT. Valle argued it was all a fantasy; the prosecution's narrative convinced jurors otherwise. Valle was facing a possible life sentence when filmmaker Erin Lee Carr began visiting him in prison to make this film.</p>


<p>There’s no way around it, you guys, this one is full of garbage—the cannibal cop himself (CANNIBAL COP, YOU GUYS), his enabling parents, and the filmmaker who never really tries to understand WHY and/or HOW Valle came to be the way he is. But don’t worry, there’s lots of good New York Post headlines….and one fabulous glamor shot.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>THIS EPISODE IS RIPPED FROM THE HEADLINES, YOU GUYS!</p>


<p>In 2013, James (Whitey) Bulger, the South Boston mobster, was captured after 16 years on the lam. He was finally brought to justice for a murderous reign of terror that inspired books, films and a saga of Irish-American brotherhood and brutality. Last month (October of 2018) he was found beaten to death in a West Virginia prison. He was 89.</p>


<p>This documentary tells the story of Whitey’s rise to power in South Boston, his dealings with the FBI during that time, it tackles questions of his relationship with the FBI. The film ultimately deals with his capture, trial, and--for lack of a better term--legacy. Whatever, any way you slice it, he was garbage.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we're revisiting one of our most popular episodes! </p>


<p>A decade after making the documentary film “Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer” about serial killer Aileen Wuornos, director Nick Broomfield was subpoenaed as a witness for Aileen’s final appeal in overturning her death sentence. When he became a participant in Aileen’s legal fight, Broomfield decided made this new documentary which looks at Aileen's violent, tortured childhood in Troy, Michigan and her subsequent years on the road as a hitch-hiking prostitute which culminated in her committing seven murders in the span of one year. For the documentary, Aileen granted Broomfield exclusive interviews in order to share her side of the story—conspiracy theories and all—as she prepared to be executed. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In 1975, the Lutz family moved into the old house at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amittyville, New York. The house was beautiful, nestled in the heart of an affluent neighborhood, it had a pool and a dock, and best of all, the family had gotten it at a staggeringly low price. <strong>The only catch—a family of five had been brutally murdered there the year before.</strong></p>


<p>According to the Lutz family, for the 28 days they lived in the home, they were tormented by ghosts and possessed by demons. They were thrown up the stairs, terrorized by mysterious creatures, and were levitated 13 feet into the air.</p>


<p>In “My Amittyville Horror,” Daniel Lutz, who was 9 at the time, tells his version of the terrifying story for the first time. And you guys, this bro is intense.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Welp, throw “Killer Legends” on the stacks of Halloween-ey docs we’ve hated!</p>


<p>Having skimmed the Wikipedia pages and doing a combined 14 minutes of research, filmmakers Josh and Rachel head off to discover ‘the truth behind four of our most terrifying urban legends’….or whatever. Josh is overeager, Rachel is over Josh, and the city of Chicago is over the both of these fools asking if anyone is afraid of clowns. But hey, Donahue makes a hilariously morbid cameo, so it was all worth it. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>There’s no way around it, you guys: There is definitely a PORTAL TO HELL under the basement stairs in a crappy rental house in Gary, Indiana. It’s definitely definitely real, and I know this because that bro The Travel Channel--the one with the ghost hunter show or whatever-- said so. And so did the 12-foot goat-man who haunts his dreams. And he has NOTHING TO GAIN BY MAKING THIS WHOLE THING UP!</p>


<p>Once again, we haaaaaaaaaaated this movie, so you know the episode is going to be hilarious. Zak Bagans buys the ‘haunted’ house, a little boy gets possessed and walks up a wall, and a cameraman turns evil. That’s about it. Oh and Patrick tries out the word “Bro” (it doesn’t go great) and Gillian laughs so hard she nearly chokes.</p>

  <description>YOU GUYS!!! A few weeks ago we got the chance to sit down with &quot;Tower&quot; director Keith Maitland for full interview about the film. [That interview is now live on the Patreon feed.](https://www.patreon.com/posts/21993766)We chatted about how he made the film, how he tracked down the victims and won their trust, how he learned about the tower shooting as kid and why is stuck with him for decades before he finally made the film, and how it was to tell the story of the shooting--the first-ever mass school shooting--as the story had been something of a state secret for nearly 50 years. We play a 3-minute clip of the interview at the end of the episode. 

We wanted to rebroadcast this episode today so you could listen before listening to the interview with Keith! [So jump on over to the patreon feed and check it out!](https://www.patreon.com/posts/21993766)

You guys, THIS EPISODE IS ALSO WHERE THE HERO BELL MAKES IT'S BEAUTIFUL DEBUT!

Here's the original description of the episode:  
On August 1, 1966, a sniper rode the elevator to the top floor of the iconic University of Texas Tower and opened fire, holding the campus hostage for 96 minutes in what was a previously unimaginable event. Based entirely on first person testimonies from witnesses, heroes, and survivors, TOWER combines archival footage with rotoscopic animation to tell the story of that day. The film highlights the fear, confusion, and visceral realities that changed the lives of those present, and the rest of us, forever - a day when the worst in one man brought out the best in so many others.</description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>You guys, we've covered A LOT of garbage on this podcast, but somehow THIS insanity is the first one to warrant an actual trigger warning. So here's the head up, THESE BITCHES think abortion, sexual assault, rape, incest, school shootings, racism, homophobia, hate speech and AIDS are HILARIOUS! So they talk about it a lot. IN THE LEAST. SENSITIVE. WAY. POSSIBLE. </p>


<p>So now, welcome behind the scenes of Hell House--a 'haunted house' where a bunch of SUPER JUDGY kids from a Dalas Pentecostal church play out depictions of Hell as they imagine it. You guys, this is "Glee" on, like, steroids. If steroids made you terrible, boring, sheltered, racist, and annoying.</p>

So whatever, the guy who directed The Exorcist gets invited to witness and record an exorcism. He fakes a lot of the audio (WE’RE GUESSING, LAWYERS, DON’T COME FOR US) and then FORGETS HIS CAMERA when he goes to interview THE POSESSED WOMAN and has an ACTUAL SUPERNATURAL ENCOUNTER in a 12th century church. We call bullshit.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Look, the specifics of this story are confusing AF. BUT at the heart of it, we’re dealing with a murder, a wrongful conviction, a false confession and A. WOMAN. NAMED. SHAWN. (She’s garbage, but we’re obsessed with the gender swapping name situation.).</p>


<p>With his execution just 48 hours away, Anthony Porter's life was saved by a Northwestern University journalism class. Their re-investigation of the crime for which he was convicted-a double homicide in a Chicago park-led to the discovery of the real killer, Alstory Simon, whose confession exonerated Porter. If it all sounds too good to be true, it's because, as compellingly argued here, Porter actually is guilty, Simon is an innocent man and both are just pawns in a much larger plan.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>We hate to insult garbage by calling Anthony Weiner garbage...but we can't think of another word. DING!</p>


<p>Anthony Weiner did a lot for the people of New York as a Congressman from 1999 - 2011. HOWEVER it all went off the rails when he started SEXTING women WHO WEREN'T HIS WIFE (A quick timeout: his wife is Huma Abedin: brilliant woman, close adviser to Hilliary Clinton, and human-who-will-not-stand-for-your-shit). His resignation from Congress was quickly followed by a run for Mayor of New York City and, because (some) men will be (some) men, MORE DICK PICS TO WOMEN WHO AREN'T HIS WIFE CAME OUT! Huma isn't having it, neither is NYC, AND NEITHER is his chief advisor, Kueen Amit Bagga in her mustard yellow pants. </p>

<br>

</div>
<div>In 1989, five black and Latino teenagers were arrested and charged for brutally attacking and raping a white female jogger in Central Park. News media swarmed the case, calling it "the crime of the century." But the truth about what really happened didn't become clear until after the five had spent years in prison for a crime they didn't commit. With THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE, this story of injustice finally gets the telling it deserves.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The working title for this one was: “Three Gays Rob a Bank”. And we have an idea for the sitcom version.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In August 1972, John Wojtowicz attempted to rob a Brooklyn bank to finance his lover's sex-reassignment surgery. The act resulted in a fourteen-hour hostage situation that was broadcast on TV. Three years later Al Pacino portrayed his crime in DOG DAY AFTERNOON.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Directors Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren began filming THE DOG in 2002 and continued for ten years. Drawing upon extraordinary archival footage, the film shuffles between the 1970s and the 2000s. We gain a historic perspective on New York's gay liberation movement, in which Wojtowicz played an active role. In later footage, he remains a subversive force, backed by the unconditional love of his mother Terry, whose wit and charm infuse the film. How and why the bank robbery took place is recounted in gripping detail by Wojtowicz and various eyewitnesses.<br>

<br>

</div>
<div>Heads Up! This episode of TCO covers parts 3 &amp; 4 of the Netflix series. To hear our coverage of the first two episodes of the Netflix series,<a href="https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/single-post/2018/07/10/49-Evil-Genius-Part-1-Covering-Episodes-1-2-of-the-Netflix-Series">go here!<br>
</a><br>

</div>
<div>In this episode, we watch Marjorie just berate the soul out of her lawyer via Skpye, learn that the filmmaker’s unhealthy (and possibly unethical?) relationship with Marjorie is off the rails, we learn who the masterminds behind the pizza-delivery-bank-heist were (maybe), we meet more hoarders, AND we posit that meathead Jerry from the FBI and Jason Zwick from ATF are in a relationship? Maybe? Whatever, it’s all awful but we make you laugh.<br>

<br>

</div>
<div>The weirdest bank robbery in history, a collar-bomb, a cane-gun, three dead men, and two homes so hoard-ey they required hazmat suits. Ladies and gentlemen, we give you “Evil Genius.”<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In 2003 in Erie, Pennsylvania, a robbery gone wrong and a terrifying public murder capture the nation's attention, and a bizarre collection of Midwestern hoarders, outcasts, and lawbreakers play cat-and-mouse with the FBI. Eventually, a middle-aged mastermind named Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong -- once a town beauty, now a woman grappling with mental illness -- is arrested. But 15 years later, this documentary proves there’s more to the conspiracy and murders than was ever thought.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>There are no two ways about it, Harvey Milk looked great in a T-Shirt. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Happy Pride, everyone! Let's talk about some gay stuff! (don't worry, this one is super true-crimey too.). In 1978, Harvey Milk became one of the first openly gay elected officials in the US when he won a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. 11 months later Milk and Mayor George Moscone were gunned down in their offices by Dan White, another of the city's Supervisors. This doc tells the story of Milk's rise to prominence and circumstances that led to the double assassination. This one is full of the gayest gays (Hey Girls!), The smartest lesbians (Hey Girls!), a FABULOUS pair of seashell earrings, and a union guy who, just trust us on this, gets a pass on calling Harvey Milk a "Fruit." Oh AND this case gives us "The Twinkie Defense," which is exactly as bullshit as it sounds. <br>

Now let's talk about a gay club kid who was super mean to people, became addicted to drugs, and murdered AND DISMEMBERED a fellow club-goer, shall we? Did I mention that he stuffed the body in a box LIVED WITH IT IN HIS APARTMENT FOR A WEEK, and then threw it into the Hudson River? No? Ugh, we'll get to it. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Glory Daze follows the rise and fall of club kid Michael Alig. From his humble beginnings as busboy in 1984 to his eventual reign as King of New York City nightlife, to his (sweet deal of a) prison sentence for murder. And as if that wasn't enough, get ready for some bonkers cameos from Patricia Field, Michael Musto, and Amanda Lepore (In A Limo! For No Apparent Reason!)<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>You Guys, I Swear to God this is what this movie is about….<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In 2004, John Wood had his left leg amputated after a single-engine plane crash that left him badly injured. He somehow convinced the doctors to let him keep the leg (!!!!!), he mummified it—yes MUMMIFIED IT—and eventually put it in a storage locker. In 2007 Shannon Whisnant unwittingly bought the leg when he purchased the contents of John’s storage locker after months of unpaid rent. Shannon—who should have been horrified—saw the leg as a money-making opportunity. He branded himself “The Leg Man” and tried to turn the leg into a tourist attraction. After learning what had become of his leg (HIS LEG, YOU GUYS), John decided to try to get it back. And the most ridiculous and disgusting custody battle the world has ever known was born.<br>

Nobody had ever met him—his only correspondence with press and publishers was over the phone or fax machine—and still he became the literary sensation of the time. He was dubbed a ‘wunderkind,’ an ‘it boy’ and ‘the literary voice of his generation.’ He became a best-selling author and sold the film rights to his books. The only thing was, he didn’t actually exist. On January 9, 2006 The New York Times sent shockwaves through the literary world when it unmasked JT LeRoy, whose tough prose about a sordid childhood had captivated icons and luminaries internationally. It turned out that he was the creative expression of 40-year-old San Francisco former phone-sex operator turned housewife, Laura Albert. Author: The JT LeRoy Story takes us down the infinitely fascinating rabbit hole of how Laura Albert--like a Cyrano de Bergerac on steroids--breathed not only words, but life, into her avatar for a decade. Albert's epic and entertaining account plunges us into a glittery world of rock shows, fashion events, and the Cannes red carpet where LeRoy becomes a mysterious sensation.<br>
<br>

<div>Also, our best friend Courtney Love (call us, girl!) Is back in a big, cocaine-infused way. Oh, how we’ve missed her.<br>

The District Attorney who was trying the case was determined to put them away at all cost and was willing to break the law to do it. But the men were innocent. The victim had lied. The question was, would the men be able to prove. It.</p>

She set out to document the 'good work' the school was doing, but quickly realized that the kids she was documenting were in serious danger at the hands of their 'house fathers.' Kate then embarks on a year long journey of helping one of the students, David, escape.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>There really aren't words to describe how much both Gillian and Patrick hated this film. H.A.T.E.D. Also, they both agree, this MIGHT be their best episode. These ladies are hilarious when they're furious. </p>


<p>Whatever, Garbage Bert meets Linda. He's disgusting, she's gorgeous. He's also insane, she's basically normal. He's rich, she likes him for his money and they date. But then she finds out that he's married. She finds someone else and he hires two guys to THROW ACID IN HER FACE. She's scarred and blinded. He goes to jail. But after he gets out her GARBAGE FRIENDS decide TO SET THEM UP ON A DATE (Like, I can't) and after five months THEY GET ENGAGED. And then THEY GET MARRIED. </p>


<p>Fine, whatever, they deserve each other. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>The hero bell and the garbage bell both got a workout with this one...</p>


<p>"How To Survive A Plague" is a riveting, powerful telling of the story of the grassroots movement of activists, many of them in a life-or-death struggle, who seized upon scientific research to help develop the drugs that turned HIV from a mostly fatal infection to a manageable disease. Ignored by public officials, religious leaders, and the nation at large, and confronted with shame and hatred, this small group of men and women chose to fight for their right to live by educating themselves and demanding to become full partners in the race for effective treatments. Around the globe, 16 million people are alive today thanks to their efforts.</p>

<p>When billionaire John Du Pont decides to build the United States' premiere wrestling training facility on his property in Pennsylvania, he attracts the sport's top athletes and coaches to come live and train there. As the athletes and their families begin to create an idyllic 'sports utopia,' Du Pont devolves into a state of constant paranoia. As his mental state deteriorates and goes unchecked, Du Pont becomes suspicious and distrustful of the athletes who've come to depend on him--a combination that results in a brutal and senseless murder.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>A decade after making the documentary film “Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer” about serial killer Aileen Wuornos, director Nick Broomfield was subpoenaed as a witness for Aileen’s final appeal in overturning her death sentence. When he became a participant in Aileen’s legal fight, Broomfield decided made this new documentary which looks at Aileen's violent, tortured childhood in Troy, Michigan and her subsequent years on the road as a hitch-hiking prostitute which culminated in her committing seven murders in the span of one year. For the documentary, Aileen granted Broomfield exclusive interviews in order to share her side of the story—conspiracy theories and all—as she prepared to be executed. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Kidnapping! Murder! Swindling Rich People! Fancy Art Shenanigans! This one has it all.</p>


<p>Christian Gerhartsreiter, a man eventually known as "Clark Rockefelle," lived a life of deception; the FBI called it "the longest-running con in FBI history." After ingratiating himself into New York society and marrying a top banker with a Harvard MBA, "Clark" settled into his new luxurious life. The two had a daughter before they divorced after 13 years. When his wife won custody, a distraught Clark abducted his beloved daughter. Ironically, it was the search for the missing child that not only exposed a web of lies and multiple identities, but a double murder committed decades earlier . </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On August 1, 1966, a sniper rode the elevator to the top floor of the iconic University of Texas Tower and opened fire, holding the campus hostage for 96 minutes in what was a previously unimaginable event. Based entirely on first person testimonies from witnesses, heroes, and survivors, TOWER combines archival footage with rotoscopic animation to tell the story of that day. The film highlights the fear, confusion, and visceral realities that changed the lives of those present, and the rest of us, forever - a day when the worst in one man brought out the best in so many others.</p>


<p>For this one, you guys, the garbage bell is magically transformed into the hero bell. And there's a whole lot of dinging.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>A four-year-old girl, whose paintings are compared to Kandinsky, Pollock, and even Picasso, has sold $300,000 dollars worth of paintings. Is she a genius of abstract expressionism, a tiny charlatan, or an exploited child whose parents have sold her out for the glare of the media and the lure of the almighty dollar? This one's a dozy, but hey, nobody gets murdered!</p>

Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier lured their best friend into the woods, stabbed her 19 times, then set out on an odyssey to meet the tall and faceless man known online as Slenderman. Shot over 18 months with heartbreaking access to the families of the would-be murderers, the film plunges deep down the rabbit hole of their crime, a Boogeyman. and our society's most impressionable consumers of media. The entrance to the internet can quickly lead us to its dark basement, within just a matter of clicks. How much do we hold children responsible for what they find there?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Strangeness is afoot. Most people don't notice the hundreds of cryptic tiled messages about resurrecting the dead that have been appearing in city streets over the past three decades. But Justin Duerr does. For years, finding an answer to this long-standing urban mystery has been his obsession. He has been collecting clues that the tiler has embedded in the streets of major cities across the U.S. and South America. But as Justin starts piecing together key events of the past he finds a story that is more surreal than he imagined, and one that hits disturbingly close to home.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>The world couldn't keep its eyes off two athletes at the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer - Nancy Kerrigan, the elegant brunette and Tonya Harding, the feisty blonde engulfed in scandal. Just weeks before the Olympics on January 6, 1994 at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Kerrigan was stunningly clubbed on the right knee by an unknown assailant and left wailing, "Why, why, why?" As the bizarre "why" mystery unraveled, it was revealed that Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, had plotted the attack with his misfit friends to literally eliminate Kerrigan from the competition. Now two decades later, The Price of Gold takes a fresh look at the worldwide spectacle that elevated the popularity of professional figure skating and has Harding still facing questions over what she knew when she knew it.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Meet Joyce McKinney, a former Miss Wyoming with an IQ of 168. 30 years ago, she fell in love with a young Mormon named Kirk. When Kirk disappeared and then turned up a few months later in the UK, Joyce was convinced he’d been kidnapped and was being held against his well. Determined to get him back, Joyce set off on a journey that would lead her across the globe, into jail, and onto the front pages of the most popular tabloids of the time. Her crusade for love took her through a surreal world of kidnapping, manacled Mormons, risqué photography, magic underwear, and celestial sex. Oh AND to the 1977 after party for the film “Saturday Night Fever.”</p>


<p>“Tabloid,” directed by the genius Errol Morris, is a portrayal of a phenomenally driven woman whose romantic obsessions and delusions catapult her over the edge into scandal, fame, and an unimaginable life. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>It's not what you think. </p>


<p>After stumbling upon a bizarre "competitive endurance tickling" video online, wherein young men are paid to be tied up and tickled, reporter David Farrier reaches out to request a story from the company. But the reply he receives is shocking-the sender mocks Farrier's sexual orientation and threatens extreme legal action should he dig any deeper. So, like any good journalist confronted by a bully, he does just the opposite: he travels to the hidden tickling facilities in Los Angeles and uncovers a vast empire, known for harassing and harming the lives of those who protest their involvement in these films. The more he investigates, the stranger it gets, discovering secret identities and criminal activity. Discovering the truth becomes Farrier's obsession, despite increasingly sinister threats and warnings. With humor and determination, Farrier and co-director Dylan Reeve summon up every resource available to get to the bottom of this tickling worm hole.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Who killed Marsha P. Johnson? </p>


<p>When the beloved, self-described "street queen" of NY's gay ghetto was found floating in the Hudson River in 1992, the NYPD chalked it up as a suicide and refused to investigate. But Marsha was a lover of life and many who knew her refused to believe she would have taken her own life. </p>


<p>Now, a quarter century later, at a time of unprecedented visibility and escalating violence in the transgender community, Marsha's old friend and fellow activist Victoria Cruz has taken it upon herself to reexamine what happened to Marsha. Dipping deep into jaw-dropping archival footage of another era of New York City life, The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson follows as this champion pursues leads, mobilizes officials, and works to tell the story of Marsha's life and get to the bottom of Marsha's death.</p>

<p>In 2001, Dr. Andrew Bagby was shot dead by jealous ex-girlfriend Dr. Shirley Turner. Shortly thereafter, Bagby's friends and family were hocked to learn that Turner was pregnant with Bagby's son. Hoping to create a film that would serve as both a memorial to Bagby and an introduction to the father the boy would never know, Bagby's bwst friend Kuenne quickly began production on a film celebrating the life of his late friend. </p>


<p>Meanwhile, upon learning that Turner had fled to Newfoundland, Bagby's devastated parents uprooted their entire lives and relocated to the easternmost providence of Canada in order to fight for the custody of their newborn grandson, Zachary. However, the Canadian government freed Turner on bail and she maintained custody of Zachary as she awaited extradition to the United States. The situation took a devastating turn during that crucial time and tragedy ensued.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In May 2003, 16-year-old Martha Puebla was shot in the head on the doorstep of her Los Angeles home, days after testifying in a gangland murder trial. Police arrested 24-year-old Juan Catalan at gunpoint, alleging that he’d carried out the hit for his gangster brother Mario.
Not only did Catalan not commit the crime, but he had an alibi. At the time of Puebla’s cold-blooded killing, he was at Dodger Stadium with his six-year-old daughter. Frustratingly, though, Catalan’s lawyer couldn’t find clear enough TV footage to prove it. 
Catalan faced death row if found guilty at trial. Even worse, the prosecuting attorney was unbeaten in murder cases and nicknamed “Sniper” because she liked to pick off defendants with the death penalty. 
Then came the head-spinning twist. It just so happened that an episode of the HBO show “Curb Your Enthusiasm” was also being shot at the ballpark that night. Finding Juan in the episode was the last hope this innocent man’s life. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Thomas Montgomery, a 47-year-old, married factory worker was playing a game online when a beautiful 18-year-old teenager named Jessi, screen name talhotblond, texted him ‘hello.’ He was instantly hooked.

For revenge, she started up an online affair with one of Montgomery's co-workers, 22 year-old Brian Barrett. When Jessi pits the men against each other, the levels of desire and deceit escalate and mind games result in real-life murder. But even then, the story isn’t over and the truth about talhotblond’s is revealed. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In 1999, writer John Krakauer stopped at a gas station in Colorado City, AZ, a place he had never been. What he found was a town frozen in time, with women in long prairie dresses and hairstyles that rang of the 1800s. The curious sight led him on a journalistic investigation into a modern day 'prophet' named Warren Jeffs and the cult-like FLDS (Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints).
 When the investigation of Warren Jeffs sends him on the run, he winds up in the number two spot on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. The number one spot being occupied by Osama Bin Laden. The manhunt for Jeffs uncovers his 'religion's most vile atrocities including the forced marriages of underage girls, rape, and polygamy. 
 Fun, right? But fear not, we play a LOT of "The Book of Mormon" in this one. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, July 26, 2009, Diane Schuler left the campgrounds in upstate New York where she was vacationing with her family and set off towards home on Long Island. With her were five young children: her son, her daughter, and three nieces. Four hours later, she drove the wrong way on the Taconic State Parkway for nearly two miles – eventually crashing into an oncoming SUV, killing herself and seven others.
 Nine days after her deadly crash, Diane’s toxicology report revealed she had a blood-alcohol content of .19% – the equivalent of ten drinks and more than twice the legal limit – as well as a high blood level of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. In sharp contrast to the toxicology report, Schuler had no known history of substance abuse or psychological problems and was generally known as a loving and stable wife and mother.
 In the aftermath, Diane Schuler was portrayed as a reckless drunk and a mother who cracked. But was she the monster the public made her out to be? Or the perfect wife and mother described by so many who knew her?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Growing up on Staten Island, filmmakers Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio had often heard the legend of ‘Cropsey.’ For the kids in their neighborhood, Cropsey was the escaped mental patient who lived in the old abandoned Willowbrook Mental Institution, who would come out late at night and snatch children off the streets.
 Later as teenagers, the filmmakers assumed Cropsey was just an urban legend. That all changed in the summer of 1987 when a 12-year-old girl disappeared from their community. The police quickly connected this disappearance to several other children who'd gone missing in the area. The hunt for the abductor would lead authorities to the real-life boogeyman living in their midst. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>When the curtain rose on the murder trial of Pamela Smart 23 years ago, the stage was set for the birth of reality TV. Accused of plotting the 1990 murder of her husband Gregory, 22-year-old Smart was subsequently convicted in the first fully televised, gavel-to-gavel court case, which has inspired TV shows, books, plays and feature films.
 This documentary takes another look at everything we think we know about the case. Is it possible that Pamela had nothing do to with the murder? That her teen aged lover killed her husband in a jealous rage without Pamela's knowledge? The evidence is shockingly compelling. 
 Join us on this bonkers romp through one of the most thought provoking true crime documentaries we've ever seen.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the early morning hours of March 13, 1964, 28-year-old Kitty Genovese was murdered in front of her building in Kew Gardens, Queens. According to the New York Times story that followed, 38 people watched the murder happen and did nothing. 50 years later, her brother is on a mission to uncover the truth. Is it possible that nobody tried to help her? Did she really die scared and alone? Why was she attacked?

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Johnny Gosch was 12-years-old when he disappeared while on his paper route on September 5, 1982. There were FIVE witnesses, but the local police (and eventually FBI) declared there was no crime. Over the years, Johnny's parents never gave up hope that they would find him. 
 This documentary tells the tale of the world's most ferocious mother, Noreen Gosch (who gives GREAT documentary), a horrendously managed investigation, a weirdo who might know where Johnny is, a possible sex ring (and we cannot even with that), and maybe (MAYBE!) a return by Johnny himself. This one's a doozy, you guys!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Jesus Camp follows a group of children as they attend an evangelical Christian summer camp, where they are taught that they have "prophetic gifts" and can "take back America for Christ.  The film claims that it "documents and does not judge." But Gillian and Patrick sure do!
 Get ready for some good old fashioned speaking in tongues, Jesus hip-hop, climate change denial, and a complete dismissal of science, some SUPER intense kiddos, and even a dance number or two! But leave your "Harry Potter" books at home, because...well...you'll see. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Amanda Knox was an 21 year old exchange student in rural Italy when she and her boyfriend were arrested for and convicted of killing her roommate, Meredith Kercher. It took nearly five years, almost all of which she spent behind bars, to clear her name. 
 In this bonkers documentary from Netflix, Amanda herself takes us through the entire journey. We also hear from a human-garbage 'journalist,' A lead prosecutor who's tight with God, and a defense attorney who's zingers are the stuff of legend.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Meet the Friedmans: Father Arnold, Mother Elaine, and kids David, Seth, and Jesse. They're all living the 'perfect' middle class life on Long Island in the 1980 until Arnold and Jesse are arrested and charged with truly horrific crimes. And guess what? Thanks to the family's love of camcorders and, weirdly, taping every second of their lives, we're treated to a front row seat as their lives completely fall apart. 
 The question is, did  they do it? The police say yes, but many witnesses say otherwise. Come with us as we learn all about this strange family with their bizarre love of pre-jail piano parties, yelling at their mother, and VIDEO DIARIES! Ahhh, the 80s. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>We believe the working title for this documentary was "The Garbage-Human Who Pretended To Be A 9/11 Survivor."
 Ugh, Meet Tania Head, the woman who claimed to be a survivor of the attacks on the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. An "employee of Merrill Lynch" with "degrees from Harvard and Stanford" and the "fiancee of 'Big Dave,'" an employee in the opposite tower, Tania was, for all intents and purposes, the face of the survivors of 9/11....Until the New York Times looked into her story. 
 As the truth of her story comes to light, we meet the real survivors she conned--some who'd figured her out early on, others who held out hope that she was who she claimed to be. 
 Hear our funny, insightful, and super-annoyed take. </p>

Two former students--our heroes Gemma and Abbie--launch a dogged investigation into the decades-old cold case. The horrors they uncover include stories of sexual abuse by Priests, a possible cover up by the Catholic Church, and a potentially corrupt city government. 
 In pursuit of the truth, we meet crooked cops, gay uncles, pregnant drag queens (you heard me), a detective named "deep throat," and a whole bunch of bad-ass ladies who are getting to the bottom this thing, no matter what.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Late on the evening of June 14, 2015, deputy sheriffs in Greene County, Missouri, found the body of Dee Dee Blancharde laying facedown in a pool of blood from the stab wounds that had killed her several days earlier.  There was no sign of her teenage daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blancharde, suffered from leukemia, asthma, muscular dystrophy, and several other chronic conditions, and had the mental capacity of a 7-year-old.
 In the days and weeks that followed, the police came to understand the crime and the treacherous web of lies, child abuse, mental illness, and forbidden love that set the stage for this horrendous and brutal murder. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>What drove music icon Kurt Cobain to take his own life on April 8th, 1994. Is it possible that he didn't? Could he have been murdered? After all, the gun had been wiped of finger prints and there are a LOT of questions about the legitimacy of the suicide note. And if he was murdered, did his wife, Courtney Love, have something to do with it? The 1998 Nick Broomfield documentary looks into all of this.
 We also meet Kurt's....colorful?....Seattle friends, become obsessed with his Aunt Mary, have an awkward encounter at the Washington State Lottery, and ride along with a pimp to the home of a weirdo named El Duce! Ahhhhh, the 90s. </p>

The film centers on a young man in Spain who claims to a grieving Texas family that he is their 16-year-old son who has been missing for 3 years. Using clips from the movie, Patrick and Gillian take you through the film while discussing everything that is tragic, ridiculous, and yes, even hilarious about it. </p>
