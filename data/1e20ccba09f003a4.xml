   <media:description>The Sikh Empire is a challenging start in Victoria 3, surrounded by enemies, with a faltering economy, and a political leaning that one might call &quot;somewhat traditionalist&quot;. While some of our wounds are self-inflicted, and many of our enemies are admittedly weak, the one to our East has a terrifying overlord, and the strength to crush us in one fell swoop. In this Victoria 3 let's play, we will take charge as the Sikh Empire, pushing the East India Company out of the Indian Subcontinent, and then creating the Empire under the Pun through the subjugation of Great Britain.

Our new Let's Play will take us to one of the oldest playable factions over the last 6 years of Total War: Warhammer games - The Empire. New gameplay mechanics from The Empire rework means we'll be tackling the Elector Counts, Machinations, and more as we expand across the Old World and more.

   <media:description>If you're wondering what games to play at the October Steam Next Fest in 2022, here's a set of five great games that are well worth your time. In this video we'll go through a handful of strategy games, city builders, tactical combat titles and more as we discuss some of the most interesting looking games at Next Fest. This video was made possible due to the developers providing me with early access to their titles and a heads up that they'd be participating in the October Next Fest, and you can expect a follow-up video after the festival is over highlighting more games that I wasn't able to check out beforehand!

   <media:description>Two Point Campus is here, and we're taking on the role of Campus Administrator across multiple universities at Two Point County as we try to educate the masses in the ways of PARTY. This management / tycoon style game has an excellent balance of comedy and challenge, and harkens back to classics from my earliest days of playing in the genre.

   <media:description>Karl Franz must unite The Empire in Total War: Warhammer 3 if he's to have any hope against the darkness that encroaches in Immortal Empires. Our new Let's Play will take us to one of the oldest playable factions over the last 6 years of Total War: Warhammer games - The Empire. New gameplay mechanics from The Empire rework means we'll be tackling the Elector Counts, Machinations, and more as we expand across the Old World and more.

Despite being a huge fan of RPGs, I never had a chance to play Disco Elysium when it first came out. We're here to fix that! Note that, though the game originally released in 2019, we're checking out the updated version from 2021 - The Final Cut!
