Then, they choose the most likely ending to the Broncos' (21:00) and Giants' (28:00) seasons, and share their thoughts on whether Aaron Rodgers could be on his way out of Green Bay (38:00). Finally, Sheil and Josh close the show by answering your mailbag questions (49:00).

Later, Steven Ruiz joins the show to talk about why he still doesn’t trust the Vikings (19:05), before discussing his QB rankings, and how the Patriots and Cowboys can learn from what has happened with Bailey Zappe and Cooper Rush (38:03).

      <title>Broncos Offense Sputters, Parity Isn’t Fun, the Bucs Need a Software Update, and More Big Takeaways from Week 6 | Extra Point Taken</title>
      <description>Ben and Sheil kick off the pod by sharing their reactions to the Chargers’ clunky win over the Broncos on 'Monday Night Football.' Next, they break down the mismanagement of the Arizona Cardinals—from coaching decisions, on-field performance, to the front office—and how the team as presently constructed cannot be run back (12:00). They then examine Tampa Bay’s offensive philosophy (19:21), tip their caps to the OG coaches of the league (27:35), and raise concerns regarding the Browns defense (35:04). They end the pod by discussing the Jets’ potential QB decision in the offseason (44:32), and the weekly extra point by Ben (51:07).

      <title>The Dolphins Are No Fluke | The Island</title>
      <description>Each week, a guest tries to persuade Nora Princiotti to agree with an argument they feel strongly about. This week, Nora is joined by The Ringer's own Danny Kelly, who explains why we should not only continue to expect impressive passing performances from Tua Tagovailoa and the Dolphins' high-speed receiving corp this season, but that we should also keep an eye on the untapped running attack that is characteristic of Mike McDaniel's balanced offensive scheme. Will Nora join him on the island, or sail elsewhere?

      <itunes:summary>Each week, a guest tries to persuade Nora Princiotti to agree with an argument they feel strongly about. This week, Nora is joined by The Ringer's own Danny Kelly, who explains why we should not only continue to expect impressive passing performances from Tua Tagovailoa and the Dolphins' high-speed receiving corp this season, but that we should also keep an eye on the untapped running attack that is characteristic of Mike McDaniel's balanced offensive scheme. Will Nora join him on the island, or sail elsewhere?

      <title>The Seahawks Spoil Russell Wilson’s Homecoming and Big Takeaways from Week 1</title>
      <description>Sheil and Ben get together to share their reactions to the Seahawks’ big win over the Broncos on ‘Monday Night Football.’ Next, they debate whether Justin Jefferson is really as good as he looked during the Vikings’ win over the Packers or if Green Bay just has a horrible defense (20:07). They then statistically dissect both Josh Allen’s and Patrick Mahomes’s Week 1 performances to show how their respective teams’ offensive schemes have improved since last season (33:25). Conversely, Ben is seeing deficiencies in Justin Herbert and the Chargers offense, (44:45) while Sheil predicts a dismal future for the Cowboys after Dak Prescott’s injury (56:51). They end the pod by delivering their weekly Extra Points (1:02:44).

        <![CDATA[<p>Sheil and Ben get together to share their reactions to the Seahawks’ big win over the Broncos on ‘Monday Night Football.’ Next, they debate whether Justin Jefferson is really as good as he looked during the Vikings’ win over the Packers or if Green Bay just has a horrible defense (20:07). They then statistically dissect both Josh Allen’s and Patrick Mahomes’s Week 1 performances to show how their respective teams’ offensive schemes have improved since last season (33:25). Conversely, Ben is seeing deficiencies in Justin Herbert and the Chargers offense, (44:45) while Sheil predicts a dismal future for the Cowboys after Dak Prescott’s injury (56:51). They end the pod by delivering their weekly Extra Points (1:02:44).</p><p>Hosts: Ben Solak and Sheil Kapadia</p><p>Production Supervision: Arjuna Ramgopal and Conor Nevins</p><p>Production Assistance: Chris Sutton</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Mid-Tier Quarterbacks in Make-or-Break Seasons</title>
      <description>Jason and Austin examine some of the QBs in the middle of their rankings who may be operating under short leashes in the upcoming season. First they quickly touch on the "Dangerously Mid-Tier" group and talk about if Kirk Cousins, Ryan Tannehill, or Derek Carr have received enough help from their respective organizations to make an elite jump. Next, they discuss the QBs at the "Flashy Good or Flashy Terrible" level like Kyler Murray (12:43), Jalen Hurts( 17:40), and Matt Ryan (21:33), and ponder if they'll be able to live up their lofty reputations this year. They end the pod by debating if quarterbacks like Daniel Jones (28:00), Jared Goff (30:50), Carson Wentz,(33:30) Baker Mayfield(36:07), and Jameis Winston (38:49) are able to transcend their criticisms and elevate their themselves above "Mostly Bad, Sometimes Good" status.

      <title>The Zero RB Draft Strategy | The Dantasy Football Podcast</title>
      <description>As draft season approaches, we break down one of the hottest draft strategies in fantasy football: zero RB, also known as waiting to draft running backs until the middle rounds and loading up on wide receivers and tight ends early. We discuss the logic behind the strategy, and offer up the most valuable middle-to-late-round running backs.

Hosts: Danny Heifetz, Danny Kelly, and Craig Horlbeck

      <title>How the New CBA Affects the NFL | The Ringer NFL Show</title>
      <description>After 10 months of negotiations, the NFL Players Association has approved a new collective bargaining agreement, which will administer its relationship with the league for the next 11 years. We clarify what the deal entails, including a rise in player minimum salaries, an extra regular-season game, a padded practice limit, and much more (0:35). Then we discuss the Ravens' trade for Calais Campbell, and Ryan Tannehill’s extension with the Titans (13:50).

      <description>Today we’re transporting ourselves back to the preseason to look at who ended up being the biggest surprises and disappointments of this season as well as to speculate on the reasons why each player's success was either bolstered or stifled. We talk about sleepers who paid off like Chris Godwin and Austin Ekeler, and players who burned us like Baker Mayfield, Odell Beckham Jr., and Adam Thielen.
Hosts: Danny Heifetz, Danny Kelly, and Craig Horlbeck

      <title>The Pats Finally Fall, Brady’s Future, the Unlucky Saints, and More From a Wild Weekend | The Ringer NFL Show</title>
      <description>After nine straight seasons, Tom Brady and the Patriots played in a wild-card game and lost to the Titans. Speculation has begun on whether or not this is the end of the Brady–Bill Belichick era (2:17). Next, we express disappointment over not predicting this Vikings performance, and express confusion over the refs’ refusal to call pass interference on the final play (33:20). Finally, we break down the Seahawks’ win over the Eagles and the wild Bills-Texans ending (43:20).
Hosts: Robert Mays and Kevin Clark

      <itunes:subtitle>The Patriots' “scandal” has come and gone. Why aren’t we as upset at New England as before? Then, who advanced analytics is telling us should be the MVP and why they’re wrong (0:30). Next, a take shop about legalizing sideline spying (11:50) before we preview the biggest three games of the week headlined by the Rams vs. Cowboys (27:50). Finally, we speculate about which coaches Jerry Jones will look to hire (Lincoln Riley and Urban Meyer) if and when Jason Garrett gets fired (48:00).

      <title>The Saints-49ers Game Is the Future of Good Football, the Pats Fall (Again), and the Rams Are BACK (Maybe) | The Ringer NFL Show</title>
      <description>A little over one year ago, we witnessed what felt like a new era of football after watching the Rams and Chiefs score over 100 points in an epic offensive showcase. Today, the Saints and 49ers proved this new era was no fluke (0:40). Then, a Stock Up lead by a strong Chiefs win over the Patriots, as well as a huge day for rookie QB Drew Lock (9:20), and a Stock Down lead by a disappointing and bizarre Seahawks loss, before predicting tomorrow's headlines (30:30).

      <description>The guys discuss how the most anticipated quarterback matchup of Week 11 turned one-sided as Lamar Jackson and the Ravens proved they’re as complete as any team in the NFL (0:29). Plus, a Stock Up led by the Vikings’ incredible comeback and an impressive division win for the Colts (12:16), before a Stock Down headlined by the Bears’ struggles, the Eagles’ waning playoff chances, and how Tua Tagovailoa’s injury affects the tanking race (23:11). Finally, they throw a pair of challenge flags on the NFL’s pass interference rule and the Washington football franchise (47:07).
Hosts: Robert Mays and Kevin Clark

      <title>The Tight End Apocalypse l The Dantasy Football Podcast</title>
      <description>Danny Kelly, Danny Heifetz, and Craig Horlbeck discuss the Rams offense plummeting off a cliff and into the sea, how Patrick Mahomes and the rest of Kansas City’s offense is suffering from defensive ineptitude, and what to do with Amari Cooper and the Cowboys(1:30). They also look at why rushing quarterbacks are the saving grace of the season and how the tight end position is bad (but not as bad as everyone thinks). Finally, the Dannys stop Craig from stealing the first Sleeper of the Week victory (35:00).

They then take a look Aaron Rodgers’s new-look skill-position group (07:30), why Dalvin Cook might make the leap (13:15), and why the Seahawks backfield will come down to blocking and #grit (18:00) before finishing up with whether they’re high on Chris Hogan and Will Fuller (26:30).

      <title>Super Bowl Preview, Part 2: We’re Not All Picking the Patriots  (Ep. 232)</title>
      <description>In Part 2 of their Super Bowl preview from Minneapolis, The Ringer’s Robert Mays and Kevin Clark discuss how the Eagles can stop Tom Brady (05:00), why the Patriots' defense is better than we think (10:30), and how Doug Pederson might out-coach Bill Belichick (16:00). Danny Kelly then joins the show to give some X-factors for each team (35:00) and help run through some fun prop bets (41:30), including how many times Gisele will be shown on Sunday night's broadcast (44:15), and which surprise guest we could see during the halftime show (45:00). Finally the guys make their predictions—and not everyone agrees on who will win (47:45).

      <title>Welcome to the Two Most Fun Weeks on the NFL Calendar (Ep. 211)</title>
      <description>The Ringer’s Robert Mays and Kevin Clark recap Week 17, including why Panthers fans should be worried (0:56), the odd reason the Bills were a shoo-in for a wild-card berth before Sunday’s games (8:36), and why the Raiders hiring Jon Gruden would not be a slam dunk (16:55). Then, the guys discuss why Patrick Mahomes II will likely be the Chiefs' starter next season, regardless of their playoff run with Alex Smith (32:38). Plus, Danny Kelly joins the show to explain how the Vikings are flawed (41:52) and why the Eagles won’t win a playoff game (46:15), and to debate who would win the Super Bowl if every team’s quarterback was Blake Bortles (48:25).

      <title>The NFL Wins With Its Week 17 Schedule (Ep. 210)</title>
      <description>The Ringer’s Robert Mays and Kevin Clark get you set for Week 17, including how the crazy AFC wild-card scenario will likely play out (4:04), why NFC teams would rather see Seattle than Atlanta as the 6-seed (16:26), and how resting players in Week 17 will affect the playoff picture and the MVP race (23:40). Then, the guys discuss which coaches need wins Sunday to save their jobs (33:32) and why most teams actually shouldn’t fire their coaches (38:29). Finally, Danny Kelly joins the show to predict next year’s fantasy studs (44:59), including a little-known 49ers receiver who should shine with Jimmy Garoppolo under center (52:16).

      <description>The Ringer’s Robert Mays and Kevin Clark recap Week 13, including why the horrific injury to Ryan Shazier isn’t the worst thing that can happen in today’s NFL, and that’s a huge problem (01:30).

      <title>Now We’re Having Fun (Ep. 193)</title>
      <description>On Tuesday, The Ringer’s Robert Mays and Kevin Clark recapped Week 12, including why Joe Flacco shouldn’t be allowed to play in prime time anymore (01:00), why no one wants to face the Falcons in the NFC playoffs (03:30), and why it’s the Rams' defense that deserves more credit for the team's success this year (11:00). Then, the guys discuss some breakout stars who surprised us this season (15:00) and explain why the Texans are the best out-of-the-running team (22:00). Finally, Danny Kelly joins the show to discuss why the Steelers seem to play down to their competition (39:00) and how the Seahawks can scrape together a playoff run despite a depleted defense and no run game (43:45).

      <title>Thanksgiving Week Means All-You-Can-Eat Football (Ep. 190)</title>
      <description>The Ringer’s Robert Mays and Kevin Clark react to some great Thanksgiving action, including the Vikings and Case Keenum putting it all together, Dak Prescott's subpar play, and the Chargers becoming the scariest wild-card contender. Then the guys preview Week 12 by discussing how we arrived in a world where Saints-Rams is the game of the week, why the Bills can’t decide if they are tanking or not and why it might be time for the Packers to move on from Mike McCarthy. Finally Danny Kelly joins the show to offer his Week 12 fantasy sleeper picks, including the Rams receiver that will step up in the absence of Robert Woods, the surprise tight end you should start, and Thomas Rawls potentially providing some value in your lineup this Sunday.

Then, Bryan Curtis and the guys discuss the myriad of significant off-field issues, including the cartoonish rift between Jerry Jones and Roger Goodell (22:45) and how the pregame player protests have already been successful (28:30).

      <description>The Ringer’s Robert Mays and Kevin Clark wrap up Week 7 in the NFL by looking at how this bizarre season has made for the most possible contenders at this point in the year (3:55), why the Seahawks and Vikings are the only teams we actually know right now (11:20), and whether the Patriots can win a title with the worst defense in the league (25:20). Then 'Talk the Thrones' cohost Mallory Rubin joins to explain how Joe Flacco admitted that the Ravens are completely broken (39:00) and why the Steelers don’t need Martavis Bryant (49:10). Finally Robert and Kevin offer their lasting impressions from Week 7, including why the NFL needs to dial back the amount of football on television (56:30).

      <description>The Ringer’s Robert Mays and Kevin Clark dig into Week 4 in the NFL, beginning with a recap of the Bears vs. Packers game that reminded everyone how serious head injuries are in the NFL (02:00). Then, the guys discuss why this is the weekend when we learn how good the Panthers and Patriots are (11:30), how the Rams high-powered offense will finally be tested in Dallas (18:00), and why the Jaguars are the real deal (28:00). Plus, Mike Lombardi joins the show to explain how we are likely watching the end of the Big Ben era in Pittsburgh (37:00) and Danny Kelly calls in with some not-so-obvious fantasy matchup plays for Week 4 (54:00). Finally, Robert and Kevin offer their headlines for next week, including how pregame protests will continue to rule the news cycle (62:00).

      <title>Week 1 Was More Bad Than Good (Ep. 139)</title>
      <description>The Ringer’s Robert Mays and Kevin Clark react to a wild Week 1 in the NFL, including how the Cowboys regained their NFC contender status Sunday night (03:30) and how the Seahawks may have lost theirs (08:00). Then, the guys discuss how the Raiders and Marshawn Lynch are the perfect mix of fun and force (10:00), why running backs won’t play a role in playoff races this season (20:00), and how some lesser-known Ravens exposed the bumbling Bengals (30:00). Then, Danny Kelly joins the show to explain why Le’Veon Bell struggled out of the gates against Cleveland (33:00) and Rodger Sherman helps the guys decide whether some Week 1 surprises were a fluke or not (42:30). Finally, Robert and Kevin point out some marquee matchups that we lost for this season this weekend (49:30), and how one glaring weakness could make for a long season leaguewide (51:00).

      <description>The Ringer’s Robert Mays and Kevin Clark continue answering 33 Preseason Questions leading up to opening night. They explore some preseason injuries that have more fantasy impact than Julian Edelman’s (04:00) and discuss whether the Falcons could be even better this year despite taking an offensive step back (14:00). Then, the guys consider whether the Seahawks defense is among the best of all-time (19:30), debate whether Derek Carr is a top-flight quarterback (24:30), and look at how the Cowboys have already fallen from NFC championship contention (28:30). Finally, Robert and Kevin imagine a major trade between the Patriots and Jets (34:15), and go over every NFL team that could win the Super Bowl this season (39:30).
