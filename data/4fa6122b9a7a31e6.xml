      <itunes:title>Remember Halloween?</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In honor of today being Halloween, we thought we would reminisce about some of our favorite Halloween memories from childhood costumes to shaving cream hijinks. We also discuss the condescending nature of giving out healthy snacks (don't be this person), Vanessa talks about having a dance recital at the famed Orange Jubilee and we explore why a chain buffet restaurant with fluorescent lighting is Jonah's equivalent of a haunted house. We also discuss feeling pressured to dress up for Halloween parties, people who get very into decorations and the time we replaced our American flag with a pirate flag at a childhood home (amazing, this was not Halloween-related.) We also dig into a holiday-fueled round of change.dork where we discuss petitions that make a case for giving students the day off after Halloween, wearing costumes to school and making Halloween fall on the last Saturday of October every month regardless of what our calendar or the Farmer's Almanac wants us to believe. Whether you're dressing up as a friendly ghost or an embittered CEO, you'll find something to boo-lieve in on this episode of the podcast. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You've seen comedian and writer Adam Conover break down important topics on his hit TV shows "Adam Ruins Everything" and "The G Word With Adam Conover," but his intellectual expertise also extends to nostalgia. On this episode of the podcast, Adam tells us about the video games he played on his graphing calculator in school, his his indie rock/funny folk music band and why he hopes no one listening to this podcast will ever hear it. We also dive deep into the educational television series Square One Television, Vanessa and Jonah reminisce about Ben Affleck's memorable role in "Voyage of the Mimi" and we trace the career traject of the vocal group Rockapella from Carmen Sandiego's house band to Folgers instant coffee fame. Finally, we play a round of YESTOLGIA OR NOSTALGIA where we debate the merits of Cinnabon-flavored cereal, the return of Taco Bell's Enchirito and the rebooted Teletubbies.

      <title>Remember Working at Toys "R" Us? (with Dan Ozzi)</title>
      <itunes:title>Remember Working at Toys "R" Us? (with Dan Ozzi)</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week the Bayers are joined by bestselling author, Dan Ozzi whose book "Sellout" comes out on paperback tomorrow! To celebrate we reminisce about the time Dan had a VIP experience with Jonah and his parents at a New York Yankees game (thanks to Vanessa and Lorne Michaels) and which corporations have the best snacks, ranging from free Luna bars at Dan's ex-employer VICE to the time he loaded up on free desserts at Google. From there we get into our topic, where Dan compares his job working at a Toys "R" Us on Staten Island to Jonah's experience of working at a Kids "R" Us in suburban Ohio. It turns out Dan's job was like a Coen Safdie brothers movie with Simpsons figurines while Jonah's job was more like a movie directed by a very boring director that ends with him getting fired for playing a Tori Amos song on the local news. Finally, we play another round of "Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan" where we debate if the United States are Un-united, discuss how littering with garbage is different than littering with language and recap the basic tenets of tipping for those Cleveland Plain Dealer readers who feel that working at Pizza Hut for minimum wage is a job that you should be grateful to have. Did we mention Dan's book is coming out in paperback? </p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>Remember Old El Paso Meal Kits? (with Randy Blythe)</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we welcome lead singer of "Lamb of God" our friend Randy Blythe! We talk about everything from Indiana Jones movies to real-life encounters with Keanu Reeves, like when Vanessa recently talked to him for twenty minutes about his star turn in the Paula Abdul "Rush Rush Video" (uh oh are they best friends now?) plus Randy and Jonah try to teach Vanessa the difference between punk and metal, concert etiquette and much more. We also dive into the classic Old El Paso taco kit and how the seasoning still holds up today. And we get into the allure of Boboli and Digiorno pizza, which made you feel you were really making the real stuff/delivery! We also discuss classic family recipes like chicken tetrazzini, noodle kugel, and Jonah's ultimate favorite: orange juice (according to our Grandma). And we play another exciting game of "Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan" that covers texting at dinner, holding the door at post offices, and radio stations playing Christmas music around Thanksgiving. If you miss this episode you might get a visit from Krampus, and if you don't know who that is, you will learn from this episode- obvi it's a must-listen!</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

Jay and Vanessa reminisce about SNL impressions they did based on their childhoods and some celebrity impressions they did later on (speaking of- who does a better Denzel Washington- you'll have to listen to find out!) The Bayers and Jay also talk about a fave show from growing up, Nickelodeon's "Doug" and Jay and Vanessa are so proud to learn what their tv son is up to today: winning a Daytime Emmy! ("tv son" is kind of nuanced in this instance but again, ya gotta listen to find out how!) Plus, in an exciting game of "Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan" they all debate new moves being made by The History Channel, how transparent restaurant commercials need to be, and whether texting your parents is a sufficient way to communicate.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>On today's new episode, Jonah and Vanessa welcome fellow Ohio native and host of Spotify's "60 Songs That Explain the 90s" Rob Harvilla to the podcast. They revisit their senior projects, which included organizing record bins, helping the community, and surfing the Internet. Jonah and Rob reminisce about their time working together at Alternative Press, including towers of promo CDs and their reviews of up-and-coming bands. Don't worry, they were nice and honest! Vanessa showcases her amazing Fred Durst impression as they navigate which song Limp Bizkit was known for performing. They discuss tablature music and their grunge band rankings, which leads to a discussion about their parents' collection of records from all genres of music. True Colors, Prince, Bob Dylan, Diana Ross and much much more. All this talk really gets the Bayers thinking about getting a record player. Sponsors, are your ears open?! We end the pod with a round of "Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan?" where they review the Plain Dealer for complaints among the Greater Cleveland area including cable networks going to hell, unrealistic expectations of punctuality, and school deficit politics.

      <itunes:title>Remember Pogo Ball? (with Julie Klausner)</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we are excited to welcome writer, actress and comedian Julie Klausner to the podcast, who you may know from her popular Hulu series "Difficult People," her podcast DOUBLE THREAT with Tom Scharpling and/or her brand new podcast ASK JULIE! on the Forever Dog Plus Network. We discuss with Julie the many similarities between the films "Singles" and "Reality Bites" (including highlights from both soundtracks), dissect "Empire Records" and "So I Married an Axe Murderer" (GWAR discussion included) and reminisce about the time Vanessa introduced Jonah to Eddie Vedder and he said Vanessa was cool. We also revisit one of the most dangerous toys of the nineties aka the Pogo Ball, and explore their unorthodox commercial campaign which for some reason featured a giant monster hand trying to destroy the universe? Then we round things out with our viral segment "Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan?" where we scan the Plain Dealer from a decade ago to find out what Clevelanders were complaining about, from smoking in casinos to extreme couponers. Unlike a Pogo Ball commute this podcast moves fast, so don't forget to don protective gear before listening. </p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Remember Being a Latchkey Kid? (with Geoff Rickly)</title>
      <itunes:title>Remember Being a Latchkey Kid? (with Geoff Rickly)</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly took a break from playing arenas with My Chemical Romance to talk to us about what it was like being a latchkey kid in the suburbs of New Jersey during the "Home Alone" era of parental supervision. Along the way we also discuss the time Geoff and Jonah's screamo band, United Nations, were sued by the actual United Nations; the fine line between art and absurdity; and Geoff's memories of his first-period chorus class. We also discuss how Jonah stayed at Geoff's childhood home nearly two decades ago for work and recall Vanessa's cherished childhood cat, Pumpkin. Finally. we play an inaugural round of a new segment called "CEO TAKEDOWN" where we look at three CEOs who have made headlines lately and determine which one needs to be taken down a notch. If you're a fan of "the system" you might not enjoy this podcast because this one is for the true punks and outcasts, not the Wall Street billionaires or corrupt cookie corporations who thrive on conceit and complacency. (You know who you are.)</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Remember Hair Crimping? (with Jenna Von Oy)</title>
      <itunes:title>Remember Hair Crimping? (with Jenna Von Oy)</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Well the sun is gonna surely shine this week because we are joined by star of the sitcom "Blossom" and friend of the Bayers, Jenna von Oy! On this episode, Vanessa fact-checks the bizarre direct message (and probably fictional road trip) that lead to her friendship with Jenna, we learn about the unlikely relationship between "Blossom" and "Seinfeld" and deconstruct Jenna's experiences doing commercials in the '90s which ranged from Kool-AId to Members Only to Quilted Northern. We also dig deep into the era's fashion—and what could accentuate a hat with fabric flowers attached to it more than crimped hair? (Unfortunately, crimping wasn't so easy for those of us with curly hair.) Finally, we discuss her co-star Joey Lawrence's "Nothing My Love Can't Fix" music video and play an insightful round of "Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan" where we explore misguided opinions on marketing, economics and junk mail. Also, be sure to check out and donate to Jenna's wonderful new project at https://www.thecassandraproject.net.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's late August and that can only mean one thing: Back To School! In this this special episode, Vanessa and Jonah recall their visceral memories from that time which include picking out the perfect school supplies, shopping for the previous year's hottest fashions at Marshalls, and the oh so important task of planning an outfit for the first day of school. We also get deep into our former high school's current website on our new segment "Congratulations, You Played Yourself" and make a compelling argument for why Jonah should be included in the "notable alumni" section alongside Vanessa, former HDWGW guest JD Samson (Le Tigre) and, amazingly, the original bassist for Filter who would probably tell Jonah, "Hey man, nice shot" when it comes to his chances for inclusion. We also discuss how wild it is that high school class presidents have a lifetime appointment and our dad chimes in with his own personal history when it comes to the McDonald's Snack Wrap and its enduring influence on the fast food franchise. If you DON'T listen to this episode, well, then congratulations, you played yourself (meaning you should listen).</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>Remember TV Guide? (with Paul Brittain)</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on the podcast we are joined by our friend, the truly hilarious actor and comedian Paul Brittain, who you might know from "Saturday Night Live," "Trophy Wife" or a sketch based on "Three Men And A Baby" back in Chicago many years ago that Vanessa is still obsessed with. In that spirit, this episode includes Vanessa and Paul recounting their halycon days of cutting their teeth in the Windy City comedy scene, us all reminiscing about the way that seemingly carefree sitcoms used to tackle serious issues and Jonah being impressed that Paul saw the post-hardcore act Hum back in the nineties. For the main event, we recall the convenience of the print version of TV Guide and the frustration of the endlessly scrolling TV Guide channel, the story of which we hope is someday made into a made-for-TV movie (meta). We also play a captivating round of "Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan" where we discuss grocery store etiquette, loud television commercials and whether baseball players should charge kids for their autographs. We dare you to find another podcast that covers everyone from Mario Lopez to Mike Hargrove, but if you do, we might just buy your ticket to a charity spaghetti dinner. </p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>Remember Xena: Warrior Princess? (with Jenny Owen Youngs)</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Jenny Owen Youngs is not only a successful musician and songwriter who has worked with some of the biggest artists on the planet, she is also a TV scholar who co-hosts popular podcasts about Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Veronica Mars. In other words, she's the perfect guest for HOW DID WE GET WEIRD? On this episode, Jonah recalls the magical night he attended both Jenny's wedding and MTV Video Music Awards where Vanessa introduced Miley Cyrus' performance, Jenny talks about what it's like living in the lobster roll mecca of Maine and Vanessa does a truly stellar impression of Jenny's collaborator Pitbull that is so uncanny it's difficult to believe Mr. Worldwide is not in the room with us. For our topic, we take a collective deep dive into the popular fantasy/adventure television series "Xena: Warrior Princess," specifically when it comes to the impact it had on a young Jenny Owen Youngs and the pioneering plot twists that have since become hallmarks of the genre. Finally, we play a snack-themed round of" Change Dot Dork" and try to guess which unhealthy treat from the past is currently back in rotation at your local grocery store. Enjoy. </p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Craig Finn is best known as the frontman for The Hold Steady and a successful solo artist but some of his formative years were influenced by peer pressure when it came to teenagers' favorite hobby in the nineties: Prank phone calls. On this episode we recount our own largely anticlimactic stories of receiving and making prank calls, Vanessa explains the way she views conversations between musicians from a comedian's perspective and of course we explore Craig's Cleveland connection, whether that means shaking it up in Shaker Heights as a child or playing to sparse audiences at the Euclid Tavern as an adult. Finally we once against revisit our "Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan" segment, which sees us discussing if it's OK to talk at movie theatres before the previews start, if Browns fans should be ejected for standing at a football game and if income inequality can truly be blamed on the fact that Nicholas Cage reportedly sold a Superman comic book for $2.1 million dollars in 2011.One thing that we don't think you'll be complaining about is Craig's new solo album "A Legacy Of Rentals," which is out now and in Jonah's constant musical rotation.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You may know Michelle Zauner from her Grammy-nominated musical act Japanese Breakfast or New York Times best-selling memoir "Crying in H Mart," but before all that she was just a kid who loved Sailor Moon. Michelle dropped by the pod this week to talk about watching and rewatching her favorite childhood VHS tapes, taking guitar lessons in the world's most corporate setting and the lessons she learned growing up about dining etiquette. Along the way Michelle helps Jonah and Vanessa call out their middle school music teacher for not lightening up and letting Jonah listen to Metallica in class, the three of us discuss the green room cheese plate situation for Japanese Breakfast's performance on this year's SNL season finale. As if that weren't enough, we also introduce a BRAND NEW SEGMENT called "Legit Moan Or Unnecessary Groan" that is kind of difficult to explain but should not be missed and sees us tackling the legacy of Crankshaft, Lawrence Welk and Giant Eagle supermarket's controversial stocking decisions. EPISODE NOTE: we accidentally say the Silent Generation came before the Greatest Greatest Generation when it's actually the other way around and we apologize for the mix-up, but honestly don't focus on that, Boomer.</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Vanessa and Jonah welcome their friends, Hollywood Power Couple Patton Oswalt and Meredith Salenger, to HDWGW. They talk about their time on Will &amp; Grace, the shelf life of pastries (especially if they are given to you for free), and attending high school and college reunions. They go on to discuss a variety of school field trips, like going into a giant tooth, Meredith's nostalgia-filled visits to Olvera Street, and Patton's trips to very cool historical landmarks near Washington D.C. The discussion eventually takes them to snack talks, including the interesting yet disgusting treat known as astronaut food. Eventually the conversation leads to being mesmerized by gift shops and relieved that kids don't have access to credit cards. A quick podcast public service announcement: DO. NOT. SHOPLIFT. AT.

Lastly, another fun round of Change.dork takes all four to thinking about Arby's, declaring the need for a holiday for wines, and the Bono/Jon Bon Jovi Vegan Challenge.</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we could not be happier to be joined by our very good friend the actress, comedian and musician Kate Micucci to discuss her childhood obsession with radio call-in contests, something she was so skilled at that eventually her local radio station told her she had to stop calling in. Along the way we discuss the time Jonah won Lilith Fair and Poison tickets from his local radio station and took Vanessa to both shows (Lilith Fair proved to be better attended), the lasting benefits of taking keyboarding classes in high school and the time Kate and Vanessa performed at a nineties-inspired music festival alongside Matchbox Twenty... or maybe it was Third Eye Blind? Finally, we play an inspiring round of our viral segment Change.dork, which explores everything from the barriers to entry for Funkytown to Crocs etiquette. </p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

Listen to Jonah and Vanessa break down this singularly terrible film where bad accents, nonsensical character arcs and an flimsy-yet-offensive plot all come together to create a film that was physically difficult to watch and leaves us far more confused than entertained.

      <title>Remember Hanging Out At The Mall? (with Andy Richter)</title>
      <itunes:title>Remember Hanging Out At The Mall? (with Andy Richter)</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>You may know Andy Richter as the longtime sidekick for Conan O'Brien, but he's also a very accomplished actor, writer, comedian and podcaster. Andy came by HDWGW this week to discuss the difficulties of fish taxidermy, his Chicago comedy roots and some of his favorite Late Night With Conan O'Brien musical acts ranging from The Breeders to Tony Bennett. We also recall fond memories of hanging out at our local shopping malls in the 80s and 90s and our favorite food court picks.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may know Andy Richter as the longtime sidekick for Conan O'Brien, but he's also a very accomplished actor, writer, comedian and podcaster. Andy came by HDWGW this week to discuss the difficulties of fish taxidermy, his Chicago comedy roots and some of his favorite Late Night With Conan O'Brien musical acts ranging from The Breeders to Tony Bennett. We also recall fond memories of hanging out at our local shopping malls in the 80s and 90s and our favorite food court picks. Along the way, Vanessa laments the demise of the Original Cookie Company and Jonah talks about buying a Body Count CD at Record Town thanks to their lax parental advisory policy. Finally, we have an impassioned round of change.org where we debate whether our collective energy should be directed toward the return of PB&amp;J Oatmeal Cream Pies, accountability for the Lethal Weapon TV series or the availability Twinkies in a high school cafeteria.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Joe Trohman is best known as the guitarist in the multi-platinum rock act Fall Out Boy but he's also created cartoons, comics and the upcoming memoir, None of This Rocks. We sat down with Joe to discuss his earliest movie memories, which include his mother showing him the Omen and share our own inappropriate movie memories, which include their parents' friend Terry showing us The Re-Animator when we were way too young. Along the way we also discuss Joe's lifelong obsession with horror movies, the fact that he and Vanessa shared the same therapist in New York City and Joe's memorable episode of MTV's Cribs. We also recall the time Jonah visited the New York Stock Exchange with Fall Out Boy and Joe's infinite metal cred (he's in a band with Anthrax's Scott Ian after all). Finally, we answer the age-old question: Can Domino's do deep-dish pizza? You'll have to listen to find out.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

On this action-packed episode, we discuss whether we keep in touch with people from our childhood and debate the need for adult-sized Lunchables. Plus, we get in-depth about the history of the beloved childhood juice, squeezits, and if we really want to see snack foods advertised as sentient beings. Finally, we revisit our change.dork segment where we imagine a world where "Weird Al" Yankovic performs at the Super Bowl and Jonah starts a public feud with Maroon 5 that is sure to be making headlines all over the Internet by the time you read this.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

Full disclosure: we told Showalter that we were going to talk to him about John Hughes movies, but we ended up inundating him with questions about his beloved comedy troupes The State and Stella as well as what we refer to as "the Wet Hot American summer franchise." In that spirit, we also find time to share our summer camp experiences when we aren't poking fun of our hometown or learning more about Showalter's creative process.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on the podcast, Vanessa and Jonah do a deep dive analysis of the 1998 Farrelly brothers film, "There's Something About Mary." Despite its all-star cast, there is a lot of questionable aspects of the film that are rooted in the broader context of comedy movies in the nineties. We've heard about suspending disbelief but you've got to attain anti-gravity levels of suspension to accept Matt Dillion's spy technology, the film's convoluted stalker backstory and the way that the Farrelly Brothers are able to reduce characters to mere caricatures. Despite all this, there are some genuinely funny moments in this film by Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz that embody the awkwardness of adolescence, where the film really shines. Whether you've never seen "There's Something About Mary" (which we hadn't) or it's one of your favorite films (grow up?), you'll find something to take away from our expert analysis of this comedy classic.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We are so lucky to have comedian, actor and singer Cole Escola drop by the podcast this week. You may know Cole from their scene-stealing roles in "Search Party," "At Home With Amy Sedaris" and "Difficult People," but before all that they were learning about sophisticated, cosmopolitan female leads on nineties shows like "Fired Up" and "Mad About You." We also get into how the calcium industry hijacked TV commercials in the nineties to the point where Cole ate so many Kraft single slices it made them puke, explore what will now be dubbed "The Snackwell aesthetic" and hear about the time Vanessa misunderstood what seems like a pretty straightforward reference from "Troop Beverly Hills" so deeply that it's still difficult to comprehend. The CEOs get a short-lived break this week as we bring back our "Back To The Present" segment where Jonah makes a compelling case for CD long boxes, Vanessa makes a plea to bring back WOW! chips (despite Olestra's uncomfortable side effects) and Cole would like to bring back Sunday night family movie programming, the latter of which should not cause intestinal bloating.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>
