    <author>emily.baker@artandideas.org (The Institute of Art and Ideas)</author><itunes:subtitle>Can empirical observation lead us to the truth? Looking for a link we mentioned? It's here:&amp;nbsp;https://linktr.ee/philosophyforourtimes From Newton to Darwin, Curie to Einstein, science has been built on empirical observation. Now the very idea of neutral observation is under threat. In a postmodern world it is claimed all observation is perspectival, everything we see influenced by what we already think. The founder of quantum mechanics, Heisenberg went further arguing that observing reality was not even possible. Are we at sea in a world of competing models? Or is it time to reassert the value of empirical observation, supported perhaps by machine learning and big data, as a means of choosing between incompatible theories? Steve Fuller is an academic studying science and technology. Fuller has published prolifically on such topics as intelligent design, the sociology of academia, and transhumanism. Angela Saini is an award-winning science journalist, author and broadcaster. She regularly presents science programmes for the BBC, and her writing has appeared in publications ranging from New Scientist, Wired and the Guardian. Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist and bestselling author. Best known for his 2012 book 'The Science Delusion' and the controversial, viral TED talk he gave which was banned by the organisation. Peter Atkins is a chemist and Fellow of Lincoln College. He’s a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK, Atkins is outspoken in his opposition to religion. Danielle Sands hosts.

Looking for a link we mentioned? It's here:&amp;nbsp;https://linktr.ee/philosophyforourtimes Most think of nature as good, while humans and human interventions are often seen as problematic and even on occasion evil. From eradicating e-numbers from our diets to refusing vaccines, many are motivated by the idea that nature knows best. Yet malaria is natural, the malaria vaccine is not. Crop failure, hurricanes, tsunamis - all are deadly, and all natural. Human actions are essential to extend and save lives from natural calamity. Is our attachment to nature undermining belief in ourselves? Should we have more faith in the human and less trust in nature? Or, are we right to be sceptical of human intervention and should we see the renewed reverence for nature as a positive return to an ancient and essential belief? Then again, should we accept that we are part of the natural world, and give up on the false distinction between real and artificial, natural and unnatural?

    <author>emily.baker@artandideas.org (The Institute of Art and Ideas)</author><itunes:subtitle>Should the origins of ideas matter as much as their substance? Our experts discuss. Looking for a link we mentioned? It's here:&amp;nbsp;https://linktr.ee/philosophyforourtimes There has always been dispute over which ideas are most significant. But at least there used to be broad agreement about the hallmarks of quality and the great works in each field. Now, from literature to the social sciences, there are claims that previous standards were structures of prejudice and oppression, and calls are heard for greater inclusion. How do we navigate this new space where there is so little agreement on merit? Should we abandon the notion of 'great works' altogether, or would this threaten the very survival of our culture and much that we hold to be valuable? Literary theorist Stanley Fish, author of How I Live Now, Meg Rosoff, journalist and editor of MsAfropolitan, Minna Salami and writer and essayist Janne Teller rethink what makes a great work of art.

Yet almost all of us choose to engage in activities, from swimming in the sea to driving a car or having a bottle of wine, that carry risks. In fact, more died globally last year from alcohol than Covid. So how do we assess what risks to take and how much time and resource to protect ourselves from future risk?</p><p>While it looks as if vaccines will bring the Covid pandemic under control, the next pandemic is potentially just a virus away.

    <author>emily.baker@artandideas.org (The Institute of Art and Ideas)</author><itunes:subtitle>Should narratives reflect or escape reality? Our panellists discuss. Looking for a link we mentioned? It's here:&amp;nbsp;https://linktr.ee/philosophyforourtimes From fairy tales to Harry Potter, from Avatar to James Bond, we love fantasy and expect our books and films to take us there. Yet at the same time we want our poems and plays, novels and movies, to reflect life and reality. Should our narratives be seeking to uncover reality or be seeking escape from it? Or are both goals impossible? Are we on the one hand unable to create a narrative that tells it how it is, and on the other incapable of making a fantasy that does not reflect our current circumstances? And if so, why? Director and producer of The Pervert's Guide to Cinema Sophie Fiennes, leading figure in contemporary philosophy of art&amp;nbsp;Noël Carroll&amp;nbsp;and myths expert Betty Sue Flowers explore whether narratives should reflect reality, or escape it.

It's here:&amp;nbsp;https://linktr.ee/philosophyforourtimes The practice of putting electrodes in the pleasure centres of the brain - otherwise known as 'wireheading' - has been a sci-fi dream for decades. Oxford professor and transhumanist Anders Sandberg, explores the history and modern impact of the idea. Anders takes us on a journey from Rosseau’s critique of civilisation via Victorian parasitologists to weird 70s science and all the way to cutting edge AI research today. Anders Sandberg is a research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford, where his research concerns the societal and ethical issues surrounding human enhancement and new technologies. He is also research associate to the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and the Oxford Centre for Neuroethics.&amp;nbsp; There are thousands of big ideas to discover at IAI.tv – videos, articles, and courses waiting for you to explore.

It's here:&amp;nbsp;https://linktr.ee/philosophyforourtimes The ancient concept of growth referred to a function of nature, the development of natural phenomena and their qualities.

Has modern society’s hijacking of this ancient concept unlocked humanity's true potential, or put us on the road to dysfunction and ruin? Series hosts Bernardo Kastrup and Fred Matser discuss this fascinating topic with&amp;nbsp;former Chief Business Officer for Google X, entrepreneur and the author of the book Solve for Happy, Mo Gawdat.

Being a real man used to be about courage, grit, and determination. But in an age of increased empathy and softness the story is getting blurred. Is the 'real man' a fantasy we should be pleased to see relegated to history along with Marlboro ads, or are these qualities that women still want and society needs?

Jamie Whyte chairs this debate between Labour MP Dianne Abott and radical feminist Julie Bindel, who both argue that male stereotypes should be relegated to history, as well as Erotic Review founder Rowan Pelling and BBC journalist Serena Kutchinsky, who argue that there is still a place for the Real Man in the modern world.

It's here:&amp;nbsp;https://linktr.ee/philosophyforourtimes Being a real man used to be about courage, grit, and determination. But in an age of increased empathy and softness the story is getting blurred. Is the 'real man' a fantasy we should be pleased to see relegated to history along with Marlboro ads, or are these qualities that women still want and society needs? Jamie Whyte chairs this debate between Labour MP Dianne Abott and radical feminist Julie Bindel, who both argue that male stereotypes should be relegated to history, as well as Erotic Review founder Rowan Pelling and BBC journalist Serena Kutchinsky, who argue that there is still a place for the Real Man in the modern world.

The shaming exposes and social media scandals of today can seem as backwards as the stocks or the pillory. Yet the fear of shame can bring the powerful to heel. What is our curious shame about shame? Might shaming be our best tool for change? Or should we always be fearful of the tyranny of the mob? 

Comedian Robin Ince, Sugar Daddy Diaries author Helen Croydon, and theologian and Zizek collaborator John Milbank uncover the strangeness of shame.

'God does not play dice with the universe' Einstein famously argued. Yet contemporary physics embeds just such dice playing at the core of its account. Is the universe really unknowable even to itself? Or as Einstein implied is this misguided and its secrets remain to be uncovered? 

Oxford Constructor theorist Chiara Marletto, mathematician Peter Cameron and string theorist Michael Duff untangle cause and effect.

Our life is made up of experiences. But what experience is remains a mystery. Heidegger thought it inexplicable and neuroscientists cannot find its location. Do we just need a better theory to uncover its secrets? Or is experience somehow both all that we have and yet not part of this world? 

Formulator of the hard problem of consciousness David Chalmers, Oxford philosopher Peter Hacker and New York neuroscientist Susana Martinez-Conde debate the mystery of experience.

Few take anarchism and the abandonment of organised government as a viable political goal. Yet in economics, capitalism is just such a leaderless anarchic system. Might a radically decentralised political system be more credible than we think? Or is centralised government necessary in politics if anything is to be achieved?  

Senior economic advisor at HSBC Stephen King, author of Bourgeois Dignity Deirdre McClosky and cofounder of Novara Media Aaron Bastani take anarchy seriously.

Yet the gap between the sound of a bell and its description is huge. Are the limits to language so profound that the big questions of science and philosophy are beyond us?
