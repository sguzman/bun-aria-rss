      <itunes:episode>392</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>Today we're not just telling a story, we're playing a game that will teach you how to tell stories of your own at home. Starsworn is a game we designed with Michael Low from Luck of Legends. Take on the role of heroes in a world of wonder! In Starsworn, kids and parents get the chance to build worlds, create heroes, and go on adventures together.




In today's episode Max Goodname and the gang arrive at the hidden conservatory for new Starsworn. They get to interact with some of the students, there's a feast in their honor, and they receive a new mission from the king himself!




if you want to play along at home, there’s a free story that’s different than the one in this episode, available to download at StoriesRPG.com.




And to check out all of Vindsvept’s music, head to youtube.com/vindsvept!




Special thanks to Nate, Emily, and Kelsie Lee, our producer Andrew Martin, our friend Vindsvept who wrote all the original music in the episode, and Michael Low, the designer of the Starsworn game with Daniel Hinds. Michael is a certified English teacher who runs online classes to help kids learn the joy of writing fiction by using story-telling games. If you’d like to hear your kids laugh, gasp in excitement, and write page after page of stories for the sheer joy of it, check out the classes on LuckOfLegends.com. Classes count for homeschool credit and come with Common Core aligned feedback on your child’s writing, speaking, and collaboration skills, so you can help them keep growing as they play!




Draw us a picture of what you think any of the characters in this story look like, and then tag us in it on instagram @storiespodcast! We'd love to see your artwork and share it on our feed!!

      <itunes:summary>Today we're not just telling a story, we're playing a game that will teach you how to tell stories of your own at home. Starsworn is a game we designed with Michael Low from Luck of Legends. Take on the role of heroes in a world of wonder! In Starsworn, kids and parents get the chance to build worlds, create heroes, and go on adventures together. Today's Max Goodname story will be told by playing this new game.

if you want to play along at home, there’s a free story that’s different than the one in this episode, available to download at StoriesRPG.com.

Special thanks to Nate, Emily, and Kelsie Lee, our producer Andrew Martin, our friend Vindsvept who wrote all the original music in the episode, and Michael Low, the designer of the Starsworn game with Daniel Hinds. Michael is a certified English teacher who runs online classes to help kids learn the joy of writing fiction by using story-telling games. If you’d like to hear your kids laugh, gasp in excitement, and write page after page of stories for the sheer joy of it, check out the classes on LuckOfLegends.com. Classes count for homeschool credit and come with Common Core aligned feedback on your child’s writing, speaking, and collaboration skills, so you can help them keep growing as they play!

And to check out all of Vindsvept’s music, head to youtube.com/vindsvept!

      <description>
        <![CDATA[It was late in the great halls of Asgard. The gods were sleeping...or at least, most of them were. Thor, God of Thunder, strongest warrior to ever walk on earth or in the heavens, was having an argument with Loki, god of fire, and cunning trickster. It had started off innocently enough, but Loki knew just how to get Thor angry. In fact, it was one of his favorite games. 
  “Sorry Thor, but you’re wrong. It is much better to be clever than it is strong.”

It's tough going, but she soon learns that the smallest towns can hold the biggest secrets.
