   <media:description>It's me hi, i'm the problem it's me. In this video essay we will explore the grey area between Good and Evil. I will dive deep into the dark philosophy behind American Psycho, Breaking Bad, The Joker, Avatar and take you on a tour through the minds of so called &quot;literally me&quot; characters like Walter White, The Joker, Bruce Wayne, Zuko, Donnie Darko and many many more. Why is it that these characters so popular nowadays? Is there maybe something inside of us that is craving to embody the dark side?

Swiss philosopher Carl Jung made the distinction between The Persona and The Shadow Self.
The persona being our outward face we present to the world. And the shadow, our darker side, often left untouched‚Ä¶

From Villains drinking milk ü•õ to the dangers of oranges üçä in The Godfather, in this video I will analyze the hidden meaning behind food in movies. Why do evil characters like Hans Landa and Homelander drink milk? How can food be used to give insight into a characters personality such as Calvin Candy in Django Unchained eating candy? And how can a certain type of food become a symbol of evil?

   <media:description>Fight club and American Psycho have been warning us, the idea of what it means to be a man is destabilizing in modern society. Recently a lot of characters have gained renewed interest among young men calling them &quot;literally me&quot;: Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, Ryan Gosling from Drive, Tyler Durden from Fight Club, Lou Bloom from Nightcrawler and ofcourse Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.
In this video essay we will dive deeper into the psyche of men in order to get a grip on why men find them so relatable and understand the so-called crisis of masculinity...

   <media:description>In this video essay we will be exploring and demistifying various types of strange, yet familiar looking places in movies and TV series. These 'unsetteling' places have gained a lot of popularity in recent years and became known as so called: &quot;Liminal Spaces&quot;. People have been sharing and discussing pictures of empty shopping malls, playgrounds and hotels all over the internet, but what makes these places so special? 
To try and find an answer to this question I decided to shine a new light on this subject by looking at it from the perspective of movies. I was suprised nobody had written about this or made a video on it already, so thats why I gathered a list of movies that feature various forms of liminality. I discovered that directors such as Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and David Lynch had mastered the art of liminal spaces, long before it became a thing. So let me show you how deep the rabbit hole goes...

   <media:description>Is Tyler The Creator going to make a movie one day? We'll let's find out! In this video essay I will be analyzing a lot of music videos and commercials from different stages of Tyler's career and putting them into a cinema historic context. Because if you look closely, there are references to movies such as The Grand Budapest Hotel, Call Me By Your Name and even older movies such as those of French Filmmaker Jean Luc-Godard. So let's dive into the cinematic world of Mr. Baudelaire, aka Tyler The Creator.

   <media:description>Upon watching season 2 of Euphoria it dawned on me that there are a lot of movie references in this show, but also references to musicvideos, popular series, TV shows and art. It made me wonder: Is Euphoria simply copying all these elements, or is there a hidden meaning behind it all? In this Video Essay I am analyzing and explaining the ideas behind these forms of symbolism to see how Euphoria is referring to popular culture. So let's find out why Good Artists copy and Great artists steal...
