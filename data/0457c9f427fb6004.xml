      <title>30 Ways to Use Lava to Incorporate a Boyfriend Into Your Toilet with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>Behold, Tik Tok judgement day is nigh! As the soiled masses scroll through prosaic videos of cats, choreography, and cleaning materials, do not pretend you are free from fear. When the end comes, it shall arrive with righteous wrath and fierce anger, darkening the sun, cloaking the moon, and causing the stars to fall from heaven. Tik Tok shall pass judgement upon you and all whom you know, causing the desolation of the land and crushing all social media sinners to dust. We have spoken! Let it be done.

      <title>Nothing Is More Terrifying Than Diane Lane Under the Tuscan Sun with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>The fog has settled in, surrounding the dark soulless condo nestled amongst the broken dreams and shattered souls of Hollywood. High above the urine-stained street, a lamp flickers dimly in a window. Faint shadows on the walls can be seen from below, giving only a tiny glimpse into the horrible monstrosities that dance within. Two hairless, beady-eyed incubi sit opposite each other, their bony claw-like hands holding microphones as they laugh and jest and mock humanity between ads for underwear and sex toys. The full moon breaks through the clouds as dusk finally arrives, causing the two vile creatures to transform into wigged, makeup-caked women, concealing their true demonic forms and allowing them to unleash a symphony of murder, mayhem, and dismemberment upon the fine citizens of Tinseltown. Lock your windows, bolt your doors, and draw the shades, because this Bald Halloween shall end in bloodshed...

      <title>We All Need a Necklace That Says “Winner” with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>After two years of wearing easy cheese-stained sweatpants and that vintage Cher 'Do You Believe?' tour t-shirt, it's time to re-visit your closet and break out those accessories. While dainty chains, layered strands, and zodiac trinkets have been en vogue this past summer, it's time to step out into the crisp, fall air with some bold bijoux that tells everyone around you, "I'm a Winner." Made from only the most affordable raw copper on the market, the "Winner" necklace is the must-have accessory as you sip your pumpkin spice latte and pleasure yourself in the park to the fiery foliage this autumn. While your parents, family, and teachers may have never said it, we here at Bald, LLC want you to know that in our humble opinion, you're the epitome of a winner.

        <![CDATA[<p>After two years of wearing easy cheese-stained sweatpants and that vintage Cher 'Do You Believe?' tour t-shirt, it's time to re-visit your closet and break out those accessories. While dainty chains, layered strands, and zodiac trinkets have been en vogue this past summer, it's time to step out into the crisp, fall air with some bold bijoux that tells everyone around you, "I'm a Winner." Made from only the most affordable raw copper on the market, the "Winner" necklace is the must-have accessory as you sip your pumpkin spice latte and pleasure yourself in the park to the fiery foliage this autumn. While your parents, family, and teachers may have never said it, we here at Bald, LLC want you to know that in our humble opinion, you're the epitome of a winner.</p><p>Download Karma Now: <a href="https://lpkarmanow.onelink.me/nSgX/TrixieandKatyayt">https://lpkarmanow.onelink.me/nSgX/TrixieandKatyayt</a></p><p>Watch the full Karma Now commercial: <a href="https://lpkarmanow.onelink.me/nSgX/TrixieandKatyawatch">https://lpkarmanow.onelink.me/nSgX/TrixieandKatyawatch</a></p><p>Cancel unnecessary subscriptions now with RocketMoney!

      <title>Live at Just For Laughs Toronto with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>Grab a piping hot mug of Tim Hortons, turn on the NHL, hide your Royal Canadian Mounted Police porn VHS, pour a shot of pure Canadian maple syrup, and bury your fat face in a pile of steaming poutine. The dolls have invaded the great white north for a live show at the Just For Laughs Festival in beautiful Toronto. Join us as we both marvel at their universal healthcare and mock them for their smorgasbord of crazy accents.
A special thank you to Duncan and all the staff &amp; crew at Just For Laughs Toronto and the beautiful Meridian Hall!

      <title>A Beginner's Guide to Comic Books, Butt Stuff, &amp; Homemade Limeade with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>We here at Bald Headquarters would like to use this week's episode to introduce our listeners to the mostly-unknown art form of comic books, the even more obscure phenomenon of superheroes, and the finer points of the opening of the rectum on the body's surface, colloquially known as "the anus". And while you're listening, please enjoy a wonderfully-refreshing early-Fall beverage recipe from our Myspace page: "Katya's Eat the Poor Limeade." A spoonful of sugar and a dash of love is all it takes to wash away the thoughts of the filthy proletariat.

      <title>Hell Hath No Fury Like a Cockroach Scorned with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>This sexy little minx was like nothing I'd ever seen before. Her legs, of which there were six, went on for days. The jelly in her prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax jiggled like a jar of freshly opened blackberry jam. There were so many segments in her abdomen that I couldn't decide which one to focus on as I salivated at the sight. I was lost in the ocean of her compound eyes, sitting just below her antennae that were themselves doing an age-old dance of seduction as she waddled across my floor. This little mama had the quick moves and the wings of an angel and she knew it.

      <title>Revisiting Glory Holes &amp; Catsup with Jeff Maccubbin &amp; Ron Hill</title>
      <description>As summer comes to a sweaty, malodorous end and you attempt to enjoy a few solitary moments of seasonal joy, take a minute to dry your swamp-ass in the air-conditioning, put on some clean underwear, and chill that special box of wine you've been saving for a special occasion. This week, we're revisiting an amazing chat with the co-editors of UNHhhh, Jeff Maccubbin &amp; Ronald Hill. Come join the girls and guys in the studio to talk about creative porn scenarios, soul-devouring rockabilly chicks, and the dirty secrets to UNHhhh's comedic brilliance. (hint: it involves dark magic, sacrifice, and doughnuts)

        <![CDATA[<p>As summer comes to a sweaty, malodorous end and you attempt to enjoy a few solitary moments of seasonal joy, take a minute to dry your swamp-ass in the air-conditioning, put on some clean underwear, and chill that special box of wine you've been saving for a special occasion. This week, we're revisiting an amazing chat with the co-editors of UNHhhh, Jeff Maccubbin &amp; Ronald Hill. Come join the girls and guys in the studio to talk about creative porn scenarios, soul-devouring rockabilly chicks, and the dirty secrets to UNHhhh's comedic brilliance. (hint: it involves dark magic, sacrifice, and doughnuts)</p><p><br></p><p>To check out UNHhhh, go to: <a href="https://bit.ly/UNHhhhYTPlaylist">https://bit.ly/UNHhhhYTPlaylist</a></p><p>Follow Jeff: @EvilJeff</p><p>Follow Ron: @ArtOfWot</p><p>Follow Trixie: @TrixieMattel</p><p>Follow Katya: @Katya_Zamo</p><ul>

      <title>TikTok Monkeys Saved My Life with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>The harvest moon shone bright in the Hollywood sky, illuminating the shattered dreams and stained casting couches below. I was back from tour and more tired than the plot of Morbius. As I settled in for a solitary evening of Netflicking and Green-Cheffing, I took a few too many puffs of the 'ol Green Unicorn Kush. As my mind raced and the synapses in my brain accelerated to the point of near-insanity, I retired to the safety of my bedroom, with only my iPhone in hand. As luck would have it, whilst researching monkey pox, my sausage fingers mistakenly typed in "Monkey Tok", whereby I was transported to a magical world of pet monkeys consuming grapes, bananas, and even watermelon. I was bathed in a level of cuteness that would make a teddy bear implode in a symphony of blood-soaked sweetness. 'Tis the world of Monkey TikTok, my friends, and it is a miracle salve for the many wounds that ail us.

      <title>Nobody's Snowballing in This Economy with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>In a world where one's public image is everything, we here at Bald, LLC would like to propose a different route: that of radical honesty. Have a small penis? Wear it like a tiny, proud badge. Hairy in all the wrong places? Include that despicable rat's nest in your nude pic. What we're trying to say is stop trying to be something you aren't, and live your life as the disgusting, disfigured, and completely unlovable quasi-human-being that you've always known yourself to be.

      <title>A Hot Masseuse Has Sex with Freddy Krueger with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>Do you find yourself frequently having dreams about a burned, disfigured man wearing a dirty red-and-green-striped sweater and brown fedora? In these dreams, does said man make pun-based jokes and threaten to kill you? Has your bed recently tried to eat you? If so, you may have unintentionally roused the ire of a certain "Mr. Frederick Krueger." While a horrific death may be in your future, we offer the following option: propose a mutually-agreed-upon sexual romp with Freddy in exchange for your soul. While an orifice or two may be extremely sore the next morning, it may just save your life.

      <title>A Heavy Pour &amp; Three Oscillating Fans with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>We here at Bald Headquarters, LLC are thrilled to announce our new collaboration with Fleügghendorfen Air Conditioners! Straight from a snow-drenched chalet in the Bavarian Alps comes Europe's oldest and most-respected HVAC specialist, Fleügghendorfen Air Conditioners. As Trixie deals with the vocal cords of an 80-year-old cigar smoker and Katya is finally on the road to recovery after quadruple hip-replacement surgery, the one thing that brings both of our esteemed hosts a respectable degree of bodily comfort is the cool, mountain air that can only emanate from a genuine Fleügghendorfen Air Conditioner. As they say in the Alps, Fleügghendorfen: for those hot and humid moments when a Scheisseberger simply won't do.

      <title>Sun-Dried Hot Dog Legs with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>Some of us have gams that appear as if they were sculpted by the gods themselves on the apex of Mount Olympus. Others, however, have legs that seem like they were dry-cured in the basement of a French farmhouse next to a beautifully-marbled Andouillette sausage. We'll let you decide if this episode is about the former or the latter.

      <title>Live from the Moontower Comedy Festival with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>To celebrate our 75th episode of the auditory smegma we call The Bald &amp; The Beautiful, we were planning on either making out with strangers underneath the 101 overpass or recording a live episode at the beautiful Paramount Theatre in Austin, TX as part of the Just for Laughs Moontower Comedy Festival. We opted for the latter. Enjoy the utter exquisiteness that is the next 60 minutes of your life, you disgusting heathens.
                      
Special Thanks to: Dustin S. and everyone at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, the Moontower Comedy Festival, &amp; Just For Laughs!

      <title>How to Properly Wash Your Genitals with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>As the Trixie and Katya grand tour exits the green, moist forests of the Pacific Northwest and meanders east towards the lumps and bulges of the Rocky Mountains, we check in with our favorite role models to learn about penile hygiene, flatus consumption, and how to make a real difference in this crazy thing we call life. If you aren't properly motivated to better yourself, spread love to others, and join a cult after this episode, then perhaps you should stop listening to this podcast.

      <title>Revisiting the Art of Dating: "Fisting is the New Kissing" with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>As the massive Trixie and Katya Tour starts its journey to a destination filled with tears, sweat, and a ton of dirty underwear, we revisit the low-stress times of 2021 where we gathered in a small studio to chat about Cheesecake Factory's Skinnylicious Menu, wigs in movies, and our unadulterated love of Panda Express's orange chicken. This episode begs the question, "Will Trixie and Katya survive a months-long live tour together?"

      <title>The Face Giveth and the Face Taketh Away with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>As the sun sets and twilight arrives, the ghosts of magic hour appear on the horizon. Your callused hands work furiously to finish attaching the buttons to a new pair of slacks that hide your tiny calves while simultaneously accentuating the hills and valleys where the boys reside. As you take a break to demand that the lotion be placed into the basket, you place your new face on top of your own, marveling at the gentle beauty and the exquisite cheekbones. Your breath is momentarily lost as you realize that you've been reborn, and my gawd do you look fabulous, honey.

      <title>Bald, Fat Silly Putty with Googly Eyes with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>As the sun rises over a stark, barren desert landscape, you open stained hotel blinds and squint your eyes as they adjust to the sudden brightness beyond the glass pane. You catch a slight whiff of your heinous morning breath, careless about its effect on others as it's been nine days since you last saw another human being. The difference between day and night has begun to blur, as time has ceased to exist. Has this Christopher Nolan movie been on for two hours? Four hours? Six hours? Does it even matter? At this point, dear friends, the pod is the pod.

        <![CDATA[<p>As the sun rises over a stark, barren desert landscape, you open stained hotel blinds and squint your eyes as they adjust to the sudden brightness beyond the glass pane. You catch a slight whiff of your heinous morning breath, careless about its effect on others as it's been nine days since you last saw another human being. The difference between day and night has begun to blur, as time has ceased to exist. Has this Christopher Nolan movie been on for two hours? Four hours? Six hours? Does it even matter? At this point, dear friends, the pod is the pod.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow Trixie: @TrixieMattel</p><p>Follow Katya: @Katya_Zamo</p><p><br></p><ul>

      <title>A Coat-Hanger Encased in a Hot Dog with Trixie and Katya and Matthew</title>
      <description>The steady advance of technology marches on, continuous and unceasing. In 1900, less than 10% of families owned a stove, a phone, or had electricity. Fast forward 122 years, and through the real-life miracles of latex, hair implants, and 3D scanning, sex dolls are ready to take their rightful place at the throne of humankind. Let us be the first to give a warm welcome to our squishy, clammy overlords.

      <title>Gorgeous Devours Cute with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>The low hum of The Macarena wafts into your one-bedroom apartment, the source of the 90s earworm a vague mystery. Dusk is slowly dawning on the other side of the thin, sun-rotted curtains. Murder She Wrote is just concluding on The Hallmark Channel as you turn off a dusty lamp and grab a chilled Ensure from your mostly-empty refrigerator. After your wig is safely ensconced on a styrofoam bust on the vanity, you struggle to open your blood-pressure pills with arthritic fingers made all the more slippery with freshly-applied Bengay. As you down the pills with the vanilla-infused protein shake, your tight hip-flexor muscles cause you to groan as you turn off the bedside lamp and pull up the tattered electric blanket you inherited from your Great Aunt Bertha. You stare at the crack on the ceiling above your bed, tracing its growing path towards the yellowed chandelier. You begin to slowly drift off into a fitful slumber. The last thought within your grey matter is a quiet rumination that has become your new mantra: "So this is a drag queen at 40"...

      <title>Building a Fake Hospital in Your House with Alexis Stone</title>
      <description>The sun is beginning to set behind a rusty white sign made of corrugated metal on top of a barren hill. A crisp breeze meanders through the "HOLLY", past the "WOOD", and down through the fetid streets of Tinseltown, carrying with it the scent of concealer, latex, sadness, and the sudden realization that Los Angeles is built upon an inherently-ridiculous foundation of misplaced hopes and dreams. It is within this setting that makeup artist, model, and visual chameleon Alexis Stone joins Trixie and Katya to talk about art, science, and precisely where the two meet.

      <title>Perfect Don't Need No Polish with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>As 2021 comes to a not-so-glorious close, let us reflect upon the things that matter most to us in a world filled with death, destruction, and chaos: reupholstered couches, scathing movie reviews, and the solemn act of cancelling otherwise-amazing New Years Eve plans in favor of binging TV whilst wearing a popcorn-dispensing hat. From all of us here at the Bald &amp; Beautiful headquarters, Happy New Years you filthy troglodytes. Believe it or not, we'll see you in 2022.

      <title>A 2014 Hyundai Elantra for Christmas with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>'Twas four days before Christmas, and all through the club, not a single bear was stirring, not even a cub. The fishnets were hung, by the faux fireplace with care, in the hopes that Trixie and Katya, would magically sprout thick, luscious hair. They were comfy and nestled, all snug in their beds, whilst questions of "Who would play her?" danced through their heads. When out on the boulevard, there arose such a clatter, it was their crazy neighbor Andre, dressed like the Mad Hatter. He yelled up to their window, "Hey Trixie! Hey Katya! Come down and let's party!" To which Trixie replied, "I can't! I had Taco Bell and now I'm a bit farty!" As Andre ran away, in a ketamine-fueled haze, Trixie and Katya turned to the camera and yelled, "To all the Bald &amp; Beautiful listeners, we wish you Happy F**king Holidays!"

      <title>Sniffin' for Coq Au Vin with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>The fragrant garland has been lovingly hung, a faint scent of Douglas fir is carried on the breeze, and a nip is clearly in the air. As the decorative gourds from Thanksgiving slowly decay in a rusty dumpster next to the backdoor of a shady Thai restaurant, it's impossible to ignore: the holiday season is upon us. And what better season than the winter solstice celebration to discuss the best local Sniffies stairwells &amp; parking garages, memorable visible p*nis lines, and the definition of "too famous for Grindr". Hang your nylon stockings, suck on that cinnamon stick, and mull that wine you filthy b*tches, because here's another amazing episode to bring you tidings of sickeningly good cheer.

      <title>A Baby in an Asbestos Bag with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>The city is silent. The streets are empty. As a grizzled gay ghoul sits alone in a dimly-lit apartment, his belly warmed from a 12-year-old Scotch, he looks down at his crotch. It might be the booze or that ill-advised 2am bean burrito, but his little friend down south begins speaking. He strains his ears to hear what the little guy is saying: "Come closer. Put on some headphones. Henceforth, you will be known as DJ Crypto Meth."

      <itunes:summary>The city is silent. The streets are empty. As a grizzled gay ghoul sits alone in a dimly-lit apartment, his belly warmed from a 12-year-old Scotch, he looks down at his crotch. It might be the booze or that ill-advised 2am bean burrito, but his little friend down south begins speaking. He strains his ears to hear what the little guy is saying: "Come closer. Put on some headphones. Henceforth, you will be known as DJ Crypto Meth."

      <title>Revisiting the Comedic Genius of Macy Rodman</title>
      <description>As Fall finally arrives and brings with it the deaths of millions upon millions of poor, innocent leaves, let's take a moment to reflect on the comedic genius that is Macy Rodamn's Caitlyn Jenner impersonation. As the Bald creative team puts the finishing touches on the next great American novel, we revisit the time that artist, singer, actor, and IGTV Hall of Famer Macy Rodman joined the girls in the studio to discuss her Caitlyn Jenner Impersonation, Lana Del Rey-fueled Twitter Mobs, and the absolute insanity of Wendy Williams. This one was all over the place topic-wise, but it's not about the destination. It's about the journey, folks.

      <title>Hell Hath No Fury Like Teenage Twitter with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>From the lows of making an unfortunate calendar-based Twitter faux pas to the highs of a stupendous, scintillating, splendiferous Violet Chachki performance, today's episode is a shining beacon of light upon a hilltop surround by the dreck that is the contemporary podcast oeuvre. Put down that dollar-store frozen burrito, slap on some deodorant, and try to pretend that you're a civilized human being for forty-five minutes instead of a rancid sack of flesh and hair. Also, Happy Labor Day, you heathens.

      <description>Put some extra ice in that Arnold Palmer, unwrap a refreshing York Peppermint Patty, and crank up that air conditioning, you sweaty hogs. Rejoice as we celebrate the swamp-ass-laden zenith of summer! Amidst crappy news of hurricanes and political turmoil, we take a fantastical trip down memory lane to discuss disco music, swimming pool self-abuse, gift-giving etiquette, and the sheer brilliance of 90's music videos.

      <title>Faux Bangs &amp; Straight-Man Dungarees with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>It was a day like any other in Southern California; the sun shining and birds singing whilst one queen man-spreads on a couch in stone-washed jeans and another queen sits on a chair with frosted faux bangs and a creepy silk shirt featuring disembodied doll parts. In other words, 'twas a typical day in the life of the fabulously-famous multi-hyphenates Trixie Mattel and Katya Zamo. We could tease you with little juicy tidbits from their conversation about eating pop-rocks edibles, taking VIP showers, and smoking cigars like men do, but we would never dream of doing that.

      <title>Revisiting our Very First Episode with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>As Katya undergoes the world's first experimental belly button-bleaching surgery in the mountains of Tanzania and Trixie puts the finishing touches on her long-gestating Alf biography, the girls are blessing your ears with a much-needed revisiting of their ground-breaking, laughter-inducing, bladder-destroying first episode of the podcast. That's right, folks. This is where it all started. Or ended, depending upon how you feel about the show.  So find a spot on your couch that isn't stained with fluorescent yellow nacho cheese, and pop open a Bartles &amp; Jaymes wine cooler for 50-ish minutes of pure auditory ecstasy.

        <![CDATA[<p>As Katya undergoes the world's first experimental belly button-bleaching surgery in the mountains of Tanzania and Trixie puts the finishing touches on her long-gestating Alf biography, the girls are blessing your ears with a much-needed revisiting of their ground-breaking, laughter-inducing, bladder-destroying first episode of the podcast. That's right, folks. This is where it all started. Or ended, depending upon how you feel about the show.  So find a spot on your couch that isn't stained with fluorescent yellow nacho cheese, and pop open a Bartles &amp; Jaymes wine cooler for 50-ish minutes of pure auditory ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow Trixie: @TrixieMattel</p><p>Follow Katya: @Katya_Zamo</p><p><br></p><ul>

      <title>A Cat Litter Retreat in Mexico with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>Fresh off an insane trip to Mexico for the kitty litter party of all kitty litter parties, Katya regales us with tales of hallucinations where she had an in-depth conversation about Franklin Delano Roosevelt's economics polices with a purple frog whilst on the deck of the Titanic. (in reality, she threw up a bunch after taking some psychedelics, but the purple frog/FDR story sounds amazing, right?) From a physical rebirth south of the border to Madonna's greatest acting performance to the joys of a shorn a**hole, today's episode is, quite simply, marvelous. Enjoy.

      <title>Dreaming About Being a Sumo Wrestler with Katya &amp; Katya's "Mom"</title>
      <description>Part 2 of our special Mother's Day Bald and the Beautiful Extravaganza continues as we welcome Katya's Mom to the podcast! After recovering from the only known case of COVID hemorrhoids, she is fresh out of acute posterior rehab and ready to talk about Katya's placenta, her tragic deli-based skull injuries as an infant, and the actual legal name she was given at birth. This episode is touching. It's confusing. It's kinda gross. In other words, it's a microcosm of genuine motherly love.

      <title>A Can of Beans in the Dishwasher with Trixie &amp; Trixie's Mom</title>
      <description>As part of our special Mother's Day Bald and the Beautiful Extravaganza, we are so excited to welcome Trixie's Mom to the show. Folks, this is like a Jerry Springer episode on steroids. We're talking extreme drug addiction, baby mamas, aliens, cults, and secret second families in Canada. In all honesty, Trixie and her Mom both led shockingly well-adjusted lives and love each other very much. But they do talk about edibles, familial drama, and Trixie's Mom getting hit on whilst in drag. So it's not all rainbows and ponies, people. (but it is very touching at times, which is disgusting)

      <title>Heaven is an Orange Julius with Trixie and Katya</title>
      <description>From advice on locating your ferociously fierce inner diva to an erudite debate on the existence of an afterlife to a deep-dive on Michael Shannon's private parts, this episode is without a doubt the best podcast episode in the history of recorded sound. Lastly, if you don't agree with this ridiculously hyperbolic statement, you're likely going to a version of hell where you have to sit in a room and smell a burnt onion recipe for eternity.
