  <title>The wild world of credit models</title>
  <description>The Covid-19 pandemic has induced a kind of schizophrenia in loan-loss models. When the pandemic hit, banks overprovisioned for credit losses on the assumption that the economy would head south. But when government stimulus packages put wads of cash in the hands of consumers and businesses, the models changed course, leading banks to release reserves back into the income statement. This year, the models have shifted yet again as the stimulus programmes wind down and banks assess the impact on borrowers</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/risk-management/credit-risk/7899221/the-wild-world-of-credit-models</link>

  <title>Loan classification under IFRS 9</title>
  <description>IFRS 9 requires classifying non-defaulted loans in two stages depending on their credit quality evolution since initial recognition by the bank. In this paper, Vivien Brunel proposes an optimal way to perform this classification. Target values of some key performance indicators of the provisioning model emerge from the implementation of this process. In particular he computes the target value of the stage 2 ‘hit rate’ and the size of the stage 2 portfolio</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/risk-management/credit-risk/2456385/loan-classification-under-ifrs-9</link>

  <description>Fabio Mercurio and Minqiang Li investigate credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) in the presence of wrong-way risk by introducing jumps at default to model the correlation between counterparty default and relevant risk factors. Efficient approximations based on CVA formulas with the independence assumption are presented, and numerical examples for a cross-currency swap and a vanilla interest rate swap are showcased</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/risk-management/credit-risk/2433221/jumping-default-wrong-way-risk-modelling-cva</link>

  <title>FVA for general instruments</title>
  <description>Computing the funding valuation adjustment (FVA) is hard, as it requires the numerical solution of generally non-linear partial differential equations. In this paper, Alexander Antonov, Marco Bianchetti and Ion Mihai develop a universal and efficient approach to numerical FVA calculation for portfolios of general instruments with multiple stochastic assets and funding sources</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/risk-management/credit-risk/2433133/fva-general-instruments</link>

  <title>Wrong-way risk done right</title>
  <description>Here, Jacky Lee and Luca Capriotti present an arbitrage-free valuation framework for the counterparty exposure of credit derivatives portfolios. The method is able to consistently capture the effects of credit spread volatility and credit correlations. By introducing fast semi-analytical approximations, they demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to handle large portfolios of credit default swaps under financially realistic models of default intensities</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/risk-management/credit-risk/2423281/wrong-way-risk-done-right</link>

  <title>Warehousing credit risk: pricing, capital and tax</title>
  <description>Warehousing of credit risk increases capital requirements and influences profit and loss. Profits are taxable and losses provide tax credits. Here, Chris Kenyon and Andrew Green extend the semi-replication approach of Burgard and Kjaer to formalise credit risk warehousing effects on pricing, including capital, and tax adjustments</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/risk-management/credit-risk/2393453/warehousing-credit-risk-pricing-capital-and-tax</link>

  <title>CCPs confront the difficult maths of default management</title>
  <description>When a member of a clearing house goes down, surviving banks send some of their coolest heads to help run the default management process. It worked well when Lehman Brothers collapsed, but there are more CCPs today, and they all have the same set of members.

  <title>Path-consistent wrong-way risk</title>
  <description>In this paper, Klaus Böcker and Michael Brunnbauer define a general copula wrong-way risk (WWR) model and show how different copulas affect results such as potential future exposure and credit valuation adjustment figures. They present a very general model that respects the pathwise structure of future exposure and reconciles different existing models under the same framework</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/risk-management/credit-risk/2377913/path-consistent-wrong-way-risk</link>

  <title>Credit exposure models backtesting for Basel III</title>
  <description>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has introduced strict regulatory guidance on how to validate and backtest internal model methods for credit exposure. Fabrizio Anfuso, Dimitrios Karyampas and Andreas Nawroth incorporate these
guidelines into a comprehensive statistical backtesting framework based on four pillars: risk factors, correlation, portfolio backtesting and capital buffer computation</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/risk-management/credit-risk/2362332/credit-exposure-models-backtesting-basel-iii</link>
