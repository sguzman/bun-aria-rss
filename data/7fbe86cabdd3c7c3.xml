      <title>Introducing - How to Build a Metaverse</title>
      <description>We’re in a metaverse déjà vu moment. Companies are spending billions of dollars creating new metaverses, imagining a 3D virtual future. But there’s a metaverse that’s already been around for decades. In this world, people have started businesses, built homes and fallen in love as avatars.

In a new four-part series from The Journal, producer Annie Minoff heads back into that largely forgotten metaverse – Second Life – to tell the story of the metaverse we already have and what it can reveal about the one that’s coming.

Start listening to How to Build a Metaverse on Friday, September 23.

      <title>Hack Me If You Can, Part 1: The Making of a Russian Hacker</title>
      <description>In more than 20 years of reporting on cybercrime, Wall Street Journal reporter Robert McMillan has never come face-to-face with a criminal hacker. Until he met Dmitry Smilyanets.

      <title>Hack Me If You Can, Part 3: The Infiltrator</title>

Increasingly, hackers are targeting public institutions and infrastructure, putting many Americans at risk. It’s now Dmitry’s job to help stop them.

      <itunes:summary>After his arrest in Amsterdam, the threat of a decades-long prison sentence loomed over Dmitry. If he cooperated with American prosecutors, he could lower his sentence. But he’d have to betray his hacking collaborator and best friend, Vladimir Drinkman.

Dmitry takes the deal and starts working with the U.S. government while he serves his time. And in the years since, Dmitry has had a new vantage point to watch the evolving threat hackers pose. Increasingly, hackers are targeting public institutions and infrastructure, putting many Americans at risk. It’s now Dmitry’s job to help stop them.

      <title>Introducing: Hack Me If You Can</title>
      <description>Wall Street Journal reporter Robert McMillan has spent years trying to find a Russian hacker who would tell him their story. And then, he met Dmitry Smilyanets, the man who managed one of the most notorious hacking teams to come out of Russia. 



Dmitry’s story is the story of how a generation of hackers grew up in Russia. It follows the dramatic game of cat and mouse that America plays trying to catch cyber criminals like Dmitry. And in Dmitry’s case, it ends with him facing a choice: go to prison for decades, or help the U.S. government stop hackers like himself. 



This is a new series from the Journal - Hack Me If You Can – the story of a Russian cyber criminal who went to the other side. All episodes out June 10th.

      <description>In the third episode of our investigative series based on an extensive array of internal Facebook documents, we look at a persistent problem on the platform: human trafficking.

The documents also show Facebook's response to these findings, which is often inadequate or nothing at all. We also hear from Patricia Wanja Kimani, a Kenyan woman who was trafficked to Saudi Arabia after responding to a job post on Facebook.
