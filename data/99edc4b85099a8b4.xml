      <description>In this episode, Stephen A., Dan Orlovsky, and Damien Woody discuss the primetime matchup between the Eagles and Cowboys and debate who needs to show out the most for their team to get the dub: Hurts or Parsons?

      <title>Hour 1: Rush Hour</title>
      <description>In this episode, Stephen A., Keyshawn Johnson, and Jeff Saturday discuss the Chiefs-Raiders MNF matchup and debate the merits of the controversial playcall by McDaniels to go for (and fail) a 2-pt conversion rather than a game-tying extra point. The Raiders blew a 17-point lead to Kansas City, but do our guys think the Raiders had an epic collapse or the Chiefs mounted an impressive comeback? The crew reacts to another roughing the passer call in last night's game and debates whether or not the officials have gone too far on this one. Plus, Davante Adams was visibly upset after last night's loss and pushed an employee out of his way en route to the locker room. Should he face discipline for his outburst? Cooper Rush is 5-0 as a starter for the Cowboys, but does the crew think he can take Dak's job in Dallas?

Plus, what is Mad Dog mad about?? He hashes out all his grudges in a fired up new segment with Stephen A. Broncos coach Nathaniel Hackett admits he was wrong to go for the field goal in the Broncos crushing Week 1 loss to the Seahawks, but is he the only one at fault or is there plenty of blame to go around? Mad Dog gives us his top 5 underdogs to watch in NFL Week 2. The Las Vegas Aces took a 2-0 lead over the Connecticut Sun in the WNBA Finals and are one win away from their first franchise win. But does Stephen A. think they can make it a clean sweep?

As Tom Brady's 45th birthday looms, the crew debates how long he'll keep playing and the chances that Aaron Rodgers will call it a career before him. Also, in the wake of Lamar Jackson's recent Twitter clapbacks, Domonique and Mad Dog argue if he's the most unfairly criticized athlete in sports today. Brian Windhorst is back to talk about the NBA's load management issue. Mad Dog gives us his all-time top 5 NFL uniforms, but does he have them right? And, the crew decides which event is more exciting: the Home Run Derby or the Slam Dunk Contest.
