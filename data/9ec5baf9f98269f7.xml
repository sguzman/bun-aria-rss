Mark is an independent hands-on software architect, with 20 of his 30 years of experience in the industry playing some type of architecture role on a myriad of different software projects. He is the author of several books including Java Message Service, 2nd Edition, and is featured in the book 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know. In addition to that he is a frequent speaker on the conference circuit (which is how we met), and gives various extremely popular software architecture trainings around the world.

In this episode we discuss his keynote from the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in London, which took place in October 2016.</itunes:summary>

In 2014 he received the Dahl-Nygaard Junior Award for his work on modeling and visualization of evolution and interplay of large numbers of objects.

He leads the work on the Moose platform for software and data analysis, he initiated the work on the Glamorous Toolkit project for reinventing the software development environments, and he is a board member of the Pharo programming language and environment. He also authored the humane assessment method for making software engineering decisions, and the demo-driven approach to embedding design thinking in software development.</itunes:summary>
