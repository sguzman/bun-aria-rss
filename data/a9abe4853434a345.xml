<li>Several listeners write in about Christmas gifts and Quidditch rules</li>
<li>Why doesn’t Hermione use her own wand to stop the troll? </li>
<li>Why did Hagrid <em>really</em> go to get Harry from the Dursleys?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This week the hosts are joined by Andy of Harry Potter Fan Zone, and Chapter by Chapter continues with chapters 13 and 14 of Sorcerer's Stone. Listen as we discuss the real-life origins of Nicolas Flamel, debate whether 'Sorcerer's Stone' or 'Philosopher's Stone' is a better title, and revisit a fan theory about what Dumbledore did with alchemy. Then, the trio visit Hagrid's Hut and Harry uses his powers of persuasion that he may or may not have inherited from Voldemort?! All this and more, including:<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Welcome back, Andy! Check out <a href="https://www.harrypotterfanzone.com/">Harry Potter Fan Zone</a>, the top Australian HP fan site.</li>
<li>News: Many new books are now available including Tom Felton's autobiography, Alan Rickman's posthumous diary, and Order of the Phoenix illustrated by Jim Kay. The hosts discuss which ones they'll be checking out.</li>
<li>Main Discussion #1: Sorcerer's Stone, Chapter 13: Nicolas Flamel</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Secrets are revealed when chocolate is eaten.</li>
<li>We never did find out what work Dumbledore and Nicolas did on alchemy. Did <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> reveal more?</li>
<li>We review an old fan theory that we love about Credence's origins.</li>
<li>In talking about the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone, Andrew explains who was responsible for the title change.</li>
<li>Which is better, saying "Sorcerer's Stone" (snappy, alliterative) or "Philosopher's Stone" (boring)? Andy and the American hosts all debate.</li>
<li>The hosts review some early Mary GrandPré artwork including an alternate cover that Andy shares with the title "Harry Potter and the School of Magic".</li>
<li>In fact, Harry Potter Fan Zone has the <a href="https://www.harrypotterfanzone.com/book-1/">most impressive gallery</a> of official artwork, exhaustingly sourced and categorized by Andy. Worth your time to check out!</li>
<li>Main Discussion #2: Sorcerer's Stone, Chapter 14: Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Hagrid reveals illegal practices inside his hut</li>
<li>This rare chapter is, in many ways, completely self-contained. The conflict presented is resolved at the end.</li>
<li>Life lessons from HP #???: Flattery will get you ev-erywhere!</li>
<li>Andrew's new proposal of an HBO Max television show features Hagrid and his pet dragon. We're in love.</li>
<li>Hagrid clearly has a soft spot for clearly dangerous creatures. Is this intentional foreshadowing to his plotline in Chamber of Secrets?</li>
<li>Is it reckless for Ron not to be honest with Madame Pomfrey about his bite? What if it's magically infected?</li>
<li>The scene with Charlie's friends is unspoilt by adaptation. What do we see when we see it in our heads?</li>
<li>We close out the chapter with our MVPs of the Week</li>
<li>Next Week: It's a MuggleMail episode! Send us your thoughts on our recent chapters or tell us what's on your mind!</li>
<li>Quizzitch: Which real-life Wizard Rock artist wrote a classic spurned love ballad titled "1991 - Charlie Weasley"</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode, we pay tribute to Robbie Coltrane, whose iconic role as Rubeus Hagrid made him beloved to costars and fans alike. Chapter-by-Chapter continues as we take flight with Harry in his first Quidditch match and explore the halls of Hogwarts beneath the Invisibility Cloak.<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>We remember Robbie Coltrane, the beloved actor who played Hagrid in the Harry Potter series</li>
<li>Main Discussion #1: Sorcerer’s Stone, Chapter 11: Quidditch</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Gryffindor surprises Hogwarts with winning very tastily </li>
<li>Why does Snape choose to confide in Filch after being attacked by Fluffy? Why does he not go to Madam Pomfrey? Or heal himself?</li>
<li>What is going through Snape's mind when Harry sees him in this vulnerable situation?</li>
<li>Does Professor Quirrell’s attack on Harry during the Quidditch match do Quirrell more harm (for him) than good?</li>
<li>Security Nightmare: Why are there not more protections in place during Quidditch matches?</li>
<li>Main Discussion #2: Sorcerer’s Stone, Chapter 12: The Mirror of Erised</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Dumbledore gives Harry some advice about life</li>
<li>The hosts rank Harry's Christmas gifts from best to worst, using math</li>
<li>How does <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-mirror-of-erised">this new information</a> on The Mirror of Erised influence our thoughts on the magical device?</li>
<li>We discuss Harry’s (reckless) tendency of using gifts from anonymous sources</li>
<li>Laura connects the threads between several Mirror of Erised and Resurrection Stone passages</li>
<li>Why is Nicolas Flamel not more well-known?</li>
<li>Who did the hosts select as their Most Valuable Character/Chapter of the Week?</li>
<li>Next week: Chapter-By-Chapter continues for Sorcerer’s Stone with Chapters 13 and 14!</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>There are certain things you can't do without becoming best friends, and podcasting about Harry Potter together is one of them! Chapter-by-Chapter returns with analysis of Sorcerer's Stone's "The Midnight Duel" and "Halloween"! Our trio of heroes get goaded by Malfoy into a trap, and then accidentally lock a troll in a bathroom. Harry also finds the one thing that he is naturally good at. <br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>News: Jim Kay <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/a-celebration-of-jim-kay">has announced</a> he will be stepping down from making the illustrated edition <em>Potter</em> books. We thank him for his work.</li>
<li>Main Discussion #1: Sorcerer's Stone, Chapter 9: The Midnight Duel</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Draco challenges Harry to a Midnight Fakeout</li>
<li>After Neville's injury, the students leap to his defense. Have the hosts had similar moments at school, or were we all too scared to speak up?</li>
<li>In what is clearly another security nightmare, Madame Hooch abandons her class of 11-year-olds who 5 minutes ago were handed a very fast and dangerous broomstick for each of them. No wonder something bad happens next!</li>
<li>Laura asks what (specifically) makes Harry a natural at flying? Maybe abuse from Dudley made his reflexes better?</li>
<li>How blatant is what McGonagall does 'favoritism' toward Gryffindor House, and why does the First Years rule exist to begin with?</li>
<li>After narrowly avoiding trouble during the day, Harry and Ron immediately go wandering the castle at night. Shouldn't they be more careful?</li>
<li>Should Harry have known that Malfoy was planning a trap? How does Malfoy have an inside line to Filch?</li>
<li>Did NOBODY walk Neville home from the hospital wing to make sure he could get in the Common Room?</li>
<li>Fluffy's origins and comments on the movie adaptation are covered in 'Odds and Ends'</li>
<li>Main Discussion #2: Sorcerer's Stone, Chapter 10: Halloween</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Dinner is interrupted by a massive disturbance </li>
<li>Major things almost always happen to Harry on Halloween. Micah recounts some of the big ones.</li>
<li>Are Ron's choice of words against Hermione a bit too much?</li>
<li>It is Hermione's pronunciation advice which helps Ron successfully tackle the troll!</li>
<li>Have any of the hosts befriended people they were not expecting to like?</li>
<li>Examining Hermione's motivations to lie, the act which solidifies her friendship with Harry and Ron.</li>
<li>HOW is it that Quirrell is not caught or at least hugely suspected for letting in the troll? Should Voldemort have used someone else instead?</li>
<li>The students of Hogwarts do not seem to dress up for Halloween, but if they DID, Andrew has ideas as to what they would be.</li>
<li>Harry and the Golden Snitch meet for the first time. Our hearts are all aflutter</li>
<li>If McGonagall had not discovered Harry's talent during the first flying lesson, when would there be another chance?</li>
<li>Next Week: Chapter-By-Chapter for Sorcerer's Stone, Chapters 11 and 12!</li>
<li>Quizzitch: In Chapter 9 of Book 1, Which secret passage out of Hogwarts do the Weasley Twins suspect Lee Jordan has found?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode, we are joined by <em>Potter</em> film actor and director Rohan Gotobed! He joins Andrew, Eric, Laura, and Micah as they continue their Chapter-by-Chapter readthrough of Sorcerer's Stone, covering Chapters 7 and 8! Harry is sorted into Gryffindor House, and learns that Snape really hates him!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to the show, film and theater actor Rohan Gotobed, who you might recognize from playing Young Sirius Black in DH2!</li>
<li>Main Discussion #1: Sorcerer's Stone, Chapter 7: The Sorting Hat</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Students arrive into the Great Hall nervously</li>
<li>Is the Sorting Ceremony too much pressure for First Years? Should there be something easier or a private ceremony?</li>
<li>Why is the hat kept a secret from all students and possibly not even mentioned in <em>Hogwarts, a History</em>? We know Hermione checked...</li>
<li>Americans struggle with British terms example 4,723, as McGonagall tells the students to 'smarten themselves up.'</li>
<li>New Segment Alert: The hosts play "MAX That!" bringing an element from the chapter to life as a new <em>Harry Potter</em> streaming series</li>
<li>Harry has a dream that the hosts find to be VERY illuminating.</li>
<li>Was it right for Seamus' mom to keep her magical secret from his dad?</li>
<li>Rohan pays tribute to all of Harry's peers who made it to the Sorting Ceremony but were never seen again...</li>
<li>Main Discussion #2: Sorcerer's Stone, Chapter 8: The Potions Master</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Eagerly Harry begins classes with angry teacher </li>
<li>What were our first impressions of McGonagall, Sprout, Flitwick and Snape?</li>
<li>New Segment: Mini Origin, where we dive into the name Quirinus and Quirrell in an effort to understand him better.</li>
<li>Snape speaks of potions very romantically, but is he overcompensating for the lost romance of Harry's mom?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This week on MuggleCast we bring back the most heavily listener-requested segment, Chapter by Chapter! Join Andrew, Eric, Laura and Micah as they begin Sorcerer's / Philosopher's Stone with Chapters 1, 2 and 3! Our read-through of the <em>Potter</em> series contains segments both old AND new (complete with sound effects) and the hosts are all much older now than when they first started more than 16 years ago!<br>
<br>
On this week's episode:<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Chapter by Chapter is rebooted! We first started the segment March 19, 2006 <a href="https://mugglecast.com/episode-31/">on Episode 31</a> (transcript <a href="https://mugglecast.com/transcript-031/">here</a>).</li>
<li>What to expect from CbyC includes: 7 Word Summaries, the same (but older) hosts, and brand new segments and games.</li>
<li>Main Discussion Part 1: Sorcerer's Stone Chapter One, "The Boy Who Lived."</li>
<li>7 Word Summary: Vernon thinks that people are behaving oddly</li>
<li>Eric asks, "What are the wizards and witches thinking?! The Statute of Secrecy is at stake here!"</li>
<li>Laura makes an excellent point about what humans do after being cooped up and being afraid for long.</li>
<li>Was it safe for Dumbledore to leave Harry unattended on a doorstep overnight?</li>
<li>Despite the magical protection, we ask, WERE the Dursleys the best option for Dumbledore to choose? Why didn't Albus raise Harry himself?</li>
<li>Main Discussion Part 2: Chapter Two, "The Vanishing Glass."</li>
<li>7 Word Summary: Dudley can’t understand why he sucks badly</li>
<li>Having read the whole series, how do we account for the magic that Harry did when he was young?</li>
<li>Where exactly did the "Vanished" glass go? In the book, it is not put back.</li>
<li>Would the zoo be able to stay in business after such an incident?</li>
<li>The hosts get depressed about the Dursleys' abuse of Harry, which hits differently now!</li>
<li>Main Discussion Part 3: Chapter Three, "The Letters From No One."</li>
<li>7 Word Summary: Chaos awaits the Dursleys everywhere and above</li>
<li>How is it exactly that the letters change addresses for Harry? Is Vernon right, and are the Dursleys being watched?</li>
<li>Why don't Petunia and Vernon just tell Harry who/what he is? Why are they SO resistant?</li>
<li>The hosts play <em>What If?</em> regarding Harry opening his Hogwarts letter while in the foyer.</li>
<li>Most Valuable Chapter/Character of the Week returns</li>
<li>Next week's Quizzitch question: Who are the four known members of Dudley’s Gang, from Chapter 3 of Book 1?</li>
<li>On next week's episode: Chapters 4-6 of Harry Potter Book One</li>
<li>This week's episode is brought to you by Indeed (Go to <a href="https://www.indeed.com/mugglecast">Indeed.com/mugglecast</a> to start hiring now), BetterHelp (Go to <a href="https://betterhelp.com/mugglecast">BetterHelp.com/mugglecast</a> and get 10% off your first month), and MeUndies (Go to <a href="https://www.meundies.com/mugglecast">MeUndies.com/mugglecast</a> for 20% off your first order)</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode, the subject of many a late night with Laura and her boyfriend is made into a main discussion for MuggleCast as the hosts and Marc talk through the physics of <em>Harry Potter</em>! Surely magical objects don't come from 'nowhere,' and there must be a magical cost for doing magic somehow? Those big questions and more are our target as Andrew, Eric, Laura, Micah and Marc put on their thinking caps and dive in!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to this week's special guest, Laura's boyfriend Marc!</li>
<li>Marc is a game designer with a passion for physics.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://twitter.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/1562143964702146561">new trailer for <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></a> has debuted, and we now know what all versions of the game will cost us. You might need to break into Gringotts to be able to afford the Collectors Edition!?</li>
<li>Main Discussion: The physics of Harry Potter</li>
<li>Just what is 'physics' and what answers does the study of physics seek to find?</li>
<li>In the Wizarding World, is there a cost for doing magic? What kind of magic seems limitless, and what kind does not?</li>
<li>Where does magical ability come from and how does it work?</li>
<li>Are new magical spells created, or discovered?</li>
<li>Next the MuggleCasters ask: where does the food come from, and where does your sh** go?</li>
<li>What do our known laws (such as conservation of mass) have in common with Gamp's known laws of Elemental Transfiguration? We go point by point.</li>
<li>Does the Vanishing Charm break down an object's atoms, or teleport it to a different dimension?</li>
<li>In this week's Bonus MuggleCast available <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mugglecast/">exclusively to Patrons</a>, the hosts examine the physics of some magical objects including Invisibility Cloaks, Time Turners and Dumbledore's Deluminator.</li>
<li>Quizzitch: In Year 4, What does Ron smush in anger after Draco taunts him about having inside-Ministry information regarding the TriWizard Tournament?</li>
<li>Next week's episode: The hosts are building their own Hogwarts lesson! Come prepared for lectures and a pop quiz!</li>
<li>This week's episode is brought to you by Backbone! Go to <a href="https://www.PlayBackbone.com/mugglecast">PlayBackbone.com/mugglecast</a> NOW to order your Backbone. For a limited <br>
time, and get FREE access to over 350 console games and perks.</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode, we’ll be continuing our conversation that began in <a href="https://mugglecast.com/episode-568-indefensible-characters-in-harry-potter-and-how-to-understand-them/">Episode 568</a>, where we argued in defense of some of the most controversial, least favorite, most complicated characters in Harry Potter. There were plenty of characters we didn’t get to last time, so it’s time for Round 2!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Welcome back, Pat!</li>

<li>Main Discussion: Indefensible Characters in Harry Potter, Round 2</li>
<li>What did Lucius Malfoy, Mundungus Fletcher, Horace Slughorn and Merope Gaunt do to put themselves in our cross-hairs?</li>
<li>What characters do we love to hate? Professor Binns, Vernon Dursley and Cornelius Fudge make the cut!</li>
<li>Can the hosts actually defend the indefensible? We try our best with Narcissa Malfoy and Barty Crouch Jr.</li>
<li>New game alert: One Gotta Go</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Inspired by a popular Reddit thread, this week's episode asks the question: what was something that a 'good' character from the <em>Harry Potter</em> series did which rubbed us the wrong way? Are characters like Molly Weasley or Remus Lupin above reproach? You may find yourself nodding along with Andrew, Eric, Micah and special guest Chloé as they detail just what these supposed 'heroes' of the series did to get on our nerves!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>As we announced last week, Chapter By Chapter will be returning soon with Book One! Now that we are all grown-up. Look for it in September!</li>
<li>Our hosts have recently appeared on each other's other podcasts, including Eric <a href="https://millennialshow.com/episode-8x27-time-to-be-real-who-will-run-for-president-2024/">appearing on #Millennial</a>, and Micah appearing on <a href="https://thankyouforspieling.libsyn.com/">Thank You for Spieling</a>!</li>
<li>This week's main discussion was inspired by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/vqehko/what_did_a_character_that_is_considered_good_do/">this great Reddit thread</a>. Shout-out to Pamela G.'s brother for suggesting!</li>
<li>Each host picks a supposedly 'good' <em>Harry Potter</em> character and lists their most heinous offenses.</li>
<li>Molly Wealsey may be the motherly type, but her love is not evenly spread. What did Hermione or Fleur ever do to receive her ire?</li>
<li>Albus Dumbledore may be the series' biggest 'good guy' after Harry, but his reckless endangerment of students via his choices for DADA staffers are preposterous.</li>
<li>Remus Lupin was our <em>very favorite</em> teacher, but when it comes to being a dad or a romantic partner, his skills are somewhat lacking.</li>
<li>Hermione's activism might win her some points, but she's much colder to anything that is somebody else's idea. Especially if she hasn't read about it in a book!</li>
<li>Consulting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/vqehko/what_did_a_character_that_is_considered_good_do/">the Reddit thread</a>, the MuggleCast hosts pick a few more of their favorite examples.</li>
<li>Why did EVERY adult let Ron use his broken and unsafe wand? Did Dobby go too far when stopping Harry's mail? Did the Weasley Twins go too far trying their products on students?</li>
<li>August's Bonus MuggleCast will cover personal secrets from the hosts' early days podcasting and working on the Web. The latest Trelawney Tea Edition will be available exclusively <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mugglecast/">via our Patreon</a>.</li>
<li>Quizzitch: in book canon, what color hair does Firenze have?</li>

<li>The <em>Secrets of Dumbledore</em> screenplay offers some very tiny moments that did not make it to the movie, but no deleted scenes.</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This week, the hosts grab their Time Turners and summon all the nostalgia that will fit in their beaded bag as they revisit the day after receiving <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em>. Andrew, Eric and Laura were in London for a live podcasting event at Waterstones, and Micah was stateside. We reflect on our initial impression of the book, what things we feel differently about 15 years later, and how magical it felt to witness the "end" of an era together. Also on this episode: dramatic line readings of some Book 7 reactions and e-mails from the day after that we finally respond to!<br>

<li>Main Discussion: Revisiting <a href="https://mugglecast.com/episode-101/">MuggleCast #101</a>, our first <em>Deathly Hallows</em> reactions episode</li>
<li>Why did we start off Episode 101 talking about <em>Lord of the Rings</em>? Eric reminds us of how things have changed since 2007.</li>
<li>Laura and the hosts lament the lack of return to the Department of Mysteries, across two time periods!</li>
<li>Podcasting had made all the hosts cold, hard people. Did the deaths in Book 7 really even affect them?</li>
<li>Did any of the deaths feel 'unnecessary' to us then, and do they now?</li>
<li>15 years later... does the epilogue feel satisfying? And what about those names for the kids?</li>
<li>The hosts listen to themselves predicting what the <em>Deathly Hallows</em> movie will entail.</li>
<li>We read some of the most dramatic reactions to the book, found in the MuggleNet Comments Section on July 21, 2007.</li>
<li>Listener e-mails include: Who was the late-blooming Hogwarts student? What was it about Lily's eyes? And, what happened to Kreacher?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: Who witnessed Dumbledore using the Sword of Gryffindor to destroy the Gaunt Ring?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's MuggleCast, the hosts take on the most <em>indefensible</em> characters, and figure out what about them gets under our skin. How can we defend the actions of someone like Gilderoy Lockhart or Rita Skeeter? Do we really believe that James Potter matured out of being a bully? And finally, is Umbridge a case of nature or nurture? Join Andrew, Eric, Micah and Laura for a deep look at characters who bug us in <em>Harry Potter</em>.<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>For Pride month, MuggleCast is participating in <a href="https://bit.ly/HogwartsHunt">The Hogwarts Hunt</a>, a fundraiser and scavenger hunt to benefit LGBT charities. We're team Hufflepuff! Visit our social media for more info.</li>
<li>Who are the most indefensible characters in <em>Harry Potter</em>? Why do we say that they can't they be redeemed?</li>
<li>The hosts unexpectedly discuss a few Ravenclaws and Micah and Laura get nervous.</li>
<li>Micah says the Death Eaters would actually approve of the Dursleys' treatment of Harry if they knew.</li>
<li>Among the irredeemable characters, which ones do we LOVE to hate and why?</li>
<li>Characters like Snape or Umbridge have scenes that are greatly written as to illustrate their motives clearly, and we are shook.</li>
<li>Could anything or anyone humanize Bellatrix Lestrange?</li>
<li>What allow us to defend some characters, but not others? Their upbringing? Their intelligence and skill? Where do we draw the line?</li>
<li>Is Argus Filch a character we understand? Would a Squib living at a magic school always have his attitude?</li>
<li>Is James Potter a defensible character, since we see so little of him and when we do he is still that teenage bully of Snape?</li>
<li>Do we believe that James would have made a good father and raised Harry without prejudice, had he lived?</li>
<li>Debate: Umbridge, Nature vs Nurture?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: Which of Umbridge's Educational Decrees (what number) barred teachers from giving the students any information that was not related to the subjects they were hired to teach?</li>
<li>Andrew was on Swish &amp; Flick podcast discussing the history of Dumbledore's sexuality! <a href="https://anchor.fm/swishflickcast/episodes/Episode-250---Grindy-and-Dumle-Sittin-in-a-Tree-e1kese6">Check it out here</a> or wherever you listen to podcasts!</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>A merger of Warner Bros and Discovery, Inc. has led Andrew to speculate as to what the future of the Wizarding World may look like on film and TV. And he's prepared a presentation about it! Hosts Eric, Micah, Laura and special Slug Club guest Neil join in and speculate as to the future of <em>Fantastic Beasts</em>, and what - if any - television series set within the Wizarding World we might see from Discovery Time Warner. It's a jam-packed episode with lots of laughs and really cool ideas!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Welcome Slug Club guest Neil, who's joining us from South Korea in the middle of the night.</li>
<li>What CEO David Zaslav might do with <em>Fantastic Beasts, Harry Potter,</em> and his upcoming meeting with JKR.</li>
<li>While <em>Secrets of Dumbledore</em> is the lowest performing Wizarding World film of all time, it still <em>technically</em> has broken even, reaching $400M globally. Is the future secure for its remaining announced sequels?</li>
<li>Hypothetically, what scripted Harry Potter TV shows could we see coming if not a direct reboot of the original Potter books?</li>
<li>The hosts all provide an idea for a television series that fills in canon and explores plot holes from the series.</li>
<li>Laura wants an episode dedicated to "<a href="https://www.mugglenet.com/2004/10/the-lost-day-part-1-why-it-took-so-long/">The Missing 24 Hours</a>", while Micah wants a series focused on Tom Riddle's ascent to power.</li>
<li>Is a Marauders series anybody's second choice for new TV content? How about one that shows the events of <em>Deathly Hallows</em> from the students' perspective in Hogwarts? And finally, Andrew's idea for an Auror Dept. police procedural is intriguing!</li>
<li>Next, the hosts "Star Wars-ify" a Wizarding World story, pairing an adult and child character together in the style of Disney+'s <em>The Mandalorian </em>and <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi.</em>
</li>
<li>Would Salazar Slytherin look good boasting a gray area? Are outcasts Hagrid and Luna the perfect pair for an exploration of Wizarding World secrets? Would Tonks and Mad-Eye see eye to eye if placed together for long? How about Snape and Draco? And would a time-traveling Neville Longbottom learn a few things from Professor Sprout?</li>
<li>Finally, falling in line with <em>Discovery Channel</em>'s past offerings, the hosts predict which educational and/or questionable reality programming we might get from the content creators.</li>
<li>Ideas include space-faring wizards, Charms disasters, a travel show, and <em>"Trelawney Truckers"</em>!</li>
<li>Quizzitch: Who illustrated the first book cover for Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, published in 1997 by Bloomsbury in UK?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Watch Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore with the MuggleCasters in our movie commentary track! We had a ton of fun watching the movie together and making sense of everything that's going on. What are each character's motives? What are we noticing now that we're watching in the comfort of our own homes? Even the credits had a surprise that a couple of us weren't aware of! We discuss every moment of the movie as we watch it together!<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>The Secrets of Dumbledore was just released on HBO Max, and now you can watch the movie in real time with your Harry Potter friends (Us). You will need to bring your own copy of the movie to get the full experience. Currently it's available on HBO Max and will be released on DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital at the end of June.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>At the beginning of the episode we help you sync up with us. Our sync point is just after the WB logo flies past the camera. For us, this was 53 seconds into the movie, but your timecode may differ if you don't have a HBO ad at the beginning.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In their first dedicated character discussion since the premiere of <em>Secrets of Dumbledore</em>, the hosts of MuggleCast turn the pages of their study guides to Professor Eulalie Hicks of Ilvermorny! "Lally" was a huge highlight of the third <em>Beasts</em> film, and we're here to say why that was. Join Andrew, Eric, Micah and Laura as they analyze the character through her words, attitude and relationships. It's a fun episode for sure.<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Main Discussion: Professor Eulalie "Lally" Hicks in <em>Secrets of Dumbledore</em>
</li>
<li>Going back to the first section he ever headed on MuggleNet, Micah starts us off with Lally's Name Origin</li>
<li>Jessica Williams, who portrays Lally, was herself a big Harry Potter fan, and even shares his birthday!</li>
<li>The announcement of Jessica's casting likely took place at the next table over from Andrew, Eric and Micah when they saw <em>Cursed Child</em> on Broadway.</li>
<li>What makes Eulalie a member of Thunderbird house? It's been a while since the hosts had a chance to talk about Ilvermorny canon.</li>
<li>As a Charms professor, Eulalie's surely competent in some of our favorite Charms, which we recap.</li>
<li>Lally, like Newt, wrote a book which is widely circulated. She also has a unique-looking wand.</li>
<li>Professor Hicks and Professor Hagrid both share a job title in common! But... what does it mean?</li>
<li>We received some insightful e-mails regarding Lally's "Transatlantic" accent, a relic of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea9_Xh9ZphI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Old Hollywood in the 1930's and 40's</a>.</li>
<li>Lally's friendhsip with Jacob is a reason to see the film, even if it got off to a rocky (problematic?) start. The hosts discuss.</li>
<li>What do we see happening between Theseus and Lally romantically, if anything, and why?</li>
<li>Andrew's idea for a Eulalie Hicks spinoff TV show will have you ready and waiting for the first season.</li>
<li>Quizzitch: What did students have to do in their end of year exam for Charms class in Harry’s year one?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode, the fearless MuggleCasters take it upon themselves to answer <em>Secrets of Dumbledore's</em> biggest unanswered questions, using their extensive knowledge of the Wizarding World to provide plausible answers and put to bed the movie's most dangling plot threads. Join Andrew, Eric, Laura and Micah on this fun journey through the plot points and listen as they finally discuss whether their own prophecy about the movie came true!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Main Discussion: Can our knowledge of book canon help us explain the events of <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em>?</li>
<li>In what YEAR is the third movie set? Some title cards would have been helpful! Are there clues in the props?</li>
<li>What became of Nagini? Andrew, Laura and Micah provide a tragic outcome while Eric imagines a spa day.</li>
<li>Where is Tina Goldstein, really? The "she's busy" explanation does not hold any giggle water for us!</li>
<li>Was Newt ever allowed back to Hogwarts after his expulsion, and did he complete his schooling there?</li>
<li>What makes Dumbledore "more than a teacher" to Newt, in his own words?</li>
<li>How and under what circumstances did Dumbledore and Eulalie Hicks first meet?</li>
<li>What is the little drop of "water" that Albus blew onto Credence? And is it connected with the Deluminator or an alternate dimension?</li>
<li>The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus... did they come true, and might they still? How about our predictions of Nostradamus?</li>
<li>Exactly when did Aberforth find out about Credence and when did they establish their mirror chats?</li>
<li>Regarding romances, where do Jacob and Queenie honeymoon, and is anything happening with Lally and Theseus?</li>
<li>The hosts wrap up discussing the most pressing questions that the next movie MUST answer.</li>
<li>Who Got it Right?! Laura and Micah sweep The Bunties (tm) with Price is Right rules applying, on our various FB3 guesses.</li>
<li>Next week, a character discussion on Eulalie Hicks! <a href="https://mugglecast.com/contact/">Submit your questions and thoughts</a> on the character!</li>
<li>Quizzitch: Who was the headmaster of Hogwarts school immediately before Dumbledore?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This week, we continue our review of <em>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</em>, this time focusing on the various odds and ends of the film! Plus, we hand out our "Bunty Awards," which are accolades for several aspects of the movie! Stay tuned for many, many more thoughts on the weeks and months ahead!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>The "Bunty" award for our Favorite New Character, Favorite New Beast, etc</li>
<li>What was the one stand-out scene of the film?</li>
<li>Was the movie poster for the film misleading? (YES)</li>
<li>Eric took a stopwatch into his <em>Secrets of Dumbledore</em> screening... for a very specific experiment.</li>
<li>We, like Jacob, were confused by the plot to confuse Grindelwald.</li>
<li>What about Grindelwald's visions in the puddles and mirrors, what do they mean?</li>
<li>Was Credence made to sound more like Aberforth at the start of the film? And was anyone else thinking he would have a romance with Queenie from their early interaction?</li>
<li>The re-use of classic Harry Potter lines is scrutinized by Micah.</li>
<li>Was the Anton Vogel actor too similar in appearance to Mads as Grindelwald, and did that lead to confusion about the plot and characters?</li>
<li>Could Credence be conceivably written out of the franchise at this point? And why can't the phoenix intervene to save him from his condition? It's... right there.</li>
<li>How do we feel about all the Aberforth and goat stuff now after seeing this movie?</li>
<li>Why doesn't anyone in the film call the head of the International Confederation of Wizards by its book-given title?</li>
<li>Revisiting some 'Crackpot Theories,' could Leta still live?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: According to The Secrets of Dumbledore, What is Bunty’s given surname? <a href="https://mugglecast.com/quizzitch/">Submit your answer</a>!</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's MuggleCast, we return to an e-mail that we received that asks us what the 1998-1999 Hogwarts school year would have been like, when Hermione returned to complete her Hogwarts education and when Ginny and Luna were her classmates. The hosts think critically and speculate which accommodations might be made in wake of the destruction of the school and considering the mental health and well-being of students and staff! Plus, a recent <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> trailer gives us the first real look inside the much-anticipated Wizarding World game. All this and more can be found inside the episode!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Playstation's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxKixtrxYRg">'State of Play' event</a> gives <em>Potter</em> fans an in-depth look at <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. The hosts discuss what interests them about it as gamers.</li>
<li>Main Discussion: Annette asks us, what do we think the 1998/1999 school year would have looked like at Hogwarts?</li>
<li>September 1 is only 4 months after the Battle of Hogwarts! Is that enough time to repair the school and memorialize the fallen?</li>
<li>What would the Sorting Hat's song be like? More calls for unity, amid Slytherin's recent walkout?</li>
<li>If McGonagall was now headmistress, who would take her spot as head of Gryffindor House and professor of Transfiguration? Is Oliver Wood too young / too obvious?</li>
<li>What would Hogwarts' graduation ceremony look like, and why did we never see one?</li>
<li>Would Ron and Harry pop by on the weekends to visit their girlfriends Hermione and Ginny?</li>
<li>Will Hogwarts FINALLY, finally, get some grief counselors? And did Dumbledore put an unnecessary target on Hogwarts when he was headmaster?</li>
<li>The hosts discuss tributes that occurred to students who died during their own educational history.</li>
<li>Listeners provide their questions, such as: will rebuilding Hogwarts add elevators and unisex bathrooms? What happens to the statues of the knights that defended the school?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: This Week's CURRENT Quizzitch Question: Finish this line: "Minister, the evidence of the Dark Lord's return is _______." A) Incomparable B) Inconvenient C) Inconceivable! D) Incontrovertible  <a href="https://mugglecast.com/quizzitch/">Submit your answer</a>!</li>

<li>

<li>The hosts analyze the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhFSUKuHly0&amp;ab_channel=portkeypuntoit">Japanese Secrets of Dumbledore trailer</a>, which includes even more exciting footage!</li>
<li>Oh brother! Did Theseus and Newt successfully defeat the Manticore?</li>
<li>Professor McGonagall namedrop!</li>
<li>Dumbledore comes face-to-face with the portrait of Ariana</li>
<li>Newt: “To save our world, each of us has a role to play." What exactly are the roles that Theseus, Eulalie, Jacob, Yusuf and Bunty will play in the third Fantastic Beasts film?</li>
<li>Tina is inside Newt's suitcase (kind of)!</li>
<li>Dumbledore: “I drew my wand, which was even more foolish.” Will this be how we’re going to get Ariana's backstory? Not via flashback, but from Dumbledore himself?</li>
<li>Listener feedback covers Tina as Bunty, Dumbledore and Grindelwald's duel, Tina possibly being pregnant and more!</li>
<li>We analyze The Secrets of Dumbledore character posters (<a href="https://twitter.com/FantasticBeasts/status/1496137707541696527">Dumbledore's First Army</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/FantasticBeasts/status/1496145317682683916">Grindelwald's Followers</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/FantasticBeasts/status/1496152833879588873">Global Wizards</a>).</li>
<li>The Secrets of Dumbledore screenplay will be published July 19. We debate whether or not this big gap between the film and the screenplay is to push fans to go to theaters?</li>

YouTube page, that is! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaM_wL1ZOM4&amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures">We use this video</a> when referencing all timestamps during our discussion.</li>
<li>Laura is optimistic that the Michael Gambon Pensieve appearance foreshadows memory being a crucial part of the plot for this film...</li>
<li>...and Eric thinks it's another desperate attempt to market the film to old-school Potter fans. Fan-service, if you will!</li>
<li>The Blood Pact is shown prominently and the hosts discuss similarities with the Unbreakable Vow in visual style.</li>
<li>Is that McGonagall visiting Dumbledore at the Hog's Head?!</li>
<li>Grindelwald declares war, Credence has longer hair, and Eulally Hicks apparates around Jacob's shop -- and we love it.</li>
<li>An important title card which has been missing from some marketing materials is back in the trailer, and the hosts discuss.</li>
<li>What is with this mysterious message on the back of Aberforth's bar? We use our Wordle experience to try and figure it out.</li>
<li>Are Albus and Gellert meeting in person? Is this an Applebees? Or merely a memory?</li>
<li>Micah thinks he can identify several of the beasts shown throughout the trailer, and Theseus does some interesting magic.</li>
<li>Is Theseus doomed? Some sleuthing reveals it may be his tie and wand that are shown with Teddy and Pickett.</li>
<li>Is Tina Polyjuiced into someone else, like Bunty? Does that explain why Katherine Waterston is missing from all promotional material in this film?</li>
<li>The Deluminator is back! And who's that group resting on the stairs at the theorized end of the movie?</li>
<li>Next week, we'll be reading YOUR submissions on theories and trailer thoughts. Be sure to send us an e-mail or voicemail using our regular channels for inclusion on the show!</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This week we're talking about black characters as well as people of color in the core <em>Harry Potter</em> books, the movie adaptations of those books, and the media that has come out since! Joining us as our honored guest is the amazing <a href="https://instagram.com/bibbidibobbidi_broke/?hl=en">Adriana Redding</a>, who led Hufflepuff Team to victory on <em>Harry Potter: Tournament of Houses</em>! Together she, Andrew, Eric and Laura discuss the reasons why black characters are so few and far between, and what their diversity hopes are for future releases set in the Wizarding World.<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Our guest <a href="https://instagram.com/bibbidibobbidi_broke/?hl=en">Adriana Redding</a> talks about her time on <a href="https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYZ9MrgqYWBq0wwEAAAAF"><em>Harry Potter: Tournament of Houses</em></a> as well as black representation in the Harry Potter series!</li>
<li>Adriana recounts how she got into <em>Harry Potter</em> a bit later than others, and how this affected her take on diversity in the series.</li>
<li>The hosts discuss the importance of seeing somebody like yourself in the stories you consume.</li>
<li>Was the statistical diversity of England and Wales in the 1990's a factor in the lack of black and POC characters in <em>Harry Potter</em>? We explain why this excuse doesn't hold water.</li>
<li>Dean Thomas' backstory was omitted by the author in favor of Neville's, but old writing exists describing what it would have been. We analyze it.</li>
<li>Did you know two black actresses played Lavender Brown in COS and POA? The third actress to play her was white... and she's the one who had lines and got to date Ron in Movie 6.</li>
<li>We discuss the gradual increase in diversity since the films wrapped up, including a black MACUSA President, Hermione in <em>The Cursed Child</em>, and more.</li>
<li>Adriana details a recent trip to the Wizarding World theme park, and asks the hosts what their ideal hope is for future installments of <em>Potter</em>.</li>
<li>Eric can't resist the urge to quiz Adriana on last week's Quizzitch Question, on the spot, and she does pretty well!</li>
<li>Quizzitch: How many Quidditch matches does Lee Jordan commentate that Harry participates in, in the books?  <a href="https://mugglecast.com/quizzitch/">Submit your answer</a>!</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Our mailbag is overflowing with feedback from our recent Snape and Lily episode, and people want to talk about Jacob in the upcoming <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> film. We hear from another one of our youngest fans, and even dig up a classic e-mail from 2006. All on this latest milestone episode of MuggleCast!<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Important Note: Next week, we're celebrating Black History Month by talking about how the books handle representation. If you're a listener of color and have feedback on this topic, <a href="https://mugglecast.com/contact/">please send us your owls</a>!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Previously unseen photos of Ariana Dumbledore <a href="https://www.mugglenet.com/2022/02/exclusive-leaked-photos-confirm-scenes-filmed-with-ariana-dumbledore/">have leaked online</a>, and Andrew and Micah did an IG Live about it. View that now on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mugglecast/?hl=en">our Instagram</a>.</li>
<li>Last week, Eric attended <a href="https://www.albionschoolofsorcery.com/">Albion School</a>, a live action roleplay, and had a blast.</li>
<li>The results of our listener house survey are in! Find out what Hogwarts house the majority of our listeners are in! (It's very close, but not as close as O.G. Pottermore said they were.)</li>
<li>Voicemails kick off from an Aquarius listener who brings even more insight into Lily's character from her horoscope.</li>
<li>More voicemails cover bagel flavorings of the 1930's, Narcissa's love for Draco (What if Harry had told Narcissa that Draco was dead?), and something misunderstood about Harry Potter.</li>
<li>Two listeners e-mail us with theories on how Jacob remembered Queenie, and whether his account of it to Newt can be trusted.</li>
<li>Is Draco's future wife linked to Nagini? And could Jacob's wand help get him in to wizarding spaces?</li>
<li>Is Cursed Child and other Potter missteps giving outside spectators a very bad impression of the Harry Potter franchise on a whole?</li>
<li>What memory does Snape use to summon a Patronus? And why exactly did Lily choose James?</li>
<li>In an email from 2006, one listener guesses at what Dumbledore is really seeing when he takes Riddle's potion.</li>
<li>Chicken Soup for the MuggleCast soul returns and this time it's from a teenager who found us last year.</li>
<li>Quizzitch: What two solutions does Hermione offer Ron to help it stop raining in Yaxley's office?  <a href="https://mugglecast.com/quizzitch/">Submit your answer</a>!</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>After the <em>Potter</em> series proved to be successful, there was the <em>Twilight Series</em>. Next came <em>The Hunger Games</em>. And then came <em>Divergent</em>! Each series was marketed as "the NEXT <em>Harry Potter</em>." But, they weren't really as successful as <em>Harry Potter</em> at all! On this special episode of MuggleCast, the hosts dive deep into what makes the tale of a boy wizard so enduring, and how the other series just didn't measure up in terms of financial success OR staying-power. We also compare HP to <em>Star Wars</em> and discuss what the two series have in common. It's another great episode this week, be sure to listen at your leisure!<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>MuggleCast is <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mugglecast">now on TikTok</a> with the username @MuggleCast! Be sure to follow us there and enjoy all the fun content we've got coming.</li>
<li>This week's Main Discussion: Why the so-called "Next Harry Potter" hasn't happened yet.</li>
<li>Andrew, Eric, Laura and Micah discuss what made <em>Harry Potter</em> so special. From the story beats to the complexity of the mystery, we dive deep into what we love and what inevitably translated to the publishers' bottom line.</li>
<li>Strong themes in the HP series? We think we spot a few that hit home! And being rewarded for catching references and foreshadowing really felt like a present to us as readers.</li>
<li>HP fans were <strong>feverish</strong> for new Harry! That's just something that cannot be said about some other series.</li>
<li>The hosts talk <em>Twilight</em> by Stephenie Meyer. Andrew and Laura even had a <a href="https://www.digitalpodcast.com/feeds/27197-imprint-the-twilight-podcast">Twilight podcast</a> back in the day!</li>
<li>Were <em>The Hunger Games</em> and the <em>Divergent</em> series simply too dystopian for readers to love?</li>
<li>Another example of a franchise that may live forever is <em>Star Wars</em>. What do that and HP have in common from a storytelling perspective?</li>
<li>Did <em>Star Wars'</em> opening up its canon to multiple creators allow it to flourish, and what lessons can Warner Bros. learn there regarding HP?</li>
<li>The hosts compare the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and wonder aloud if "the next <em>Harry Potter</em>" will even be a book at all.</li>
<li>Finally, are older Millennials going to be the ones to spot the next HP, or will the younger generation determine what the next candidate is?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: In <em>Divergent</em>, the hero Tris is eligible to join 3 factions. Which faction does she join, and for bonus points, what are the 3 she has to choose from?  <a href="https://mugglecast.com/quizzitch/">Submit your answer</a>! </li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>MuggleCast excitedly kicks off the year 2022 with their review of the brand new <em>Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts</em> reunion special! Join Andrew, Eric, Micah and Laura as they go "chapter-by-chapter" on the 100 minute show and discuss the highs and lows, cast members who were noticeably absent, and how the reunion special did or didn't meet their expectations. We also have a mail-bag show next week, so be sure to send us <a href="https://mugglecast.com/contact/">YOUR thoughts on the special</a>!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>2022 started off with a brand new <a href="https://play.hbomax.com/page/urn:hbo:page:GYbzrRAvf-ZPCKQEAAAAX:type:feature">Reunion Special</a>, looking back on the making of all 8 films and featuring the cast including Dan, Rupert and Emma</li>
<li>Harry Potter Reunion Special First Impressions: did it satisfy our craving? Did it make us cry? (Spoiler alert: yes, it did.)</li>
<li>Andrew found the beginning to be a little clunky, and the fact that Rupert, Dan and Emma were not physically all in the same space was ultimately a missed opportunity.</li>
<li>Laura thinks the special would have benefitted from having a dedicated host to guide us through the many different interviews and set a more static tone for the special.</li>
<li>Micah wanted to see more groups together and would have expected a higher focus on the first film, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary and not the others.</li>
<li>Eric wanted more Ian Hart! They brought him in for a whole day and he only appears in the last 5 minutes of the show? Release the Snyder Cut of <em>Back to Hogwarts</em>, you cowards!</li>
<li>We all appreciate getting to hear from all 4 directors who helmed the <em>Potter</em> films.</li>
<li>Dan Radcliffe's chat with Chris Columbus and some archival footage of the young trio warmed all of our hearts, multiple times.</li>
<li>Hearing Alfonso Cuarón discuss <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em> changed Micah's mind on the film! Eric is not so cheaply bought... but admits that Cuarón clearly really cares and that his take on Harry's adolescence is valid.</li>
<li>Dan Radcliffe and Gary Oldman's chat shows that they truly mean a lot to one another and is great to see.</li>
<li>After seeing Mike Newell wrestle with the Phelps Twins and break some of his own ribs while doing so, everything we've ever wondered about why the <em>Goblet of Fire</em> movie is the way it is makes perfect sense.</li>
<li>The trio talking teenage hormones reignites the spark of all of our ships, including Emma and Tom who CLEARLY HAVE SOMETHING GOING ON...</li>
<li>...but perhaps not as much as Dan and Helena Bonham Carter! That steamy handwritten note, wowza...</li>
<li>The hosts lament the exclusion of a Sirius/Bellatrix duel that was evidently filmed, and recount other surprising times during this special where an actor says something shocking which paints director choices in a questionable light.</li>
<li>Evanna Lynch appears with an inspirational message for the outsiders in all of us.</li>
<li>The cast discussing their on-screen kisses is very popcorn worthy, even if the kisses themselves weren't all so.</li>
<li>The In Memoriam segment touches us all as we reflect on cast members who are no longer with us, and the nice things said about them in this special.</li>
<li>RIP also to Millie the hamster. We never knew ye before!</li>
<li>The special ends back at the beginning, with footage of the 11-year-old trio, and lots of emotional admissions from the actors about each other and the films' legacy.</li>
<li>The hosts discuss JK Rowling's appearance in archived footage and what mystery still remains about her involvement in this special.</li>
<li>Quizzitch: What is the name of Rupert Grint's child? <a href="https://mugglecast.com/quizzitch/">Submit your answer</a>! </li>
<li>Finally, Eric and Micah played Fandom Feud last week, with fellow members of HP Fandom to benefit trans-supportive charities. Check out the whole video of both games they played over on <a href="https://youtu.be/HE9WiMuVbsE">YouTube</a>!</li>

<li>Another year, gone (in your best Dumbledore voice)!</li>
<li>We discuss the upcoming Harry Potter Reunion Special. The trailer was supposed to be released last week prior to our recording, but never appeared. It was eventually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFGS4zZWGoA&amp;ab_channel=HBOMax">released</a> Monday, December 20th.</li>

<li>Dumbledore is in New York City! What brings him there?</li>
<li>Could the portkey in the Room of Requirement be a Tibetan Prayer Wheel?</li>
<li>Rise Great Avenger! Laura calls out some very watery phoenix imagery behind the title card!</li>
<li>Listener feedback covers all things Jacob!</li>
<li>Did Dumbledore enchant Jacob's want to work only in times of need?</li>
<li>Was Jacob expelled from Ilvermorny? Could he be a late bloomer?</li>
<li>Does Jacob get a wand because, well, it would just be too dangerous for him NOT to have one?</li>
<li>Could Credence hold the secret to destroying the blood pact?</li>
<li>What do we have to look forward to in the wizarding world in 2022?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: What is the street address for Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes in the books? <a href="https://mugglecast.com/quizzitch/">Submit your answer</a>! </li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode, major news hits the fandom! We discuss the upcoming reunion of cast and crew from Harry Potter to celebrate the first film's 20th anniversary. In addition, the new, shorter version of <em>Cursed Child</em> is reportedly a lot more heavy on an Albus/Scorpius relationship! And finally we bring you our 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Join Andrew, Eric, Laura and Micah as they reveal what awesome fan-crafted finds they've discovered this year.</div>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint will all take part in a <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/cast-members-feature-in-retrospective-for-harry-potter-twentieth-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wwd_social">20th Anniversary Special</a> for <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone</em>'s release</li>
<li>Even actors from later films, such as Gary Oldman and Mark Williams, will be joining in as well as SS/COS director Chris Columbus</li>
<li>There have been no reports of J.K. Rowling in attendance. The hosts weigh in on what involvement she'll have, if any.</li>
<li>A Cursed Child fan <a href="https://twitter.com/FaithNoMoar/status/1459370155218251781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1459370155218251781%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mugglenet.com%2F2021%2F11%2Frumor-one-part-cursed-child-will-make-scorbus-canon%2F">has passionately revealed</a> that the new, shorter version of <em>Cursed Child</em> on Broadway has a lot more direct references to Albus and Scorpius being interested in one another, and fewer references to girls like Rose and Polly Chapman!</li>
<li>The hosts guess at why the play would make changes now, and for only half of its current productions.</li>
<li>Main Discussion: Our 2021 Holiday Gift Guide episode is here! Each host has two recommendations of fan-made items to check out.</li>
<li>From Andrew's list: A <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/978416127/personalized-wizard-school-acceptance?variation1=2003774264">custom Hogwarts acceptance letter</a> and a really awesome <a href="http://etsy.com/listing/1050910612/custom-lenticular-chocolate-frog-card?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=harry+potter+chocolate+frog&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-9&amp;organic_search_click=1">personalized lenticular Chocolate Frog card</a>!</li>
<li>Eric just loves the super-crafty, miniature <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=bookend%20alley">Book Nooks</a> that can be found on Etsy, as well as Etsy seller <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/CleverBadger">Clever Badger designs</a>, who make many hand-crafted gifts for book lovers.</li>
<li>Additionally, <a href="https://www.mugglenet.com/2021/11/give-back-to-fandom-forward-with-the-2022-mugglenet-fandom-calendar/">MuggleNet's 2022 fandom calendar</a> is donating part of its proceeds to Fandom Forward (formerly the HP Alliance)</li>
<li>Micah has found <a href="https://winmarkstampandsign.com/product/set-of-2-ravenclaw-house-12-ounce-stainless-steel-stemless-wine-glass/">Wine Goblets from Ravenclaw house</a> and themed soy candles <a href="https://www.frostbeardstudio.com/collections/best-sellers">from Frostbeart Studio</a>!</li>
<li>And Laura has found a way to get <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1088814480/the-grim-tea-leaves-teacup-and-saucer?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=harry+potter+tea+cup&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-8&amp;sca=1">The Grim in your teacup</a> every day, as well as <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/842465704/harry-potter-themed-engraved-apple-watch?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=harry+potter&amp;ref=sc_gallery-1-5&amp;plkey=6d4a92f85c1e41a3789c0b503b784ec35c0c43ce%3A842465704&amp;pro=1&amp;frs=1&amp;sts=1">these neat custom Apple Watch bands</a>
</li>
<li>In addition to their fan-made recommendations, the hosts discuss where to go for vintage Harry Potter merchandise (eBay!)</li>
<li>We also ask: if money weren't an object, which piece of official <em>Harry Potter</em> merchandise would we buy?</li>
<li>Lastly, what newly-released official merchandise are we eyeing at the end of this year?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: What 14th Century witch enjoyed being burnt at the stake so many times that she did so at least 47 times under different guises?</li>
<li>This week's episode is brought to you by Beam (Visit <a href="http://www.BeamOrganics.com/mugglecast">BeamOrganics.com/mugglecast</a> for 40% off the first 3 months of any Beam sunscription, plus a free mug and frother -- OR 20% off any one time purchase) and BetterHelp (get 10% off your first month at <a href="http://www.betterhelp.com/mugglecast">BetterHelp.com/mugglecast</a>)</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode, we empty some owl post from our Muggle Mail bag! What would the 1998-99 Hogwarts school year have looked like? Why did Harry decide to become an Auror? Plus, we analyze several new Credence theories, a Chicken Soup from India and a horcrux email from 2006 that we’ll finally answer!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>We're confounded! Harry Potter: Wizards Unite is closing this January!</li>
<li>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone director Chris Columbus says he thinks they got Harry’s scar wrong... and is interested in making a Cursed Child movie!</li>
<li>It's our monthly Muggle Mail episode with voicemails covering Dumbledore and Grindelwald's blood pact, Mads Mikkelson's casting and more!</li>
<li>Would Hermione, Ginny and Luna have been close? Would the Slytherin students have been treated poorly? How would Snape have been remembered?</li>
<li>Credence theories abound!</li>
<li>Would J.K. Rowling ever write a HP-world book from a different character's perspective?</li>
<li>What is Grindelwald's emotional motivation?</li>
<li>Chicken Soup for the MuggleCast Soul returns!</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode, long time friend of the show Evanna Lynch joins us to discuss her new book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/677563/the-opposite-of-butterfly-hunting-by-evanna-lynch/">The Opposite of Butterfly Hunting</a>. She talks about the challenges in writing her memoir and the hosts ask her about her experiences as a newly published author. Her book chronicles a struggle with mental illness and an eating disorder, as well as her correspondence with JK Rowling via letters, years before she was cast as Luna Lovegood. Evanna was kind to answer all of our questions and give us her time. This is one episode you won't want to miss!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Evanna Lynch returns to MuggleCast, a newly published author!</li>
<li>Her book, <em>The Opposite of Butterfly Hunting </em>is a deeply moving, at times comical and mostly challenging tale of her struggles with an eating disorder while she was growing up.</li>
<li>The hosts take turns asking Evanna questions both about her book, and some of the surprising stories found within.</li>
<li>Evanna details why she was inspired to write <em>Butterfly Hunting...</em> and how she managed to remember so many details from when she was eleven.</li>
<li>What lessons and messages can readers hope to get from the book?</li>
<li>Laura asks Evanna what she would say to her younger self, and Evanna replies gravely and honestly.</li>
<li>The interview touches on Evanna's early correspondence with J.K. Rowling via letter. What made her reach out?</li>
<li>The reasons Evanna is connected to the character of Luna.</li>
<li>Evanna recounts her transition from everyday Harry Potter super-fan to friend and colleague of the cast, and how strange it was to get used to.</li>
<li>Finally, what does the title of the book mean? And how did becoming a vegan change Evanna's way of seeing the world?</li>
<li>MuggleCast recently was on Evanna's <a href="https://www.thechickpeeps.com/episodes/2021/3/10/s3-ep22-chickpeeps-x-mugglecast-crossover">The ChickPeeps podcast</a>, and we had a great time.</li>
<li>Evanna leaves us with a story of walking into bookstores to sign copies of her book, and what it was like to record the audiobook.</li>
<li>Quizzitch: What is Aragog's wife's name?? <a href="https://www.mugglecast.com/quizzitch/">Submit your answer</a>!</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode of MuggleCast, we follow up on our original character discussion on Credence Barebone, aka Corvus Lestrange, aka "Aurelius Dumbledore"? Wading deep into prophecy, including forming one of our own using Nostradamus, the hosts try to answer the question: "Just what is going on with Credence?" Listen as we find some answers by reviewing the scenes and subplots of <em>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.<br>
</em><br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>We heard from the creator behind <a href="https://www.harrypotterdatabase.com/deleted-and-unreleased-scenes">Harry Potter Database</a> and its astonishing collection of deleted and unreleased movie scenes!</li>
<li>The surprise main character in <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em> is Credence Barebone! Micah points out why this is more usual than unusual.</li>
<li>Filmmakers chose twice not to include a scene where Credence survives his bout with MACUSA, both the end of the first film and the start of the second. Would such a scene have been an improvement?</li>
<li>What brought Credence to "Circus Arcanus," and is it all one master manipulation from Grindelwald that has set Credence on his path to find his 'family'?</li>
<li>What do Credence's name origins tell us about the character, for his various names?</li>
<li>We revisit an old e-mail which explains how Greek mythology may influence the future of the character.</li>
<li>The hosts read aloud the predictions of Tycho Dodonus... and try to identify characters within.</li>
<li>Could the "son cruelly banished" be somebody else, like Albus Dumbledore?</li>
<li>Eric reads key passages from the script book which lends a little insight into that humongous shipwreck. Does the script book quietly reveal an important element?</li>
<li>We revisit major theories about Credence including, is he Ariana's twin? Does he have her Obscurus? Is he really Corvus Lestrange, or a science experiment made by Dumbledore and Grindelwald?</li>
<li>The hosts pick some numbers at random, and consult Nostradamus himself for a prediction of the future!</li>
<li>Quizzitch: What was Leta Lestrange’s mother’s name? <a href="https://www.mugglecast.com/quizzitch/">Submit your answer</a>!</li>

<li>The hosts recall their initial impressions of Hermione. Is she really an "insufferable know-it-all"?</li>
<li>Where does Hermione's academic drive come from? Her parents? Pressure to fit into a new school? Pressure to fit into a new society?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's special episode of MuggleCast, we finally have some <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em> news to discuss! The third entry in the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> series will be titled, <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/fantastic-beasts-secrets-of-dumbledore-to-be-released-globally-april-2022"><em>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</em></a>! Also, a plot synopsis and new release date (April 15, 2022) are out! Join Andrew, Eric, Micah and Laura as they discuss their first impressions of the title, what specific "secrets" the title may be hinting at, and we hear from Slug Club-level Patrons listening live who have some great theories as well! <br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Fantastic Beasts 3 will be titled, <em>The Secrets of Dumbledore.</em>
</li>
<li>The hosts all owe Andrew money. He has heavily speculated that "Dumbledore" would be in the title!</li>
<li>Back on <a href="https://www.mugglecast.com/episode-442-harry-potter-screenwriter-returns-cursed-child-inside-look/">MuggleCast 442</a>, the hosts each predicted the title of the movie in 2019, and some came close!</li>
<li>What do we make of the title? Is this anything other than a money-motivated decision to get people to see the movie because it is called something "Dumbledore"?</li>
<li>What does this mean for how prominent Dumbledore will be versus the Core Four and Grindelwald from previous movies?</li>
<li>What could the "secrets" of Dumbledore be? Will it have to do with the Blood Pact, or Ariana perhaps?</li>
<li>Will the secrets of Dumbledore be better explained than the crimes of Grindelwald in <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em>?</li>
<li>We discover that the film title shares a word with another Harry Potter movie! Will this be a trend?</li>
<li>Andrew points out the huge visual <a href="https://twitter.com/MuggleCast/status/1440728508897001473?s=20">difference in the size of both series titles</a> on their respective title cards. It's huge!</li>
<li>The movie's synopsis includes phrases like "intrepid explorers" and "Muggle baker" - but otherwise is pretty vague.</li>
<li>Are we still going to visit Rio de Janeiro in this movie?! Was the Brazil setting filmed exclusively at Leavesden?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: Who is the main character of <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>? WRONG answers only! <a href="https://www.mugglecast.com/quizzitch/">Submit your answer</a>!</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This week, the MuggleCasters tackle the fiercest Hogwarts house of them all with their main discussion centered on Gryffindor! Joining the discussion is long-time friend of the show and boyfriend of Andrew, Pat! The panel of current and former Gryffindors talk about the good and the bad traits of Gryffindor, like why being bold can be a bad thing, and how being "daring" can mean you like to get into trouble. The hosts also examine Gryffindor's security system, ask why it is so insecure, and how famous Gryffindors like Minerva McGonagall and Peter Pettigrew fit into their house assignments!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>On this episode we conclude our epic House-themed discussions with Gryffindor House!</li>
<li>What do daring, nerve and chivalry have to do with the panel's own experiences as former/current Gryffindors?</li>
<li>Is the Sorting Hat's description of Gryffindors the complete picture? Why is Pottermore's welcome letter for Gryffindors so hilariously short?</li>
<li>We examine the good and bad of Gryffindor, including their readiness to admit fault once they've been proven wrong, their hot-headedness and ill temper, and loyalty to one another.</li>
<li>Is everything Snape said about Gryffindors true? We examine moments between he and the Marauders.</li>
<li>What does it mean that Gryffindor House has had two pairs of troublemakers that we know of across two generations?</li>
<li>What happens when Gryffindors fight each other? Seamus and Harry's argument in Book Five may give us insight into the personalities of Gryffindor.</li>
<li>The Fat Lady's password system STINKS! It's a security nightmare! </li>
<li>Notable Gryffindors include Dumbledore, McGonagall and... Peter Pettigrew? The hosts discuss who fits in and who doesn't.</li>
<li>Quizzitch: The Sorting Hat tells us that Hufflepuff came from Valley Broad, Slytherin from Fen, and Ravenclaw from Glen, but from where did Godric hail?</li>
<li>This week's episode is brought to you by Quip -- get $5 off a mouthwash starter kit at <a href="http://www.GetQuip.com/muggle5">GetQuip.com/muggle5</a>
</li>
<li>Coming up later this week on Bonus MuggleCast, <a href="http://www.patreon.com/mugglecast">available on Patreon</a>, the hosts discuss HBO Max's new Harry Potter Hub, where the platform makes TV and Movie suggestions based on what Hogwarts House you're in. Do we agree with HBO Max's choices? Definitely not -- Laura is hurt by the Ravenclaw picks.</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Intelligence. Wisdom. Learning. Wit. Our four-part series on the Houses of Hogwarts continues this week with Ravenclaw (be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.mugglecast.com/episode-526-in-defense-of-slytherin-house/">Slytherin</a> and <a href="https://www.mugglecast.com/episode-527-in-defense-of-hufflepuff-house/">Hufflepuff</a> episodes)! Andrew and Eric are surprised with just how critical Micah and Laura are of their own house (but, honestly, would you expect anything less of Ravenclaws?). Join us as we "look down" upon the Hogwarts grounds from high atop Ravenclaw Tower and discuss some of the House's most notable members!<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Main Discussion: Ravenclaw House</li>
<li>Could Ravenclaw be the house we know the least about?</li>
<li>Does the Sorting Hat group Ravenclaws together based on academic prowess, regardless of their intent? </li>
<li>Why was Hermione not sorted into Ravenclaw?</li>
<li>What makes Micah and Laura Ravenclaws... Andrew and Eric have some ideas!</li>
<li>Do certain descriptions of Ravenclaws, especially that of their common room, make them come across as elitist?</li>
<li>What sort of students were the hosts during their younger years?</li>
<li>What does it mean for Ravenclaw House that Luna was the character most often referred to as being authentically herself?</li>
<li>What do we make of Cho Chang, a Ravenclaw, being Harry’s first love interest?</li>
<li>Would the reader's perspective have changed at all knowing the first two Defense Against the Dark Arts professors/frauds were both Ravenclaws?</li>
<li>We discuss other notable Ravenclaws, including Garrick Ollivander, Sybill Trelawney, Filus Flitwick, The Grey Lady and more !</li>
<li>Quizzitch: On which floor at Hogwarts can you find the staircase that leads directly to the door to Ravenclaw’s common room? Visit <a href="http://www.MuggleCast.com/Quizzitch">MuggleCast.com/Quizzitch</a> to submit your answer!</li>

Join Andrew, Eric, Micah and Laura as they discuss the qualities possessed by Hufflepuff students, examine why Hufflepuff does not get much glory in the books, and why everyone should want to know a Hufflepuff in real life.

</li>
<li>We begin the episode with a fun segment, "The Top 5 Most Disparaging Scenes Featuring Hufflepuff"!</li>
<li>Main Discussion: While they may have been "picked last for kickball" in the books, Hufflepuffs may represent the best of us.</li>
<li>A brief video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smu0RneksxI">of the author</a> from after the books were published seems conciliatory to all Hufflepuffs burned by their book representation.</li>
<li>What do traits such as "just" and "loyal" mean? What are the values of hard work and patience, and why do Hufflepuffs prefer to walk the quiet road to glory?</li>
<li>Helga Hufflepuff's philosophy of "I'll teach the lot, and train them up the same" is actually the best policy when it comes to education, Laura explains.</li>
<li>Eric shares which moments from the <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/outcome/hufflepuff">Hufflepuff Welcome Letter</a> made him feel most at home in his new house.</li>
<li>Other famous Hufflepuffs: from Newt AND his brother Theseus, to Helga herself, Hepzibah Smith, the founder of Hogsmeade and more, just which witches and wizards wore the badger when they were at Hogwarts?</li>
<li>Each hosts says something nice about Hufflepuff House and listeners give their thoughts!</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode of MuggleCast, we're discussing Tina Goldstein's role following the events of The Crimes of Grindelwald, and what lies ahead! Plus, we revisit our predictions made after seeing her in the first Fantastic Beasts movie.<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to Slug Club Member Deanna and Alohomora's Katy Haile!</li>
<li>Fantastic Beasts Character Discussion: Tina Goldstein and her role in The Crimes of Grindelwald</li>
<li>We revisit some of the things we mentioned back in <a href="https://www.mugglecast.com/episode-320-tina/">Episode 320</a> during our initial Tina discussion to see if anything held true in Crimes of Grindelwald!</li>
<li>Did her standoffishness subside? Did she get her mojo back after catching Grindelwald? What does Tina's horoscope say about her character? What happened to Tina's story between movies? Why did she never reach out to Newt about the photo of him and Leta? Why didn't Queenie help to clarify the situation?</li>
<li>Tina The Auror &amp; The Search for Credence</li>
<li>Why was she so easily duped by Yusuf Kama?</li>
<li>What will Tina and Queenie’s relationship be like now that she has (supposedly) sided with Grindelwald? Are we headed toward a showdown between sisters?</li>
<li>Knowing World War II will serve as a backdrop to future Fantastic Beasts films, how concerned should we be for the Goldstein family?</li>
<li>What can we expect of her future relationship with Newt? Will it be a very minor subplot?</li>
<li>Was Tina catching Grindelwald at the end of the first movie foreshadowing of what’s to come? Will Credence save her much like she has saved him?</li>
<li>New Game: Whose Eyes Are They?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: As of the late 20th century, Tina Goldstein lived with her husband Newt Scamander in Dorset with their pet Kneazles, what were their pets’ names? Visit <a href="http://www.MuggleCast.com/Quizzitch">MuggleCast.com/Quizzitch</a> to submit your answer!</li>

<li>Could Travers already be working for the Dark side in the time of <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em>? He's got family history.</li>
<li>Bellatrix's comment about Snape's neighborhood leaves one listener asking if his home town puts Snape in hot water with the Death Eaters.</li>
<li>That same listener asks why NOBODY told Harry that Snape and Lily were childhood friends! Lupin, Sirius, and Dumbledore all hide that fact for their entire lives.</li>
<li>Did the Hogwarts Sorting Hat always reflect Salazar Slytherin's bias?</li>
<li>The hosts reflect on which scenes from the Potter films most improved on the books.</li>
<li>In this month's Throwback Email, an Australian listener details WW2 references present in Grindelwald's backstory.</li>

<li>Our character discussions return as we celebrate the birthday of Neville Longbottom!</li>

<li>Had Voldemort marked Neville as his equal, would a similar situation have played out with Alice sacrificing herself to save her son? </li>

<li>The hosts give their reactions to the movies pairing Neville and Luna together.</li>

<li>Was Neville always doomed to feeling “second best” even if  he had a more supportive parental figure?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>We continue our discussion on the most shocking moments in Harry Potter fandom history, with some stories you'll remember -- and others you probably forgot!</li>
<li>In 2012, Micah discovered that JKR had announced she was actively working on a Harry Potter Encyclopedia, but it was <a href="https://www.mugglenet.com/2012/05/rowling-has-no-firm-plans-to-publish-potter-encyclopedia/">quickly retracted</a> once the story got out.</li>
<li>In 2013, Rowling was outed as male author Robert Galbraith by a lawyer's... wife's... friend... and a British newspaper.</li>
<li>Later that same year, only a week after MuggleCast "ended," the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> film series was announced!</li>
<li>Years later, can we all agree <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> IS a prequel?</li>
<li>Dumbledore's appearance in <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em> and the casting of Jude Law was a delightful surprise.</li>
<li>In 2016, more Wizarding World schools were announced, and controversy may have prevented us from getting more that were promised.</li>
<li>The same year, the stage show Cursed Child is announced, and debuts in 2 parts! We revisit the original description of the show, which is very different than the final product.</li>
<li>Honorable mentions submitted by our listeners include Ron/Hermione regrets, Rowling on Twitter, and the Wizards Unite game.</li>
<li>We also reflect on the actors we've lost over the years.</li>
<li>To wrap up our discussion, each of the hosts speculates on which crazy "impossible" idea will be the next shocking news story in fandom.</li>
<li>Quizzitch: Who portrayed the character of Barry Fairbrother on the BBC series adaptation of the Casual Vacancy? Visit <a href="http://www.MuggleCast.com/Quizzitch">MuggleCast.com/Quizzitch</a> to submit your answer!</li>

<li>Welcome back Andy, of <a href="http://www.harrypotterfanzone.com">Harry Potter Fan Zone</a> (and <a href="http://www.PotterNoMore.com">PotterNoMore.com</a>)!</li>
<li>This is Part 1 of a two-part episode, wherein the hosts discuss the most Shocking Moments in Harry Potter Fandom History.</li>
<li>First up: In 2005, JK Rowling invites fan site heads Emerson and Melissa <a href="https://www.mugglenet.com/j-k-rowling/jkr-interview-mugglenet-leaky-cauldron/">to her house</a>!</li>
<li>In 2007, before <em>Deathly Hallows</em> and high-speed internet, a live stream revealed a new Harry Potter theme park! What was the significance of a Potter-themed park at the time?</li>
<li>...but Andy had already been to a Harry Potter theme park, down in Australia, called Warner Bros. "Movie World"!</li>
<li>Also in 2007, JKR Fan Site Award winner The HP Lexicon was taken to court by JKR/WB over their plans for a book. How did this feel to us as fellow fan site workers?</li>
<li>The split that changed it all: How WB's decision to break up <em>The Deathly Hallows</em> changed history and set the bar for future film franchises to come.</li>
<li>Half-Blood Prince's unexpected release date postponement disappointed fans like few things had at the time. Andrew had made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tXUH5FUIl4">reaction video</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkSK1l47ANI">new version of the HBP trailer</a>.</li>
<li>Pottermore announced: We discuss the early days of the website, why it was so special, and what ultimately happened to it.</li>
<li>Stay tuned next week for more shocking news moments, like the time JKR confirmed she was finally writing an Encyclopedia, Fantastic Beasts coming into existence, the earliest Cursed Child information, and so much more.</li>

<li>Welcome <a href="https://www.swishflickcast.com/">Swish and Flick</a>'s Meg &amp; Katie!</li>
<li>Main Discussion: Celebrating Pride Month in the Harry Potter fandom</li>
<li>Andrew, Meg &amp; Katie share their personal experiences of coming out and the feeling of safety in the Potter fan community</li>
<li>What is it about the Harry Potter fandom that makes it a welcoming place for diversity? What have the hosts noticed about inclusion at Potter events?</li>
<li>What’s a “different” thing about the other hosts that the fandom didn’t judge them for?</li>
<li>Why was it such a big deal to reveal Dumbledore's sexuality? What other gay characters were in pop culture at the time?</li>
<li>How important is it for us to remember the time at which the Harry Potter series was written?</li>
<li>Does the lack of an LGBTQ+ character in the Harry Potter series speak to its larger diversity issue?</li>

<li>The Harry Potter Store in New York City is now open. Will Micah be going?</li>
<li>In celebration of the character's birthday, today we are discussing all things Draco Malfoy.</li>
<li>Malfoy's name implies he will act in bad faith, and his horoscope suggests a duality of character. Do the hosts agree?</li>
<li>According to <em>LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</em>, Malfoy's Boggart is Lord Voldemort. Is this canon? Are there any other things his Boggart might be?</li>
<li>We all agree Tom Felton was an excellent choice for Draco, and we love how active he is in fandom today.</li>
<li>Fun Segment: To kick off our in-depth character analysis, the hosts recap the Top 7 Moments Draco was a Jerk</li>
<li>While the first four moments were concerning, the top three moments could have or did result in the loss of life!</li>
<li>Can Draco Malfoy be redeemed? How much of his upbringing is to blame for his casual racism?</li>
<li>Is there a "sweet spot" age where Draco can be held responsible for all of his actions, and if so, when?</li>
<li>Drawing from <em>Cursed Child</em>, all the hosts strangely agree that Draco would be a good father as a result of his actions.</li>
<li>Are there actions of Draco's that are truly unforgivable? What behavior would the hosts never forgive in their personal life?</li>
<li>Which characters from <em>Harry Potter</em> would never forgive Draco? Which ones would?</li>
<li>Finally, the hosts all try to say something nice about Draco!</li>
<li>Quizzitch: The constellation Draco was so named for its appearance of being like a dragon.. Who first named the constellation Draco?Visit <a href="http://www.MuggleCast.com/Quizzitch">MuggleCast.com/Quizzitch</a> to submit your answer!</li>

<li>Main Discussion: Former MuggleNet Fan Fiction moderator Laura Tee is here to discuss fanfic!</li>
<li>Have the MuggleCast hosts read fanfic before? Why or why not? Was there a stigma attached in the early days?</li>
<li>Laura runs through some common Harry Potter fanfic tropes including American exchange students, students getting "HOT" over the summer, and replacement love interests for Snape.</li>
<li>The hosts have each read some of the most popular Potter fanfics as suggested by our listeners, and are here to dish!</li>
<li>In "<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522">The Very Secret Diary</a>" by Arabella, Laura found a depth to Ginny's character that was lacking for her in the books.</li>

<li>
<em>Debt of Time</em> is so massive that it even has its own read-through podcast, <a href="https://www.fwhpod.com/">Firewhisky and Honey</a>.</li>
<li>Micah's choice for fan fiction, "<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6337916/1/In-the-Light-Of-the-Stars">In the Light of the Stars</a>" by little0bird, features a lot of diversity as a teenaged McGonagall navigates wartime Britain.</li>
<li>Draco and Hermione meet repeatedly for coffee in Andrew's new favorite fanfic, "<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/23875939/chapters/57393508">Remain Nameless</a>" by HeyJude19.</li>
<li>After talking about SO MUCH fan fiction, and listing off some honorable mentions, the hosts try their own hand at writing fanfiction with prompts given to them by Laura!</li>
<li>Andrew reads his heartwarming meetcute for adult Scorpius Malfoy and Albus-Severus Potter.</li>

<li>News: Warner Bros' <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max">recent deal with Regal</a> means a shorter window between theaters and streaming for future Wizarding World films.</li>
<li>This week, we focus our attention on Fred and George Weasley, in celebration of their April 1st birthday.</li>
<li>Following up on <a href="https://www.mugglecast.com/episode-503-ron-weasley-podcast/">our Ron discussion</a>, we read the Twins' horoscope (Aries) for insight into their personality.</li>
<li>Is it strange for George to marry Angelina Johnson, after Fred's death? The hosts weigh in.</li>
<li>The Weasley Twins have traits that can be found in each of their other family members, like Percy's ambition and Arthur's ingenuity.</li>
<li>Are Fred and George the most entrepreneurial characters in <em>Harry Potter</em>?</li>
<li>Eric asks: Can readers readily tell the twins apart from one another in the books? It turns out, Fred and George really do have different personalities!</li>
<li>One of the twins often "goes too far," while the other is more restrained. The hosts read textual evidence to support the findings.</li>
<li>From harming childhood pets to forcing Unbreakable Vows and feeding acid pops, one Weasley Twin sure has a mean streak, even toward his family members!</li>
<li>Check out <a href="https://www.mugglecast.com/episode-235/">MuggleCast #235</a> for our interview with Oliver Phelps.</li>
<li>Our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mugglecast/">patrons</a> weigh in on the top Weasley Twins moments... together.</li>
<li>On Bonus MuggleCast, available on Patreon this week, the hosts celebrate March Madness by competing in a Weasley Twins Quotes bracket</li>

<li>We asked our listeners, following <a href="https://www.mugglecast.com/episode-505-best-harry-potter-fan-films/">last week's discussion</a>, what fan films they would like to see made.</li>
<li>From Arthur and Molly's courtship, to Regulus' thwarting of Voldemort, the hosts discuss what the best plots yet to be seen could look like.</li>
<li>Since Ilvermorny has been more or less forgotten about by the author, should fans take it back / make it their own?</li>
<li>This week's episode is all MuggleMail!</li>
<li>Theories on how Ron inherited Charlie's wand, and similarities between Hogwarts and boarding school arrive in hushed tones in new voicemails from our listeners.</li>
<li>We've received a litany of responses to our Security Nightmare series, agreeing that Hagrid, the Floo Network, the troll, and the Chamber of Secrets all prove Hogwarts is not safe.</li>
<li>We hear from a listener who homeschools her kid and loves sharing Harry Potter as a proud parent.</li>
<li>MuggleMail covers other topics such as: Could Harry and a Young Tom Riddle be romantically involved? Could Mrs. Norris be a secret Animagus? And how one listener feels about the women of Harry Potter.</li>
<li>We answer a vintage email from August 2007! Where is 13-year-old Blake now?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: What secret does the Grey Lady say Rowena Ravenclaw kept from the other founders? Visit <a href="http://www.MuggleCast.com/Quizzitch">MuggleCast.com/Quizzitch</a> to submit your answer!</li>

<li>Welcome Slug Club guest Olivia!</li>
<li>The Hogwarts Legacy video game will <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22309068/hogwarts-legacy-transinclusive-character-creation-jk-rowling">reportedly allow</a> for players to customize their character's gender identity. </li>
<li>To celebrate International Womens Day 2021, the hosts discuss achievements by women in the <em>Harry Potter</em> series</li>
<li>Not only did Lily Potter save her son, but she ended the war with Voldemort the first time, saving thousands of lives!</li>
<li>Hermione has saved Ron and Harry's lives more times than we can count!</li>
<li>Ginny overcame the trauma of Tom Riddle's teenage Horcrux and turned out well adjusted, in spite of a lack of psychological services at Hogwarts</li>
<li>Fleur Delacour and Nymphadora Tonks distinguish themselves as strong and powerful witches</li>
<li>Sirius Black's mother defeats the Order of the Phoenix! How comes nobody could get her painting down?</li>
<li>The hosts uncomfortably talk about Umbridge's attack on Privet Drive and Harry, before they even met. </li>
<li>Others we discuss include Luna, Professor McGonagall, Narcissa, and Molly.</li>
<li>Do the ladies on our panel feel like women in the series were brought to the forefront in a way they're happy with<em>?</em>
</li>
<li>To wrap up our International Womens Day celebration, the hosts tackle multiple choice trivia questions based on J.K. Rowling's <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard_of_the_Month#:~:text=Wizard%20of%20the%20Month%20was,the%20first%20of%20every%20month.">Witch or Wizard of the Month segment</a>
</li>
<li>And finally, we recognize that the author herself faced an uphill battle in the publishing industry as a woman, which she overcame.</li>

<li>Did Wizards Unite finally confirm a long-standing theory about Lavender Brown?</li>
<li>Main Discussion: All The Ways That Hogwarts Is A Security Nightmare</li>
<li>For decades, students and teachers have been lied to about Hogwarts safety! </li>
<li>Are moving staircases really a good idea?</li>
<li>The Forbidden Forest &amp; Black Lake are no place for students of any age!</li>
<li>The Triwizard Tournament? Ask Cedric Diggory how that turned out!</li>
<li>Background check, anyone? We discuss how professors like Quirrell, Lockhart, Hagrid &amp; Impostor Moody endangered the students year-after-year.</li>
<li>Quidditch... need we say more?</li>
<li>Dear Dumbledore, you REALLY couldn't find the the Chamber of Secrets? Or the giant snake?</li>
<li>The Whomping Willow (emphasis on whomping)</li>
<li>Mental health check: should students really be experiencing their worst fears (Boggarts) in  front of each other?</li>
<li>Remember that year Dementors "safeguarded" the school?</li>

<li>...and the Time Turner also turns some heads!</li>
<li>Omnioculars, Wormtail's Hand, Decoy Detonators, and Auto-Answer Quill receive mixed feedback...</li>
<li>...while the Pensieve, Quick Quotes Quill, and Hermione's beaded bag impress everyone!</li>

<li>The hosts share their reactions to the news that Mads Mikkelson will replace Johnny Depp as Grindelwald in the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> series</li>
<li>MuggleCasTBT: In May 2016, which characters did we predict we’d see in the Fantastic Beasts series? The answers may surprise you!</li>
<li>Main Discussion: Which character would we want to be in the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, and why? Charlie Weasley? Nearly-Headless Nick? For real?!?!</li>
<li>Listeners weigh in with their picks including Oliver Wood, Crookshanks, Luna Lovegood, Celestina Warbeck and more!</li>
<li>We dig deep into the Muggle Mail  bag to answer some lingering questions</li>
<li>The "real" Harry Potter fan debate continues</li>
<li>Why is Slytherin House still allowed to exist?</li>
<li>Could Sirius going to Azkaban have been part of Dumbledore's larger plan?</li>
<li>Why is Harry so good at resisting the Imperius Curse? Could it be the Horcrux?</li>
<li>Will it really be that hard for fans to adjust to a new Grindelwald?</li>
<li>Should fans stop complaining about plot holes and let J.K. Rowling finish the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> series first? One listener thinks so!</li>
<li>Quizzitch: Rhys Ifans, who plays Xenophilius Lovegood in <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em>, shares a birthday with this Canadian quiz show host. (You must answer in the form of a question)</li>

<li>Breaking News: Johnny Depp is OUT as Grindelwald! Warner Bros <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54846285">reportedly asked</a> Johnny to leave the role.</li>
<li>Andrew breaks down what happened and details a chain of events.</li>
<li>Why is this happening now, and why didn't it happen sooner?</li>
<li>WB gave him the professional courtesy of stepping down with dignity, but was Johnny Depp actually fired?</li>
<li>Is <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> a doomed series? Is it a sinking ship of controversy? Is it <em>cursed</em>?</li>
<li>Hosts read listener-submitted casting suggestions for a new Grindelwald, and we present our own suggestions!</li>
<li>Would Colin Farrell come back as Graves/Grindelwald, and would that make sense?</li>
<li>Will Grindelwald's appearance be worked into the plot of future films? And will this still be 5-part series?</li>
<li>Guess That Book returns! Can the hosts correctly guess what Harry Potter book that four out-of-context audio clips are from?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: Actor Jamie Campbell Bower starred alongside Johnny Depp in what film before <em>FB2</em>?</li>

<li>MuggleMail includes MORE casting of gingers, Sorting Hats, Slytherins and Aussies.</li>
<li>Could the eventual <em>Potter</em> TV show be on network television, rather than a streaming app?</li>
<li>Our main discussion this week is about orphans in literature! Why are there so many, and how are they alike?</li>
<li>Are there benefits for authors wanting to start a hero off with a blank slate that makes orphaning them appealing?</li>
<li>How does Harry's orphan status affect him? What would change if Lily and James survived?</li>
<li>What about Voldemort? He, too, is an orphan, but he and Harry are so different, or are they?</li>
<li>We examine some other notable orphans: Batman, Superman, Anna and Elsa from <em>Frozen</em>, James Bond and even Jane Eyre!</li>
<li>For Quizzitch: Who invented the spell Muffliato??</li>

<li>Should MuggleCast make Umbridge pillows that you can punch? And, finally, a mention of Umbridge from <em>Half-Blood Prince</em> is brought to our attention.</li>
<li>In our Main Discussion, we ask Marissa about the creation of <a href="https://amzn.to/3kP0ibP"><em>The Unofficial Harry Potter Character Compendium: MuggleNet's Ultimate Guide to Who's Who in the Wizarding World</em></a>. How did this book come about, how did they gather information on over 700 characters, and which characters stood out to her in her research?!</li>
<li>Special sections in the Barnes &amp; Noble edition discuss MuggleNet's favorite non-canon characters, and who is the REAL hero of the Harry Potter series?</li>
<li>What is the role of a fan site in 2020? We discuss the early days of MuggleNet and where it stands today</li>
<li>The hosts play <em>GUESS. THAT. CHARACTER!</em>

<li>Some of your favorite Potter actors are back to voice The Tales of Beedle The Bard audiobook</li>
<li>MuggleCasTBT recalls a time when we discussed J.K. Rowling <a href="https://twitter.com/MuggleCast/status/1233208321706020865">potentially writing</a> under a pseudonym.</li>
<li>Muggle Mail covers becoming inspired to teach, the Hog's Head and the Room of Requirement.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.mugglecast.com/harry-potter-chapter-chapter-analysis-archive/">Chapter-by-Chapter</a> continues with Order of the Phoenix – Chapter 19: The Lion &amp; The Serpent.</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: The Quidditch match features Draco falling out.</li>
<li>Dumbledore's Army is going swimmingly. Harry really IS a teacher!</li>
<li>Is Luna the best representation of inter-house cooperation at Hogwarts?</li>
<li>We discuss whether "Weasley Is Our King" is bullying or just typical sportsmanship.</li>
<li>It's insane how the staff reacted to Harry and George’s attack versus the taunting on the field, which no one tried to stop.</li>
<li>WHERE is Dumbledore? And where was Hermione to set another fire in the stands?</li>
<li>Isn’t there a charm for earplugs? Ron doesn’t need to hear to be a good Keeper.</li>
<li>Honestly, is Draco any good at Quidditch?</li>
<li>McGonagall vs. Umbridge</li>
<li>McGonagall: the star Quidditch player - it runs in her family!</li>
<li>On Fred: Can you lifetime ban someone for something you thought they were “about to” do? And why is this described as a lifetime ban?</li>
<li>Is this an opportunity where Harry, if he had known Umbridge’s backstory, could have used it to his advantage.</li>
<li>Everything is terrible this chapter, but Hagrid is back!</li>
<li>The Umbridge Suck Count climbs to 40!</li>
<li>The Debate returns as Andrew &amp; Micah and Laura &amp; Eric team up to debate Umbridge's punishments!</li>

<li>Reminder: MuggleCast is moving to Tuesdays! Each week we'll have a new episode available bright and early.</li>
<li>A 'flagship' Harry Potter store has been announced, where we'll be able to grab coffee, Butterbeer, and... 'House Wands'?!</li>
<li>Chapter by Chapter: Order of the Phoenix Chapter 13, Detention with Dolores</li>
<li>This chapter is very unlucky for Harry. Are all Chapter 13's in the Harry Potter series the same way?</li>
<li>Theory: Every chapter ever is unlucky for Harry.</li>
<li>Fred and George are getting away with their testing -- until Hermione steps in. Why this moment was truly 'below the belt' for the twins.</li>
<li>What's going on with Hermione and her crusade to free the elves? We don't see her doing any work that the elves do.</li>
<li>We learn that Bowtruckles can actually be quite evil. How could Newt keep one so close to his eye balls? It's Security Nightmare: Pickett Edition!</li>

<li>Andy from <a href="https://www.harrypotterfanzone.com/">Harry Potter Fan Zone</a> joins the show and shares the history of his website and how he received the prestigious J.K. Rowling Fan Site Award</li>
<li>The hosts share the Harry Potter gifts they received during the holidays</li>
<li>Chapter-by-Chapter returns with Order of the Phoenix - Chapter 12: Professor Umbridge</li>
<li>Seven Word Summary: Classes begin for the term despite attitudes</li>
<li>Harry’s troubles continue: Seamus bolts early in the morning, Dean is at a loss for words and Lavender isn’t buying Harry’s story either.</li>
<li>Hermione once again raises the importance of House unity. But is Hogwarts set up well for such a thing?</li>
<li>Does Dumbledore, in fact, not want to draw attention to Hagrid's absence?</li>
<li>Fred &amp; George are in search of test subjects! Why couldn’t the Gryffindor Head Boy or Head Girl handle them?</li>
<li>Why doesn't Harry own up to giving the Weasley twins their money for the joke shop?</li>
<li>Kissy Kissy! Cho is back. Enter Ron - Master Wandblocker! </li>
<li>Is J.K. Rowling trying to tell the reader something about jumping on bandwagons?</li>
<li>Harry has his worst day of classes: History of Magic, Potions, Divination, DADA</li>
<li>What classes when we were kids could we just not get through?</li>
<li>With Hagrid gone and Umbridge teaching DADA, Harry really has no classes he enjoys! </li>
<li>Does Snape ride Harry hard because he sees potential in him or because he's an ass?</li>
<li>Umbridge raises the point that Defense Against The Dark Arts at Hogwarts has been rather disrupted and fragmented. She's not wrong, is she?</li>
<li>So, we’re going back to basics? We could see doing this for one or two lessons, but the entire year?</li>
<li>What does Umbridge having a short wand mean?</li>
<li>Do we believe this new DADA class was really carefully devised by experts at the Ministry?</li>
<li>Is Umbridge wrong about Lupin?</li>
<li>Parvati raises a great point about the practical nature of their O.W.L.s. So, the students should just show up and perform a spell? Isn’t Umbridge setting the students up for failure? Wouldn’t it be a poor reflection on her if all of her students fail their O.W.L.s?</li>
<li>Have a biscuit, Potter!</li>
<li>Umbridge Suck Count, Connecting The Threads, MVP of the Week, Rename The Chapter return</li>
<li>Quizzitch: What has Hermione been making over the summer?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this special installment, Rori Porter, a transfemme member of the Harry Potter fandom, joins the MuggleCasters to discuss why J.K. Rowling's December 19th tweet was transphobic and hurtful. <br>
<br>
Rori explains the court battle the tweet is in reference to, what Rowling's doing by saying this, and how it affects trans people. We also discuss the role inclusion and acceptance has played in the Harry Potter fandom, and where we go from here.<br>

<strong>Please note: </strong>This episode was recorded prior to J.K. Rowling's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/world/europe/jk-rowling-maya-forstater-transgender.html?searchResultPosition=1">controversial tweet</a>, which was harmful to the transgender community and allies. As <a href="https://twitter.com/MuggleCast/status/1207715938906320896">we stated</a> on Twitter, trans rights are human rights. We see you, we love you. You are valid. We will always welcome you! We'll share additional thoughts on the situation in Episode 448.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In our final episode of 2019, we take a look back at another Decade of Harry Potter by reliving the biggest moments and surprises of the past 10 years. What were we feeling then, how do we feel now, and what does it all mean for the decade ahead? Events discussed include: <br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>June 18, 2010: The Wizarding World of Harry Potter officially opens in Orlando (and basically saves Universal theme parks)!</li>
<li>November 19, 2010: <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 1</em> hits theaters. It sets a trend for a single book to be split into two films, but this trend may've died this decade too.</li>
<li>July 15, 2011: The final <em>Harry Potter</em> film, <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 2</em>, is released worldwide! The hosts share their feelings after the final movie, taking into consideration the number of years spent in the fandom.</li>
<li>April 12, 2012: J.K. Rowling <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jk-rowlings-adult-post-harry-potter-book-casual-vacancy-311519">announces</a> her first post-<em>Potter</em> novel, <em>The Casual Vacancy. </em>Only one person on the panel has finished it.</li>
<li>April 14, 2012: Pottermore launches at a time when people truly craved more from J.K. Rowling.</li>
<li>April 2013: In one of the most shocking moments of the decade, J.K. Rowling secretly publishes <em>The Cuckoo’s Calling</em> under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. We discuss how word leaked.</li>
<li>August 27, 2013: MuggleCast ends... and then... two weeks later... Warner Bros. announces the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> film series.</li>
<li>December 19, 2013: We hear rumblings that a <em>Harry Potter</em> play is in development, and it looks nothing like what it became. </li>
<li>January 14, 2016: Wands raised! Alan Rickman, the actor who brilliantly portrayed Professor Severus Snape passes away at 69.</li>
<li>November 18, 2016: Magic returns to the silver screen as <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> hits theaters</li>
<li>November 19, 2018: <em>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</em> opens in theaters</li>
<li>Spring 2019: J.K. Rowling leaves Twitter. Will she ever get back to her usual daily tweeting? </li>
<li>October 2, 2019: Pottermore officially shuts down.</li>
<li>What do we expect in the decade ahead for Potter? </li>
<li>Quizzitch: What characters from the original Harry Potter series have also been in both Cursed Child and the Fantastic Beasts series?</li>
<li>Bonus MuggleCast: We discuss the things we think will definitely NOT happen in the next decade in Potter!</li>

<li>Mike from Potterless Podcast joins the show! He shares why he got into the series so late and some of the moments that shocked him the most.</li>
<li>Chapter-by-Chapter continues with Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 8 - The Hearing</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Harry is attacked by Fudge but Dumbledore prevails</li>
<li>Have any of us ever been before a judge?</li>
<li>Given Harry is being charged with UNDERAGE magic, isn’t it ridiculous an adult can’t accompany him to trial?</li>
<li>Where exactly was Harry’s owl sent? Was it even sent at all?</li>
<li>We’re introduced to Fudge’s “right-hand“ woman... Dolores Jane Umbridge!</li>
<li>Why do we think Dumbledore arrived at the Ministry three hours early?</li>
<li>Given the number of people required for this trial, there is no way the time and location wasn’t changed at least the night prior!</li>
<li>By changing the time, is the Ministry hoping Harry would need to use magic, getting him into further trouble?</li>
<li>Is Ms. Figg a credible witness? We debate if she really saw the Dementors!</li>
<li>Dumbledore makes Fudge SUPER uncomfortable!</li>
<li>Who really sent the Dementors? Voldemort? The Ministry?</li>
<li>Do we think Fudge made the decision to implement Umbridge at Hogwarts before or after the trial?</li>
<li>Would Harry have prevailed without Dumbledore present?</li>
<li>What’s up with Harry’s heart swelling to unnatural size?</li>
<li>This could have all been solved with a little bit of Veritaserum! </li>
<li>The Umbridge sucks count grows by 2!</li>
<li>We Connect The Threads, Rename The Chapter and give our MVPs of the Week</li>
<li>Quizzitch: What nickname does Malfoy give Harry while at the Ministry?</li>

<li>One of our listeners received the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Illustrated Edition two weeks early! How does it compare to the rest of the series?</li>
<li>This week we dive into Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Chapter 4, 12 Grimmauld Place</li>
<li>Seven Word Summary: Harry shouts loudly at everyone in CAPSLOCK</li>
<li>As soon as Harry steps into the Black Family home, J.K. Rowling offers an ominous line. It's the first of many hints about Sirius' fate.</li>
<li>Rowling has enjoyed using the number 12 throughout the Harry Potter series. We review its many major uses and a couple of our other favorite commonalities.</li>
<li>Molly, who's usually a calming figure, isn't much help to Harry when he enters the Order's hideout. Should Harry have just barged into the Order meeting?</li>
<li>Harry enters ALL CAPS mode for the first time in the series. While it was justified, we don't believe he should've taken it out on Ron and Hermione.</li>
<li>What led Harry to this moment of epic fury? And what would it sound like?</li>
<li>Speaking of rage, Percy isn't happy with the rest of his family after his recent promotion was downplayed by Arthur. Did Dad step out of line?</li>
<li>Were we surprised to learn that Snape was in the Order? Good thing he leaves before dinner.</li>
<li>The Umbridge Suck Count ticks up by 1 point, while Rita Skeeter gets an honorable mention.</li>
<li>Quizzitch: What is the name of Bill Weasley’s unwitting informant into the Goblin POV?</li>

<li>We take listener feedback on British "tea" and defending Mundungus Fletcher</li>
<li>Chapter-by-Chapter continues with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 3: The Advance Guard</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Tonight the Guard rides into Grimmauld Place</li>
<li>We discuss Harry's treatment of Hedwig... his only friend at Privet Drive</li>
<li>Who should Harry be guessing is behind the Howler? Does he even consider Dumbledore?</li>
<li>Is it odd there is no further communication between Petunia and Harry? What about news on Dudley's condition?</li>
<li>The child abuse continues: eating through a cat flap and not being able to "steal" food from the fridge</li>
<li>Was Mad-Eye Moody really the best person for Harry to first encounter?</li>
<li>We discuss the members of the Advance Guard and where else they popped up in the Potter series: Remus Lupin, Mad-Eye Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Hestia Jones, Sturgis Podmore, Dedalus Diggle, Emmeline Vance, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Elphias Doge</li>
<li>Moody washes his eye - what are the chances one of the Dursleys drinks that upon their return to Privet Drive?</li>
<li>We're introduced to Tonks for the first time in the series! Did the movies do her character justice?</li>
<li>Laura wants to know.. why does Lupin look so ragged all the time?!?</li>
<li>How ignorant are the Dursleys to think they won a best-kept lawn competition in the middle of a draught? And what's the prize for winning?</li>
<li>Metamorphmagi: What would we do with this new magical ability?</li>
<li>Does the Ministry detect magic being done by the Advance Guard while at Privet Drive?</li>
<li>How do Muggles not see the Advance Guard depart Privet Drive and arrive in Grimmauld Place? What kind of magic is being used, if any?</li>
<li>We Connect the Threads, give our MVPs of the Week and Rename The Chapter!</li>
<li>Quizzitch: To what does Fred Weasley equate the concept of time?</li>

<li>Eddie Redmayne provides us a smidge of an update on Fantastic Beasts 3</li>
<li>Chapter-by-Chapter continues with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 2: A Peck of Owls</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Many owls arrive at Harry's home tonight</li>
<li>Mr. Tibbles was on the case! Good to know that Harry is being watched by... cats!</li>
<li>We question Mrs. Figg's qualifications for keeping an eye on Harry all of these years</li>
<li>If Dumbledore was so afraid of Harry using magic this summer why did he not institute a better plan for protecting him?</li>
<li>We learn Mrs. Figg had to make coming to her house miserable... so the Dursleys allowed it to continue.</li>
<li>Given his track record, is Mundungus the best person to be keeping tabs on Harry?</li>
<li>What does it say about Vernon that he thinks Dudley's condition is due to a bad bit of "foreign" tea?</li>
<li>Why wouldn't Harry be innocent until proven guilty following the Dementor attack?</li>
<li>How quickly did Mundungus get word to Dumbledore about what happened?</li>
<li>Petunia knows about Dementors... from Snape!</li>
<li>Vernon asks if Harry's lot has the death penalty! What?!?</li>
<li>Everyone in the room wonders why the Dementors are in Little Whinging… did Voldemort send them? </li>
<li>What happens when worlds collide? We share some of our personal experiences.</li>
<li>Could the Dementors have actually attacked Harry inside the Dursley's house?</li>
<li>Did a bond form between Petunia and Harry when she proves she understands what Voldemort's return means?</li>
<li>Are we at all sympathetic to Vernon’s desire to kick Harry out of the house after all that has happened? Our patrons weigh in.</li>

<li>Chapter-by-Chapter returns with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 1: Dudley Demented</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: Harry Potter fights with Dudley and Dementors</li>
<li>The introduction of Harry is very much one of a neglected child</li>
<li>What does it say about the Dursleys that they take pride in the fact that Dudley doesn’t watch the news and has no clue who the Prime Minister is?</li>
<li>What do we make of Ms. Figg  asking Harry over for tea frequently throughout the summer?</li>
<li>Are Vernon and Petunia overreacting to the “crack” that pretty much the entire neighborhood hears? Or is it fair they suspect Harry?</li>
<li>Harry's isolation: let the conversation about Dumbledore’s approach to Harry begin!</li>
<li>We analyze Harry's dreams: Cedric's death, long corridors, locked doors and more!</li>
<li>Harry is itching for a fight and tries to provoke Dudley with name-calling. What do we make of this version of Harry?</li>
<li>Who is Mark Evans? J.K. Rowling <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110720082643/http://www.jkrowling.com:80/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=49">once addressed rampant speculation</a>.</li>
<li>When the Dementors attack and Harry hears the voice inside his head - is it Voldemort or the Horcrux speaking to him?</li>
<li>Have we ever seen Harry control a Patronus through spoken word before?</li>
<li>Surprise! There's more to Ms. Figg than meets the eye!</li>
<li>We debut a new chapter-by-chapter segment... Umbridge Sucks!</li>
<li>Connecting the Threads, MVP of the Week and Rename The Chapter return!</li>
<li>We answer an email on frame narratives and take a very cute voicemail on midnight book release parties</li>
<li>Quizzitch: J.K. Rowling once said on her old website that Ms. Figg deals in the roaring trade of cross-bred cats and what?</li>

<li>Before beginning our chapter-by-chapter analysis of Order of the Phoenix, we connect the threads to Prisoner of Azkaban, since the Harry Potter series is a frame narrative (We recently did this with Sorcerer's Stone and Deathly Hallows on <a href="https://www.mugglecast.com/episode-427-connecting-sorcerers-stone-to-deathly-hallows/">Episode 427</a>). </li>

<li>In anticipation of our Order of the Phoenix chapter-by-chapter analysis we take a time turner back to the early 2000s to discuss the years before the fifth Harry Potter book.</li>
<li>The wait between Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix was three years (the longest gap!), and it was a critical period for the fandom.</li>
<li>How did the Harry Potter fan community soar during this time?</li>
<li>When did we all start discovering Harry Potter fansites?</li>
<li>What were the biggest questions heading into Order of the Phoenix?</li>
<li>Who was <a href="http://www.cosforums.com/cosarchive/archive/index.php/t-20-p-5.html">going to die</a> in the fifth book? What did Priori Incantatem truly mean? What was next for Harry, Ron and Hermione?</li>
<li>To help us out a bit, we revisited MuggleNet's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021007085736/http://www.mugglenet.com/facts.shtml">Facts About Book Five</a>!</li>
<li>What were the hosts initial thoughts of the Order of the Phoenix cover art?</li>
<li>Release party reminiscing: where were we all for the release of the fifth book?</li>
<li>Quizzitch: where did Harry get the name Hedwig?</li>

<li>Does Dumbledore govern Harry's existence from the very beginning of the series?</li>
<li>What protected Harry overnight on the Privet Drive stoop? #SecurityNightmare</li>
<li>Did Rowling know the role Sirius would play in later books?</li>
<li>Why are wizards so willing to risk exposing themselves following Voldemort's downfall?</li>
<li>Why does Dumbledore think Harry's scar will come in handy? Does Dumbledore suspect a Horcrux connection exists this early on?</li>
<li>We connect the MANY threads between Sorcerer's Stone and Deathly Hallows</li>
<li>The importance of Gringotts and Griphook</li>
<li>King's Cross and the Doorway Between Worlds</li>
<li>Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog Card and what it means for Fantastic Beasts</li>

<li>Has it inspired us to get up and move around more?</li>
<li>Why is it not as popular as Pokemon GO?</li>

<li>Welcome Slug Club member Chloe!</li>
<li>Wizards Unite is out and we discuss what we like about the game so far!</li>
<li>Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure is dealing with some launch pains</li>
<li>Chapter-by-Chapter returns with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 29 The Phoenix Lament</li>
<li>7-Word Summary: After Dumbledore's death, Harry regroups with friends</li>
<li>Harry breaks the news of Dumbledore's death and reveals the truth about Snape and Draco</li>
<li>Lupin's loses control when learning of Dumbledore's death in a way Harry has never seen. Is this because of everything Dumbledore has done for Lupin?</li>
<li>We discuss the healing impact of Fawkes' phoenix song on the Order</li>
<li>Why did Lupin or Sirius never tell Harry about Snape and Lily?</li>
<li>Given Harry had been right about Draco all year, if you were Ron and Hermione, how would you feel?</li>
<li>The Vanishing Cabinet and Hand of Glory have strong threads connecting them back to Chamber of Secrets</li>
<li>When Flitwick comes to get Snape and is mysteriously unconscious, why aren't Hermione and Luna quicker on the uptake?</li>
<li>Shouldn't the fact that Snape didn't kill Flitwick tell us that more is happening than meets the eye? Does Snape actually save Luna and Hermione's lives?</li>
<li>With Death Eaters in Hogwarts, do we think Snape is trying to act as quickly as possible to prevent them from harming the students/?</li>
<li>Why didn't the Order stop Snape and Malfoy? Why didn't they alert the Ministry?</li>
<li>Much like in Goblet of Fire, why didn't the Dark Mark trigger an immediate Ministry response?</li>
<li>We react to Fleur's response to Bill's condition and Tonks' big reveal about Lupin</li>
<li>Is Harry not trusting in McGonagall about the Horcruxes a mistake?</li>
<li>Should Hogwarts remain open?</li>

<li>Universal Orlando's Wizarding World of Harry Potter has just opened its latest coaster, Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, and we review it!</li>
<li>We're joined by The Insider's Kirsten Acuna, who rode the Motorbike Adventure with Andrew.</li>
<li>Check out Kirsten's <a href="https://www.insider.com/hagrids-magical-creatures-motorbike-adventure-review-2019-6">review of the ride</a> and her report on the <a href="https://www.insider.com/hagrids-magical-creatures-motorbike-adventure-easter-eggs-2019-6">queue's easter eggs</a>! And here's <a href="https://www.hypable.com/hagrids-magical-creatures-motorbike-adventure-review/">Andrew's review</a> on Hypable.</li>
<li>The ride's queue is intriguing: It's the ruins of Hogwarts, with inscriptions and art from students over the decades. It's here where Hagrid also birthed a Blast-Ended Skrewt.</li>
<li>Soooo about this Blast-Ended Skrewt: What large hole is spraying us while we're on the Motorbike Adventure??? </li>
<li>Andrew and Kirsten review the ride, which is a thrilling technological marvel. And riding it at night is a whole different experience! </li>
<li>The fandom has a new debate on their hands: Is the Motorbike or Sidecar the better vehicle to ride in?</li>
<li>We take questions from Patreon supporters: How does this ride compare to the others? How intense is it?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Unplug your Alexa's: Our Slug Club guest this week had her name stolen from Amazon!</li>
<li>Vans' new line of Harry Potter shoes is causing some ripples amongst fans -- how'd Hufflepuff gets the short end of the stick?</li>
<li>Andrew is in Orlando for the opening of Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure. Follow us on Instagram to get looks at the new ride!</li>
<li>MuggleMail: What would've happened if the Death Eaters weren't waiting for Dumbledore back at Hogwarts? And the best DVD/Blu-ray collection question gets answered.</li>
<li>Chapter by Chapter: Half-Blood Prince Chapter 28, Flight of the Prince.</li>
<li>Have we ever felt like Harry did in the opening of this scene, as if we're hurling through space because of a life-changing event?</li>
<li>Hogwarts Is A Security Nightmare Example #9134891: Kids running around while hearing ruckus. Where's the lock-down?</li>
<li>Warning: Never light Laura's house is on fire while her dog is inside. She will be enraged.</li>
<li>Harry has to remind Hagrid to put out his burning home. He ALSO has to remind him how to conjure one of earth's core elements: WTF?</li>
<li>Even while working for the Greater Good, Snape still takes the opportunity to besmirch James. Why so mean?</li>
<li>The Half-Blood Prince is revealed, and Snape can't stand being called a coward. What's going through his mind in this moment?</li>
<li>The movie version of this chapter is different to say the least. We compare and contrast.</li>
<li>Dumbledore's pockets are now available for everyone to peruse, and the locket presents itself. Uh oh.</li>
<li>Quizzitch: From whom does Lupin learn that Dumbledore has died?</li>
<li>Thank you to this week's sponsors: The Harry Potter Figurine Collection (<a href="http://HeroCollector.com/Wizards">HeroCollector.com/Wizards</a>), Scentbird (<a href="http://Scentbird.com/MUGGLECAST">Scentbird.com/MUGGLECAST</a> for 50% off), and ThirdLove (<a href="http://Thirdlove.com/MuggleCast">Thirdlove.com/MuggleCast</a> for 15% off).

  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>We're joined by Slug Club member Alicia, who wants to know: How does Ollivander's stay in business?</li>
<li>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is coming to Canada -- it's the sixth production!</li>
<li>MuggleMail: Horcruxes probably can't be made via assisted suicide; what's the best DVD/Blu-ray set available?; thank goodness the Trio didn't have to go into The Cave; in defense of Harry Potter.</li>
<li>We've passed 1,000 Patrons, an amazing milestone! Thank you to everyone for their support.</li>
<li>Chapter by Chapter: Half-Blood Prince Chapter 27, The Lightning Struck Tower.</li>
<li>Harry has to face one of the worst situations for a child to be in.</li>
<li>Dumbledore once again experiences The Surge: He's damn good on a broom.</li>
<li>Dumbledore speaks to Draco in a way that's reminiscent of how he'd speak to Tom.</li>
<li>Harry needs a cloak that deflects spells -- he's been frozen under the cloak twice in one book.</li>
<li>Why is Draco incapable of killing Dumbledore?</li>
<li>Would this have been a different situation if Draco were a few years older?</li>
<li>Severus... Please: This line was an amazing bit of work from Rowling.</li>
<li>Snape's Avada Kedavra isn't written like the Killing Curse typically is. Is it because Snape was also trying to A) Prove he meant it, and B) move the body away from further harm?</li>
<li>To say goodbye to Dumbledore, we read Patrons' favorite Dumbledore lines in Dumbledore (and Micah) voices.</li>
<li>In light of analyzing this scene, we revisit Andrew's Astronomy Tower of Terror ride idea. This time it has exciting new twists!</li>
<li>Quizzitch: Who did Draco mistake for being dead?</li>
<li>This week's episode is brought to you by The Wizarding World Figurine Collection from Eaglemoss Hero Collector (get two figurines for the price of one, plus free shipping, at <a href="http://HeroCollector.com/Wizards">HeroCollector.com/Wizards</a>) and OpenFit (text MuggleCast to 303030 for a FREE month trial)!</li>

  <description>*   Welcome Slug Club member Natalie!
*   News: we get our first look at animatronic Hagrid and discuss the changes coming to Pottermore!
*   Chapter-by-Chapter continues with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Chapter 26, The Cave
*   7-Word Summary: Together they enter the mysterious boat ride
*   The perfect breaststroke: what do we make of Dumbledore's new-found agility? Is it pure adrenaline? His eagerness to find the Horcrux?
*   Next level magic: it leaves traces and can be felt! Might J.K. Rowling explain this further in the Fantastic Beasts series?
*   Why does this Horcrux have the highest level of protection? Is it because it once belonged to Voldemort's mother?  
*   Has Voldemort visited the cave since he placed the Horcrux here? 
*   Why is Harry's blood more valuable upon entering the cave but not for exiting?
*   The simple approach: even in the most dangerous of situations, Dumbledore is still teaching Harry
*   Is it possible that because part of Voldemort resides within Harry, that the magic within the cave is mistaking him for Voldemort?
*   Magical weight vs. human weight and how Voldemort's tends to overlook those he considers to be &quot;less than himself&quot;
*   Does Dumbledore's reaction to the bodies in the lake reflect the fact that he's resigned himself to his fate?
*   What do we think Dumbledore is seeing when he drinks the potion? We recall we didn't have the context of Ariana when we first theorized about this in 2005!
*   Dumbledore's Ring of Fire: what spell does he cast to ward off the Inferi?
*   Despite her absence Laura does an amazing job Connecting The Threads (and planning the discussion)!
*   The hosts reveal their Horcrux Hidey Hole, MVPs of the Week and Rename The Chapter!
*   Quizzitch: Which Death Eater calls Dumbledore &quot;Dumby&quot;?

  <description>*   Universal reveals the beasts we can expect to see on Hagrid's motorbike adventure including one never seen in the films!
*   We take voicemails in defense of Slughorn, on the Room of Requirement, Harry's daydreaming and Hufflepuffs ability to find things
*   Chapter-by-Chapter continues with Chapter 23 of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Horcruxes
*   7-Word Summary: Secrets are discovered inside the Slughorn office
*   Compromised security: what's up with the Fat Lady denying Harry entrance to Gryffindor Tower? Could Felix have still been at work?
*   Dumbledore is initially shocked that Harry has acquired the memory. Did he really think Harry could do it?
*   Do we actually know where Tom first learned about Horcruxes?
*   We contrast Tom and Harry's approach to extracting information from Slughorn
*   Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to Horcruxes... really?!?! Like who?
*   We learn Dumbledore is particularly fierce about Horcruxes. Why is that? Could Grindelwald have made one?
*   Horcrux Breakdown: the diary, the ring, the locket, the cup, Nagini and something of either Gryffindor's or Ravenclaw's
*   Did part of Dumbledore's prophecy explanation reveal that Harry is a Horcrux?
*   Can Voldemort feel when one of his Horcruxes is destroyed? Not in the books, but it works in the films!
*   Does Dumbledore's rant about tyrants creating self-fulfilling prophecies mean even more now that we know more about Grindelwald?
*   The hosts rename the chapter and give their MVPs
*   Quizzitch: How long does it take to make Felix Felicis?
*   In celebration of recording on 4/20, we offer thoughts on which characters in the wizarding world like the ganga!</description>

*   Is Slughorn so elusive because he considered Harry would eventually use Felix Felicis?
*   Venomous tentacula, acromantula venom, unicorn hair... Slughorn has a side-hussle!

  <description>*   What’s up with JKR’s Twitter?&#13;
&#13;
*   Larry Potter gets nixed from the latest LEGO movie&#13;
&#13;
*   Chapter-by-Chapter continues with A Very Frosty Christmas&#13;
&#13;
*   7-Word Summary: Rufus tries to convince Harry by persuasion&#13;
&#13;
*   Do the words unbreakable vow finally make Ron a believer?&#13;
&#13;
*   Harry’s Draco argument has been rejected so many times he can hear Hermione’s response to the latest development in his head&#13;
&#13;
*   Arrests for the sake of arrests. Perception vs. reality. We dive deep into the Ministry under Rufus Scrimgeour.&#13;
&#13;
*   Does Lupin’s current state make him more sympathetic to Snape?&#13;
&#13;
*   Lupin may unknowingly provide some hints to the identity of the Half-Blood Prince&#13;
&#13;
*   How is Lupin able to go undercover without other werewolves knowing who he is?&#13;
&#13;
*   Could the Ministry take a page out of Voldemort’s book - playing to the underserved and underrepresented?&#13;
&#13;
*   We discuss how Scrimgeour goes about his conversation with Harry all wrong.&#13;
&#13;
*   Why, why would the Minister use Umbridge’s name to try and strengthen any argument he made?&#13;
&#13;
*   Is it fair Harry takes out all of his frustration towards the Ministry on Scrimgeour?&#13;
&#13;
*   Could Harry and Dumbledore have benefited from working with the Ministry?&#13;
&#13;
*   Connecting the Threads, MVP of the Week and Rename the Chapter&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
*   7-Word Summary: Rufus tries to convince Harry by persuasion&#13;
&#13;
*   Do the words unbreakable vow finally make Ron a believer?&#13;
&#13;
*   Harry’s Draco argument has been rejected so many times he can hear Hermione’s response to the latest development in his head&#13;
&#13;
*   Arrests for the sake of arrests. Perception vs. reality. We dive deep into the Ministry under Rufus Scrimgeour.&#13;
&#13;
*   Does Lupin’s current state make him more sympathetic to Snape?&#13;
&#13;
*   Lupin may unknowingly provide some hints to the identity of the Half-Blood Prince&#13;
&#13;
*   How is Lupin able to go undercover without other werewolves knowing who he is?&#13;
&#13;
*   Could the Ministry take a page out of Voldemort’s book - playing to the underserved and underrepresented?&#13;
&#13;
*   We discuss how Scrimgeour goes about his conversation with Harry all wrong.&#13;
&#13;
*   Why, why would the Minister use Umbridge’s name to try and strengthen any argument he made?&#13;
&#13;
*   Is it fair Harry takes out all of his frustration towards the Ministry on Scrimgeour?&#13;

  <description>*   Laura returns as we hit 400 episodes!&#13;
&#13;
*   What Potter gifts did the hosts get for the holidays? Does Andrew have to return his to NJ Transit? See a photo of the gift on [MuggleCast.com](http://mugglecast.com/episode-400-evanesco/).&#13;
&#13;
*   Our patrons put Laura on the hot seat as she answers some tough Potter questions&#13;
&#13;
*   Pottermore's #NationalTriviaDay tweet creates a real sh*t storm by saying Hogwarts didn't have bathrooms pre-18th Century&#13;
&#13;
*   So… did they really just do their business wherever they stood?&#13;
&#13;
*   Who teaches younger students how to wipe up after themselves?&#13;
&#13;
*   Why bother adding bathrooms to Hogwarts at all?&#13;
&#13;
*   Did wizards never see a need for a private place for them to relieve themselves?&#13;
&#13;
*   We dig deep into our MuggleMail bag and retrieve some vintage emails just for Laura&#13;
&#13;
*   After six years, Laura finally becomes Lady Geek of the Week, learns she correctly predicted Neville's head on fire and has a best friend named Eve&#13;
&#13;
*   Voicemails cover a Kowalski descendant, Newt's expulsion, Queenie's mental state, a Leta horcrux and more&#13;
&#13;
*   The Dueling Club is back featuring characters from The Crimes of Grindelwald&#13;
&#13;
*   Quizzitch: Which Slytherin student prevented the Chamber of Secrets from being discovered?&#13;
&#13;
*   Chicken Soup comes all the way from Pakistan!&#13;
&#13;
*   And the hosts entertain this Crackpot Theory: Is Aurelius Dumbledore a homunculus?&#13;
&#13;
*   In Bonus MuggleCast, [available on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/bonus-mugglecast-23816495), we discuss a strange Harry Potter book, Crimes of Grindelwald's prophecy, and Hermione's actions in Half-Blood Prince.</description>

  <description>*   We check our initial predictions - who got the opening weekend box office total right?&#13;
&#13;
*   Eric and Andrew give their thoughts after seeing the movie for a second time&#13;
&#13;
*   Could an elusive iceberg creature have caused the Atlantic shipwreck?&#13;
&#13;
*   What's up with the Deathly Hallows being carved into a Hogwarts desk?&#13;
&#13;
*   How did Dumbledore know to warn Theseus about Grindelwald's rally? Did he tip off Nicolas Flamel as well?&#13;
&#13;
*   Mirror of Erised: Is Dumbledore's greatest desire now undoing the blood pact?&#13;
&#13;
*   Andrew and Micah dive deep into the Crimes of Grindelwald script book&#13;
&#13;
*   Do a few initially missed moments suggest Grindelwald is leading Credence on?&#13;
&#13;
*   We analyze Dumbeldore's description of an obscurus and The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus&#13;
&#13;
*   Did we miss an early clue when Leta says to Dumbledore: &quot;not unless you had a brother who died too&quot;?&#13;
&#13;
*   Dumbledore was in the Room of Requirement when he looks into the Mirror of Erised&#13;
&#13;
*   Was Leta's death intentionally ambiguous? If both her and Corvus Jr. are gone, how does the Lestrange bloodline continue on?&#13;
&#13;
*   JKR has been hinting at Aurelius for over two years on her website!&#13;
&#13;
*   Voicemails cover calls from inside the theater, Queenie's allegiance, Tina, Leta, Nagini and more!&#13;
&#13;
*   A great email analysis on Aurelius, Credence, Corvus and the raven/phoenix chick&#13;
&#13;
*   Listeners call in live with their thoughts and questions!&#13;
&#13;
*   Quizzitch: According to the “Crimes of Grindelwald” screenplay / film, what is Travers' official position at the Ministry of Magic?&#13;

*   Do we really believe JKR has been keeping this secret for 20 years?  

*   Jamie Campbell Bower &amp; Toby Regbo reprise their roles as young Grindelwald &amp; Dumbledore  

*   What does this mean for future films? Will their relationship finally be explored?  

*   Why can't Dumbledore move against Grindelwald? Convenient excuse or something more magical?

  <description>*   … Did that work? Is he listening to this episode?&#13;
*   With Micah gone this week, we're joined by two of our listeners, Alex and Stefanie, who do their best impressions of the NY News Anchor.&#13;
*   Patrons in the U.S. have received their mugs, but we need to know if they arrived okay! And if yours arrived broken (rare but possible), let us know.&#13;
*   This week's episode is [sponsored by Puffs the Play](http://puffstheplay.com/mugglecast)! Receive a special discount on tickets to see Puffs at New York City's New World Stages.&#13;
*   Chapter by Chapter continues with Chapter 2 of Half-Blood Prince: Spinner's End.&#13;
*   The brilliance of this chapter is how Snape is playing Bellatrix and Naricissa simultaneously but in different ways.&#13;
*   How much does Voldemort know about Dumbledore's injury? He can't know about the Horcrux… right?&#13;
*   Does one line from Bellatrix help make Delphi's existence canon?&#13;
*   Why would Bellatrix have such a hard time trusting Snape's word when Voldemort is content with his reasoning? And what should she do if she had ever learned the truth?&#13;
*   Who is the MVP of the chapter? Those poor elves…&#13;
*   We rename the chapter to reflect what really happens.&#13;
*   Crackpot Theory: Has Bellatrix made an unbreakable vow before?&#13;

  <description>- With Micah out for the week, MuggleCast welcomes our friend Nasim and one of our Patreon supporters Andy to the show!

- The MuggleCast community lost a listener and friend this week. Hug your loved ones.

- The Beedle the Bard Illustrated Edition covers are out now, and they're gorgeous!

- We forgot to discuss Tonks on last week's Mother's Day episode, so this week we share some thoughts about her decision to head to the Battle of Hogwarts as newborn Teddy stayed at home.

- Annnd that leads perfectly into our main discussion this week: The Battle of Hogwarts turns 20 (fictional) years old!

- We share our feelings reading the iconic scenes again 11 years after it was originally published. Do our feelings on it change now that we're adults?

- Was it responsible to allow students who were 'of age' to fight? What role would we have taken in defending the school? What GOOD came out of the battle (besides Voldemort's downfall)?

- Eric quizzes us on the Battle of Hogwarts. And of course, Quizzitch wraps up the show.</description>

  <description>*   Pottermore makes some staffing changes- Scholastic confirms release of Crimes of Grindelwald screenplay  

*   The mystery behind Hogwarts Mystery is revealed!  

*   Main Discussion: Crimes of Grindewald trailer roundup  

*   We breakdown the Lestrange family tree in more detail  

*   What does it mean that Leta and Credence are half-siblings? Will this test allegiances?  

*   Who is Yusuf Kama? Could it have been him staring at the family tree?  

*   Listeners fact check us on the Minister for Magic, DADA professor and headmaster during the late 1920s  

*   Did Dumbledore's comment about Newt not following directions mean Newt really isn't supposed to be in Paris?  

*   Could Grindelwald been standing before a group of peers presenting his crimes?  

*   Could the dance Leta attended be her own wedding or engagement party?  

*   What role does Leta have in all of this? Is she a casual observer to the unfolding events or does she pick a side?  

*   J.K. Rowling Sez covers Lethal White, Newt &amp; Kennilworthy Whisp's friendship and 85-year-old grandmothers  

*   We respond to tweets on Grindelwald's cell, Dumbledore's put-outer, the DADA classroom and the history of transport to Hogwarts  

*   Quizzitch: In Chamber of Secrets, what three nonsense spells does Harry aim at the bush before Dudley calls for his mother?</description>

  <description>*   Slug Club member Greg joins the show all the way from Singapore  

*   A new Hogwarts Mystery trailer has been released  

*   Cursed Child announces their Friday Forty program
*   We reveal our plans for the 777 Challenge! Learn more and see the mug design at MuggleCast.com
*   Main Discussion: Potions in the Wizarding World
*   We react to JKR stating that muggles can't properly brew potions
*   From Ageing Potions to the Elixir of Life to Mandrake Draught we run down the list of different types of potions 
*   Would the hosts be good at making them? Are we patient enough? Careful with instructions?  

*   Which potion does each host wish they could have in real life?
*   Is there a time we wish we could have used Veritaserum? Felix Felicis?
*   Over/under: How many times will Polyjuice Potion be used in Fantastic Beasts?  

*   The hosts create their own potions (assuming we're wizards of course)  

*   Patreon Question of the Week: If you could take Polyjuice Potion for an hour, who would you turn into and why?  

*   Voicemails cover Cedric Diggory, Mrs. Black, and feedback on our Fudge episode  

*   Quizzitch: Name the members of The Advance Guard that come to Privet Drive to pick up Harry in Order of the Phoenix   

*   Bonus MuggleCast: We explore the theory that the Dursleys' feelings towards Harry were magnified by the presence of a horcrux!</description>

  <description>*   Eric...? Eric...?  

*   Slug Club member Ken joins the show  

*   Guessing Game: How many books has the Harry Potter series sold to date? How many do we think are duplicate copies?  

*   Eric...? Eric...?  

*   We respond to David Yates' recent comments about how Dumbledore's sexuality will play into Fantastic Beasts 2  

*   Saying that &quot;all fans are aware of that&quot; has not sat well with...well...the fans  

*   JKR and the Wizarding World preach inclusion and acceptance but have shied away from embracing LGBTQ characters  

*   That said, Dumbledore still needs to be introduced in the Fantastic Beasts series and fans need to learn about his history with Grindelwald's  

*   We haven't seen Jude Law's portrayal of Dumbledore and we know he spent time learning about the character from Rowling  

*   Rowling is the screenwriter, she's the one who knows the backstory and she has four films to tell it  

*   Eric...? Eric...?  

*   In honor of Groundhog's Day we each create a weather-predicting fantastic beast  

*   Southern Hagrid makes an appearance  

*   Owl Post covers last weekend's Celebration of Harry Potter  

*   Voicemails return!  

*   Quizzitch: In Chapter 10 of Half-Blood Prince, &quot;The House of Gaunt,&quot; Hermione is seen working on an essay entitled what?

- Chamber of Secrets gets the House Edition treatment (and so will the rest of the series)

- Nighttime shows are coming to Wizarding World Orlando while Cursed Child rehearsals begin on Broadway

- Dan Radcliffe weighs in on the Johnny Depp/Grindelwald debate

- Ashley has her own discussion ready for the show and wants to know how Jacob will get his memory back?

- She breaks down what we know about memory charms to date and characters who've experienced them

- How exactly can a memory charm be broken? How much does Jacob remember by the end of Fantastic Beasts?

- Since the Swooping Evil venom is supposed to erase bad memories, is there a chance Jacob's memory wasn't fully erased?

- Will Jacob regain his memory in full? Will it be over time through a series of flashbacks through Fantastic Beasts 2?

- Did the murtlap bite somehow prevent him from losing his full memory?

- Could JKR offer further education on memory charms via Pottermore to prepare us?

- Main Discussion: The Gaunt Family

- Given Voldemort's recent birthday, we take a look at his family: Merope, Morfin and Marvolo

- Is there anything we actually like about these characters?

- Andrew gets incestuous asking if the other hosts would ever marry their cousins

- Could we ever love somebody after we found out they had us under a spell?

- Should Tom Riddle Sr. have sought out his son and tried to raise him?

- We discuss the distinction between Tom Riddle Jr. and Voldemort being able to love

- Do we see the Gaunt family playing a role in future Fantastic Beasts films?

- Email and text messages cover the Wizarding World's third expansion and the Potter films moving to HBO

- This Week in MuggleCast history looks at Episodes 72, 128, 168 and 189

- Quizzitch: To whom, in the Harry Potter universe, is Mark Evans related?</description>

  <description>- Welcome Slug Club member Juliana!
- It's been 13 years since the release of Prisoner of Azkaban in theaters! We reminisce. 
- The 20th anniversary editions of Philosopher's Stone have shipped!
- Fantastic Beasts Character Discussion: Credence Barebone
- How much is there still to learn about him? Who was his mother? Could his father still be alive?
- Can Credence control his powers? He's very targeted in his attacks, but his actions sometimes have unintended consequences (Chastity).
- Is it odd given how powerful Grindelwald is that he couldn't figure out Credence was the obscurial?
- Does the obscurial mask its own identity?
- We discuss Credence's relationship with Graves/Grindelwald
- Will Dumbledore extend a helping hand to Credence given what happened to Arianna?
- The Barebone name origin conversation takes an inappropriate turn
- What's next for Credence? Did he really make it onto the boat?
- Voicemails: Ron, Queenie, Grindelwald, Puffs and more!</description>

<li>Can Credence control his powers? He&#39;s very targeted in his attacks, but his actions sometimes have unintended consequences (Chastity).</li>
<li>Is it odd given how powerful Grindelwald is that he couldn&#39;t figure out Credence was the obscurial?</li>
<li>Does the obscurial mask its own identity?</li>
<li>We discuss Credence&#39;s relationship with Graves/Grindelwald</li>
<li>Will Dumbledore extend a helping hand to Credence given what happened to Arianna?</li>
<li>The Barebone name origin conversation takes an inappropriate turn</li>
<li>What&#39;s next for Credence? Did he really make it onto the boat?</li>
<li>Voicemails: Ron, Queenie, Grindelwald, Puffs and more!</li>

  <description>- Happy Birthday Eric!
- Callum Turner cast as Theseus Scamander
- What do we know about Newt's older brother besides a brief mention in Fantastic Beasts?
- We analyze the letter between brothers that never made the final cut. Would it have put too much emphasis on Grindelwald early on?
- What kind of relationship do the two brothers share? Micah and Eric have differing opinions.
- Isn't it a bit ironic that Theseus is tasked to track down Grindelwald and its Newt who catches him? How will Theseus react?
- Theseus and Graves worked together - how close did Grindelwald get to Theseus without him knowing?
- Is Theseus even still alive? Could he possibly be a Grindelwald supporter?
- Will the two brothers work together when Grindelwald inevitably escapes?
- Will Theseus die tragically like the Greek hero for which he is named?
- We share some more first Potter memories!</description>

- &quot;If you don't like the Niffler, there is something wrong with you!&quot;
- JKR wanted to have one thing that was &quot;quintessentially&quot; American - Frank the Thunderbird

  <description>We review what we’ve been up to and fandom and discuss the MAJOR news about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them!

– Andrew reminisces about LeakyCon while Eric reviews Sorcerer’s Stone in IMAX

– Does the Fantastic Beasts soundtrack offer huge insights into what we can expect to see in the film?

– We review what we know about the Fantastic Beasts mobile game…

– And Micah thinks Warner Bros is missing a big opportunity in NYC!

– Celebrating 20 Years of Magic! Make sure to get your copy of Newsweek today!

– Main Discussion: Fantastic Beasts is now a five-part movie series!

And a special guest appearance by everyone’s favorite Brit!

Who said it?! A Cursed Child character or Original Story character (or Laura)? You might be surprised!
The expansion of the Wizarding World: what would we like to see next? Has it gone too far already?
Is Pottermore becoming the clearinghouse for all things Potter?
Ilvermorny House controversy! We thought those drawings looked awfully familiar!
NOT SAFE FOR WORK! We  discuss things that definitely happened in the Potter series but JKR didn’t include because they were “kid” novels.
Aberforth and his clean goat Severus
Scabbers saw quite a bit of Weasley in his day
Love potions… as date rape drugs?
The prefect’s bathroom… an all-out orgy!
Plus Bertha Jorkins &amp; Peter Pettigrew, Polyjuice &amp; puberty, Gilderoy Lockhart and vibrating brooms!</description>

  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Court of MuggleCast is now in session.</li>
<li>We all offer our individual opinions on the case and identify the key players.</li>
<li>The trial was very emotional for both Jo and Steve but did it have to get to this point?</li>
<li>Why did RDR initially make it so difficult for Warner Bros. to obtain a copy of the book?</li>
<li>Why did Steve ask for a clause in his contract saying RDR Books would defend him should a lawsuit occur?</li>
<li>Steve initially said he would never publish the Lexicon because “that would be illegal”.</li>
<li>We review testimony given and comments made by both sides and offer our thoughts.</li>
<li>Breaking down the “fair use” doctrine, we try and get inside the head of Judge Patterson.</li>
<li>Which of the four categories of fair use would go in Jo or Steve’s favor?</li>
<li>The negative impact this could have on the Harry Potter fandom and the “floodgates” that could open.</li>
<li>We take a look at fan and media opinions of this trial.</li>
<li>Elysa brings up a few previous court cases that have dealt with the “fair use” doctrine and the precedents set seem to favor J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros. (Harper and Roe Publishers vs. Nation Enterprises).</li>
<li>Why MuggleNet’s book never faced a lawsuit – it offered commentary, analysis and theory.</li>
<li>Make the Music Connection provides some laughter after a very serious episode.</li>

<li>Portus 2008 public relations director Aziza Aba Butain joins us…</li>
<li>…to interview the narrator of the U.S. Harry Potter books Jim Dale.</li>
<li>Mr. Dale gives his thoughts on the recent Deathly Hallows split as well as the movies in general.</li>
<li>One of his sons is actually a movie helicopter operator who has worked on the Potter films.</li>
<li>What is his favorite Potter character voice? Which one is the hardest – or as he puts it – the most annoying to do?</li>
<li>He discusses how he prepares to record the Potter books: some water and a green apple anyone?</li>
<li>How long does it take him? More like how long is he given! The answer may surprise you.</li>
<li>How well does he know Stephen Fry and Mary GrandPre?</li>
<li>Does he ever read the books for enjoyment and what is his relationship with J.K. Rowling?</li>
<li>He denies using his relationship with Dumbledore to further his career.</li>
<li>Just what does he think about the HP fandom?</li>

<li>Dumbledore is gay – initial thoughts from the hosts!</li>
<li>Eric gives us a full report on MuggleCast LIVE in Australia!</li>
<li>We go over each of the questions answered at the October 19th reading in NYC.</li>
<li>Andrew, Laura, and Micah talk about meeting Jo. (Yes, life is now complete.)</li>
<li>Should Jo have revealed Dumbledore’s sexuality?</li>
<li>Why does it matter, and why is it front-page news?</li>
<li>This leads into a discussion on the presence of homosexuality and how it is regarded in society, as well as our own experiences.</li>
<li>The hosts become quite opinionated when it comes to fans who act as though Dumbledore being gay tarnishes his character.</li>
<li>The message of this episode: embrace differences and don't blindly follow the doctrine that all people must be one way, which is deemed the “right” way.</li>

<li>We announce a very BIG interview.</li>
<li>Apparently some of us didn’t see the connection between the hangman game on Jo’s site and the “Deathly Hallows”.</li>
<li>Speaking of Deathly Hallows, we have yet more ideas what it might mean!</li>
<li>We give everyone at home a short cultural lesson about death and its place in the world.</li>
<li>If the title is a reference to Halloween, does this mean spirits will return to earth?</li>
<li>Could “Hallows” be the spirits of those Voldemort murdered to create his Horcruxes?</li>
<li>Would they be able to help Harry kill Voldemort?</li>
<li>Why are Fred and George allowed to use their wands, and Hagrid can’t?</li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Peter Pettigrew – not your average garden rat. While it is clear that Wormtail aligns himself with those in power, it seems unclear as to which Death Eater the Dark Lord trusts more: Snape or Wormtail?

<br>

</div>
<div>If there is so much to talk about concerning Christmas in the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, just why do we know so little about Professor Sinistra and her Astronomy class? Are a person’s Patronus and Animagus form the same? Is Tom Felton too different from Draco’s character to be a success in later films? And while the crew debates the disappearance of Harry’s scar upon the fall of the Dark Lord, will the veil and Sirius’ mirror reappear in the Final Book? Plus, who initiated contact first: Wormtail or Voldemort?<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>From MuggleCast Christmas stories to song parodies…all that and more ahead with Andrew, Ben, Eric, Kevin, Jamie, and Laura on this week’s edition of MuggleCast.<br>
<br>

<div>The Brit is back! And he weighs in on everything from Miss Granger to Las Vegas.

<br>

</div>
<div>Snape: good or evil, bat or spider? Is JKR pulling a fast one on the fans by leaving clues INSIDE clues, or are we reading too much into it? The cast goes around the table with their opinions on Snape’s loyalty (or lack thereof) to both sides of the war. Kevin, Laura, and Eric look at <em>His Dark Materials: The Golden Compass</em> to premiere the book review segment, and we debate over which characters would win in a duel.<br>
<br>

<br>

</div>
<div>Our huge live show with PotterCast, recorded at Manhattan’s Union Square Barnes &amp; Noble right after the premiere of <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em>. More than 500 fans came out to say hello; we all were downright terrified.<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Melissa’s mom brings us reports from the official <em>Goblet</em> after-party –<br>
Emma Watson, Jamie Waylett, Robert Pattinson, Matthew Lewis, Katie<br>
Leung and Tolga Safer live on the show</li>
<li>The actors about the volume of the Barnes &amp; Noble crowd: “Oh-my-god!”</li>
<li>Andrew is extraordinarily agreeable. “Yeah? YEAH!!!”</li>
<li>Emerson and Melissa revisit the delusional debacle: Emerson comes face<br>
to face with an H/H’er</li>
<li>The real Micah Tannenbaum stood up, and his news voice sat down</li>
<li>John Noe cries</li>
<li>GOF: Better than POA? “YEAH!!!”</li>
<li>The crew discuss the film in full detail – spoilers everywhere and no one cares</li>
<li>House-elves, magical creatures, the maze, angry roots and impatient fug</li>
<li>Kevin Steck is backwards compatible</li>
<li>Dumbledore: too aggressive?</li>
<li>John summons the (clumsy) ghost of Sirius Black</li>
<li>Sue has a close encounter of the real kind with Jason Isaacs, who we<br>
learn enjoys a nice Potter podcast on his morning jog</li>
<li>Hi, Jason!</li>
<li>The scoop on Skeeter in Movie 4</li>
<li>Dan Radcliffe: looking forward to filming the Book 6 scenes with Ginny</li>
<li>Andrew “row’s” with the audience over pronunciation</li>
<li>Mama Sue warns about <em>Goblet’s</em> intense ending</li>
<li>A fan chooses the podcast over DisneyWorld (we tried to make it up to her)</li>
<li>Was it a good time? Yeah. Yeah? YEAH!</li>

<div>For a man so obsessed with choices, Dumbledore sure can’t seem to pick between Tom and Voldemort. While Ginny’s role in the Final Book is debated, was there more behind Lucius slipping the Diary in her cauldron? And parents brace yourselves.

</div>
<div>Could the <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em> have escaped death? Just what would have happened if Tom Riddle’s diary had survived the <em>Chamber of Secrets</em>? While the crew doesn’t discuss much on the new <em>Goblet of Fire</em> film, they do have an exciting contest announcement. And, did the Half-Blood Prince have special feelings for a certain someone, leading to his distaste for Harry, which we have witnessed since <em>Sorcerer’s Stone</em>? Plus, our NYC Podcast is movin’ on up!<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>This is <em>Sirius</em>ly one long, action-packed episode as the Voldemort Contest winner, Cristin Atkins, joins Andrew, Eric, Kevin, and Laura on this week’s edition of MuggleCast.<br>

<div>Philadelphia International? The Barnes &amp; Noble bathroom? Andrew wants you to come up with the wackiest, yet realistic places to podcast from. And as the crew discusses Harry?s most visible physical attribute and its connection to the final word in the last installment, is it possible that the dementors somehow <em>scarred</em> Petunia?

<div>While there is debate on whether Ralph Fiennes will make a convincing Lord Voldemort, there is no doubt that the special effects in Goblet of Fire are up to par. Just check out the film’s recently released official trailer. And why did Snape’s Killing Curse send Dumbledore sailing through the sky? It’s because he had Air Jordans on, of course. Plus, we’ve got Horcruxed hats, Inheritance interviews, a crazy contest, and a brand-new news segment. Even Yoda stops by. This was one wild show.<br>

<div>While Dumbledore got a black hand in The Half-Blood Prince, will Goblet of Fire get a black eye at the box office? New clips were revealed this week of the fourth Harry Potter film, as well as its official PG-13 rating. As the time frame for the release of the final book gets debated, just how long will HP 7 be? One fan suggested it will rival War and Peace. And just who will help Harry with his heroic Horcrux hunt? Plus, did somebody forget to clean up underneath Fawkes’ perch? Why did everybody’s favorite phoenix fail to come to Dumbledore’s aid?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On our August 14, 2005 edition of MuggleCast…<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>The Goblet of Fire and American Pie… two movies with something in common? As the fourth HP film receives a verdict on its official rating, the jury is still out on Draco Malfoy. From Ontario to Missouri, the people want to know… just who will the newest Death Eater side with? And as the clock counts down to a South Pacific world premiere, just whose time will be up by the end of Book 7? Two years… too long to conceal our thoughts. Plus, while our favorite wandmaker has gone missing, something huge was discovered about Lily Potter.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>From Dark Marks to Dark Secrets… all that and more ahead with Andrew, Kevin, and a special co-host on this edition of MuggleCast.<br>
<br>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Special co-host: Aris Janetakos</li>
<li>Special guest announcer: Ben Schoen (after feeling bad he missed out on taping the actual podcast)</li>
<li>Bear with poor Kevin…he’s got a wisdom tooth coming in</li>
<li>Main Topic: GOF is rated PG-13</li>
<li>Andrew says this one will appeal to more teens, less parent/child groups</li>
<li>Deaths = given PG-13</li>
<li>We think movies 5, 6, and 7 will also receive this prestigious award</li>
<li>Whose side is Draco on?</li>
<li>Aris and Kevin think Draco’s going to end up helping Harry</li>
<li>What did the Pensieve mean?</li>
<li>Unbreakable Vows… what are the rules?</li>
<li>Snape loves Lily</li>
<li>Poor Ollivander…where could he have gone? (Andrew’s expecting a letter from him soon)</li>
</ul>
