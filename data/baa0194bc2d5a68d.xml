They feel like they are running behind. They feel like there is some "secret formula" that's complicated & too sophisticated for them to understand. Listen...all of us feel lost & like we don't know what we're doing. In this episode, I talk about how to overcome that & we share OG stories about the early days of MFCEO.

I've been reading a ton of U.S. history, & I've learned more about the most incredible men & women our country has ever produced. It's been so impactful to me that I created a course called UNITED WE WIN: 7 Lessons in Excellence and Success From the Greatest Americans of All Time. The full course will only be available to my email subscribers, but I'm publishing the first lesson as a gift to you for Independence Day. Happy 4th of July, Mother F*ckers!</p>]]></description>

There's a bunch of people out there who really aren't succeeding & really aren't getting the results they say they want, because they don't have the right answer to the question, "will I put in the work when no one's looking?" And there are other people who are paralyzed with fear & regret because they constantly ask "what if?" Listen, regardless of the question, the answer is always GO HARD.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Why is that people nowadays think that if we disagree, we have to hate each other? Why do people think that if I share an opinion that is the opposite of yours, that it's somehow a personal attack & offensive? The media & politicians fuel this mentality & it's really killing our ability to get along & be good & decent people to one another. It's got to stop. There's a way to disagree - even strongly - with one another without despising each other. That's what we talk about in today's Sunday Sermon.</p>]]></description>

I get it. It is hard to take the negatives of life & convert them into positives. It's hard to be wronged & still do the right thing. It's really hard to go through really bad things & become a force for good in the world. But it can be done. You just have to make the choice.</p>]]></description>

But at the other end of the spectrum are people who have a lot to offer, but they don't realize it & take advantage of it. You need to resist the temptation to "discount" yourself in business & life & "price" yourself more fairly & generously. Because if you do bring something worthwhile to the world, you deserve to benefit from that.Â </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Can you draw a line in the sand? Can you decide that f*cking enough is enough and that the change you need to make is far more important than the sacrifice it will take to make it? The problem is, too many people canât do that. Too many people think they can make endless compromises with themselves, and that they have plenty of time to get around to the life they want. F*ck that! They donât. Successful people know that. And they resolve to cut the bullsh!t and get serious: Immediately.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400;">Â </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>One thing Iâve learned is that people are almost always wrong about why they arenât succeeding in business (and life). They think theyâre not a âborn leader.â They think they arenât selling because their product or service isnât priced low enough. Theyâre worried that if they really put themselves into their brand, it wonât fly with people.

Maybe they are making enough money, are in good enough shape, and in decent personal relationships. Their lives aren't terrible, but they are also not great. So they get into this mentality of not really being motivated to change the status quo. The irony is that this comfort zone is actually uncomfortable. In this episode, I tell you what that means, and why you definitely want to push yourself beyond your comfort level.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If youÂ are waiting to see what other successful people do just so you can do the same thing, you are doing yourself a disservice. It's one thing to notice what someone else does well. It's legitimate to cherry pick a good idea or best practice and apply it to your life and business. But here's the bottom line: whatever you draw from someone else should be adapted and be developed for you. Personalize it or pass on it. Â You don't want to be a carbon copy of someone else. Â It's less than you deserve and bad business.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Good communication skills are critical to success. Unfortunately, society has become so soft and overly sensitive that people feel they need to be passive and tentative in the way they speak to others. They tone down the truth to avoid offending someone.Â They are vague in order to avoid hurting someone's feelings. Guess what? This doesn't work. In order to succeed personally and professionally, you need to speak clearly. You need to speak truthfully. You need to be direct.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's popular today to go around saying, "I'm gonna be me. And I give zero f*cks what anyone thinks about it." While we should not be enslaved to other people's opinions, Andy Frisella says that what other people think about you matters. People are going to judge what kind of person you are byÂ how you treat people and what you put out on social media. If you don't take that seriously, you're in trouble. Opportunity comes from other people--and how other people perceive you is huge. If you struggle with how to connect with people and build relationships that lead to opportunity, The MFCEO shares a tool in this episode that will help you!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Too many people complain that their friends and family aren't supporting their business. Here's the reality: you're going to need way more than the support of your friends and family to be successful. Plus, your friends and family aren't obligated to support you. When it comes to the real world of business, they owe you nothing. It's your job to provide a quality product or service that everyone would want to support. And it's your job to sell them on that quality product or service. But above all, you have to think of support in terms of a bank account. Don't constantly ask other people to make withdraws on your behalf. You want to be the guy who make more deposits in other people's accounts.</p>]]></description>

You will become a better, more badass person; and better, more badass people will be attracted to you and your life. It doesn't mean certain members of your old peer group are bad people. It just means that you've become very different people with different hopes, dream, and goals--and moving apart is natural. You better accept it. The alternative is keeping your friends--and staying average and mediocre.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's great if you are out there trying to build a business and life of value. But too many people out there are complaining that they have "haters." According to The MFCEO Andy Frisella, very few people have accomplished anything significant enough to have haters. The haters are imaginary; they exist in the minds of people who want to create excuses for their lack of progress. In reality, you might be on the receiving end of legitimate criticism. If that's the case, don't call it "hate." Accept it humbly. Learn from it. And use it to truly accomplish great things.</p>]]></description>

Without it, they will bounce from one thing to the next and never enjoy the amazing results that are bound to come. Second: When it comes to personal branding, are you comfortable tooting your own horn? You need to be. Â If you don't, nobody else will do it for you.</p>]]></description>
