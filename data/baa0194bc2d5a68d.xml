They feel like they are running behind. They feel like there is some "secret formula" that's complicated & too sophisticated for them to understand. Listen...all of us feel lost & like we don't know what we're doing. In this episode, I talk about how to overcome that & we share OG stories about the early days of MFCEO.

I've been reading a ton of U.S. history, & I've learned more about the most incredible men & women our country has ever produced. It's been so impactful to me that I created a course called UNITED WE WIN: 7 Lessons in Excellence and Success From the Greatest Americans of All Time. The full course will only be available to my email subscribers, but I'm publishing the first lesson as a gift to you for Independence Day. Happy 4th of July, Mother F*ckers!</p>]]></description>

Why do people think that if I share an opinion that is the opposite of yours, that it's somehow a personal attack & offensive? The media & politicians fuel this mentality & it's really killing our ability to get along & be good & decent people to one another. It's got to stop. There's a way to disagree - even strongly - with one another without despising each other. That's what we talk about in today's Sunday Sermon.</p>]]></description>

It's really hard to go through really bad things & become a force for good in the world. But it can be done. You just have to make the choice.</p>]]></description>

Like...it literally seems like society has become an insane asylum & the lunatics are running the place. Everybody is angry & resentful at everybody else. Well I heard a great story that provides a two word answer for what's wrong with the world. If we take that answer seriously, we'll all go a long way in fixing society...and our own lives.</p>]]></description>

The guy who wants to someday speak to millions can give a talk to his 7 employees today.

But at the other end of the spectrum are people who have a lot to offer, but they don't realize it & take advantage of it. You need to resist the temptation to "discount" yourself in business & life & "price" yourself more fairly & generously.

They think they’re not a “born leader.” They think they aren’t selling because their product or service isn’t priced low enough.

But then they say sh*t like, "2016 was practice.  2017 was a warm-up.  Now 2018 is game time!" Seriously? What a joke. They aren't going to make a change. They aren't really going to accomplish anything. And neither are you...but it's probably not because you're lazy. It's something else. In this episode, I tell you what it is--and how, if you really want to crush the new year, you can. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>There's a common mistake that stalls a lot of people's progress. They may be on their way to achieving their goals, making more money, but then all of a sudden, they hit a brick wall. Why?

Yes, there are fundamentals to success. But you also have to be adaptable. Your plan has to evolve. Your skill set has to be developed and reinvented.

They believed in something that could make their lives better, as well as the lives of their families. But they also knew that they were up against impossible odds and that the cost of failure was high. Are you motivated to pursue amazing, seemingly impossible goals? Not just goals that benefit you, but others too? Have you considered the high cost of achievement? America was built by people who, in the face of massive adversity, decided to move on regardless.

Here's the deal: People have a tendency to think their struggles or issues are worse than everybody else's. But the reality is that everybody deals with something. What it comes down to is this: When you get pushed to the brink by the negative memories and thoughts, what do you do? You can cave in and give up.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What do you do when the person you love does not support you and your goals? Or, what do you when they support your overall goals, but they often nag you about your lack of progress? Do you suck it up and take it? Do you just tell them to go to hell? In this episode of Thursday Thunder, Andy Frisella unpacks his thoughts and answers this frequently asked question. The bottom line: a relationship is two people believing in the same things and being committed to the same goals. Is that what you have with your significant other or not?</p>]]></description>

While we should not be enslaved to other people's opinions, Andy Frisella says that what other people think about you matters. People are going to judge what kind of person you are by how you treat people and what you put out on social media. If you don't take that seriously, you're in trouble. Opportunity comes from other people--and how other people perceive you is huge.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Too many people complain that their friends and family aren't supporting their business. Here's the reality: you're going to need way more than the support of your friends and family to be successful. Plus, your friends and family aren't obligated to support you. When it comes to the real world of business, they owe you nothing. It's your job to provide a quality product or service that everyone would want to support. And it's your job to sell them on that quality product or service. But above all, you have to think of support in terms of a bank account. Don't constantly ask other people to make withdraws on your behalf. You want to be the guy who make more deposits in other people's accounts.</p>]]></description>

The reality is, people like the show and the style, but they've never developed the substance required for success. The MFCEO says: you can't fake it.

You will become a better, more badass person; and better, more badass people will be attracted to you and your life. It doesn't mean certain members of your old peer group are bad people. It just means that you've become very different people with different hopes, dream, and goals--and moving apart is natural. You better accept it. The alternative is keeping your friends--and staying average and mediocre.</p>]]></description>

Do you come out with a product, release it to the public, it goes "okay" but not good, so you just move on to another product--or even another company? According to Andy Frisella, most people don't understand that success takes time and tenacity. They don't have the aggressive patience necessary to succeed. Without it, they will bounce from one thing to the next and never enjoy the amazing results that are bound to come. Second: When it comes to personal branding, are you comfortable tooting your own horn? You need to be.  If you don't, nobody else will do it for you.</p>]]></description>

Spoiler alert: They can't. In this episode, Andy Frisella provides some practical tips for to how to focus on one thing; and how that laser-like focus can lead to even greater success.</p>]]></content:encoded>
