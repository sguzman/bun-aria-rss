			<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been in a place you felt you weren't supposed to be within your career or business? Or like you're not doing what you feel like you're supposed to be doing?</p> <p>I certainly have. It's easy to get caught in this, to keep doing what you're doing, ignoring that voice inside, fearing the risk.</p> <p>Yet listening to our fear keeps us small, it keeps the world from getting the gift we could be giving.</p> <p>Architect Ibrahim Greenidge came to this place in his career, where he decided he needed to make a shift.</p> <p>In today's episode, you'll discover how Greenidge started his practice and grew it to a team of five. Greenidge shares his number one challenge running an architectural practice today and the three top principles that have been his guiding stars for success.</p> <p>Greenidge is the co-founder of BOLT Architecture, a Brooklyn-based architectural practice.</p> <p>In 2017, he was appointed to serve as President of the New York Coalition of Black Architects. He won the 2015 Jumaane Stewart Recognition Award, his designs have been featured in the UN's Remembering Slavery Exhibit as well as the Center for Architecture's "Say It Loud: Distinguished Black Designers of New York Coalition of Black Architects". In 2017, Greenidge was acknowledged among the Top 20 Distinguished Minority Architects and Designers by Architizer.</p> <p>► Feedback?

Studio Banana is responsible for the globally acclaimed OSTRICHPILLOW® and involved in high-yield, high-impact innovative projects for clients such as United Nations, Nestlé, Coca-Cola, Al Jazeera, Ernst & Young, Qatar Foundation, BBDO, McCann Erickson, Santander Bank, Vodafone or Telefonica, among others.</p> <p>In 2019, they published "Work Out of the Box," a collection of conversations with industry leaders and case studies from their portfolio to break design-driven transformation down into 13 core principles as a sort of manifesto on how to design work environments and work cultures.<br /> <br /> In this episode, Key offers up a great vantage point into the philosophy of Studio Banana, the company culture, their business strategy, and deployment methodology.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, I am speaking with the award-winning architect and designer Suman Sorg, a fellow of the AIA and founder of Sorg Architects.</p> <p>She has also recently formed a non-profit design firm, A Complete Unknown, in her home in Washington DC. The A Complete Unknown design firm has a mission to promote social justice, peace, and unity through architecture and design.</p> <p>Suman has over 30 years of building a successful architecture practice.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, I'm speaking to Mike Grosswendt who is the CEO and Founder of All Coast Construction, a construction company based on the west coast of the US.</p> <p>Mike focuses his attention onto new construction and restorations. He's worked with many world-renowned architects. He's worked with an incredible array of A-list celebrities as well including Quincy Jones. He's recently completed the home of Robert Downey Junior and his wife Susan, which is based in Malibu; quite an incredible and unusual architectural feat. He's currently working on a remodel of a 27,000 sq ft home for Charles Gwathmey, again, in Malibu.</p> <p>In this conversation, Mike and I talked about his beginnings, how he began as a carpenter, and how he won projects in the early days. We get a really good insight into the workings of a construction business, how a contractor views modern construction, what makes a good relationship between contractor and architect, and all the different nuances of making construction profitable, and the complexities of running a business.</p> <p> </p> <p>► Access your free training at http://SmartPracticeMethod.com/</p> <p>► If you want to speak directly to our advisors, book a call at https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/call</p> <p>► Subscribe to my YouTube Channel for updates:</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture</p> <p>*******<br /> For more free tools and resources for running a profitable, impactful, and fulfilling practice, connect with me on:<br /> Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture<br /> Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/<br /> Website: https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/<br /> Twitter: https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch<br /> Podcast: http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/<br /> iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926<br />  Android Podcast Feed: http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast</p> <p>*******</p> <p>Access the FREE Architecture Firm Profit Map video here: http://freearchitectgift.com</p> <p>Download the FREE Architecture Firm Marketing Process Flowchart video here: http://freearchitectgift.com</p> <p>Come to my next live, in-person event: https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live</p> <p>Carpe Diem!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, I'm speaking with Mark Weaver and Darrell Wilson of Mark Weaver Associates.</p> <p>Mark Weaver Associates is a full-service design firm based in Los Angeles that was founded in 1970. Since then, they have built an impressive portfolio of work with residential installations, they worked on private aircraft, yachts, and even private island retreats in a vast array of locations from Los Angeles to New York City to London, and also in Italy.</p> <p>Mark has been recognized by a breadth of national and international publications and has earned himself a loyal following of clients from around the world. He regularly lectures at UCLA and is a founding member of both the LA Museum of Contemporary Art and the Institute of Classical Architecture and Art.</p> <p>Darrell is the Principal Designer at Mark Weaver Associates, and they've been working together for the best part of 20 years. His approach to design has been shaped by a wide range of influences from mid-century Italian and French furniture to classical architecture. Darrell's perspective is from very much an architectural background.</p> <p>In this episode, we discuss how Mark and Darrell create long-lasting client relationships that bring regular projects into their business and that last for decades. We also talk about how to navigate the time-based pricing versus value-based pricing conundrum that many architects and designers face in their businesses. We also look at how to responsibly manage your clients' money within a project.</p> <p> </p> <p>► Access your free training at http://SmartPracticeMethod.com/</p> <p>► If you want to speak directly to our advisors, book a call at https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/call</p> <p>► Subscribe to my YouTube Channel for updates:</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture</p> <p>*******<br /> For more free tools and resources for running a profitable, impactful, and fulfilling practice, connect with me on:<br /> Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture<br /> Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/<br /> Website: https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/<br /> Twitter: https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch<br /> Podcast: http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/<br /> iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926<br />  Android Podcast Feed: http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast</p> <p>*******</p> <p>Access the FREE Architecture Firm Profit Map video here: http://freearchitectgift.com</p> <p>Download the FREE Architecture Firm Marketing Process Flowchart video here: http://freearchitectgift.com</p> <p>Come to my next live, in-person event: https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live</p> <p>Carpe Diem!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, I am speaking with Robert Yuen.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, I'm speaking with Griff Davenport, FAIA, who is the DLR Group's Chief Executive Officer.</p> <p>Griff leads the firm's executive leadership team and collaborates with the senior leadership to craft the firm's business strategy and to progress the evolution of DLR Group design.</p> <p>He's been instrumental in developing and driving the growth of the group's vertical markets and expanding their geographic footprint both nationally and internationally.</p> <p>It was a really fascinating conversation to speak with Griff as his entire career, since 1980, has been solely with the DLR Group. He talks about how his career has evolved, his role in business development, in establishing new offices, such as the one in Minneapolis, and how they have grown, and developed, and specialized in various sectors such as education. Of course, we go deep into the importance of culture, mission, vision, and values in a practice and leadership.</p> <p> </p> <p>► Access your free training at <a href= "http://SmartPracticeMethod.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">http://SmartPracticeMethod.com/</a></p> <p>► If you want to speak directly to our advisors, book a call at <a style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/call" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/call</a></p> <p>► Subscribe to my YouTube Channel for updates:</p> <p><a href= "https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture">https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture</a></p> <p>*******</p> <p>For more free tools and resources for running a profitable, impactful, and fulfilling practice, connect with me on:<br /> Facebook: <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture">https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture</a><br />  Instagram: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/">https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/</a><br />  Website: <a href= "https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/</a><br />  Twitter: <a href= "https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch">https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch</a><br />  Podcast: <a href= "http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/">http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/</a><br />  iTunes: <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926"> https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926</a><br />  Android Podcast Feed: <a href= "http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast">http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast</a></p> <p>*******</p> <p>Access the FREE Architecture Firm Profit Map video here: <a href="http://freearchitectgift.com">http://freearchitectgift.com</a></p> <p>Download the FREE Architecture Firm Marketing Process Flowchart video here: <a href= "http://freearchitectgift.com">http://freearchitectgift.com</a></p> <p>Come to my next live, in-person event: <a href= "https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live</a></p> <p>Carpe Diem!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest this week is business coach and entrepreneur, Ray Brown.</p> <p>For about 5 years, Ray has worked at CEO-level across six companies, including overseeing the sale of Scotland's largest watercolor business Premier Water to global food giant Danone in 2005.</p> <p>In late 2005, after moving to Australia with his family, he was selected to join the international business coaching organization, Shirlaws Group.</p> <p>As a business coach of a number of different architectural practices based in Melbourne, Ray recognized there's a significant gap in the education provided to architects around running a business. And obviously, as we know, there's a lot of limited literature and resources available to support them in this role.</p> <p>So Ray co-founded Archibiz, which is designed to help ambitious architects build profitable and sustainable businesses whilst doing great design.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week I’m speaking with Christian Giordano, president and majority shareholder of Mancini Duffy, a technology first design firm based in New York City and New Jersey.</p> <p>Christian is an innovator, an entrepreneur, a visionary, and a disruptor; he’s the inventor of The Toolbelt LLC, a software suite that allows users to explore and manipulate 3D models collaboratively to explore<br /> and make decisions together. He also the host of the Anti-Architect Podcast.</p> <p>He has been highlighted as one of Building Design + Construction’s “40 Under 40” Class of 2013. With his leadership of Mancini Duffy, Christian saw a unique opportunity to recalibrate Mancini’s approach — emphasizing technology to transform the way designers across disciplines work. He launched a research & development incubator – dubbed the Design Lab – which brings together designers, technologists, and clients to leverage technologies like Virtual Reality, 3D Printing, Drones, Generative Design, and Artificial Intelligence to break barriers limiting design capabilities. What began as an internal incubator, has quickly grown to disrupt the way the design process is facilitated.</p> <p>In this episode, you will discover<br /> - How Intrapreneurship is cultivated within the firm<br /> - How Christian became president and majority shareholder of a firm that has 100 years of history<br /> - The importance of transparency in developing a powerful business culture</p> <p> </p> <p>► Subscribe to my YouTube Channel for updates:</p> <p><a href= "https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture">https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture</a></p> <p>*******</p> <p>For more free tools and resources for running a profitable, impactful, and fulfilling practice, connect with me on:<br /> Facebook: <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture">https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture</a><br />  Instagram: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/">https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/</a><br />  Website: <a href= "https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/</a><br />  Twitter: <a href= "https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch">https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch</a><br />  Podcast: <a href= "http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/">http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/</a><br />  iTunes: <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926"> https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926</a><br />  Android Podcast Feed: <a href= "http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast">http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast</a></p> <p>*******</p> <p>Access the FREE Architecture Firm Profit Map video here: <a href="http://freearchitectgift.com">http://freearchitectgift.com</a></p> <p>Download the FREE Architecture Firm Marketing Process Flowchart video here: <a href= "http://freearchitectgift.com">http://freearchitectgift.com</a></p> <p>Come to my next live, in-person event: <a href= "https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live</a></p> <p>Carpe Diem!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today kicks off Women’s History Month here in the United States. Today, I'm joined by three impactful and accomplished women who are making history in their own right here with us today.</p> <p>Carrie Byles, Xuan Fu, and Laura Ettelman compose the executive committee of Skidmore, Ownings and Merrill, one of the world’s most highly respected and successful architecture firms, otherwise known as SOM.</p> <p>SOM has completed some of the world’s most legendary buildings, in addition to a plethora of work that spans everything from airports to university campuses.</p> <p>Notable buildings include the Willis Tower of Chicago (I prefer to use its former name “Sears Tower” for personal reasons) and the Burj Khalifa, currently the world’s tallest building.</p> <p>Now before we jump into our interview today, here is a bit of background on today’s guests:</p> <p>In addition to serving on the Executive Committee, Laura Ettelman is the managing partner in SOM’s New York Office and oversees the design and planning of a diverse range of projects across the globe. Her work ranges from large-scale master plans to interior design. Among the projects in her portfolio are some of the world’s largest aviation and transportation hubs, new hospitals and research centers for healthcare and science, and campus master planning and design for both higher education and the civic and government sectors.</p> <p>Partner Carrie Byles is based in SOM’s San Francisco office. She has a strong background in information technology and how it shapes the way we live in and design our buildings.</p> <p>Xuan Fu is a managing partner with SOM's Chicago office. In 1994, Fu started her SOM career as a technical coordinator before assuming the position of a project manager in 2004. As an expert in the Asian market, she has worked on a range of international projects including master plans, commercial buildings, mixed-use developments, retail, hospitality, and convention and exhibition center projects.</p> <p> </p> <p>► Subscribe to my YouTube Channel for updates:</p> <p><a href= "https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture">https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture</a></p> <p>*******</p> <p>For more free tools and resources for running a profitable, impactful, and fulfilling practice, connect with me on:<br /> Facebook: <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture">https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture</a><br />  Instagram: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/">https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/</a><br />  Website: <a href= "https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/</a><br />  Twitter: <a href= "https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch">https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch</a><br />  Podcast: <a href= "http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/">http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/</a><br />  iTunes: <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926"> https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926</a><br />  Android Podcast Feed: <a href= "http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast">http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast</a></p> <p>*******</p> <p>Access the FREE Architecture Firm Profit Map video here: <a href="http://freearchitectgift.com">http://freearchitectgift.com</a></p> <p>Download the FREE Architecture Firm Marketing Process Flowchart video here: <a href= "http://freearchitectgift.com">http://freearchitectgift.com</a></p> <p>Come to my next live, in-person event: <a href= "https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live</a></p> <p>Carpe Diem!</p>]]></description>
