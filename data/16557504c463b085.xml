    <description>What do you get when a DIY influencer dates an ex-frat-president tech mogul? Honestly we’re not really sure either, but we’re all about to find out together. Hosted by Lauren Riihimaki (LaurDIY) and boyfriend, Jeremy Lewis, Wild ’Til 9 is about relationships, spotting the red flags and giving the green lights, and the lifestyle in which this polar opposite couple found themselves. Things are about to get wild… but only until 9PM.
