Women are especially vulnerable to rising temperatures in poor countries on the frontlines of climate change because many have little choice but to work through their pregnancies and soon after giving birth. Further adding to the risks, women in socially conservative Pakistan — and many other places —typically cook the family meals over hot stoves or open fires, often in cramped rooms with no ventilation or cooling.<br>The harsh conditions facing many women were brought into tragic focus on May 14, the day temperatures in Jacobabad, Pakistan hit 51 C, making it the world&#8217;s hottest city at that time.&nbsp;</p>
