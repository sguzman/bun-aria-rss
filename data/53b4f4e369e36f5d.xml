			<description><![CDATA[<p>We sit down with legendary investor Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital and his son Andrew who, while less-well-known, is also an incredibly accomplished investor in a very different arena: early-stage VC. The purpose of the conversation was to discuss their joint work together on Howard’s all-time most popular memo, “Something of Value”, which made the then-shocking argument that Value and Growth investing are not diametric opposites but rather two sides of the same investing coin. We of course dive deep into that, and also cover plenty of fun Oaktree and investing history, as well as Andrew’s favorite topic: selling (or not selling, as the case may be).

From Sequoia through Sony, TSMC, Nvidia, The New York Times, the NBA and Oprah — we revisited all the classics and pulled out the common threads that weave the tapestry of great companies we’ve covered on Acquired. This episode was truly a joy to put together… huge thank you to Patrick and Brent for giving us the perfect stage on which to present it!<br /> <br /></p> <p>This episode has video!

Today that tiny firm has grown to nearly $15B under management and become a premier “capital partner” to founders at all but the very earliest stages — companies like Snowflake, Facebook, Roblox, Plaid, Grab and Acquired fan-favorite Modern Treasury.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We sit down with two of the most talented and respected people in Hollywood — Brian Koppelman and Joseph Gordon-Levitt — to talk about the process of adapting Mike Issac’s story of Uber, “Super Pumped”, into their new Showtime series. To say this was a thrill for us is a MASSIVE understatement. Huge thank yous to Brian, Joe and Showtime for making it happen!<br /> <br /></p> <p>This episode has video! You can watch it on Spotify (right in the main podcast interface) or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AcquiredFM">on YouTube</a>.<br /> <br /></p> <p>PSA: if you want more Acquired, you can <a href= "http://pod.link/acquiredlp">follow our newly public LP Show feed here</a> in the podcast player of your choice.<br /> <br /></p> <p><strong>Sponsors:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Thanks to the Solana Foundation for being our presenting sponsor for this special episode.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Of our 65+ sources for the TSMC episode, one stood above the rest: a wonderful Knowledge Project episode with Brinton Johns and Jon Bathgate of NZS Capital laying out the state of the semiconductor market. When coincidentally we met Brinton a week later, we knew fate was telling us we had to dig deeper. It turns out NZS has a lot more to teach Acquired than just about semis!

Brian Arthur and Increasing Returns fame!)... and of course we also throw in some semiconductor shop-talk for good measure. :)</p> <p><br /> If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We sit down with the one & only Michael Mauboussin to dive deep into his incredible body of work: untangling skill and luck, measuring moats, persistence of returns in venture capital, decision making and — particularly timely — expectations investing and how to think about valuations in the current 2021 market environment.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We kick off Season 9 with a classic: Part I of the a16z story. How did this brand new venture firm charge out of the gates in 2009, going from zero to disrupting the entire venture industry overnight? You probably know Marc & Ben's history with Netscape and Loudcloud/Opsware... but what about the Black Panthers, Nintendo 64, Al Gore, Doug Leone, Masayoshi Son, and an epic feud with Benchmark Capital that became Silicon Valley's version of the Hatfields and the McCoys?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We kick off Season 9 with a classic: Part I of the a16z story. How did this brand new venture firm charge out of the gates in 2009, going from zero to disrupting the entire venture industry overnight? You probably know Marc & Ben's history with Netscape and Loudcloud/Opsware... but what about the Black Panthers, Nintendo 64, Al Gore, Doug Leone, Masayoshi Son, and an epic feud with Benchmark Capital that became Silicon Valley's version of the Hatfields and the McCoys? Buckle up, Acquired's got the truth.</p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors. We can't wait to see you there. Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a></p> <p> Sponsors:</p> <ul> <li>Thank you to Pilot for being our presenting sponsor for all of Acquired Season 9! Pilot takes care of startups' bookkeeping, tax and CFO services so busy founders can focus on what matters, which is building the company. To paraphrase Jeff Bezos's famous AWS analogy: bookkeeping and tax don't make your product any better — so you should let Pilot handle them for you. In fact Pilot is backed by Bezos himself via Bezos Expeditions, along with an all-star roster of other investors including Sequoia, Index, and Stripe. They are truly the gold standard for startup bookkeeping, and many of the companies we work with run on them. You can get in touch with Pilot here: <a href= "https://bit.ly/acquiredfmpilot">https://bit.ly/acquiredfmpilot</a> , and Acquired listeners get 20% off their first 6 months! (use the link above)</li> <li>Thank you as well to Pitchbook and to Nord Security.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We sit down with the hottest new protocol layer in crypto today: Solana, and its cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko, who is the CEO of Solana Labs. If you listened to our Ethereum episode or follow crypto even at a cursory level, you've likely heard of Solana and its ability to scale transactions thousands of times higher than Ethereum. And, unlike other so-called "ETH killers", Solana is doing so in production today with large and real applications. We dive into the project's history coming out of the 2017-18 crypto winter, how it works and what's ahead now that they've recently raised $314m (yes that is Pi $million) from a16z and Polychain Capital, with their native SOL tokens currently trading at a market cap around $10B (!).</p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like our Book Clubs. We can't wait to see you there. <strong>Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a></strong></p> <p><strong><br /> Sponsors:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Thanks to SoftBank Latin America for being our presenting sponsor for this special episode. SoftBank has truly been the first and best large capital allocator in the Latin American startup ecosystem, and we are very excited to work with and learn from them over the rest of 2021.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We close out Season 8 with the most ambitious organization we've ever covered on Acquired: Ethereum, and it's celebrity wunderkind founder Vitalik Buterin. If you thought Mark Zuckerberg IPO-ing Facebook at $100B by age 27 was something, just wait until you hear the story of this high school junior creating $500B (!!) of market cap by the same age — and oh yeah, maybe seeding the future dethroning of Facebook, Google, Amazon and all of big tech in the process. Regardless whether you're a crypto neophyte, a die-hard bull, or a skeptical bear, this is a story you need to hear, and Ethereum is an innovation you need to understand. Buckle in for a wild ride... and some special surprises from a few Acquired friends. :)</p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We close out Season 8 with the most ambitious organization we've ever covered on Acquired: Ethereum, and it's celebrity wunderkind founder Vitalik Buterin. If you thought Mark Zuckerberg IPO-ing Facebook at $100B by age 27 was something, just wait until you hear the story of this high school junior creating $500B (!!) of market cap by the same age — and oh yeah, maybe seeding the future dethroning of Facebook, Google, Amazon and all of big tech in the process. Regardless whether you're a crypto neophyte, a die-hard bull, or a skeptical bear, this is a story you need to hear, and Ethereum is an innovation you need to understand. Buckle in for a wild ride... and some special surprises from a few Acquired friends. :)</p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's time. We wrap our Berkshire Hathaway trilogy with Warren and Charlie entering a new era: the age of the internet. Can they and Berkshire adapt to this brave new world? We find out. And, after 9+ hours, we render our final judgments on Berkshire and Warren's career. Is "Never bet against America" still the right longterm approach? Or is there another, even bigger Snowball out there that Warren may be missing?</p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like our recent Book Club event with Brad Stone. We can't wait to see you there. Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a></p> <p><strong><br /> The Berkshire Hathaway Playbook:</strong></p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/berkshire-hathaway-part-iii">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/berkshire-hathaway-part-iii</a> )</p> <p><strong>1. The Berkshire Hathaway "Culture"</strong></p> <ul> <li>Berkshire Hathaway really only has three key cultural tenants that stretch across its huge array of operating businesses and investments: <ol> <li>Don't put Berkshire's reputation at risk (i.e., don't be Salomon Brothers).</li> <li>Don't take money out of the business (i.e., re-invest and avoid or defer paying tax whenever possible).</li> <li>Funnel all excess cash back to Omaha for re-allocation (i.e., if you can't find a good use for excess cash, give it back to Warren).</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p><strong>2. You need different strategies at different company scales and points in time.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Berkshire's greatest longterm strength has been its ability to adapt and employ different strategies as it and the world has changed. From the transition from cigar butts to wonderful businesses as we saw in our last episode, to diluting the equity portfolio with fixed income assets from Gen Re before the internet bubble crash, to focusing on preferred equity during the financial crisis and ultimately making a non-controlling stake Apple the largest asset in the whole Berkshire portfolio, Warren and Charlie have demonstrated remarkable flexibility during their investing careers.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. There are huge advantages to a company structure where one person makes all decisions.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Warren's ability to make $10 billion+ decisions on his own and within an hour (usually with input from Charlie) is truly unique in the global history of business, and allows Berkshire the flexibility to capitalize on opportunities that no one else can act upon, like the financial crisis. At the same time this setup obviously carries risk — not so much in Warren making bad decisions (cough, <em>airlines</em>), but in missing other opportunities simply due to lack of diversity in thought. Which leads us to our last playbook theme...</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Never Bet Against The Internet.</strong> (aka the "Rosenthal doctrine")</p> <ul> <li>Andrew Marks of TQ Ventures perhaps sums up Warren's career best: he's the greatest "status quo investor" that's ever lived, as embodied in his "never bet against America" philosophy. As long as the future looks mostly like the present, nobody is better than Warren at handicapping probabilities and picking winners. But that's no longer the world we live in today. As Doug Leone laid out in our Sequoia Part II episode, we now live in a world of accelerating change: what works today is unlikely to keep working tomorrow. And where is that dynamic baked into the very fabric of existence? The Internet. Never bet against it.</li> </ul> <p><strong><br /> Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Bill Gates 1996 Wired interview: <a href=

At the same time this setup obviously carries risk — not so much in Warren making bad decisions (cough, <em>airlines</em>), but in missing other opportunities simply due to lack of diversity in thought. Which leads us to our last playbook theme...</li> </ul> <p>4. Never Bet Against The Internet. (aka the "Rosenthal doctrine")</p> <ul> <li>Andrew Marks of TQ Ventures perhaps sums up Warren's career best: he's the greatest "status quo investor" that's ever lived, as embodied in his "never bet against America" philosophy. As long as the future looks mostly like the present, nobody is better than Warren at handicapping probabilities and picking winners. But that's no longer the world we live in today. As Doug Leone laid out in our Sequoia Part II episode, we now live in a world of accelerating change: what works today is unlikely to keep working tomorrow. And where is that dynamic baked into the very fabric of existence? The Internet. Never bet against it.</li> </ul> <p> Links:</p> <ul> <li>Bill Gates 1996 Wired interview: <a href= "https://youtu.be/VFFlO7yBIBM?t=1056">https://youtu.be/VFFlO7yBIBM?t=1056</a></li> <li>Jeff Bezos's

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In Part II of our Berkshire Hathaway Trilogy (!), we pick up the story with Warren wandering in the woods of Omaha, searching for his life's next chapter after retiring from the professional investing business at the top of his game at age 39. How does he emerge from those woods anew, transforming from Ben Graham's cigar-butt cocoon into the butterfly collector of Berkshire's wonderful businesses? (Spoiler: Charlie Munger.) And how did one rotten-to-the-core business nearly bring it all down — everything he'd ever worked for — in the span of one terrible week?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's time. After 150+ episodes on great companies, we tackle the granddaddy of them all — Berkshire Hathaway. One episode alone isn't nearly enough to do Warren and Poor Charlie justice, so today we present Part I: Warren's story. How did a folksy, middle-class kid from Omaha become the single greatest capitalist of all-time? Why, like Jordan, did he retire (twice!) at the top of his game, only to reinvent himself and come back stronger than ever? As always, we dive in. Let's dance.</p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors. We can't wait to see you there. <strong>Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a></strong></p> <p><strong><br /> The Warren Buffett Playbook:</strong></p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/berkshire-hathaway-part-i">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/berkshire-hathaway-part-i</a> )</p> <p><strong>1. Money can create more money. (aka "Compounding")</strong></p> <ul> <li>Very early in life, Warren figured out something most people never truly grasp: money can be used to generate more money. It's sounds simple, but once you fully internalize this concept, you'll never see the world the same again. A given sum no longer represents what you could buy with it — a coffee, a phone, a car, a house, etc — but rather what it could grow to become over time. At the extreme, people like Warren are "cursed", seeing prices for goods not as whatever the sticker says, but 5x, 10x, 20x higher — because that's what the opportunity cost of parting with the capital represents.</li> <li>If you own an asset that's compounding at a high rate with no obvious reason it will stop... dear lord do not interrupt it!! Most people are tempted to meddle: lock in gains, cover other losses, actively trade, or otherwise "manage" their investments. In the long run these actions are almost assuredly all value-destructive behaviors if you own truly great businesses.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Align incentives: be a doctor, not a prescriptionist.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Warren likened stockbrokers — who got paid based on volume of trades placed, not investment performance — to "prescriptionist" doctors who were paid by their number and type of pills prescribed, versus actual patient outcomes. Once Warren created his investment partnerships (and then later transformed Berkshire Hathaway into something similar), he not only unlocked hugely better outcomes for his"patients", but allowed created a path to pursue his own dream and become fabulously wealthy in the process.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. You can't expect to control other people's emotions around money (or anything else).</strong></p> <ul> <li>However with the right "ground rules", you can mitigate the impact of others on your business and decision making — and even use them to your advantage.</li> <li>Warren's early partnerships had a few ground rules and norms: partners will not know what securities are held, trading in/out is allowed only 1 day / year, and Warren will consistently set low expectations (leaving himself ample room to over-deliver). These set the stage for nearly complete freedom for Warren to operate as he saw fit — to the immense gain of his limited partners.</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Sins of omission (selling or passing) nearly always cost more than sins of commission (buying).</strong></p> <ul> <li>Warren is almost without doubt the greatest investor of all time. However even he made three incredibly stupid "unforced errors" early in his career that cost hundreds of billions in future gains: selling GEICO, selling American Express, and passing on the opportunity to invest in Intel with Arthur Rock.</li> <li>That said, Warren's fourth great mistake (and in his estimation his greatest) was certainly a sin of commission: buying Berkshire Hathaway itself. Warren estimates this single blunder totaled $200B+ in opportunity cost over his lifetime.<br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Carve Outs:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Ben: Year One of Not Boring: <a

Most people are tempted to meddle: lock in gains, cover other losses, actively trade, or otherwise "manage" their investments. In the long run these actions are almost assuredly all value-destructive behaviors if you own truly great businesses.</li> </ul> <p>2. Align incentives: be a doctor, not a prescriptionist.</p> <ul> <li>Warren likened stockbrokers — who got paid based on volume of trades placed, not investment performance — to "prescriptionist" doctors who were paid by their number and type of pills prescribed, versus actual patient outcomes. Once Warren created his investment partnerships (and then later transformed Berkshire Hathaway into something similar), he not only unlocked hugely better outcomes for his"patients", but allowed created a path to pursue his own dream and become fabulously wealthy in the process.</li> </ul> <p>3. You can't expect to control other people's emotions around money (or anything else).</p> <ul> <li>However with the right "ground rules", you can mitigate the impact of others on your business and decision making — and even use them to your advantage.</li> <li>Warren's early partnerships had a few ground rules and norms: partners will not know what securities are held, trading in/out is allowed only 1 day / year, and Warren will consistently set low expectations (leaving himself ample room to over-deliver). These set the stage for nearly complete freedom for Warren to operate as he saw fit — to the immense gain of his limited partners.</li> </ul> <p>4. Sins of omission (selling or passing) nearly always cost more than sins of commission (buying).</p> <ul> <li>Warren is almost without doubt the greatest investor of all time. However even he made three incredibly stupid "unforced errors" early in his career that cost hundreds of billions in future gains: selling GEICO, selling American Express, and passing on the opportunity to invest in Intel with Arthur Rock.</li> <li>That said, Warren's fourth great mistake (and in his estimation his greatest) was certainly a sin of commission: buying Berkshire Hathaway itself. Warren estimates this single blunder totaled $200B+ in opportunity cost over his lifetime. </li> </ul> <p>Carve Outs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ben: Year One of Not Boring: <a href=

We figured it was high time to revisit Nick & crew for a Part II...<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors. We can't wait to see you there. <strong>Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a><br /> <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>The Rec Room Playbook:</strong></p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/rec-room-part-ii-with-ceo-nick-fajt"> https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/rec-room-part-ii-with-ceo-nick-fajt</a> )</p> <p><strong>1. It's ok not to have a grand plan from the beginning.</strong></p> <ul> <li>As Nick says, company founding stories tend to get romanticized in retrospect. (Guilty as charged here at Acquired!) As a founder it can feel like there's so much pressure on you to "have it all figured out" from day one. But the reality of most great company beginnings is nothing so grand: often it's just founders who have an inkling about something interesting and the combination of courage + right life circumstances to jump into the unknown and learn as they go. Things change quickly in new or evolving markets, and if you're too wedded to a master plan you're likely to miss more opportunities than you seize.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Don't let early (or even just recent) success blind you if potential headwinds are on the horizon.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Rec Room experienced "explosive" growth during the 2017 holiday season with the launch of Playstation VR. However this was a classic "wiggle of false hope" (in Paul Graham parlance), not real product-market fit. It would have been easy to ignore the very real warning signs (e.g., that VR adoption as a whole was slowing) and plow full steam ahead. Instead the team realized they probably needed to step back from the temporary momentum and diversify out of solely focusing on VR to find new avenues for growth.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Build your company into a robust organism.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Startups constantly face existential risks: what if the market shifts? What if we make wrong strategic decisions? How can you architect your business as a system so that "you" (either you personally or the company management as a whole) doesn't need to always be right in order to succeed? For Rec Room this has meant investing deeply into UGC and letting creators lead growth. Any room or piece of content might be no more likely to breakout than another — but in aggregate across now millions of creators, Rec Room is almost guaranteed a constant stream of "hits".</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. UGC is a flywheel that's difficult to start, but creates incredible business dynamics once spinning.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Like any flywheel, UGC requires a ton of effort to get moving in the beginning. (E.g., why should people bother to create? What tools do they need? How do you get the incentives right?) But once momentum takes over, it can become an incredible virtuous cycle where users' creativity inspires more users both to consume and create themselves, which compounds faster and faster over time.</li> <li>Furthermore, once a UGC flywheel is spinning, the underlying platform's unit economics get pretty fast: costs to produce content go down (or to zero), cost to acquire users go down (or to zero), and retention, engagement and monetization all spike up. In previous eras Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitch rode to this dynamic to incredible success. Today Roblox, Rec Room, TikTok and others are following the same playbook.</li> </ul> <p><strong>5. When operating a "metaverse", the best business dynamics result from having everything on a single platform (vs. siloing users based on devices/geos/etc)</strong></p> <ul> <li>Having all users able to interact on one platform not only maximizes liquidity across the creator-consumer marketplace, but affords the company more power across brand (e.g. Rec Room is the sole brand, not "Rec Room on xbox/steam/VR/etc") and central economic control.<br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Our "Part I" episode with Nick on Rec Room's seed round: <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/season-2-episode-2raising-a-seed-round-with-against-gravity-ceo-nick-fajt"> https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/season-2-episode-2raising-a-seed-round-with-against-gravity-ceo-nick-fajt</a></li> <li>Rec Room! <a href= "https://recroom.com/">https://recroom.com</a><br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Carve Outs:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Invent and Wander: <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Invent-Wander-Collected-Writings-Introduction-ebook/dp/B08BCCT6MW/"> https://www.amazon.com/Invent-Wander-Collected-Writings-Introduction-ebook/dp/B08BCCT6MW/</a></li> <li>Resonant Arc on YouTube: <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFzWAEPDGiY34bGpwM_DWmA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFzWAEPDGiY34bGpwM_DWmA</a></li> <li>How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio: <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0</a></li> </ul>]]></description>

As a founder it can feel like there's so much pressure on you to "have it all figured out" from day one. But the reality of most great company beginnings is nothing so grand: often it's just founders who have an inkling about something interesting and the combination of courage + right life circumstances to jump into the unknown and learn as they go. Things change quickly in new or evolving markets, and if you're too wedded to a master plan you're likely to miss more opportunities than you seize.</li> </ul> <p>2. Don't let early (or even just recent) success blind you if potential headwinds are on the horizon.</p> <ul> <li>Rec Room experienced "explosive" growth during the 2017 holiday season with the launch of Playstation VR. However this was a classic "wiggle of false hope" (in Paul Graham parlance), not real product-market fit. It would have been easy to ignore the very real warning signs (e.g., that VR adoption as a whole was slowing) and plow full steam ahead. Instead the team realized they probably needed to step back from the temporary momentum and diversify out of solely focusing on VR to find new avenues for growth.</li> </ul> <p>3. Build your company into a robust organism.</p> <ul> <li>Startups constantly face existential risks: what if the market shifts? What if we make wrong strategic decisions? How can you architect your business as a system so that "you" (either you personally or the company management as a whole) doesn't need to always be right in order to succeed? For Rec Room this has meant investing deeply into UGC and letting creators lead growth. Any room or piece of content might be no more likely to breakout than another — but in aggregate across now millions of creators, Rec Room is almost guaranteed a constant stream of "hits".</li> </ul> <p>4. UGC is a flywheel that's difficult to start, but creates incredible business dynamics once spinning.</p> <ul> <li>Like any flywheel, UGC requires a ton of effort to get moving in the beginning. (E.g., why should people bother to create? What tools do they need? How do you get the incentives right?) But once momentum takes over, it can become an incredible virtuous cycle where users' creativity inspires more users both to consume and create themselves, which compounds faster and faster over time.</li> <li>Furthermore, once a UGC flywheel is spinning, the underlying platform's unit economics get pretty fast: costs to produce content go down (or to zero), cost to acquire users go down (or to zero), and retention, engagement and monetization all spike up. In previous eras Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitch rode to this dynamic to incredible success. Today Roblox, Rec Room, TikTok and others are following the same playbook.</li> </ul> <p>5. When operating a "metaverse", the best business dynamics result from having everything on a single platform (vs. siloing users based on devices/geos/etc)</p> <ul> <li>Having all users able to interact on one platform not only maximizes liquidity across the creator-consumer marketplace, but affords the company more power across brand (e.g. Rec Room is the sole brand, not "Rec Room on xbox/steam/VR/etc") and central economic control. </li> </ul> <p>Links:</p> <ul> <li>Our "Part I" episode with Nick on Rec Room's seed round: <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/season-2-episode-2raising-a-seed-round-with-against-gravity-ceo-nick-fajt"> https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/season-2-episode-2raising-a-seed-round-with-against-gravity-ceo-nick-fajt</a></li> <li>Rec Room! <a href= "https://recroom.com/">https://recroom.com</a> </li> </ul> <p>Carve Outs:</p> <ul> <li>Invent and Wander: <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Invent-Wander-Collected-Writings-Introduction-ebook/dp/B08BCCT6MW/"> https://www.amazon.com/Invent-Wander-Collected-Writings-Introduction-ebook/dp/B08BCCT6MW/</a></li> <li>Resonant Arc on YouTube: <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFzWAEPDGiY34bGpwM_DWmA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFzWAEPDGiY34bGpwM_DWmA</a></li> <li>How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio: <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0</a></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We dive into the history behind Meituan, the juggernaut Chinese "super-app" which dominates China's services economy, offering consumers everything from food delivery, restaurant reviews, travel booking, bike-sharing, movie ticketing, and countless other entertainment and lifestyle services all at the touch of a button. Already China's 3rd largest tech company by market cap (behind just Tencent and Alibaba), Meituan did $15 billion in net revenue in FY2019 and continues to grow rapidly. What makes it so special, and how were they able to become the market leader in such a competitive space? This story is packed with lessons that apply equally beyond China tech to high-growth company building and investing everywhere.<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors. We can't wait to see you there. <strong>Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a></strong></p> <p><strong><br /> The Meituan Playbook:</strong></p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/meituan">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/meituan</a> )</p> <p><strong>1. Adding product offerings (post initial product-market fit) isn't losing focus. It's smart business.</strong></p> <ul> <li>A huge part of Meituan's success and longterm defensibility versus its <em>literally thousands</em> of past competitors is its ability to cross-sell customers across many different product lines. Meituan can afford to spend much more on acquiring and retaining a new user who'll end up purchasing food delivery, groceries, hotels, travel and more through the platform vs. standalone competitors in each vertical. Most western companies woefully misunderstand this dynamic. (Amazon being a notable exception)</li> <li>Meituan enjoys an average of 26 transactions per user per year (vs e.g. Airbnb users which book an average of 0.5 transactions/year). With each additional offering, Meituan increases the number of revenue streams it can amortize its CAC over, while also offering superior experiences to customers.</li> <li>Key to making this strategy work is having the discipline to follow the same playbook as any startup: launch new initiatives quickly, test and improve based on real customer feedback, don't let perfect be the enemy of shipped, and kill what's not working and move on. Meituan and Amazon's new initiatives often lack polish — but they either quickly bring in $billions of revenue, or they die and the company goes on to the next one. Again with few exceptions, western tech companies completely misunderstand how to execute this playbook effectively.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. When you spot a market that's both large and growing fast — ride that wave!!</strong></p> <ul> <li>Chinese e-commerce was a 20% saturation industry in 2017 and still growing nicely. However real world services was only 5% online, and poised to grow even faster. Staying nimble to capitalize on this online to offline (or "O2O") trend allowed Meituan to accelerate while Alibaba was caught flat-footed. Today Meituan (along with its fellow Tencent portfolio company Pinduoduo) represents probably the biggest threat Alibaba has faced in its entire history.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Many still don't realize what a powerful moat (trusted) reviews provide in online platforms.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Once it merged with Dianping, review data became Meituan's biggest competitive advantage vs other food delivery (and other product line) competitors. A deep database of reviews creates an incredible barrier to entry: any competitor can standup a set of listings, but without trusted reviews those listings are just "flat". This same dynamic helped Airbnb successfully defend against European clones early in its life.</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Old news, but always worth repeating: the days of China simply cloning American tech companies are long gone. Today it's China, not the US, that's leading innovation on mobile and the internet more broadly across many categories.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Ironically, Meituan's founder Wang Xing started his career as perhaps China's top Web 2.0 company cloner, and Meituan itself began as a Groupon knockoff. But to say the the tables have turned today is a <em>massive</em>understatement, haha.</li> </ul> <p><strong>5. Meituan capitalized on the secular trend of China's growing middle class and mobile-first economy.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Meituan's growth followed the growth of China's middle class. They were able to capitalize on the emergence of Tier 2 and 3 cities that provided newly addressable populations.</li> <li>Meituan was smart to pay attention to these non-Tier 1 cities from the very beginning. Founder Wang Xing realized that smaller cities where people were beginning to access the internet via mobile phones and internet cafes were a good fit for their initial group-discount platform.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We dive into the history behind Meituan, the juggernaut Chinese "super-app" which dominates China's services economy, offering consumers everything from food delivery, restaurant reviews, travel booking, bike-sharing, movie ticketing, and countless other entertainment and lifestyle services all at the touch of a button. Already China's 3rd largest tech company by market cap (behind just Tencent and Alibaba), Meituan did $15 billion in net revenue in FY2019 and continues to grow rapidly. What makes it so special, and how were they able to become the market leader in such a competitive space? This story is packed with lessons that apply equally beyond China tech to high-growth company building and investing everywhere. </p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors. We can't wait to see you there. Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a></p> <p> The Meituan Playbook:</p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/meituan">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/meituan</a> )</p> <p>1. Adding product offerings (post initial product-market fit) isn't losing focus. It's smart business.</p> <ul> <li>A huge part of Meituan's success and longterm defensibility versus its <em>literally thousands</em> of past competitors is its ability to cross-sell customers across many different product lines. Meituan can afford to spend much more on acquiring and retaining a new user who'll end up purchasing food delivery, groceries, hotels, travel and more through the platform vs. standalone competitors in each vertical. Most western companies woefully misunderstand this dynamic. (Amazon being a notable exception)</li> <li>Meituan enjoys an average of 26 transactions per user per year (vs e.g. Airbnb users which book an average of 0.5 transactions/year). With each additional offering, Meituan increases the number of revenue streams it can amortize its CAC over, while also offering superior experiences to customers.</li> <li>Key to making this strategy work is having the discipline to follow the same playbook as any startup: launch new initiatives quickly, test and improve based on real customer feedback, don't let perfect be the enemy of shipped, and kill what's not working and move on. Meituan and Amazon's new initiatives often lack polish — but they either quickly bring in $billions of revenue, or they die and the company goes on to the next one. Again with few exceptions, western tech companies completely misunderstand how to execute this playbook effectively.</li> </ul> <p>2. When you spot a market that's both large and growing fast — ride that wave!!</p> <ul> <li>Chinese e-commerce was a 20% saturation industry in 2017 and still growing nicely. However real world services was only 5% online, and poised to grow even faster. Staying nimble to capitalize on this online to offline (or "O2O") trend allowed Meituan to accelerate while Alibaba was caught flat-footed. Today Meituan (along with its fellow Tencent portfolio company Pinduoduo) represents probably the biggest threat Alibaba has faced in its entire history.</li> </ul> <p>3. Many still don't realize what a powerful moat (trusted) reviews provide in online platforms.</p> <ul> <li>Once it merged with Dianping, review data became Meituan's biggest competitive advantage vs other food delivery (and other product line) competitors. A deep database of reviews creates an incredible barrier to entry: any competitor can standup a set of listings, but without trusted reviews those listings are just "flat". This same dynamic helped Airbnb successfully defend against European clones early in its life.</li> </ul> <p>4. Old news, but always worth repeating: the days of China simply cloning American tech companies are long gone. Today it's China, not the US, that's leading innovation on mobile and the internet more broadly across many categories.</p> <ul> <li>Ironically, Meituan's founder Wang Xing started his career as perhaps China's top Web 2.0 company cloner, and Meituan itself began as a Groupon knockoff. But to say the the tables have turned today is a <em>massive</em>understatement, haha.</li> </ul> <p>5. Meituan capitalized on the secular trend of China's growing middle class and mobile-first economy.</p> <ul> <li>Meituan's growth followed the growth of China's middle class. They were able to capitalize on the emergence of Tier 2 and 3 cities that provided newly addressable populations.</li> <li>Meituan was smart to pay attention to these non-Tier 1 cities from the very beginning. Founder Wang Xing realized that smaller cities where people were beginning to access the internet via mobile phones and internet cafes were a good fit for their initial group-discount platform.</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the entire 20th Century, you’d be hard pressed to find a better business than an American newspaper — Warren Buffett famously described them as “franchises” — and no American newspaper stood taller than the New York Times. Controlled by a single family bound by a legal oath “to maintain the editorial independence and integrity of The New York Times and to continue it as an independent newspaper, entirely fearless, free of ulterior influence and unselfishly devoted to the public welfare”, the Times served as the paper of record for generations of Americans and people around the world. But no good thing lasts forever, and the dawn of the 21st Century saw both the Times and this once-mighty industry devastated by the dual disruptive forces of the internet and the 2008 financial crisis. And yet by 2021, The Times, essentially alone of its former peers, has reemerged from the American newspaper wreckage and transformed itself into a thriving digital business with an order of magnitude more subscribers than its print heyday. Curious how it all happened? We dive into 170 years of history to find out!<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors. We can't wait to see you there. <strong>Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a><br /> <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>The New York Times Company Playbook:<br /></strong>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/the-new-york-times-company">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/the-new-york-times-company</a> )</p> <p><strong>1. When you find yourself sitting in front of a big approaching demand wave... ride it!!</strong></p> <ul> <li>The New York (Daily) Times was founded during the newspaper boom of the 1850s, and similarly Adolph Ochs took over the local Chattanooga paper at the start of that city’s mining boom.</li> <li>The NYT made huge investments in its reporting during the two World Wars as the public’s appetite for news exploded, while its rivals missed the ball worrying over preserving advertising space. Likewise NYT launched The Daily (which would become the biggest podcast in the world) immediately following Trump’s inauguration in early 2017.</li> <li>Arguably NYT’s biggest business mistake was missing the cable wave -- which Rupert Murdoch leveraged brilliantly to build Fox News into the most valuable news media franchise in the world.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Where there’s an entrepreneurial will, there’s an entrepreneurial way.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Adolph Ochs bought the Chattanooga Times with $250 and sellers’ notes, and then acquired The New York Times out of bankruptcy with no personal money down and $100k of real estate debt. And turned them both into successes on a level no one (even himself at times) believed possible.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Recurring Acquired theme: the media business is still the second-best business of all time, behind technology.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Media’s ability to generate dual revenue streams (advertising and subscription) from the same content product generates enormous leverage on investment, AND most of those costs are fixed vs. variable (especially in a digital environment).</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. This is why “content is king” has always been true in the media industry.</strong></p> <ul> <li>NYT’s version of this strategy has always been to invest more in high-quality journalism than any of its peers.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the entire 20th Century, you’d be hard pressed to find a better business than an American newspaper — Warren Buffett famously described them as “franchises” — and no American newspaper stood taller than the New York Times. Controlled by a single family bound by a legal oath “to maintain the editorial independence and integrity of The New York Times and to continue it as an independent newspaper, entirely fearless, free of ulterior influence and unselfishly devoted to the public welfare”, the Times served as the paper of record for generations of Americans and people around the world. But no good thing lasts forever, and the dawn of the 21st Century saw both the Times and this once-mighty industry devastated by the dual disruptive forces of the internet and the 2008 financial crisis. And yet by 2021, The Times, essentially alone of its former peers, has reemerged from the American newspaper wreckage and transformed itself into a thriving digital business with an order of magnitude more subscribers than its print heyday. Curious how it all happened? We dive into 170 years of history to find out! </p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors. We can't wait to see you there. Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a> </p> <p>The New York Times Company Playbook:(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/the-new-york-times-company">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/the-new-york-times-company</a> )</p> <p>1. When you find yourself sitting in front of a big approaching demand wave... ride it!!</p> <ul> <li>The New York (Daily) Times was founded during the newspaper boom of the 1850s, and similarly Adolph Ochs took over the local Chattanooga paper at the start of that city’s mining boom.</li> <li>The NYT made huge investments in its reporting during the two World Wars as the public’s appetite for news exploded, while its rivals missed the ball worrying over preserving advertising space. Likewise NYT launched The Daily (which would become the biggest podcast in the world) immediately following Trump’s inauguration in early 2017.</li> <li>Arguably NYT’s biggest business mistake was missing the cable wave -- which Rupert Murdoch leveraged brilliantly to build Fox News into the most valuable news media franchise in the world.</li> </ul> <p>2. Where there’s an entrepreneurial will, there’s an entrepreneurial way.</p> <ul> <li>Adolph Ochs bought the Chattanooga Times with $250 and sellers’ notes, and then acquired The New York Times out of bankruptcy with no personal money down and $100k of real estate debt. And turned them both into successes on a level no one (even himself at times) believed possible.</li> </ul> <p>3. Recurring Acquired theme: the media business is still the second-best business of all time, behind technology.</p> <ul> <li>Media’s ability to generate dual revenue streams (advertising and subscription) from the same content product generates enormous leverage on investment, AND most of those costs are fixed vs. variable (especially in a digital environment).</li> </ul> <p>4. This is why “content is king” has always been true in the media industry.</p> <ul> <li>NYT’s version of this strategy has always been to invest more in high-quality journalism than any of its peers. It was true in 1896 when Ochs took over, true during the World Wars and the Pentagon Papers, and perhaps has never been more true than today when NYT employs 1,700 journalists around the world and pays them an average of >2x the rest of the industry.</li> </ul> <p>5. That said, distribution is critical as well. To build a world-class media organization you must be great at both content AND distribution.</p> <ul> <li>In the old media landscape, NYT built great distribution through its printing and delivery operations, as well as savvy investments like the Index which led to libraries and researchers across the country relying on the Times as the “paper of record”.</li> <li>However in today’s media landscape, the task of building great distribution falls on the newsroom and journalists themselves. The job is no longer finished once you hit publish -- reporters and editors must own the responsibility of getting their work in front of readers via social media and shareable story elements. </li>

Bring a prepared mind.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Founders (as they should) typically think more about solving a problem in the world, and less about the market context around what they're doing.

The two questions that matter are "Why now?" and "Who cares?".</strong></p> <ul> <li>Early-stage is different from other forms of investing. As Don would say, it's predicated on investing in markets undergoing significant change: today's solutions are wrong for tomorrow. A good answer to "why now" upends the Warren Buffet quote about reputations of businesses with bad economics surviving intact.

What you don't need are specific qualifications: Michael Moritz was a journalist, Roelof Botha was an actuary, Don and Doug were sales guys and Alfred was a COO. Greatness can come from anywhere.</li> <li>There will always be too much capital chasing too few good deals. It's true today, it was true when Alfred started 10 years ago, and it was true when Michael Moritz started 20 years before that.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We had to do it. After 12 years and <em>3,000,000x</em> appreciation, we kick off Season 8 with the best investment of all-time and our biggest episode ever: Bitcoin. From the first bitcoin transaction of 10k for two Papa John's pizzas (worth about $350m today!!) to $40k+ BTC and maybe the moon beyond, we cover the whole crazy, improbable journey of how a single 8-page PDF document changed the world of money — and perhaps the world itself — forever.<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors. We can't wait to see you there. <strong>Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a></strong></p> <p><strong><br /> The Bitcoin Playbook:</strong></p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/bitcoin">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/bitcoin</a> )</p> <p><strong>1. Technological paradigm shifts are ideal opportunities for attacking incumbents.</strong></p> <ul> <li>The traditional finance system worked fantastically well for 500 years, but it wasn't built for the internet. The fact that sharing your bank account or credit card number is required in order to transact, but there's no really robust way to protect against fraud when doing so, provided the perfect seam for a new entrant. Bitcoin and its creators saw this shortcoming and created a new form of money that worked like email.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. In the early days of a network-effect system, usage matters more than use-cases.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Because the value of a network grows as a function of Metcalfe's Law (value = # of engaged participants squared), in the early days simply growing the number of engaged participants matters more than the specifics of what those participants are actually doing. As the network's value grows, it will become attractive to successively more groups of users and use cases.</li> <li>Bitcoin started as the domain of researchers and fringe libertarians, then illicit transactions (Silk Road), then speculation (the ICO boom) before finally reaching adoption by the mainstream investment community. Each wave built enough monetary value in the network to make it attractive to the next set of users. Similarly Facebook went from sharing photos of attractive undergrads to how billions communicate, and Airbnb went from ratty airbeds to ~10x larger than any hotel chain, all within a few short years.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had to do it. After 12 years and <em>3,000,000x</em> appreciation, we kick off Season 8 with the best investment of all-time and our biggest episode ever: Bitcoin. From the first bitcoin transaction of 10k for two Papa John's pizzas (worth about $350m today!!) to $40k+ BTC and maybe the moon beyond, we cover the whole crazy, improbable journey of how a single 8-page PDF document changed the world of money — and perhaps the world itself — forever. </p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors. We can't wait to see you there. Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a></p> <p> The Bitcoin Playbook:</p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/bitcoin">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/bitcoin</a> )</p> <p>1. Technological paradigm shifts are ideal opportunities for attacking incumbents.</p> <ul> <li>The traditional finance system worked fantastically well for 500 years, but it wasn't built for the internet. The fact that sharing your bank account or credit card number is required in order to transact, but there's no really robust way to protect against fraud when doing so, provided the perfect seam for a new entrant. Bitcoin and its creators saw this shortcoming and created a new form of money that worked like email.</li> </ul> <p>2. In the early days of a network-effect system, usage matters more than use-cases.</p> <ul> <li>Because the value of a network grows as a function of Metcalfe's Law (value = # of engaged participants squared), in the early days simply growing the number of engaged participants matters more than the specifics of what those participants are actually doing. As the network's value grows, it will become attractive to successively more groups of users and use cases.</li> <li>Bitcoin started as the domain of researchers and fringe libertarians, then illicit transactions (Silk Road), then speculation (the ICO boom) before finally reaching adoption by the mainstream investment community. Each wave built enough monetary value in the network to make it attractive to the next set of users. Similarly Facebook went from sharing photos of attractive undergrads to how billions communicate, and Airbnb went from ratty airbeds to ~10x larger than any hotel chain, all within a few short years.</li> </ul> <p>3. Distributing network value out to its participants creates large incentives for adoption.</p> <ul> <li>Rewarding miners with bitcoin itself created a huge incentive for participants to join and stay in the Bitcoin network. Although this dynamic got a bad rap during the ICO bubble when it was overused and overpromised by grifters and scammers, it remains a powerful strategy and will likely be used more going forward.</li> <li>Perhaps most excitingly, this incentive unlocks massive new potential for open-source software development: people who work on open-source software (or provide other functions) can now receive direct value for their contributions, without being employed in any traditional sense.</li> </ul> <p>4.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As regular listeners know, we typically cover some of the biggest companies who often receive the most media attention (see Airbnb and DoorDash). But today's episode is a little different. In our conversation with Courtland Allen of Indie Hackers, the largest community of startup founders, we dive into the stories of underdogs. What happens when there are millions of people doing small business entrepreneurship? How does anyone having access to the globally addressable market of 3 billion internet users open the door for the niche-est of products? We tell the story of Courtland’s own “Indie Hacker” journey, how he came to found Indie Hackers itself, and the lessons learned along the way.<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show, the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our live Book Club discussions with top authors. <strong>Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a><br /> <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>Playbook Themes from this Episode:</strong></p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/special-acquired-x-indie-hackers"> https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/special-acquired-x-indie-hackers</a> )</p> <p><strong>1. As long as you don't quit your journey, you're still in the act of succeeding.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Indie Hackers was Courtland's seventh company. Before it, Courtland had started six other companies, each with a few thousand dollars in revenue but never as big as he wanted it to be. Looking back, Courtland has realized that everyone has a certain number of companies they need to start before they succeed: for some, that number may be one, for others, 36. For him, that number was 7. So his advice? All you have to do is not quit before you get to that number.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. The journey is as important as the destination.</strong></p> <ul> <li>While Courtland was working on some of his earlier companies, he was miserable. A few of those working years felt like a complete blur. But sometime before he started Indie Hackers, he realized that in order to keep going until you succeed (see playbook #1), you must structure your life so that it's easy for you to not quit. In other words, you have to make the journey fun — almost like the emotional counterpart to Paul Graham’s famous “default alive” concept. With this reframe, Courtland began to enjoy the journey — enjoying the new people he met and the new things he learned. This mindset helped him level up as a person. Instead of worrying and asking "am I there yet?" he was able to enjoy the building journey.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Stories are always paramount.</strong></p> <ul> <li>As we discuss so often on Acquired, stories can be an incredibly powerful force, and their value is one of the core theses/value propositions of Indie Hackers. One insight Courtland came to from Hacker News was that people didn't want to just read comments about people who didn't succeed. They wanted high quality, verified stories that were trustable in some way.</li> <li>Indie Hackers sends a survey out to users 6 months after they join the community. One of the questions the survey asks is, "would you have started your company if not for Indie Hackers?" 15-20% say they would not have started without some story or interaction on Indie Hackers!</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Don't try to create budgets — sell to people that already have them.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Courtland originally tried to monetize Indie Hackers via advertising, and shared advertisement opportunities with the Indie Hacker community. But he soon realized that these smaller businesses weren't exactly the best customers to sell to. Eventually, he transitioned to selling to enterprises, and was pleasantly surprised by how much easier it was to sell.</li> <li>The sales process simplified is: educate, then win. If you're selling to someone with a budget, you essentially bypass the education step.</li> </ul> <p><strong>5. Utilizing platforms, like everything in business, has tradeoffs.</strong></p> <ul> <li>There are no hard or fast rules in business. Everything has tradeoffs. Platforms may help with distribution but make it harder to build a brand and also create risks and dependencies. For Courtland, it was important for Indie Hackers to have its own brand. Additionally, he already had a distribution strategy (Hacker News). Hence, it made sense for Indie Hackers to be its own site, as there were many risks but few benefits to using some other platform like Medium.</li> </ul> <p><strong>6. Trust and mission alignment are critical in acquisitions.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Acquisition terms are about much more than just the purchase price. Sometimes, other considerations are more advantageous than cash (e.g. equity), and there are creative ways to align their incentives.</li> <li>For Courtland, it was crucial that he retain freedom over his time and control over the direction of Indie Hackers. Hence, it was — and still remains — key that Patrick and Courtland's relationship have a high degree of trust.</li> </ul> <p><strong>7. Acquisitions can enable established brands to take bigger risks.</strong></p> <ul> <li>“Intra-preneurship” can be difficult because the initiative is constrained by internal processes and standards as well as external expectations. Hence, you can often take bigger risks through an acquisition. Google video versus YouTube is a great example of this.</li> </ul> <p><strong>8. There is an infinite number of "indie hacker" opportunities.</strong></p> <ul> <li>There is no end to the number of niche problems that can be identified and served. Big businesses and platforms create massive opportunities to go for the long tail. New businesses can build on top of these platforms or build for these platforms, creating tools to help people use them. For example, there are thriving tools business ecosystems today for Stripe, Shopify, WordPress, and still many more use cases yet to be addressed.<br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Indie Hackers: <a href= "https://www.indiehackers.com/">https://www.indiehackers.com</a></li> </ul>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Over 13 years after its founding, one of the defining startup companies of the past decade finally makes its public debut — and boy was it a big one. But for all the hype (and all the legitimately great things Airbnb has accomplished), this is a company that looks very different today than in the past. Even before COVID, Airbnb's once-exponential bookings growth had declined to linear levels while the company's costs continued to balloon at accelerating rates. What’s going on here? Are public investors smart to bet on a permanent shift in travel behavior coming out of the pandemic? Or is this a case of unrealistic expectations? As always, we dive in.<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show, the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our live Book Club discussions with top authors. <strong>Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />  <br /></span></p> <p><strong>Playbook Themes from this Episode:</strong></p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/airbnb">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/airbnb</a> )</p> <p><strong>1. If you can create value for all sides in a market ("expand the efficient frontier"), you really can’t help but be successful.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Born out of the 2008 financial crisis, Airbnb was able to fundamentally change the nature of the travel market and provide guests with more quality for less money, while also enabling hosts to earn meaningful extra income during a very difficult economic period. This led to incredible market adoption of the service, at times almost despite the company's own actions and activities.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. When you create a market, you have an opportunity to set the terms.</strong></p> <ul> <li>By virtue of creating a whole new class of supply that had never participated in the travel market before, Airbnb was able to enact much more platform-favorable payment terms versus the hotel industry. Unlike <a href="http://booking.com/">Booking.com</a> and the OTAs, guests pay Airbnb at the time of booking, and Airbnb keeps that cash (including fees) until after check-in — which could occur weeks or even months later.</li> <li>This created an enormously beneficial cashflow dynamic for Airbnb that allowed them to grow while burning much less cash than otherwise would have been required.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. When you don't fly low to the ground, you aren't forced to operate at the lowest level of detail.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Unlike DoorDash which needed to create an enormously efficient operational machine just in order to survive, Airbnb's capital-light business model, low operational intensity and favorable cashflow dynamics meant they've never had to operate in a particularly cost-disciplined or product-focused manner. While the core business has been insulated from competition due to its global network effects, the company has missed or poorly executed on Amazon-like opportunities to expand into adjacent markets and services that could have continued to drive new growth.</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Relying solely direct/organic traffic is both a gift and a curse.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Undeniably, direct/organic customer acquisition is a wonderful goal for any business to strive for. Who wouldn't want to acquire customers without paying for them? However, if you don't also build the muscle for profitable and reliable growth through paid channels, you can be left vulnerable vulnerable when organic growth slows, as it inevitably will.<br /> <br

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 13 years after its founding, one of the defining startup companies of the past decade finally makes its public debut — and boy was it a big one. But for all the hype (and all the legitimately great things Airbnb has accomplished), this is a company that looks very different today than in the past. Even before COVID, Airbnb's once-exponential bookings growth had declined to linear levels while the company's costs continued to balloon at accelerating rates. What’s going on here? Are public investors smart to bet on a permanent shift in travel behavior coming out of the pandemic? Or is this a case of unrealistic expectations? As always, we dive in. </p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show, the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our live Book Club discussions with top authors. Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a>  </p> <p>Playbook Themes from this Episode:</p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/airbnb">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/airbnb</a> )</p> <p>1. If you can create value for all sides in a market ("expand the efficient frontier"), you really can’t help but be successful.</p> <ul> <li>Born out of the 2008 financial crisis, Airbnb was able to fundamentally change the nature of the travel market and provide guests with more quality for less money, while also enabling hosts to earn meaningful extra income during a very difficult economic period. This led to incredible market adoption of the service, at times almost despite the company's own actions and activities.</li> </ul> <p>2. When you create a market, you have an opportunity to set the terms.</p> <ul> <li>By virtue of creating a whole new class of supply that had never participated in the travel market before, Airbnb was able to enact much more platform-favorable payment terms versus the hotel industry. Unlike <a href="http://booking.com/">Booking.com</a> and the OTAs, guests pay Airbnb at the time of booking, and Airbnb keeps that cash (including fees) until after check-in — which could occur weeks or even months later.</li> <li>This created an enormously beneficial cashflow dynamic for Airbnb that allowed them to grow while burning much less cash than otherwise would have been required.</li> </ul> <p>3. When you don't fly low to the ground, you aren't forced to operate at the lowest level of detail.</p> <ul> <li>Unlike DoorDash which needed to create an enormously efficient operational machine just in order to survive, Airbnb's capital-light business model, low operational intensity and favorable cashflow dynamics meant they've never had to operate in a particularly cost-disciplined or product-focused manner. While the core business has been insulated from competition due to its global network effects, the company has missed or poorly executed on Amazon-like opportunities to expand into adjacent markets and services that could have continued to drive new growth.</li> </ul> <p>4. Relying solely direct/organic traffic is both a gift and a curse.</p> <ul> <li>Undeniably, direct/organic customer acquisition is a wonderful goal for any business to strive for. Who wouldn't want to acquire customers without paying for them? However, if you don't also build the muscle for profitable and reliable growth through paid channels, you can be left vulnerable vulnerable when organic growth slows, as it inevitably will. </li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Live from the scene of its blockbuster IPO, we recount the crazy, roller coaster journey of this "Palo Alto delivery company".

Sometimes winner-take-all markets DO tip.</strong></p> <ul> <li>The end-state that Uber (and its global peers) spent the past decade chasing — that eventually it would outrun its competitors, tip entire markets in their favor, add multiple product lines and turn massively cashflow positive — has thus far proved elusive, leading many to believe that any such undertaking is a false dream. But, since 2018 China's Meituan appears to be doing just that, all while operating in an even more competitive environment than Uber. DoorDash may now be on a similar trajectory in the US.</li> <li>That said, it's almost impossible to predict in advance how much time and capital it will take to get there, let alone any one company's odds of success. DoorDash benefitted immensely from their competitors' relative difficulties accessing capital post-2016, and was willing to sacrifice enormous dilution to outlast them. If you're going to play the winner-take-all game, you need to be willing to go all-in when others blink.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. If you're going to fly low to the ground, you also need to operate at the lowest level of detail.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Flying low to the ground (i.e., sacrificing higher margins in order to share more value back to your customers and suppliers) is a great recipe for success in highly competitive markets like e-commerce and on-demand services. However when you do so, you need to be maniacal about squeezing every last drop of efficiency out of your platform: every 1% improvement in margins could mean a 20%, 30% or even 50% profitability increase and the difference between life (for you) and death (for your competitors). DoorDash clearly gets this and has embedded this ethos in everything they do at the company.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Focus on what you can control</strong>.</p> <ul> <li>DoorDash had the capital markets turn against them HARD early on in the company's life. It would have been easy to lose focus, sell or give up, as did many of their competitors. To Tony and the entire company's credit, they kept moving forward and made decisions each step of the way that kept the company alive — even when those decisions came at a high cost. As a result they outlasted nearly all competition and were in a position to IPO at one of the highest market caps of all-time, all as an only 7 year old company.</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. "Why now" matters.</strong></p> <ul> <li>DoorDash had one of the best "why now" answers of all-time: mass-market smartphone adoption (not just high-end) made 3 things true that were never possible before: 1. average consumers could order online conveniently, 2. couriers could plug into the network via their own devices, and 3. restaurants (most of whom didn't have wifi or desk staff) could accept orders online. Before 2013 a business like this would simply have been impossible to build.<br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Carve Outs:</strong></p> <p>David:</p> <ul> <li>Hades on the Nintendo Switch: <a href=

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Live from the scene of its blockbuster IPO, we recount the crazy, roller coaster journey of this "Palo Alto delivery company". From Sand Hill darling during their Series A and B fundraises to all but left-for-dead during the great unicorn massacre of 2015/16, DoorDash has clawed their way back from the brink and emerged as America's dominant meal delivery service, and its only unit-economic positive standalone logistics player.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Live from the 2020 ASCEND Space Conference, Acquired covers the full story behind the most "out there" technology story of the past few years: Virgin Galactic. How did this space tourism company grow out of the winning X Prize team, and catch the eyes and fancy of billionaires like Paul Allen, Sir Richard Branson, and, most recently, company chairman Chamath Palihapitiya who took it public via the first "modern" technology SPAC transaction in history? Tune in to find out!!<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show, the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our live Book Club discussions with top authors. <strong>Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a><br /> <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>Playbook Themes from this Episode:</strong></p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/virgin-galactic">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/virgin-galactic</a> )</p> <p><strong>1. Prizes can be a great way to generate leverage on innovation.</strong> If done right, the X Prize and other industry prizes like it (e.g., Netflix Prize, DARPA Challenge, etc) can bring an order of magnitude more talent to bear on a challenge than what the same dollars alone could hire.</p> <ul> <li>The challenge is to create a prize that inspires and draws in a large enough pool of contributors. The aerospace industry’s “cool” factor may be what allowed the X Prize to succeed and explain why prizes aren't employed as often in other sectors.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. When trying new things, most people want to go second — but those willing to go first get the best returns.</strong>Being first into new markets carries high risk (including/especially reputational), but often also offers asymmetric upside. Investing in a new frontier when others think it’s crazy is a recipe for success — if you’re both contrarian and right.</p> <ul> <li>Chamath took a huge turn from the traditional VC playbook when he created his first SPAC in 2017, years before they went mainstream. He and his investors have generated over $1B in profits from that vehicle (which is now merged with Virgin Galactic), and have since used those proceeds to launch five more.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. The best time to invest was yesterday, the next best time is today.</strong> Great investors don’t miss the chance to invest in big markets because they’ve passed on it before. Sir Richard Branson passed on investing in the X Prize twice before partnering with Burt Rutan's winning team to build Virgin Galactic.</p> <p><strong>4. Whenever a market's prices aren't being set by supply and demand, there's probably an opportunity to disrupt that market.</strong> The traditional IPO pricing process is managed by third parties (investment banks) that represent both sides of the transaction, and also have their own economic interests at play. It's the equivalent of a real estate agent representing both the buyer and seller. As a result, many technology IPOs have left hundreds of millions or billions of dollars on the table. SPACs and direct listings are now solving that problem. Any other market with this dynamic should represent fertile ground for entrepreneurs.<br /> <br /></p> <p><strong>Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Virgin Galactic's "One Small Step" reservation program:

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Live from the 2020 ASCEND Space Conference, Acquired covers the full story behind the most "out there" technology story of the past few years: Virgin Galactic. How did this space tourism company grow out of the winning X Prize team, and catch the eyes and fancy of billionaires like Paul Allen, Sir Richard Branson, and, most recently, company chairman Chamath Palihapitiya who took it public via the first "modern" technology SPAC transaction in history? Tune in to find out!! </p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show, the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our live Book Club discussions with top authors. Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a> </p> <p>Playbook Themes from this Episode:</p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/virgin-galactic">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/virgin-galactic</a> )</p> <p>1. Prizes can be a great way to generate leverage on innovation. If done right, the X Prize and other industry prizes like it (e.g., Netflix Prize, DARPA Challenge, etc) can bring an order of magnitude more talent to bear on a challenge than what the same dollars alone could hire.</p> <ul> <li>The challenge is to create a prize that inspires and draws in a large enough pool of contributors. The aerospace industry’s “cool” factor may be what allowed the X Prize to succeed and explain why prizes aren't employed as often in other sectors.</li> </ul> <p>2. When trying new things, most people want to go second — but those willing to go first get the best returns.Being first into new markets carries high risk (including/especially reputational), but often also offers asymmetric upside. Investing in a new frontier when others think it’s crazy is a recipe for success — if you’re both contrarian and right.</p> <ul> <li>Chamath took a huge turn from the traditional VC playbook when he created his first SPAC in 2017, years before they went mainstream. He and his investors have generated over $1B in profits from that vehicle (which is now merged with Virgin Galactic), and have since used those proceeds to launch five more.</li> </ul> <p>3. The best time to invest was yesterday, the next best time is today. Great investors don’t miss the chance to invest in big markets because they’ve passed on it before. Sir Richard Branson passed on investing in the X Prize twice before partnering with Burt Rutan's winning team to build Virgin Galactic.</p> <p>4. Whenever a market's prices aren't being set by supply and demand, there's probably an opportunity to disrupt that market. The traditional IPO pricing process is managed by third parties (investment banks) that represent both sides of the transaction, and also have their own economic interests at play. It's the equivalent of a real estate agent representing both the buyer and seller. As a result, many technology IPOs have left hundreds of millions or billions of dollars on the table. SPACs and direct listings are now solving that problem. Any other market with this dynamic should represent fertile ground for entrepreneurs. </p> <p>Links:</p> <ul> <li>Virgin Galactic's "One Small Step" reservation program: <a

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Superstar past guest and Superhuman CEO Rahul Vorha joins us for a deep dive on how Superhuman applies concepts from game design to building productivity software. We're not talking points and badges — we mean hardcore, Unreal Engine-style technical innovations and Fortnite-level understanding of fun and mastery. It's a topic where Rahul has serious cred: before Superhuman and Rapportive, he worked as a game designer on RuneScape, the pioneering browser-based MMORPG. This is a topic every founder, engineer, product and even sales person should listen to. Tune in!</p> <p>You can listen to Part I of our Superhuman story with Rahul here: <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/superhuman">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/superhuman</a><br />  <br /></p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show, the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our new live Book Club discussions with top authors. Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a></p> <p><strong><br /> Playbook Themes from this Episode:<br /></strong> Also available on our website at <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/special-superhuman-part-ii-designing-software-to-feel-like-a-game-with-rahul-vohra"> https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/special-superhuman-part-ii-designing-software-to-feel-like-a-game-with-rahul-vohra</a> )</p> <p><strong>1. Game Design not Gamification.</strong> Good games nurture intrinsic motivation in players, in part because they’re fun. “Gamification” instead uses external motivators like badges, levels, and points to goad users into interacting with the product.</p> <ul> <li>Game design combines goals and objectives, intentional emotional design, and the psychological phenomenon of flow. It forces the designer to consider, what is fun? To which Rahul’s answer is “pleasant surprise”.</li> <li>Great game design creates intrinsic motivation: “doing things because they are inherently interesting and satisfying.” Adding extrinsic motivation like points or rewards can actually <em>erode</em> the desire to do a task.</li> <li>Rahul’s Advice for product designers: <strong>“Pull back from user wants and user needs. Instead, design for <em>fun</em>.”</strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. It's more important to consider how your product makes customers <em>feel</em> than what it functionally does for them.</strong> When designing any product, interaction, or experience, identifying the exact desired user emotions can be incredibly powerful.</p> <ul> <li><strong>How do you do this?</strong> Find opportunities where the product naturally delights, surprises, or gives users a sense of accomplishment - and find light-touch ways to amplify it.</li> <li><strong>Example: Inbox 0</strong>. Superhuman found that reaching Inbox 0 is one of the most emotionally resonant moments in someone’s interaction with their email. To amplify that moment, Superhuman uses beautiful imagery as a reward to trigger specific emotions when a user empties their inbox.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Democratizing powerful tools that were previously reserved for an elite class is a recipe success.</strong> Superhuman moved mountains to create that “10x better” experience before launching. Even when starved for resources, it can pay off in a big way for a startup to expend massive engineering effort to build a better foundation than the competition.</p> <ul> <li>The team at Superhuman faced a challenge: <strong>How can we deliver the same speed and power that developers have in code editors to ordinary people in their email inboxes?</strong> To solve it, they spent <strong>2 years</strong> <strong>re-writing large parts of Chrome</strong> to make everything faster. Now the Superhuman browser app is faster than any standalone email app experience and provides sub-100 ms results. The result: users don’t have time to break flow state.</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Storytelling is everything.</strong> Don Valentine used to say “Money flows as a function of the story.” Storytelling matters across all dimensions of a startup: pitching investors, recruiting talent, selling products, building a cult-like following. On the podcast, Rahul ties rich detail and visuals to his core points.</p> <ul> <li>When racing Lamborghinis: “you see the landscape rip by, you hear the scream of the engine, you taste burning rubber.”</li> <li>When pitching his co-founder on joining: “I could see as the gears turned in his mind as he’s munching this pizza, increasingly slowly until his mouth ground to a halt.”</li> <li>When describing engineers coding in flow state: “our fingers dance across a keyboard like we’re playing a piano.”</li> </ul>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A week before the 2020 US Presidential election, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo joins us to tell the story of a company that has impacted all of our lives (political and otherwise) like none other. While it's easy to forget now, a very viable alternate history exists where it's Twitter, not Facebook, who owns Instagram, and Vine, not TikTok, that's the global platform for mobile video. We dive into it all on this episode — and of course while we had Dick, we also had to discuss his controversial recent deleted tweet.<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show, the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our live Book Club discussions with top authors. <strong>Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a><br /> <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>New!</strong> We're codifying our own Playbook notes and takeaways from each episode, and posting them here in the show notes and on our website. You can read them below or at: <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/twitter-with-dick-costolo">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/twitter-with-dick-costolo</a><br />  <br /></p> <p><strong>Playbook Themes from this Episode:</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Sometimes early advantages matter. A lot.</strong> In a network economy industry (like social media), it's almost impossible to chase down someone with an established lead. The only way you can hope to compete is by changing the game. And even that is a long shot. <ul> <li>Once Facebook — and then Instagram within Facebook — had established a meaningful active user lead over Twitter, there was no "down the middle" play Twitter could run to catch up. Twitter recognized this and attempted all sorts of orthogonal strategies: video (Vine), live (Periscope), music (Twitter Music), syndication (Moments), exclusive content (the NFL deal). In each case either Facebook was able to copy and co-opt the innovation, or the attempt simply failed.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Sometimes reach matters. A lot.</strong> If you're operating in a network economy, your service MUST deliver a first-class experience on every platform that matters. <ul> <li>Vine launched on iOS and immediately went to #1 in the App Store. But they didn't get a good Android experience out fast enough, which fractured the social graph that users could share across. Instagram was able to respond aggressively with a first-class video experience across both iOS and Android before Vine could stop the bleeding — and the rest is history.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Network Resiliency.</strong> Some network graphs are more inherently defensible than others. How easy it is to "rehydrate" your network somewhere else should drive how closely you guard it. <ul> <li>Facebook, LinkedIn and WhatsApp all have relatively low defensible networks — if you were to exfiltrate their graphs, you could recreate their value quickly. This is why all of those companies / products significantly restrict connection exporting, and also why they were able to bootstrap quickly in the early days by importing users' address books.</li> <li>By contrast, the Twitter graph is about interest, not social connections. Even if you exfiltrated all its connections, it'd be very difficult to recreate Twitter (people have tried). This dynamic made it more difficult for Twitter to scale quickly, but also has made it more resilient over time. The core Twitter product is just as robust — if not more — today than it was in 2010... the same can't be said for the blue Facebook product, which has bled out to Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, Snap, iMessage, etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Balancing forest fires and forestry management.</strong> As a leader of a rapidly growing organization, you face two types of challenges: "forest fires" (this crazy thing just happened and we need to respond), and "forestry management" (this set of crazy things will keep happening until we figure out a solution that scales). You need a different mental state to approach each, and balancing between the two is incredibly difficult when you're see-sawing back and forth every day.<br /> <br /></li> </ol> <p><strong>Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Ashish Goel at Stanford: <a href= "https://web.stanford.edu/~ashishg/twitter.html">https://web.stanford.edu/~ashishg/twitter.html</a></li> <li>Dick and Adam's new firm, 01 Advisors: <a href= "https://01a.com/">https://01a.com/</a><br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Carve Outs:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Vote! <a href= "https://www.vote.org/">https://www.vote.org</a></li> </ul>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On the eve of the 2020 NBA Finals, we dive DEEP into the history and business model of the league behind the world's 2nd largest and fastest growing major sport. How did the NBA grow from merely an excuse to monetize hockey arena off-nights into a global powerhouse with more reach and influence and reach than any other American sport? Tune in!!</p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show, the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our new live Book Club discussions with top authors. <strong>Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a><br /> <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>New!</strong> We're codifying our own Playbook notes and takeaways from each episode, and posting them here in the show notes and on our website. You can read them below or at: <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/the-nba">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/the-nba</a><br />  <br /></p> <p><strong>Playbook Themes from this Episode:</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Distribution.</strong> Great product-market fit is necessary but not sufficient for outsized success; you also need great distribution.</p> <ul> <li>Basketball had great product-market fit from the beginning — it was an indoor sport that could be played in any weather, didn't require lots of specialized equipment or setup, was relatively safe and provided a great player and spectator experience.</li> <li>However basketball's rapid dissemination was helped <em>enormously</em> by its origin within the missionary context of the YMCA organization, which quickly spread the new game to its branches around North America and the world (including and especially China) — all 50 years before the NBA's founding.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Hobbies.</strong> A corollary to Paul Graham's idea that great markets start as toys: finding the right business model to professionalize an amateur or "hobby" market with a large or rabid fan base can yield massive business opportunities.</p> <ul> <li>Basketball was hugely popular for decades before the NBA came along. College and independent professional teams (like the Harlem Globetrotters and New York Rens) proved people would pay to watch great talent; the NBA simply provided the right league structure and real estate to serve that demand at scale.</li> <li>Other examples: personal computers and Apple, electric cars and Tesla, video game streaming and Twitch, bitcoin and Coinbase, etc.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Influence = Power.</strong> The NBA's strategy to "make the players the stars" has succeeded tremendously, and stands in stark contrast to the other major American sports leagues.</p> <ul> <li>NBA players both individually and as a whole have an order of magnitude more social followers than other major American athletes and, relatedly, have also accumulated an order of magnitude more wealth: 7 current and former NBA players have ~half billion wealth or more, compared to only 1 from all other American team sports.</li> <li>Nike's Jordan deal + creation of the Air Jordan brand wrote the blueprint for the modern influencer endorsement (pre-<a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/oprah-harpo-studios">Oprah</a>!), and is perhaps the most successful non-acquisition deal of all-time.</li> <li>Social influence is a compounding network economy: because NBA players have more followers, they win over more fans (and especially young fans) and aspiring athletes than other sports leagues, which leads to new players and stars getting more influence, which repeats the cycle and widens the lead over other sports.</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Internationalization.</strong> The world is a big place. <em>Much</em> more potential talent and customers exist outside any country's borders than inside. The wider you cast your net, the greater rewards you can reap.</p> <ul> <li>Starting with the Dream Team in 1992, the NBA embarked on a deliberate campaign to internationalize its image, both with players and fans. The result is this past season 1 billion people watched the NBA (the vast minority of whom were Americans), and 25% of NBA rosters (and probably 50%+ of its young stars) are international. No other major American sport is anywhere close.</li> <li>Regular Acquired mega-theme reminder: China is ALWAYS bigger and more important than you think it is. 600m people in China watch basketball and 300m people play basketball. That's an entire Unites States' worth of developing players, and two US's worth of fans. Whether the future value of those players and fans accrues to the NBA or the CBA (Chinese Basketball Association) will shape <em>everything</em> about the game going forward.</li> </ul> <p><strong>5. Cinematic Universes.</strong> The best media properties create and support whole ecosystems <em>around</em> the core product and across mediums.</p> <ul> <li>Non-game content like All-Star Weekend and the Slam Dunk Contest, as well as short-form and behind-the-scenes access like SportsCenter highlights, Inside the NBA, etc. provide the NBA with additional compelling (and monetizable) content, all while building the game's reach and deepening fan relationships.</li> <li>Unsurprisingly, this echoes the core of the Disney flywheel. Technology only amplifies this dynamic: social media, over-the-top distribution and direct fan relationships provide more opportunities for the best properties to increase their share of customers' attention.</li> </ul> <p><strong>6. Younger customers = More Future Cashflows.</strong></p> <ul> <li>57% of US 13-17 year-olds list the NBA as their favorite sports league, compared to 13% for the NFL and 4% for MLB. Assuming those numbers hold for this cohort (and younger), the impact on relative future cash flows (and valuations) for the respective sports is <em>enormous</em>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>7. Beachfront property.</strong> That said, valuations in any market aren't just driven by the discounted sum of future cashflows; scarcity also matters. Nowhere is this better exhibited than NBA team valuations.</p> <ul> <li>Average NBA team valuations have risen 600% in the past decade. Part of this is due to the League's incredible growth. But perhaps as much or more is simply because lots of people want to buy NBA franchises (see e.g., Ballmer) but there are only 30 properties, and ~0-2 are available for purchase at any given time.<br

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the eve of the 2020 NBA Finals, we dive DEEP into the history and business model of the league behind the world's 2nd largest and fastest growing major sport. How did the NBA grow from merely an excuse to monetize hockey arena off-nights into a global powerhouse with more reach and influence and reach than any other American sport? Tune in!!</p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show, the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our new live Book Club discussions with top authors. Join here at: <a href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a> </p> <p>New! We're codifying our own Playbook notes and takeaways from each episode, and posting them here in the show notes and on our website. You can read them below or at: <a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/the-nba">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/the-nba</a>  </p> <p>Playbook Themes from this Episode:</p> <p>1. Distribution. Great product-market fit is necessary but not sufficient for outsized success; you also need great distribution.</p> <ul> <li>Basketball had great product-market fit from the beginning — it was an indoor sport that could be played in any weather, didn't require lots of specialized equipment or setup, was relatively safe and provided a great player and spectator experience.</li> <li>However basketball's rapid dissemination was helped <em>enormously</em> by its origin within the missionary context of the YMCA organization, which quickly spread the new game to its branches around North America and the world (including and especially China) — all 50 years before the NBA's founding.</li> </ul> <p>2. Hobbies. A corollary to Paul Graham's idea that great markets start as toys: finding the right business model to professionalize an amateur or "hobby" market with a large or rabid fan base can yield massive business opportunities.</p> <ul> <li>Basketball was hugely popular for decades before the NBA came along. College and independent professional teams (like the Harlem Globetrotters and New York Rens) proved people would pay to watch great talent; the NBA simply provided the right league structure and real estate to serve that demand at scale.</li> <li>Other examples: personal computers and Apple, electric cars and Tesla, video game streaming and Twitch, bitcoin and Coinbase, etc.</li> </ul> <p>3. Influence = Power. The NBA's strategy to "make the players the stars" has succeeded tremendously, and stands in stark contrast to the other major American sports leagues.</p> <ul> <li>NBA players both individually and as a whole have an order of magnitude more social followers than other major American athletes and, relatedly, have also accumulated an order of magnitude more wealth: 7 current and former NBA players have ~half billion wealth or more, compared to only 1 from all other American team sports.</li> <li>Nike's Jordan deal + creation of the Air Jordan brand wrote the blueprint for the modern influencer endorsement (pre-<a href= "https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/oprah-harpo-studios">Oprah</a>!), and is perhaps the most successful non-acquisition deal of all-time.</li> <li>Social influence is a compounding network economy: because NBA players have more followers, they win over more fans (and especially young fans) and aspiring athletes than other sports leagues, which leads to new players and stars getting more influence, which repeats the cycle and widens the lead over other sports.</li> </ul> <p>4. Internationalization. The world is a big place. <em>Much</em> more potential talent and customers exist outside any country's borders than inside. The wider you cast your net, the greater rewards you can reap.</p> <ul> <li>Starting with the Dream Team in 1992, the NBA embarked on a deliberate campaign to internationalize its image, both with players and fans. The result is this past season 1 billion people watched the NBA (the vast minority of whom were Americans), and 25% of NBA rosters (and probably 50%+ of its young stars) are international. No other major American sport is anywhere close.</li> <li>Regular Acquired mega-theme reminder: China is ALWAYS bigger and more important than you think it is. 600m people in China watch basketball and 300m people play basketball. That's an entire Unites States' worth of developing players, and two US's worth of fans. Whether the future value of those players and fans accrues to the NBA or the CBA (Chinese Basketball Association) will shape <em>everything</em> about the game going forward.</li> </ul> <p>5. Cinematic Universes. The best media properties create and support whole ecosystems <em>around</em> the core product and across mediums.</p> <ul> <li>Non-game content like All-Star Weekend and the Slam Dunk Contest, as well as short-form and behind-the-scenes access like SportsCenter highlights, Inside the NBA, etc. provide the NBA with additional compelling (and monetizable) content, all while building the game's reach and deepening fan relationships.</li> <li>Unsurprisingly, this echoes the core of the Disney flywheel. Technology only amplifies this dynamic: social media, over-the-top distribution and direct fan relationships provide more opportunities for the best properties to increase their share of customers' attention.</li> </ul> <p>6. Younger customers = More Future Cashflows.</p> <ul> <li>57% of US 13-17 year-olds list the NBA as their favorite sports league, compared to 13% for the NFL and 4% for MLB. Assuming those numbers hold for this cohort (and younger), the impact on relative future cash flows (and valuations) for the respective sports is <em>enormous</em>.</li> </ul> <p>7. Beachfront property. That said, valuations in any market aren't just driven by the discounted sum of future cashflows; scarcity also matters. Nowhere is this better exhibited than NBA team valuations.</p> <ul> <li>Average NBA team valuations have risen 600% in the past decade. Part of this is due to the League's incredible growth. But perhaps as much or more is simply because lots of people want to buy NBA franchises (see e.g., Ballmer) but there are only 30 properties, and ~0-2 are available for purchase at any given time.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Acquired teams up with the My First Million podcast for a “best of both worlds” crossover episode.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We go deep behind the "epic" story of a plucky game developer from Cary, North Carolina (by way of Potomac, Maryland) which, after bootstrapping for its first 22 years, has quietly morphed into an $18b juggernaut that may become the most important technology company for the next evolution of the internet. And oh yeah, its founder, CEO and controlling shareholder? He cares more about land conservation than he does about money, he's beholden to no one and has the firepower of China's biggest internet giant behind him, and he's willing to stare down Apple, Google and anyone else who doesn't support his vision of an open and equal-opportunity internet future in a fight to the death. You'll want to buckle your seats for this one!!</p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show, the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our new Book Club live sessions with authors like Hamilton Helmer of 7 Powers and Will Thorndike of The Outsiders. <strong>Join here at: <a class= "notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" href= "https://acquired.fm/lp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot= "">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a> <br /> <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>New!</strong> We're codifying our own Playbook notes and takeaways from each episode, and posting them here in the show notes and on our website. You can read them below or at: <a href= "http://www.acquired.fm/episodes/epic-games">www.acquired.fm/episodes/epic-games</a><br />  <br /></p> <p><strong>Playbook:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Good companies find gold in a rush. Great companies sell jeans and pickaxes to everyone who pans. <strong>The best companies sell jeans, pickaxes AND find more gold than anyone else.</strong> <ul> <li>Epic's two-part business model of the Unreal Engine plus Fortnite (and other games and experiences) is like AWS plus Amazon's consumer facing businesses: not only do they create and sell the infrastructure that powers a whole industry, but as their own "first and best" customers they can use its features most effectively and inform their own future roadmap of what to build.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>"Games as a Service"</strong> (embodied by titles like Fortnite, Roblox, Minecraft, League of Legends and Honor of Kings, etc) <strong>is a revolution that's unlocking value on the same order of magnitude that SaaS did for software.</strong> <ul> <li>Much like SaaS apps, GaaS experiences can be built by small teams with a creative insight, in a capital-light fashion on open, best-in-class infrastructure that's cheap to rent (Unreal Engine or Unity). They can be designed to address initially small or niche-seeming use cases and desires (e.g. Battle Royale), but then adapt and scale elastically when they strike a rich vein. And perhaps most importantly they monetize via ongoing subscription and virtual economy revenue that aligns with actual user engagement, vs one-time upfront fees on boxed software.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Zero (or low) marginal cost businesses are special opportunities.</strong> <ul> <li>Anytime you can sell something for a significant price that costs you little/nothing to create incremental copies of — e.g. Fortnite skins — you have the potentially to do very, very well.</li> <li>People sometimes forget, but this dynamic also existed before the internet: the media business (both content and distribution) was perhaps the best and most consistent industry of the 20th century from a Return on Capital perspective. There's a reason Warren Buffet called Tom Murphy and Dan Burke of Capital Cities the best capital allocation team of all-time — they were playing on a field tilted in their advantage.</li> <li>That said, the internet has brought this dynamic to MANY more sectors of the economy, and its next iteration (the metaverse) will extend it to even more.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Capital scarcity creates a forcing function for disciplined and effective capital allocation. Capital abundance often leads to undisciplined and ineffective capital allocation.</strong> <ul> <li>Epic created immense value during its 22 years as a bootstrapped company. While its first $330m capital raise from Tencent in 2012 has ultimately led to even more value creation, the first ~4-5 years post-investment saw the company almost lose its way with multiple long, costly and undisciplined game projects for which actual market demand was unclear.</li> <li>When the company ultimately re-captured its mojo with Fortnite, it was by going back to its roots with a fast-follow project built by a small team in response to clear market demand — with a unique twist that made it special.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Retaining "control"</strong> — over your distribution, your margins, your product decisions and ultimately your company — <strong>allows you to build the biggest possible platform in the long run.</strong> <ul> <li>The old saying that "you can't build a really big company on someone else's platform" is usually true. Multiple times along its journey, Epic and Tim chose to go the harder, longer, and riskier "independent" route vs. relying on publishers, retailers or (now) app stores.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Iteration is the in-practice implementation of compounding.</strong> <ul> <li>Iteration is a standard dogma in startups and engineering (e.g. "agile", etc.), and compounding is a standard dogma in (value) investing. In practice they're two sides of the same coin: the small iterations that Epic does year in and year out — on both the Unreal Engine and Fortnite + other GaaS experiences — compound to create extraordinary value. Or put another way, within operating businesses like Epic, dollars don't just compound on their own. Retained earnings need to be re-deployed every day to build that next feature or service that future developers (and non-developers!) can build on top of.<br /> <br /></li> </ul> </li> </ul>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We're joined by two very special guests, Eventbrite CEO Julia Hartz and her cofounder, spouse and Eventbrite Chairman Kevin Hartz, to tell their story of building Eventbrite together (along with their lives and family) from the PayPal diaspora to bootstrapped business, unicorn status, IPO and now starting all over again in the wake of COVID with both a tragedy and a huge new opportunity in front of them as public company.</p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show (including the episode with Kevin on SPACs), the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our new Book Club live sessions with authors like Hamilton Helmer of 7 Powers and Will Thorndike of The Outsiders. <strong>Join here at: <a href="https://acquired.fm/lp/" rel= "payment">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a><br /> <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>New!</strong> We're codifying our own Playbook notes and takeaways from each episode, and posting them here in the show notes and on our website.

Most VCs ignored or were confused by this data (~"Call us when you attack Ticketmaster."), but they missed that it unlocked a massive new market which previously operated only through word-of-mouth and cash transactions (if at all).</li> <li>All three major dislocations of the 21st century — the tech bubble bursting in 2001, the financial crisis in 2008, and now COVID in 2020 — have only accelerated offline behaviors to online.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We close out Season 6 with the story of perhaps the single most successful media entrepreneur of all-time: Oprah Winfrey, and her juggernaut conglomerate Harpo Studios.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Missing Acquired? We are too. But the world's not done adapting just yet, and neither are we. So get ready for (in the immortal words of Sammy Hagar) the best of both worlds: an Acquired + Adapting crossover lollapalooza... at Podapalooza 2020! We'll be covering the mother of all adaptations, Intel's abandonment of the memory business in favor of microprocessors in the mid-1980's.</p> <p>What is Podapalooza? It's a charity podcast festival that our friends over at Glow are putting on next weekend, April 25-26, and we're really excited to be part of it. Dozens of the best podcasters on the internet (e.g., Patrick at Invest Like the Best, Levar Burton, Cory Doctorow, J.D. Vance, etc.) are creating exclusive content for the festival, with all proceeds going to COVID-19 relief. As Glow puts it, Podapalooza is the 2020 version of Live-Aid: podcast hosts instead of rockers, pajamas at home instead of big hair on stage, but still the same purpose of supporting relief for the most important cause of this moment. We think it's a really great idea -- we've already bought our tickets and hope you do too.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The world has changed. Acquired is changing too: we’re taking a pause from our normal episodes. The world doesn’t need stories of M&A and IPOs right now. But it does still need stories of great companies and great leaders. So we’re taking everything that we’ve put into Acquired - our format, our infrastructure, and the way we can reach all of you - and launching Adapting. Adapting is a series all about doing just that -- changing to fit what the world needs right now, not what it needed last week.</p> <p>Our first episode starts on the front lines of change: the local restaurant industry.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world has changed. Acquired is changing too: we’re taking a pause from our normal episodes. The world doesn’t need stories of M&A and IPOs right now. But it does still need stories of great companies and great leaders. So we’re taking everything that we’ve put into Acquired - our format, our infrastructure, and the way we can reach all of you - and launching Adapting. Adapting is a series all about doing just that -- changing to fit what the world needs right now, not what it needed last week.</p> <p>Our first episode starts on the front lines of change: the local restaurant industry.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wait is over. Acquired returns with a very special Part II of the Sequoia Capital story, joined by the very best person in the world to help us tell it - Doug Leone. Since 1996, Doug has served as Sequoia’s Global Managing Partner, in charge of overseeing the firm’s incredible expansion from a single, $150m early-stage fund focused on Northern California to the multi-billion dollar global powerhouse it is today. Doug is incredibly candid and insightful about all that has gone into building the modern Sequoia: from winning Google and missing Facebook, to the enormous (and enormously successful) bet on decentralized expansion in China and India, to the firm’s “proudest moment” at the depth of the dot com bust. This episode is an absolute must-listen for anyone in the tech, startup and venture ecosystems today.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take Acquired to the Old Town Road to cover the amazing story behind the biggest global sensation of 2019 — and the highest valued private startup in the world — TikTok. How did a mid-30 year old UX architect at enterprise software giant SAP wind up creating Gen Z’s favorite social app that’s now rivaling Instagram in global MAU? Why is a 2017 merger of two Chinese companies being branded a US national security threat and retroactively placed under review by CFIUS? And perhaps most importantly, why is TikTok such an important product & technology innovation that all of us should be learning from?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We take Acquired to the Old Town Road to cover the amazing story behind the biggest global sensation of 2019 — and the highest valued private startup in the world — TikTok.

Why is a 2017 merger of two Chinese companies being branded a US national security threat and retroactively placed under review by CFIUS? And perhaps most importantly, why is TikTok such an important product & technology innovation that all of us should be learning from?

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Flywheel is strong with this one. We dive deep into the origins of one of the boldest business strategy decisions of our time: Disney CEO Bob Iger’s attempt to buck the Innovator’s Dilemma - and forego billions of dollars in cashflow from Netflix and pay TV providers - in order to establish a direct distribution relationship with its customers for the first time in the company’s history. Is this the force awakening within the house that Walt built, or a phantom menace that will drag Disney to the dark side of unprofitability?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the second episode of our APLUSS(Z!) IPO saga, we dive into the history behind the planet’s largest non-social social network, Pinterest.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We enter the wayback machine and revisit the subject of Acquired’s second ever episode, Facebook’s bombshell 2012 acquisition of Instagram — this time with the help of then-Facebook executive Emily White, who moved over post-acquisition to become Instagram’s first business head. Together with Kevin and Mike, Emily helped build Instagram's business model, which today accounts for nearly 1/4 of all of Facebook’s revenue. Is this still Acquired’s canonical A+ with an extra 3.5 years of hindsight?

We hope you enjoy the conversation as much as we did!</p> <p> </p> <p>Links:</p> <ul> <li><a href= "https://www.wsj.com/video/a-look-at-glitch-a-new-online-game/657B892C-C122-46BA-A973-D58E3FE1839A.html"> Kara interviewing Stewart Butterfield, CEO of… Glitch?</a></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Acquired wraps up a big few weeks of coverage with not an IPO or an M&A or a fundraising round, but what’s still the largest tech exit in recent memory: Spotify’s $30B direct public listing. We dive into what it all means and how we got here: from Napster to iTunes to Facebook (and even some Justin Timberlake thrown in for good measure).

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Hey Acquired listeners. A note about this show: we recorded this episode the night before the 2016 Election Day in the US.

Two days later, we woke up to a very different world than the one we were expecting.</em></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Reflecting on what’s happened, and the past few months of our show, we wanted to say two things:</em></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>First, we want to apologize for our cavalier attitude toward this election cycle, and our glossing over the clearly very real problems and deep divide in America that it represented.

That was wrong, the sentiment behind it was wrong, and it was insensitive to the very real pain a lot of people are feeling out there on both sides.</em></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Second, looking back on this particular episode about the Facebook IPO, we think it actually might present a relevant parable for our country right now and--we hope--some important lessons for the technology industry going forward. For all the wonderful aspects of the tech industry that we celebrate on this show, there is no doubt that it also bears a great deal of responsibility for the current divide in America, and especially in its contribution to wealth inequality. Likewise, for all the wonderful aspects to the Facebook IPO story, as told in this episode, there is a very dark side as well: Facebook shareholders, investment banks and institutional investors raked in billions of dollars at the expense of individual retail investors who lost their shirts.</em></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>At the same time, Facebook’s perseverance through their “broken IPO", and their determination in overcoming with incredible speed the massive, existential challenge to their business model posed by mobile, is something we think *can be* an inspiration to us all on how to move forward even when that seems hard.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ben & David break down Jet.com’s meteoric rise, culminating in Walmart’s blockbuster $3B+ acquisition of the company just two years after its founding.
