      <title>Affirmative Action Faces Toughest Test in a Generation</title>
      <description>For more than 50 years, colleges and universities around the country have taken race into account as they craft their incoming classes. But now a pair of lawsuits could change the face of higher education in this country. It’s the biggest challenge to affirmative action in a generation. And, given the makeup of this Supreme Court, it is very likely affirmative action in college admissions could be found unconstitutional.
Over three episodes, we will explore the legal issues around affirmative action in higher education. Does the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibit all discrimination based on race? Or is benign discrimination permissible — taking race into account in order to help groups that have been marginalized? Does the constitution leave room to remedy society’s ills?
In this episode, we explore the 1978 case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke — the first challenge to affirmative action decided by the Supreme Court. Guests include:

* Robert “Bo” Links — Attorney for Allan Bakke

* Michelle Adams — Professor at the University of Michigan Law School

* Ted Shaw — Professor at the University of North Carolina, and former president of the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund

* Garrett Epps — Professor at the University of Oregon School of Law

* John Jeffries — Former dean of the University of Virginia School of Law

      <title>Big Law Gender Gap: Re-imagining the Legal Workforce [Bonus Episode]</title>
      <description>Law firms have a gender equity problem. Data has shown that women struggle to reach the upper levels of the profession, and that those who do had to work harder than their male counterparts. For example, two thirds of female attorneys say they've been perceived as less committed to their careers, compared with just two percent of male attorneys, according to a 2019 ABA survey.
The reasons why aren't a mystery: the pay gap, the "motherhood penalty," legacy origination, a dearth of male mentors, and sexism, to name a few.
But what are the solutions? If the ideal, female-friendly law firm could be created from scratch, with an infinite amount of start-up capital, how would it be done? We posed that question to nearly a dozen people in the legal industry, including diversity consultants, law firm partners, ex-partners, associates, and women who were on track to make partner but felt they were forced to leave. In this podcast, they tell us what they'd prioritize and some of the challenges that can't be fixed with money.

      <title>Why the Supreme Court's Gun Decision Matters So Much [Bonus Episode]</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/supreme-court-gun-case-to-set-future-rights-control-podcast</link>
      <description>In a landmark 2nd Amendment decision on Thursday, the Supreme Court struck down New York's gun licensing law. It's a decision that transforms where and when a gun can be carried. And, for the first time, the Court recognized a constitutional right to carry a gun outside of the home, in public. If you know this is a big deal, but you're not sure why, or you just want a refresher on how we go here, we've got you covered.
Today we're releasing an episode of our Cases &amp; Controversies podcast for our [Un]Common Law listeners. This episode was originally released in November, just after oral arguments in the case. Bloomberg Law's Kimberly Robinson and Jordan Rubin explain what it's all about and why it is a "landmark decision."
And, for the latest on this case and the Supreme Court go to news.bloomberglaw.com.

      <title>2. Beyond NIL: Will College Sports Become a Free Market?</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>The new era of name, image, and likeness in college sports has seen rapid change. For instance, initially athletes were signing deals directly with brands and companies. Now, so-called “NIL collectives” are amassing multi-million-dollar funds to attract star recruits. Critics say these funds are being used as back-door recruiting inducements which violate the NCAA’s interim NIL policy.
Many college coaches and administrators have complained that the interim policy is vague and unenforceable. But that may be just the beginning thanks to several new cases progressing in both federal court and at the National Labor Relations Board. Either could potentially alter the landscape even further—making college sports a completely free market or redefining some college teams as employees of the schools they play for.
In the final episode of our two-part series on NIL in college sports we speak with:

Stewart Mandel, editor-in-chief of college football coverage at the Athletic.

Jeffery Kessler, co-executive chairman at Winston and Strawn, and co-lead counsel for the athletes in NCAA vs. Alston.

Ekow Yankah, professor of Law at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law and author of “Is NIL Destroying College Sports.”

Audrey Anderson, chair of the higher education practice group at Bass Berry &amp; Sims.

      <description>College sports is closing out the first year of the name, image and likeness era for athletes.
Since July 1 2021, athletes have been free to earn money from marketing deals on their NIL rights, including through endorsements, appearances, modeling, and hosting camps. One UCLA basketball player even launched his own cryptocurrency. The right of publicity now belongs to collegiate athletes. This comes after decades of strictly enforced rules barring student athletes from receiving any compensation beyond the value of their scholarships.
NIL rights mark an inflection point in both college sports broadly, as well as the decades-long legal battle to allow athletes to share in the billion-dollar collegiate sports industry. But lingering questions remain. Even among those who say athletes deserve to earn money, some say the current NIL state laws and NCAA guidelines aren't working.
In this first episode of a two-part series, the [Un]Common Law podcast will examine the NIL landscape, some of the cases that led to this new era, the patchwork of state laws, and the legal and policy concerns going forward.
In this episode we speak with:


Kyle Jahner, a reporter covering trademark and intellectual property for Bloomberg Law.


Tim Nevious, a sports attorney who was part of the original legal team that brought the Alston vs. NCAA case.


David McGriff, an private practice attorney who specializes in setting up NIL deals.

      <title>The End of an Era: Beveridge's Outgoing Chairman Ben Wilson on Leadership, Law and Life [Bonus Episode: Black Lawyers Speak]</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>On January 1, Ben Wilson will officially conclude his tenure as chairman of Beveridge &amp; Diamond and retire from the firm.
As first reported by Bloomberg Law, Wilson, affectionately regarded as the dean of Black partners at major law firms, announced his retirement this fall after 45 years in legal practice, 35 of those years with the firm.
Wilson became chairman of the Washington, D.C.-based Beveridge &amp; Diamond in 2017, 31 years after entering the firm as its first Black partner. But his impact stretches far beyond his firm. Over the years, the Harvard Law graduate has mentored generations of Black and other diverse law firm partners, general counsel and law students across the country, becoming known to many as a teacher, a coach and a friend.
In 2008, founded the Diverse Partners Network, which he’ll continue to lead after retirement, renamed as the Diverse Lawyers Network. He is also the founder of the African American Managing Partners Network, a tight-knit network of African American leaders of major law firms, and the African American General Counsel Network.
Lisa Helem, Bloomberg Law’s Executive Editor for Strategic Initiatives, spoke with Wilson about law firm leadership, his formative years growing up in Jackson, Mississippi, his work to improve diversity in the legal profession and his legacy.
We present that conversation here as a special episode of our award-winning “Black Lawyers Speak” series, hosted on UnCommon Law.

      <title>3. Why Can't We Have One Bar Exam for All Jurisdictions? </title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>Some frustration with the bar exam comes not just because it’s a hard test. Differences in state licensing requirements can mean attorneys may have to take the bar exam multiple times.
In the final episode of [Un]Common Law’s three-part look at the bar exam, we ask why can't there be one bar exam for all U.S. jurisdictions? A national bar exam that eliminates the need for a patchwork of state tests? The answer turns in part on the test called the Uniform Bar Exam or UBE. Developed by the National Conference of Bar Examiners to solve the issue of portability, the UBE allows participant jurisdictions to accept exam scores from other participating jurisdictions. Still, some critics, such as the New York State Bar Association, have taken aim at the UBE for being “too universal,” and now recommend that their state withdraw.
In this episode we speak with:

Alex Su, head of community development at IronClad.

Alan Scheinkman, retired judge who was appointed chair of a special task force of the New York State Bar Association

Richard Maltby, a Florida-based attorney for Sandberg Phoenix &amp; von Gontard, P.C.

Natalie Rodriguez, associate professor of law at Southwestern Law School and member of California’s blue-ribbon commission on the future of the state bar exam.

Cynthia Martin, chief judge on the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western District and former chair of the NCBE task force charged with recommending the “next generation” changes to the Uniform Bar Exam.

      <title>2. Could a Law School Diploma Substitute for the Bar Exam? </title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/could-a-law-school-diploma-stand-in-for-the-bar-exam-podcast</link>
      <description>In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, five U.S. jurisdictions opted to suspend their July 2020 bar exams. Instead, these jurisdictions granted licensure to new attorneys through "diploma privilege.” That's the practice of admitting new attorneys to the state bar, and allowing them to practice law, contingent on their graduation from an ABA-accredited law school only. It does not require taking and passing a bar exam. Wisconsin is currently the only state to permanently offer diploma privilege, and it is only available to graduates of its two in-state law schools, Marquette University Law School and University of Wisconsin Law School.
Critics of the bar exam have long argued that a timed test, based on short-term memorization of how to apply a vast amount legal rules, is not a true measure of legal competency. And now, with a string of remote testing snafus during the pandemic, many in the legal community are asking whether diploma privilege is a better option. Standing in the way of these fundamental changes are many state supreme courts and bar associations who have authority over who can practice law in their jurisdictions. Additionally, those opposed to diploma privilege argue that, whether it's accounting, medicine, or law, licensure exams are there for a good reason—to protect the public from incompetent practitioners.
In this second episode of our podcast series on the bar exam, [Un]Common Law will explore the arguments both for and against diploma privilege.
In this episode we speak with:

Sam Skolnik, Washington-based legal industry reporter for Bloomberg Law.

Efrain Hudnell, a 2020 graduate of the Seattle University School of Law, now an attorney with King County prosecuting attorney's office in Seattle.

Daniel Tokaji, Dean of the University of Wisconsin Law School.

David Wiggins, retired justice of the Iowa Supreme Court.

David Krutz, managing partner in the Milwaukee office of Michael Best and Friedrich.

      <title>1. Is It Time to Kill the Bar Exam? </title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>In all U.S. jurisdictions except Wisconsin, passing a bar exam is a requirement to obtain a license to practice law. However, the Covid-19 pandemic forced some state authorities to adopt alternative paths to licensure for recent law school graduates.
In the wake of those changes, criticism of the bar exam has blossomed into a movement to reform or eliminate the test altogether. These critics argue that the bar exam, “is an outmoded, discriminatory, and simply ineffective as a barometer of legal competence,” according to Bloomberg Law’s Sam Skolnik.
While defenders of the status-quo argue that the bar is still the best way to evaluate would-be attorneys on the fundamental legal concepts that every lawyer should know.
In this first of a three-part series on the bar exam, the [Un]Common Law podcast will look at the arguments for and against preserving the bar exam.
In this episode we speak with:

Alexis Ahlzadeh, recent graduate of Emory Law School, now an associate attorney with the Findling Law Firm based in Atlanta, GA.

Joe Patrice, a senior editor and writer at Above the Law.

Roger Schechter, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.

Johanna Miller, director of the Education Policy Center at the ACLU of New York.

      <title>5. Whistleblower Says Facebook Knowingly Profits From Hate Speech [UnChecked: Bonus Episode]</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/facebook-profits-from-hate-speech-says-whistleblower-podcast</link>
      <description>Frances Haugen, the whistleblower whose revelations have prompted a congressional investigation into Facebook revealed herself publicly in an interview that aired on CBS on Sunday night. Haugen is the source of thousands of internal company documents that were leaked to U.S. lawmakers and the Wall Street Journal.
A data scientist, Haugen was hired by Facebook in June of 2019 to lead the company’s civic integrity team, which was charged with cracking down on hate speech and misinformation. In practice however, she said that the company chose to downplay or ignore its own evidence detailing the rampant spread of misinformation on its platforms, as well as harms to children and teens. Haugen's lawyers have filed at least eight complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission, should the agency choose to bring charges against Facebook for withholding information and misleading investors.
The public outcry over Facebook is not new. The social media giant has been on the receiving end of media exposes and Congressional inquiries for years. Last July, [Un]Common Law released a podcast series, called “Unchecked” looking into the legal and regulatory framework for social media, as well as changes to laws that could be implemented.
In this special episode of [Un]Common Law, Naomi Nix, a Washington, DC based reporter for Bloomberg News talks about the latest revelations.

      <title>4. Regulating Social Media as a Threat to Humanity</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>Concerns over the harmful impact of social media are rising to a fever pitch. In the past decade, everyone from conspiracy theorists to foreign governments have used social media to spread election disinformation, sow discord, and peddle viral conspiracies.
This month, the Biden administration and the U.S. Surgeon General accused social media platforms of being the primary source of misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. Likewise, a July 6 paper warned that the invention of social media could cause human society to fail “catastrophically, unexpectedly, and without warning” if it continues down its current path.
In the fourth and final episode in our UnChecked series, we are looking at some of the public-policy solutions being proposed to rein in the threats posed by Big Tech and social media.
In this episode of [Un]Common Law we speak with:

Courtney Rozen, White House reporter for Bloomberg Law

Francis Fukuyama, author and professor of political science at Stanford University

Alex Engler, AI Data &amp; Democracy Fellow at Brookings Institution

Tom Wheeler, former chairman of the FCC and visiting fellow at Brookings Institution

Martha Minow, professor of law at Harvard University

      <title>3. What Would Breaking Up Big Tech Change?</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>Cracking down on large tech companies may be one of the few remaining areas of political consensus in Washington D.C. However, many legal experts caution that antitrust cases could take years to complete and the outcomes are far from certain.
Still others claim that the recent focus on antitrust is more about punishing tech platforms for being successful. They argue that it would have little impact on more pressing concerns, such as the spread of misinformation, the erosion of privacy, and the acceleration of political polarization.
In this episode of [Un]Common Law we speak with:

Derek Bambauer, professor of law at the University of Arizona, where he teaches internet law and intellectual property.

Sally Hubbard, attorney and director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute.

Chris Koopman, executive director at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University.

David McLaughlin, reporter for Bloomberg News covering antitrust, finance, and mergers and acquisitions.

      <title>2. Social Media Bans Are Not About Free Speech</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>Permanently revoking users’ access to social media platforms— a practice known as “deplatforming “— isn’t a new concept, but the high-profile ban of President Donald Trump has raised new questions about censorship and free speech in the internet age.
For years Twitter famously clung to its identity as “the free speech wing of the free-speech party.” Meanwhile, Facebook employed a policy that mostly excluded politicians from content moderation rules that applied to other users. Yet, within days of the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms suspended the accounts of the president of the United States.
First Amendment lawyers point out that the Constitution protects against government censorship of speech. However, social media platforms are businesses run by companies. They have terms of service and aren't obligated to provide a platform to anyone. Still, whether one views the deplatforming of a U.S. president as necessary or not, many say the more important question is whether tech companies should be the ones deciding where to set the boundaries for online speech.
In this episode of [Un]Common Law we speak with:

Katie Fallow, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.

Steve Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster in London.

Lyrissa Lidsky, Dean of University of Missouri Law School.

Jessica Melugin, director of the Center for Technology &amp; Innovation at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

      <title>1. Would Scrapping Section 230 Break the Internet?</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>In the months since the January 6 attack on the Capitol, one thing people on both sides of the political aisle seem to agree on, is that social media bears at least some responsibility for spreading the lies that led to the attack. But, is that true? And if it is, even a little bit, what should lawmakers do about it? Those questions are what [Un]Common Law will explore in our new series called “UnChecked.” A look at the legal doctrines, case history, and legislation that gave birth to the internet as we know it.
This first episode is all about Section 230, the law that makes it possible for companies like Facebook and Twitter to publish content created by their users. Specifically, Section 230 states that, "no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider." In other words, online platforms can’t be held liable for the speech that is posted on their sites. Almost as importantly, Section 230 also gives those platforms the freedom to moderate, or remove content as they see fit.
Many Republicans say Section 230 enables tech companies to censor conservative voices. While some Democrats say the law has allowed platforms to wash their hands of harms associated with hate speech, terrorism, and harassment. Many lawmakers, from both parties, have expressed a willingness to make changes to the status quo, but what those changes look like has yet to be determined.
In this episode of [Un]Common Law we hear from:

Gigi Sohn, former FCC Counselor, now a fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law and Policy.

Jeff Kosseff, professor of cybersecurity law at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of a book about Section 230 called, “The 26 Words That Created the Internet.”

Rebecca Kern, Technology and Cyber Policy reporter for Bloomberg Government.

Jessica Melugin, director of the Center for Technology &amp; Innovation at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

Elizabeth Banker, former Deputy General Counsel at the Internet Association.

Nabiha Syed, attorney and president of The Markup, an investigative journalism startup that explores how powerful actors use technology to reshape society.

      <title>Introducing: UnChecked</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>For our next season of [Un]Common Law, we’re wading into the thorny debate over Big Tech and social media. Companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter are much bigger than they were 20 years ago, but is this a problem?
Is Big Tech impinging on your right to free speech? That depends on who you ask. And what about the increased influence of hate-speech, conspiracy theories and disinformation that spread like wildfire online.
Despite bipartisan consensus that something needs to be done, what that something actually might look like differs wildly. So, we’re asking experts, and trying to connect the dots to find out what new internet regulation might look like. 
We’re calling this series, UnChecked, and it will be reported out over a series of episodes starting June 14th.

      <title>Eric Holder on Diversifying the Judiciary [Bonus Episode: Black Lawyers Speak]</title>
      <link>https://news.bloombergtax.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>Earlier this year [Un]Common Law published a podcast series looking at the experiences of African American lawyers and judges working in the legal industry—which, to this day, remains one of the least diverse professions in America. Now, more than a year since George Floyd’s murder, and the wave of soul-searching in the legal industry that followed, 16 of the nation’s largest law firms, nine of which are in the Am Law 200, still do not have even a single Black partner according to a report from the American Lawyer.
Back in January we interviewed former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, now a partner with Washington DC-based, Covington &amp; Burling as part of [Un]Common Law's “Black Lawyers Speak Series," and today we are releasing the full Q&amp;A as a bonus episode from that series.

      <title>15. If Qualified Immunity Is Bad Policy, Why Can't We Fix It?</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>In the wake of Derek Chauvin’s conviction in the murder of George Floyd, lawmakers in both parties said they were “cautiously optimistic” that the trial could provide new momentum to overcome the political hurdles that have stymied efforts at policing reform.
In a speech before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, President Joe Biden formally called on lawmakers to resurrect the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which among other things, would end the legal practice of granting qualified immunity to police officers. 
Qualified immunity was considered a relatively obscure legal doctrine known only to civil-rights lawyers and legal scholars, but after the death of George Floyd, it has now become a common topic in the media, cities, and state legislatures across the country.
In this episode of the UnCommon Law Podcast, we speak with Alexander Reinert, a professor of law at the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, Clark Neily, a senior vice president for criminal justice at the Cato Institute, and Anya Bidwell, an attorney with the nonprofit Institute for Justice.

      <title>14. Derek Chauvin Verdict: Legal Community Reactions</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>It took the jury less than 11 hours, to pronounce Derek Chauvin guilty on all three counts of murder in the second and third degree, as well as second-degree manslaughter. While there are many shoes yet to drop before this case is finally complete. Including sentencing, and there will surely be an appeal after that. Also, attention will now shift toward the criminal trial, later this summer, of the three other Minneapolis Police Department officers who were also present during Floyd’s murder.
The [Un]Common Law podcast now turns to the attorneys for their insights on the verdict. In this episode host Adam Allilngton speaks with Barbara McQuade, former U.S. Attorney and now a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, Somil Trivedi, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Criminal Law Reform Project, and Tiffany Jeffers, an associate professor an associate professor of law and legal practice at Georgetown University Law Center.

      <title>12. Could Chauvin Win an Appeal if Convicted?</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>Closing statements in the Derek Chauvin trial are set to begin on Monday. The former Minneapolis police officer is facing charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. Many attorneys agree that Chauvin faces an uphill battle to avoid being found guilty on at least one of the charges. That sets up, what would surely be, an appeal of the verdict.
Has Chauvin’s defense team successfully set up potential issues for an appeal in the event of a guilty verdict? What are the chances that an appeal would be successful? Former federal prosecutor and NBC legal analyst Glenn Kirschner joins [Un]Common Law to discuss.

      <title>11. The Defense Rests Its Case in the Derek Chauvin Trial</title>
      <description>Defense attorney Eric Nelson has a big task to accomplish this week in the murder trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin as he set out to rewrite the narrative of George Floyd's final moments that prosecutors diligently laid out over a two-week period.
All told, the prosecution called nearly 40 witnesses to the stand over the two weeks, including fellow police officers, medical experts and eyewitnesses as young as nine years old. The defense took just two days to call seven witnesses.
Nelson argued that Floyd died of a sudden cardiac arrest caused by a combination of fentanyl, methamphetamine, high blood pressure, an enlarged heart, and adrenaline—and not by his restraint by Chauvin, who was filmed kneeling on Floyd’s neck and back for more than nine minutes.
Bloomberg Law reporter Ian Lopez joins [Un]Common Law host Adam Allington to discuss what Chauvin's defense team was trying to accomplish as the trial heads toward closing arguments and a verdict that could be returned as early as next week.

      <title>10. George Floyd: Minnesota's Spark of Life Testimony Explained</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>The prosecution wrapped up it’s case in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin on Monday, April 12.
Over the course of more than two weeks the jury heard extensive testimony about George Floyd's health problems and struggles with drug addiction. But thanks to an obscure legal doctrine, the jury was also allowed to hear testimony aimed at humanizing George Floyd.
Floyd’s younger brother, Philonise Floyd, took the stand on Monday to share some personal reminisces and reflections, which are permitted under Minnesota’s “Spark of Life Doctrine.”
To hear this kind of testimony during the evidentiary phase of a trial is unusual. That’s because whether George Floyd was a good brother, or liked to play basketball, or made snacks for his siblings, etc…none of that has any bearing on whether Derek Chauvin committed a crime. And, to be clear, it’s not supposed to.
So why is it allowed? Host Adam Allington speaks with Ted Sampsell-Jones, of the Mitchell Hamline School of Law.

      <title>9. Derek Chauvin Trial: What You Need to Know</title>
      <link>https://news.bloombergtax.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's trial has been a two-week whirlwind of emotional witness testimony so far, including police department officials, bystanders, medical experts, and an overwhelming amount of video evidence.Opening statements from the prosecution used a viral video of Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes before his death to convince jurors that the killing was murder, while defense attorney Eric Nelson said the videos did not tell the full story. Witnesses as young as nine years old were called to the stand alongside expert witnesses, including doctors and a pulmonologist.
The chief of the Minneapolis Police Department opened the second week of the trial with his testimony, saying that the tactic used by Chauvin to restrain Floyd, pressing his knee into his neck, did not follow police policy.
“I absolutely agree that violates our policy,” testified Chief Medaria Arradondo at Chauvin’s trial.
Needless to say, a lot has happened in the courtroom, but we are still likely weeks away from a verdict. In this episode of [Un]Common Law, host Adam Allington and Bloomberg Government's Adam Taylor retrace some of the key moments from the first two weeks of Chauvin's trial.

      <title>8. Police Training and Use Of Force in the Derek Chauvin Trial</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>The chief of the Minneapolis Police Department testified this week that the tactic used by Derek Chauvin to restrain George Floyd, pressing his knee into his neck, did not follow police policy.
“I absolutely agree that violates our policy,” testified Chief Medaria Arradondo at Chauvin’s trial.
In the second week of testimony in the Chauvin trial, the state called law enforcement experts to testify about policies, procedures, and how officers are trained.
In this episode of [Un]Common Law, we explore the issue of police training, and whether Chauvin’s use of force can be explained by either his training, or as a reaction to events on the ground.
Laura Scarry, an attorney with DeAno and Scarry, LLC who has represented police officers, joins us to talk about how she relies on police training practices to defend her clients. And Randy Shrewsberry, a former police officer and the executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform, tells us about his organization’s studies on use of force.

      <title>7. Powerful Testimony From Opening Witnesses in Chauvin Murder Trial</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>Opening statements in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, began this week.
During his opening statement Monday, Eric Nelson, the attorney for the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, indicated that a key part of the defense strategy would be to argue that drugs and health problems caused Floyd's death.
Nelson also claimed that a crowd of onlookers who witnessed Floyd's death made the responding officers worry for their safety and diverted their attention from Floyd.
On Tuesday, Darnella Frazier, who was 17 when she recorded the viral video of Floyd’s death, was also called to testify for the prosecution.
In this episode of UnCommon Law Host Adam Allington speaks with Ekow Yankah, a professor of criminal law at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City and Sheila Bedi, a clinical law professor at Northwestern’s Pritzker School of Law and the director of the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic.

      <title>6. How ‘Lived Experience’ Impacted Chauvin Jury Selection</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>The jury in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is noteworthy for its diversity. About 13.5 percent of Hennepin County, Minnesota is African American and, of the 15 jurors (including the three alternates), nine are White, four are Black and two are mixed race, according to the court.
Still, many experts, including Andrew Gordon, a Deputy Director at The Legal Rights Center in Minnesota, have noted that the process of seating the jury in the Chauvin case, as well as many other cases, often leaves African Americans out because it fails to seat jurors with "a diversity of lived experiences."
Gordon is our guest on this episode of [Un]Common Law.

      <title>5. All Eyes On Minnesota As Police Reforms Go Into Effect</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>Jury selection in the Derek Chauvin case wrapped up Tuesday, March 23.
Of the 15 jurors selected thus far, two are white men, three Black men, one Black woman, six are white women and two are multiracial women, according to the court.
George Floyd's death last May at the hands of Minneapolis police officers has made Minnesota ground zero for the debate over police reform, and specifically policies involving use of deadly force.
In the months since Floyd’s death a number of new state laws and policies have gone into effect and law enforcement experts are watching to see if the changes will be successful at rebuilding trust between police and communities of color, while also providing officers the protection they need to engage with dangerous suspects.
In this episode with speak with:
Stephen Joyce, Midwest Correspondent for Bloomberg Law.
Arthur Ago, a former public defender and director of the Criminal Justice Project at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

      <title>4. ‘Defund the Police’ Efforts Pitting Cities Against States</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>In the aftermath of Floyd’s death, citizens across America took to the streets to demand police reform and accountability. Now almost a year later dozens of cities and states have changed policies, or enacted laws that restrict the use of violent force by police.
In addition to municipal and state level changes, in March the House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, which was passed on March 3. What are some of the key aspects of that bill?
But while many Democrats are touting the bill, a broader pushback against the “defund the police” movement is springing up in a number of GOP-lead statehouses that aim discourage or punish cities seeking to cut police budgets, by withholding state funding.
In this episode we speak with: Ayanna Alexander, BLaw social justice reporter. Greg Casar, a member of the Austin City Council, and Robert Blaine, director of the Institute for Youth Education and Families at the National League of Cities.

      <title>3. Why It's Difficult to Prosecute Chauvin Despite Video </title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>Prosecutors seeking to criminally charge police officers face a number of obstacles. There is a high bar when it comes to proving intent, and police officers are generally granted leeway in what many consider to be a difficult job that requires split second decision making. Moreover, law enforcement officers place citizens under restraint tens of thousands of times every day. And even then, in the rare cases when that action results in death, proving that someone died specifically because of the restraint is rarely cut and dry.
In this episode of [Un]Common Law, we talk with Professor Ekow Yankah, a criminal procedure expert at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law about the legal distinctions that make it difficult to criminally prosecute police. We also speak with Brad Colbert, a professor of law at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, about the specific differences between the charges Derek Chauvin is facing under Minnesota state law.

      <title>2. Who is Peter Cahill?: The Judge On The Chauvin Trial</title>
      <link>https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/businessofbees?selected=BL9023477468</link>
      <description>The third-degree murder charge against Derek Chauvin have been reinstated. This is in addition to charges of second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. As of March 11, there was no appeal from defense, and jury selection is moving forward. But what do we know about the man overseeing the murder that launched last summer’s protests following the killing of George Floyd?
Speaking from behind a plexiglass shield and with cameras rolling for the entire world to watch, the spotlight is on Judge Peter Cahill. In the second episode of the new season of [Un]Common Law, we examine Cahill’s career and the events that led up to him being appointed to try one of the most significant court cases in a generation.
We talk to Mike Bryant, a personal injury and criminal defense attorney based in the Twin Cities, and Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minneapolis-based civil rights lawyer. And reporter Lydia Wheeler also walks listeners through her recent profile story on Judge Cahill’s reputation and background.

      <title>1. The Death of George Floyd: Police on Trial</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>The trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with second-degree unintentional felony murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd, begins this week with the task of finding 12 jurors who can set aside their opinions and render a unanimous verdict. But in a high-profile case such as this, with so many strong opinions already formed, criminal law experts are saying that jury selection may be the most critical piece of the case. The question at the heart of the case is whether what millions of people saw on the viral video of Chauvin kneeling on the neck of Floyd as he died was murder or a tragic accident..
In advance of what very well could be the highest profile court case since O.J. Simpson or Rodney King, officials in Minnesota have spent the last eight months preparing for another wave of civil unrest. Barricades and fences have been erected in front of government buildings and thousands of police officers and National Guard members and have been called in as backup. Law enforcement has vowed to preserve people’s rights to assemble and protest, but also keep the peace. The three other officers involved in the case, Tou Thao, Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. Their separate trial is now scheduled for Aug. 23.
We talk to Jack Rice, a Minneapolis-based defense attorney, and Glenn Kirschner, a former federal prosecutor with 30 years of trial experience, about the intricacies of picking a jury in a pandemic. Reporter Jordan Rubin also joins to lay out the basics of the case
Here is a link to the full 16-page jury questionnaire.

      <title>Introducing: The Trial of Derek Chauvin</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>It isn’t hyperbole to say the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer accused killer of George Floyd is likely to be one of the most significant court cases in a generation.
In fact, in the nine months since Floyd’s death at the hands of Chauvin, the name “George Floyd” has become synonymous with a growing movement for police reform as well as a massive racial reckoning that has spread to all corners of American society.
Given the sweeping significance of this case, the [Un]Common Law Podcast will also provide timely interviews, analysis as the trial unfolds.

      <title>Black Lawyers Speak, Ep. 5 </title>
      <description>In "Black Lawyers Speak: Stories of the Past, Hopes for the Future," we have looked at how the current focus on diversity and inclusion in Big Law is playing out. We have heard from key players at law firms, law schools and corporations about how issues or diversity and inclusion are being treated in the wake of last summer's police shootings and protests.
In episode five, we turn our attention to the issue of diversity in the federal judiciary. We speak with former judges and legal scholars as well as advocacy groups about what role diversity should play in court appointments, and how it impacts the perception of the courts' legitimacy by the communities they serve.
In episode five, Bloomberg Law interviews:

Eric H. Holder Jr., former United States Attorney General and partner at Covington &amp; Burling LLP.

Janai Nelson, Associate Director-Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF).

Jonathan Adler, Johan Verheij Memorial Professor of Law at Case Western Reserve School of Law.

Trina Jones, Jerome M. Culp Professor of Law at Duke University School of Law.

Catherine Smith, professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law.

Stephen Robinson, of counsel at Skadden Arps and former federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Lena Zwarensteyn, Fair Courts Campaign Director for the Leadership Council on Civil and Human Rights.

      <title>Black Lawyers Speak, Ep. 4</title>
      <description>In "Black Lawyers Speak: Stories of the Past, Hopes for the Future," we have looked at how the current focus on diversity and inclusion in Big Law is playing out. We have heard from key players at law firms and in corporations about how they are doing the hard work of culture change, and how, through their work, they are underscoring the argument that diversity is good business.
In episode four, we turn our attention to the unique experiences of African American women law partners, a segment that comprises less than 1% of all partners in the legal profession. We speak with veteran lawyers who have ascended to the highest ranks of leadership at major firms, those who serve as general counsel at large companies and younger partners who are putting their stamp on a more inclusive future right now. In episode four of Black Lawyers Speak, Bloomberg Law interviews:

Shauna Clark, global and U.S. chair of Norton Rose Fulbright and U.S. head of employment and labor practice.

Grace Speights, global head of labor &amp; employment practice at Morgan Lewis.

April Boise Miller, co-founder of the Black GC 2025 Initiative and executive vice president and general counsel at Eaton.

Christa Brown-Sanford, partner and deputy chair of intellectual property at Baker Botts

Raqiyyah Pippins, life sciences and healthcare regulatory partner at Arnold &amp; Porter

Tsedale Melaku, Ph.D., sociologist and postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Research on the African Diaspora in the Americas &amp; the Caribbean at The Graduate Center, City University of New York

Maja Hazell, global head of diversity &amp; inclusion at White &amp; Case

      <title>Black Lawyers Speak, Ep. 3</title>
      <description>In the wake of last summer’s protests, more law firms in the AmLaw 200 are being more vocal about plans to increase their diversity. For decades, Big Law has been one of the least diverse industries in America, especially when it comes to Black lawyers. In episode three of Black Lawyers Speak, we focus on the legal education pipeline and whether law schools and law students can push law firms to be accountable for their rhetoric.
Legal experts point out that one reason for the lack of diversity is the fact that elite firms tend to recruit and hire most from top-ranked law schools. And, not only are these schools expensive and difficult to get into, but they just don’t graduate enough students of color to diversify an entire corporate sector. Some law school dean argue that to be successful, the legal industry will need to start doing things differently. That could include hiring a larger percentage of students from schools ranked outside of U.S. News &amp; World Report's top 14 and re-evaluating the significance of law school rankings.
In episode three of Black Lawyers Speak, Bloomberg Law interviews:

L. Song Richardson, dean and professor of law, University of California, Irvine School of Law

Mariah Levy, law student, Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law

Rashad Abdallah, law student, University of Michigan Law School

Rachel Barnes, law student, University of Virginia School of Law; chair of the National Black Law Students Association

Danielle Holley-Walker, dean and professor of law, Howard University School of Law

Tsedale Melaku, sociologist, Critical Race and Gender Scholar

Elie Mystal , justice correspondent at The Nation

Wendell Taylor, Washington office managing partner of Hunton Andrews Kurth

Merle Vaughn, managing director and national law firm diversity practice leader at Major, Lindsey &amp; Africa

      <title>Black Lawyers Speak, Ep. 2</title>
      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/podcasts/uncommon-law</link>
      <description>Despite the increased emphasis on diversity and inclusion in law firms, the legal profession remains among the least diverse of any profession today. According to the American Bar Association’s National Lawyer Population Survey, in 2007 just 4% of active attorneys identified as Black or African American. Since that time, the number has remained largely flat at around 5%, despite decades of diversity efforts and studies that diversity is good for business.
Law firms say that they recognize that the ongoing lack of diversity is a problem, and they say they are committed to fixing it. But what steps are they taking and why haven’t the programs they’ve put in place been more effective? Also, what role are general counsel playing as companies seek to leverage the carrot of their business to promote change.
In episode two of Black Lawyers Speak, Bloomberg Law interviews:

Tony West, chief legal officer at Uber

Elie Mystal, justice correspondent at The Nation

David Wilkins, vice dean for Global Initiatives on the Legal Profession at Harvard Law School

Chaka Patterson, senior vice president and general counsel

Adtalem Global Education

Kim Rivera, president, strategy and business management and chief legal officer at HP Inc.

Raqiyyah Pippins, partner at Arnold &amp; Porter

Stephen Robinson, partner, litigation; co-chair of the global Diversity Committee at Skadden

Kinika Young, senior director of health policy and advocacy at Tennessee Justice Center

Warren Allen, founding member of WTAII PLLC

      <link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/black-lawyers-speak-stories-of-the-past-hopes-for-the-future-ep-1-podcast</link>
      <description>For months now, law firms and companies across the nation have joined the national dialogue on race and equality—sprouting up amid outcry over the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others — to take a fresh look at how their corporate cultures can better incorporate diversity and inclusion. But every effort to change culture comes with a cost: disruption of the status quo. Is the legal profession willing to pay it? This podcast takes aim at this question and others. Why has Big Law struggled for decades to hire and promote more Black attorneys, despite years of discussion and efforts? What can we learn from the sacrifices and triumphs of pathbreaking law firm leaders and law professors? And will the hopes African American lawyers have held for greater equity in corporate spaces finally be realized this time?
In this podcast series, we’ll be peeling the curtain back on the experiences of African American lawyers at elite law firms and companies and their work for equality in the profession. You'll hear insight on the challenges of culture change, and why, despite it all, they have great hope for the future.

      <title>Introducing: Black Lawyers Speak</title>

      <description>Despite decades of work to educate more Black lawyers, the percentage of Black associates and partners in firms across the U.S. remain very low, and well below those of other professional careers. Big Law firms across the board are ramping up social justice efforts as the nation engages in a renewed dialogue on race and equality. But some have accused firms of using minorities as “diversity props” to impress clients and misrepresent their inclusiveness to potential employees. So what are law firms doing to fix their lack of diversity?

Hosts Adam Allington and Lisa Helem, along with reporters Ayanna Alexander, Ruiqi Chen, and Meghan Tribe, interviewed lawyers across the industry, from corporate general counsels to top Am Law 200 lawyers to current law students, each sharing their experience navigating the legal space as a person of color. We try to answer what law firms are doing to recruit more diverse classes of lawyers, and how they are addressing barriers to entry for Black lawyers.

      <title>Business, Interrupted</title>
      <description>Businesses all across the country have been shutdown for days, weeks, or even months at a time due to the coronavirus pandemic. Many assumed their insurance policies would help them defray some of their lost revenue. But those assumptions were, by and large, wrong.
In this special audio documentary, “Business, Interrupted” we look at why insurers denied the claims of their shuttered policyholders. A team of reporters from Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax look into the so-called “virus exclusion” clauses, that insurers quietly inserted into many of their business policies, and how those clauses are now creating strife between insurers and businesses.
We hear from several small business owners across the country about the shock they felt when their pandemic claims were denied, in some cases within hours after filing. We also hear from regulators and lawmakers about whether they will force insurers to retroactively honor these claims, a possibility that insurers view as an existential threat to their entire industry.
--With assistance from Lydia Beyoud, Evan Weinberger and, David Hood

      <title>6. Of Pollinators and Pesticides</title>
      <description>Bees are up against a lot these days: a shrinking habitat, invasive mites, Colony Collapse Disorder, and even the pesticides on the crops they help pollinate. Hosts Adam Allington, Tiffany Stecker and David Schultz dig into recent studies that show nectar and pollen contaminated with insecticides may be harming bees much more than previously thought.

      <title>5. Invasion of the Beehive Bodysnatchers</title>
      <description>The drastic decline in honeybee populations is no secret. For years, pesticides were thought to be the leading cause of increased die-offs. But new studies suggest that the parasite Varroa destructor, which sounds like it belongs in a sci-fi film, might be affecting bee health more than we thought.

But what about the other thousands of bee species pollinating crops and flowers? Hosts Adam Allington and David Schultz explore how the honeybee came to be the classic bee.

      <title>3. How Bees and Farmers Got Together</title>
      <description>Commercial honey bees take laps around the U.S. to pollinate fruits, veggies and nuts – and their services aren’t cheap. But they are essential. Hosts Adam Allington and Tiffany Stecker talk with farmers in California about the rising costs of hives and how those traveling bees could be pushing native pollinators out of their habitats.

      <title>2. Apis Mellifera</title>
      <description>Hosts Adam Allington and David Schultz take us back to the earliest days of beekeeping in Egypt and tell us how humans and honeybees formed a partnership that has spanned thousands of years and several continents. In addition to the obvious benefits of producing honey, Apis Mellifera, also known as the European honeybee, has also inspired the imagination of thinkers and philosophers from the “land of milk and honey,” up to a 19th century minister who invented the modern beehive.

      <title>Introducing: Business of Bees</title>
      <description>These days about one in three bites of food you eat wouldn’t be possible without commercial bee pollination. And the economic value of insect pollination worldwide is estimated to be about $217 billion. But as important as bees have become for farming, there’s also increasing signs that bees are in trouble. In the decade-plus since the first cases of Colony Collapse Disorder were reported, bees are still dying in record numbers, and important questions remain unanswered. 
Over the course of one year, host Adam Allington and environment reporters David Schultz and Tiffany Stecker traveled to all corners of the honeybee ecosystem from Washington, D.C., to the California almond fields, and orchards of the upper Midwest to bring back answers to these questions.
