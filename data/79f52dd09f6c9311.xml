Think about it. Geolocation data is necessary for delivery companies to bring goods to your doorstep, for ride-hailing apps to get you to your destination, and for automotive brands to make the most out of their driver assistance systems (ADAS) technology. The list of examples goes on and on. The requirement for location-based mapping services has increased to such an extent that the global digital map market is expected to rise by $33.18 billion in the&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/tomtom-attempting-wrestle-control-of-digital-map-back-from-silicon-valley?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web]]></description>

From March 1st, 2023, the EU is set to ban all 8K TVs and some 4K models from the European market. That’s gotta suck if you have made booking the boardroom out to play Minecraft under the pretence of a meeting a fine art. What’s behind the ban? EU legislation on energy labelling aims to eliminate the least efficient products from the market. Since September 1st, 2021, every television and screen label has included the electricity consumption in kWh for 1,000 hours&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/the-eus-8k-tv-ban-will-be-a-nightmare-for-startups?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web]]></description>

The design was brought to life after it won the University of Surrey’s public competition, the Natural Robotics Contest. The contest, which ran in the summer of 2022, invited the public to submit an idea for a bio-inspired robot that could help the world. An international panel of judges chose the robot fish concept designed by student Eleanor Mackintosh because it could help reduce the amount of plastic pollution in water. The winning design was subsequently turned into a functioning prototype.

According to Bloomberg News, Twitter’s new owner is set to cut around 3,700 jobs – about half the company’s workforce. Those who remain are also bracing for upheaval. Musk reportedly intends to scrap the platform’s work-from-anywhere policy and mandate returns to offices from Monday. The U-turn has reignited calls for legal rights to work-from-home on both sides of the Atlantic. Changing times Musk’s mooted move would scrap a groundbreaking policy. In 2020, Twitter became one of the first tech firms to allow staff to work from home indefinitely. The policy quickly proved&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/musk-ending-wfh-twitter-reignites-debate-on-legal-right-wfh?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href="https://thenextweb.com/company/twitter-3">Twitter</a>

European astrophysicist Sunny Vagnozzi, of the University of Trento and Cambridge University, alongside Israeli-American researcher Avi Loeb, of Harvard University, today published a (potentially) landmark research paper indicating that everything we think we know about the universe’s origins could be completely wrong. According to their work, the Big Bang was more of a Big Bounce. Their paper details a scenario wherein our universe, as we observe it, is merely the result of a previous cosmological phase&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/european-astrophysicist-pokes-a-giant-hole-in-the-big-bang-inflationary-theory?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web]]></description>

We recently saw the launch (finally!) of Matter, an industry-unifying open standard for smart homes. If you’re building IoT devices, this (excuse the pun) matters. Let’s dive into what it’s all about — and especially what it means for European businesses. What is Matter?

Horizon Worlds, his initial foray in the space, has only added to concerns. The social platform is regularly derided for slow uptake, persistent bugs, and risible avatars. Despite the mounting criticisms, Zuckerberg remains bullish about making Facebook a “metaverse company.” But for Herman Narula, the CEO of UK unicorn Improbable, Meta’s vision overlooks a fundamental issue. “The problem is VR,” Narula said last week at Stanford University. “The&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/metaverse-doesnt-need-vr-improbable-ceo-herman-narula-meta-zuckerberg?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web]]></description>

All through the pandemic, it has been this cohort that has self-assuredly shown the rest of the working populace how they’d really like things to be done. Studies show that this is the generation that is most values-driven, wants to know that the company they work for is strongly supporting diversity goals, and has an innate need for work-life balance. Gen Z is also the TikTok generation.

Every day is a challenge that’s more pressing than the last. So I ask you this… why should your computer have it so easy?
