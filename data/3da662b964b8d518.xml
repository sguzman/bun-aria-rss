    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, podcast maven Jordan Harbinger joins me for a collaborative deep dive on the topic of podcasting.

Why is SMARTLESS worth $20 million a year to Amazon? <br/><br/>We then tackle the future of the industry. Will independent audio-only podcasting as we know it today still be around in 5 years, or is this just a step toward a radical new configuration of the media landscape? (I have a theory on this which I run by Jordan for his opinion.)<br/><br/>We get into it all...<br/><br/>For more on Jordan and his massively successful show: https://www.jordanharbinger.com/<br/><br/>Thanks to Jay Kerstens for the intro music and Mark Miles for mastering.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Ep. 75: JOSHUA FIELDS MILBURN on Saying &quot;No&quot; to Almost Everything</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>In today&apos;s episode, I talk with Joshua Fields Milburn, who along with Ryan Nicodemus make up the powerhouse duo known simply as the Minimalists. You probably know Joshua from the wildly successful Netflix documentaries, MINIMALISM and LESS IS NOW, or the popular podcast he co-hosts with Ryan. <br/><br/>The story of how the Minimalists got started is well-told, so I thought I would focus on a natural follow question: what happened next? Starting with when I first met him in 2012, I ask Joshua to walk us through the building of the Minimalist brand -- how they went from an amateur blog to being recognized on the street a dozen times a day. In doing so, we learn a lot about the inspiring, value-driven approach that Joshua and Ryan have taken in their careers, in which living right is more important than making the most money or accusing the most likes. <br/><br/><br/>Thanks to Jay Kerstens for the intro music.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Ep. 42: GREG MCKEOWN and I Discuss Unplugging, Doing Less, and Finding Focus </title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this special episode of DEEP QUESTIONS, I rebroadcast a conversation recorded earlier this summer, featuring me and the bestselling author Greg McKeown. It originally aired on Greg&apos;s fantastic podcast, WHAT&apos;S ESSENTIAL (https://gregmckeown.com/podcast/).<br/><br/>You probably know Greg from his influential 2014 book, ESSENTIALISM, which I recommend all the time. In this conversation, we talk about unplugging from distraction, the art of doing less (without accomplishing less), and how to improve your ability to focus.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it. <br/><br/>Thanks to our sponsors Magic Spoon (use magicspoon.com/CAL to receive free shipping) and Blinkist (use blinkist.com/DEEP for a 7 day free trial).<br/><br/>Also thanks to listener Jay Kerstens for the intro music.</p>]]></description>
