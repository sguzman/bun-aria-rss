For years, fried fish businesses like Horace and Dickie’s and Fish in the Neighborhood have been pillars in their community.

        <![CDATA[<p>Stuffed ham: IYKYK</p>

<p>This hyper-local delicacy from southern Maryland has been a part of life in St. Mary’s County for generations. But, unless you grew up there or have a family connection, you probably have no idea what it is. Patrick and Ruth explore what goes into a stuffed ham, its generations-old history, and how people are eating it now.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>D.C.’s Chinatown has all the hits. A giant archway. Dragons painted on the streets. Chinese characters in its storefronts. But…where are all the Chinese people?</p>

<p>For all of its traditional iconography, D.C.’s Chinatown doesn’t feel very Chinese. For years, the remaining Chinese restaurants and shops have felt more like Easter eggs in the neighborhood rather than the main attraction. How did it get like this? Ruth explores the history of D.C.’s Chinese American community.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Asian carryouts are longtime fixtures of D.C.’s Black neighborhoods. Where else can you get a quintessential order of chicken wings and mambo sauce? Despite how loved they are by District natives and transplants, they’ve also gotten a lot of bad press. For years, Black customers have experienced racism at the hands of Asian workers. Meanwhile, Asian workers have received xenophobic attacks. Hosts Ruth and Patrick puzzle through their mixed feelings about a D.C. institution.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>We’re back! After covering the pandemic’s effect on food delivery and our local restaurant scene, Dish City is dining out again.</p>

<p>Behind every iconic food of the Washington region is a story of city change. On the latest season of Dish City, join hosts Ruth Tam and Patrick Fort as they sample iconic meals from D.C., Maryland and Virginia and search for answers to questions like: Why are there so many Chinese carryouts in D.C.’s Black neighborhoods? What’s the seasoning that’s <em>actually</em> on your blue crabs? And…<em>what</em> is stuffed ham?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>There are problems with food delivery. There's the reliance on gig laborers who say they are underpaid. Restaurants have to pay high commission fees on top of most orders. And delivery companies wind up operating on threadbare margins and still haven't turned an annual profit. Oh, and soggy fries. We haven't quite solved for that yet.</p>

<p>There's plenty to vent about. But, food delivery's not going anywhere. So, on our season finale: Can food delivery be better?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>On a cold November night in 1976, a New York City restaurateur named Misa Chang started sliding delivery menus under her neighbors’ doors for her Chinese restaurant in Manhattan. Chang wasn’t the first to offer delivery, but when delivery gained traction in U.S. cities, Chinese restaurants were often the first to do it. As dishes like chop suey and General Tso's chicken became part of American food culture, Americans’ feelings toward the Chinese Americans who made the food (and delivered it) remained stuck in the past. And now, as demand for delivery increases, many American Chinese restaurants are closing. Is delivery the key to survival?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>As Game of Thrones nerds can tell you, "winter is coming" is more than a seasonal weather forecast –it's a warning. With that in mind, what are local restaurants with outdoor dining doing to prepare for the harshest season? And, given the limits in federal and local coronavirus financial relief, what do they actually have control over? Ruth and Patrick follow a restaurant and brewery owner's preparations –and their state of mind– as we count the days towards the cold.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Now that fall is here, Patrick is enjoying his cozy flannel shirts and crisp pumpkin beers. But for Ruth, entering this season is bittersweet. Cultural holidays like the Mid-Autumn Festival are normally comforting this time of year. But for Asians who observe this harvest celebration, there's no easy way to safely gather and eat traditional mooncakes during a pandemic. To get some perspective on family food traditions and what they offer us this season, Ruth turns to D.C. resident Suzanne Nuyen, the creator of Vietnamese food blog, Bun Bo Bae.</p>

For Patrick, the decision to dine out is a lot more complicated than it was pre-pandemic. In his attempt to find a safe way to dine, he learns how others are making that decision and gets advice from local restaurateurs, government regulators and his co-host Ruth.</p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, D.C. has been gripped in protest for five days straight. As demonstrations intensify, local food businesses downtown have been broken into and burned.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Washingtonians have protested the loss of black life, and it's not the first time restaurants have witnessed it. Ruth and Patrick revisit a conversation with Virginia Ali, who cofounded Ben's Chili Bowl and witnessed the 1968 protests that destroyed her neighborhood. Virginia Ali shares the origin story of Ben’s, why her business stayed open through the protests and how they survived the years that followed.</p>

        <![CDATA[Following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, D.C. has been gripped in protest for five days straight. As demonstrations intensify, local food businesses downtown have been broken into and burned.
This isn't the first time Washingtonians have protested the loss of black life, and it's not the first time restaurants have witnessed it. Ruth and Patrick revisit a conversation with Virginia Ali, who cofounded Ben's Chili Bowl and witnessed the 1968 protests that destroyed her neighborhood. Virginia Ali shares the origin story of Ben’s, why her business stayed open through the protests and how they survived the years that followed.
Music and archival audio in this episode included <a href="https://archive.org/details/GirlGroups-top100-1954-67/042MarthaReevesVandellas-DancingInTheStreet.mp3">"Dancing In The Street" by Martha Reeves &amp; Vandellas</a> and an excerpt from the documentary "King Is Dead."

        <![CDATA[<p>No surprises to anyone listening: Dish City has had to pivot. But, it's nothing compared to what local restaurant owners and workers are dealing with. On week 11 of working from home, Patrick and Ruth turn to the owners of Compass Coffee and Hank's Oyster Bar to see how they made decisions during some of the most intense weeks of their lives. Then, they talk to two Washingtonians –a bartender and a Muslim community leader– about how they've each changed their approach to food service during the pandemic.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>From high-powered creatives and business executives in New York, to lawyers and politicians in D.C., the power lunch has long been a staple for the wealthy and powerful. And the classic steakhouse has always been the quintessential setting for these meals.</p>

<p>But as more and more young people move to D.C., do power lunches still hold the cachet they once did? And, despite being known as a "steakhouse town" for decades, are D.C.'s steaks still the ultimate "power lunch"?</p>

<p>Ruth and Patrick explore the local lunch scene to see if what you eat in the middle of the day indicates how powerful you might be in D.C.</p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Jumbo slice is divisive. A single, floppy slice is longer than most diners' forearms. While it's a favorite among late night partiers, especially in Adams Morgan, it's often derided as "drunk food" and has historically been blamed for all the fights and litter on 18th street on weekends. Ruth and Patrick call on pizza experts near and far to understand why jumbo slice has stood the test of time -- and why it's so beloved. Follow us on Twitter and Instagram: @dishcity.

        <![CDATA[Jumbo slice is divisive. A single, floppy slice is longer than most diners' forearms. While it's a favorite among late night partiers, especially in Adams Morgan, it's often derided as "drunk food" and has historically been blamed for all the fights and litter on 18th street on weekends.

Ruth and Patrick call on pizza experts near and far to understand why jumbo slice has stood the test of time -- and why it's so beloved.

        <![CDATA[<p>Ethiopian cuisine is a D.C. mainstay, so when Ruth and Patrick taste "fast-casual Ethiopian" at Union Market, they have questions. What does it mean when a chef tries to put a new spin on dishes that are thousands of years old? We visit a family restaurant that's sticking to tradition, talk to a chef who tried to make the "Rasika of Ethiopian food," and collect some scorching hot takes from perhaps the best-known Ethiopian chef out there, Marcus Samuelsson.

        <![CDATA[<p>The half-smoke is the first food that comes to mind when we think about D.C.'s "iconic" foods. But when Ruth and Patrick take a trip to Ben's Chili Bowl, which made the half-smoke famous, Ruth orders a hot dog by mistake and realizes she doesn't really know what a half-smoke is. We take a trip to a sausage factory, hop back in time to 1958 when Ben's Chili Bowl opened and foray into the struggle playing out between old and new D.C.</p>
