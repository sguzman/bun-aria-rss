			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Nuclearrevenge In today's episode, OP has to deal with an incredibly toxic landlord and his corrupt wife. OP gets tired of dealing with his landlord's harassment, so he decides to investigate some of his landlord's strange behavior. Why doesn't the landlord just file an eviction notice?

OP gets tired of dealing with his landlord&apos;s harassment, so he decides to investigate some of his landlord&apos;s strange behavior. Why doesn&apos;t the landlord just file an eviction notice?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP is a hearing-impaired student in a music class with a stuck-up teacher. The battery in OP's hearing aid dies, so he raises his hand to ask his teacher for permission to go get more batteries. The teacher shuts him down, which means OP can't hear a single thing going on for the entire class. Eventually, the teacher hits him with "ARE YOU LISTENING?" and OP can honestly respond, "Nope!"</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Prorevenge In today's episode, OP recounts a story from his youth when his family was down on their luck and had to rent a place in a trailer park. The home they rented was repulsive. They had leaks, a cockroach infestation, mold, and the entire place was completely falling apart. Their landlord didn't care at all -- the only thing he card about was that they paid rent. So when one of their pipes starts to leak, OP's family doesn't bother reporting it! This leads to thousands of dollars of wasted water and hugely expensive repair costs that add up to $25,000!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Niceguys vs r/Nicegirls It's time for another epic showdown between the sexes! In this video, you get to decide which group is crazier: nigeguys or nicegirls. We've got cringey niceguys who think that women owe them love and affection, and we've got women who brazenly manipulate guys out of their money before ghosting them. If you ask me, each group is incredibly toxic in their own unique way.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;r/Niceguys vs r/Nicegirls It&apos;s time for another epic showdown between the sexes! In this video, you get to decide which group is crazier: nigeguys or nicegirls. We&apos;ve got cringey niceguys who think that women owe them love and affection, and we&apos;ve got women who brazenly manipulate guys out of their money before ghosting them. If you ask me, each group is incredibly toxic in their own unique way.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Choosingbeggars This story is pretty nuts. A 41-year-old lawyer decides that he's tired of working, so he actually sues his rich parents for money. Basically, he wants them to pay him a weekly allowance so that he doesn't have to go into work anymore. I should also mention that the dude already lives in a $1,000,000 house that his parents bought for him. Not only did he lose the case, but now he's pretty much guaranteed to be written out of inheritance. How stupid can you be?</p>

OP quit on the spot, which caused her manager to have a breakdown because the store is already understaffed. Here's an idea: if you're having trouble finding employees, maybe you could try paying your employees more 🤷</p>

The 17-year-old is upset because this means that she will miss out on a school dance. OP basically says, "Sorry sweetie, but mommy's party time is more important than your party time." Is OP the butthole?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP resists joining his neighborhood HOA. The HOA eventually tricks OP into joining under false pretenses, and then starts billing OP for a huge amount of money. However, the HOA screwed up OP's contract, which left him with all of the power. He went to his lawyer and discovered that he absolutely had the HOA by the balls. They had to do whatever he said, and there was nothing they could do to stop him. He embarrassed the HOA so badly the the HOA president moved out of the country LOL!</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;r/Maliciouscompliance OP gets stuck with an incredibly lazy, toxic professor who refuses to actually teach the subject matter to his students. To make matters worse, he&apos;s one of those professors who intentionally fails a certain number of students every semester. OP gets tired of dealing with his professor&apos;s attitude, so he orchestrates a secret meeting with his fellow students where they ALL agree to file official complaints against the professor. This causes the dean to personally get involved!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[r/Idontworkherelady "Black People Should Serve White People!"]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Idontworkherelady In today's episode, OP is a black man attending a work event at a restaurant with his colleagues. He is very clearly a member of the party and not a restaurant worker, but that doesn't stop a Karen from handing him her keys and demanding that he go get her car. OP tries to politely explain that he's not part of the valet service, which prompts the Karen to call OP the worst thing you can call a black woman. I really wish OP had thrown her keys in the gutter!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/AmITheA**hole OP's brother is a 16 year-old young man who asks his parents to help him buy a car. It's a reasonable request -- after all, OP is 20-year-old woman and their parents helped buy her a car. They finally agree and OP's brother pools his money with his parents so they can go buy him a nice car. But instead of buying the brother a car, they buy themselves a new car -- using the brother's money! The brother is absolutely devastated and calls the parents out for their incredibly selfish behavior. Who do you think the butthole is here?</p>

He comes across a young man about 16 years old who is very interested in one of his antique pieces. OP says that the boy will need his parent's permission before he can hold it because, well, he's a responsible human being. The boy's father shows up SCREAMING at OP to hand over the gun, and then goes on a long rant about how he's a free American and he has a right to other people's property. Yeah, he's that kind of crazy.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[r/Pettyrevenge Park Like a Jerk? I'll Block You In!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Pettyrevenge Here's a general word of advice to you. If you drive your car to car repair shop, don't steal a parking space from an exhausted auto mechanic. Is it really a good idea to piss off a car expert, and then leave your car in the hands of a person who knows exactly how to mess up a car? Well, an entitled idiot tries exactly that when he steals OP's parking spot. OP gets revenge in a rather petty but satisfying way!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/AmITheA**hole OP's friend is getting married, and OP agrees to let her friend use his house as her wedding venue. However, OP's fiancé doesn't like OP and refuses to allow OP to attend the wedding... but they still want to use OP's house. OP is like, "Wait, you're not inviting me to the wedding, but you still want to use MY house for your wedding. Nuh-uh. Not gonna happen." The wedding couple freaks out on OP and calls him a bitter a-hole for refusing to give them his house. Does that make him the butthole in this situation?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Maliciouscompliance Unfortunately, OP has a horrible father who thinks that it's a good idea to beat his kids as a way to discipline them. When OP's father finally tells OP to leave the house and not come back, OP happily complies and begins living independently. He later finds out from a friend that his dad is leaving on vacation for a few days, so OP sneaks back into his old place and steals all of his dad's stuff. To be fair, it was stuff that the dad bought with OP's money, so realistically OP had every right to take it back.</p>

The thieves electrocute themselves on the live wires!</p>

OP's friend sends over this long, unusual contract that spells out all the things he has to do in order to qualify for being a godfather. For example, he has to work as a free, unpaid babysitter for the child for 18 years. He also has to give the baby $25,000 for education, and even more money over the following 18 years. Why would you give someone money to become an unpaid babysitter-slave for life?</p>

One night, he manages to show up to a murder scene really early, even before the police arrive. When the cops show up they just assume that he's part of evidence collection, so the cops actually open the door and invite him to walk into the murder scene to start filming. A little while later, the actual evidence collection guys show up, and all the cops turn to stare at OP. Uh-oh.</p>

That&apos;s exactly what happened to OP in today&apos;s story! OP is the only person who manages a massive warehouse of tires. So when his idiot manager fires him, they suddenly don&apos;t have a clue where anything is and their business struggles without him. A few months later, they beg OP to come back!&lt;/p&gt;

OP works as an insurance adjuster, and he's working on a claim where a young driver clearly broke the law and was responsible for a 3-car crash. Despite the kid obviously being at fault, his parents call up OP and scream at him because they expect him to pay for the damage to his car. OP tries to explain that their kid is clearly the one at fault, but they just won't listen. They even ask him how they're supposed to commit insurance fraud when he's being so uncooperative!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[r/Tifu By Kidnapping A Penguin 🐧]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Tifu Who knew that it's possible to just steal a penguin? Well, it turns out that it's easier than you might think. So easy, in fact, that a kid manages to get his hands on a baby penguin in a field trip, stuff the poor little guy into his backpack, and then sneak back onto the school bus. The other students told on the kid to a teacher, and the teacher didn't believe them! It wasn't until they actually showed the teacher that the kid stole a real life penguin that the teacher had to turn the school bus around so they could return the confused animal!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Entitledparents Have you ever heard that you shouldn't eat anything before surgery? That's because the anesthesia can cause you to throw up while you're unconscious, and you could choke to death on your own vomit. Yet for some reason, this entitled parent thinks that she knows more than an actual doctor and tries to trick the hospital by sneaking her kid some food before surgery. When the hospital finds out, they can cancel the surgery and of course the entitled mother flips out. Lady, they're trying to save your kid's life!</p>

After much arguing, OP just decides to bring out normal bread with garlic butter on the side, and the woman happily gobbles up all of it. What?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/AmITheA**hole OP is stuck in a real pickle... kind of like how girls get stuck in the washing machine, if you know what I mean. OP's mother secretly marries her fiancé's father, which means that her fiancé has suddenly become her step-brother! OP's mother is now telling OP that she can't marry her fiancé because they're step-siblings, and that would be wrong. OP wants to go along with it anyway, because their parents violated their trust by getting married in secret and sabotaging their wedding. Is OP the butthole for wanting to marry her step-bro, or are their parents the buttholes?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, we have one of the craziest stories I've ever read. An out of touch multi-millionaire boss has one of his employees invest some of his cash into the stock market. When OP grows the investment, his boss demands that OP also hand over his portion of the profits. OP begrudgingly agrees, but he doesn't tell his boss that there's still some leftover cash in the stock market. The boss either forgets about that cash or never realized it was there in the first place, leaving OP to walk away with a cool $2,000,000.</p>

Well, in today&apos;s episode, we&apos;ve got people who DO speak the language, and who overhear gossip in other languages that was definitely not meant for their ears.

The problem is that OP&apos;s sister keeps pretending that she&apos;s the one who&apos;s pregnant. When OP and her sister go shopping, a considerate worker offers OP a chair because, well, she is actually pregnant. OP&apos;s sister flips out and says that she&apos;s the one who deserves the chair because it&apos;s her child. OP yells at her sister that even though it&apos;s her sister&apos;s child, OP is the one who is actually pregnant and she&apos;s exhausted from constantly running around.

You wouldn&apos;t want to get TOO relaxed, would you? That&apos;s what happened to OP. He took one too many sleeping pills and ended up dropping a hot one on his new girlfriend&apos;s bed. Oopsie Poopsie!&lt;/p&gt;

A local farmer had a deal with the previous owner to mow the lawyer's lawn in exchange for being able to use the hay for his farm animals.

OP reports the business to the cops and watches as Karen&apos;s business crumbles.&lt;/p&gt;

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;r/AmITheA**hole In today&apos;s episode, OP has a confrontation with her bizarre parents. For some reason, her parents are absolutely obsessed with her love life and are terrified that she will become &quot;easy&quot; in college. They call her terribly sexist names, and they even make bets with other members of the family about when she will lose her virginity. OP is pretty sure that her parents are wrong here, but her whole family is against her in this. Is OP the butthole?&lt;/p&gt;

OP wasn't about to accept this without a fight, so she hid dead fish in the car's upholstery. Enjoy your stinky ride!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, an unbearable entitled mother yells at a babysitter because the babysitter had the audacity to discipline her child. She screamed, "Do NOT parent my kids! You're not their mother!" LOL, sure thing lady. I guess that means the babysitter should just let the kids do whatever they want, right? So don't come crying to the babysitter when the kids absolutely destroy the house with paint and markers!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Choosingbeggars In today's episode, OP attends a wedding and leaves her prescription drugs in her purse in a private room. That was apparently a stupid a mistake, because one of the wedding guests breaks into her room, steals her prescription drugs, and then approaches OP to ask if she has any other drugs that he can steal. Normally I'd think someone like this is a moron, but in this case he's probably just high as a kite. If you like this content, follow for more daily Reddit content!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Maliciouscompliance What happens when a sexist judge tells a lady lawyer that she can't wear pants in a courtroom? Malicious compliance, of course! The judge simply takes off her pants and treats her long coat as a makeshift dress. Be careful when you make demands of lawyers, because their whole job is malicious compliance!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Entitledparents How dumb can you possibly be? This Karen gets angry at a neighborhood kid, so she takes pictures of the kid that are EXTREMELY illegal. These types of pictures are so illegal, in fact, that I can't even say the name of the type of pictures they are in this description without getting in trouble with YouTube. Then, she brings the pictures to the authoritties to try to get the kids in trouble. Instead, the cops come and arrest HER for possession of forbidden photos!</p>

OP's mom immediately starts criticizing her about what she wears around the house, and just starts hounding her every single day about completely meaningless things.

			<title><![CDATA[r/Relationships My Girlfriend Tried to Murder Me Twice! Should I Dump Her? 🤔]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Relationships_Advice In today's episode, OP is stuck with a real headscratcher. On the plus side, his girlfriend is pretty and fun to be around. On the down side, she literally tried to murder him twice. So, should he stay with her or break up with her? Talk about a real conundrum! Personally, I feel like 1 attempted murder is 1 too many but maybe OP just draws the line at 3 attempted murdered. What do you think?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[r/AmITheA**hole For Sending My Parents To Jail?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, OP is in a truly sticky situation. Her parents stole her identity and used it to open credit cards and accounts in her name, but then never paid off any of the bills. Her credit is completely ruined, and now a company filed a lawsuit against her because they think that she owes them money. OP is afraid that the only way to get her parents to stop is to report them to the police and send them to prison. Will that make her the butthole?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Relationships_Advice Today's story is one of the strangest posts I've ever read. OP is a black woman dating a white guy, and everything in their relationship has been perfectly fine. Eventually the topic of slavery comes up, and OP's boyfriend says that she shouldn't criticize slavery because she actually would have had a good life during that time period as a white-passing slave. OP is shocked because... well, who wouldn't be shocked by something like that?! If you like this episode, follow for more Reddit stories!</p>

They believe that they're entitled to use OP's swimming pool whenever they want. OP turns them down and tells them that there's a community swimming pool just a few hours away. Naturally, the entitled Karen then breaks onto OP's property to use his pool without his permission!

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;r/Entitledparents In today&apos;s episode, OP uses a wheelchair and needs to take the bus. There&apos;s only 1 spot on the entire boss where can lock his wheelchair in, and of course a Karen is sitting there. He politely asks to use that spot, but the Karen freaks out and says that she and her precious baby need the seat. Eventually, the bus driver even has to get involved and starts screaming at the Karen to move, but she just won&apos;t listen!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[r/AmITheA**hole For Not Giving My Boyfriend My $300,000 Lottery Winnings?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, OP has a boyfriend who's really into cars. He wants to enter a lottery to win a $300,000 car, but he doesn't have the money for a ticket. OP buys a ticket for herself, and ends up winning! Suddenly, the boyfriend starts treating the car as if it's his and says that they have to share everything. OP doesn't want to give him the car (or even half of the car), so does that make her the butthole in this situation? If you like this episode, follow my podcast for more daily Reddit posts!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, we have an awesome story about a student who completely destroys their teacher in class. When a class clown jokes that the teacher is doing a bad job of explaining a lesson, the teacher snaps and says, "Do YOU want to teach this class?" The student says, "Sure!" and the teacher lets him try, because he's sure the student will fail. The student actually does a better job than the teacher, which just embarrasses him even more.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;r/Maliciouscompliance In today&apos;s episode, we have an awesome story about a student who completely destroys their teacher in class. When a class clown jokes that the teacher is doing a bad job of explaining a lesson, the teacher snaps and says, &quot;Do YOU want to teach this class?&quot; The student says, &quot;Sure!&quot; and the teacher lets him try, because he&apos;s sure the student will fail. The student actually does a better job than the teacher, which just embarrasses him even more. If you like this podcast and want to see more, follow my podcast for daily Reddit content!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[r/Maliciouscompliance "I Don't Want Help From A WOMAN!" "Yes sir!"]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, we have a piece of garbage misogynist who calls into tech support over some trivial issue. OP is a woman, and the second she answers the phone, this guy starts screaming at her that he doesn't want help from a woman because he needs a man. You don't want help from me? Sure thing, buddy! OP sends the angry caller into on hold purgatory for hours and never resolves his issue. If you like this video and want to see more, subscribe to my channel for more daily Reddit content!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[r/Storiesaboutkevin Kevin Tries To Pet a Hungry Lion!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Storiesaboutkevin In today's episode, OP lives in South Africa and goes on a Jeep safari with a female Kevin (a Kevina). This woman is beyond stupid! She's so stupid that when their Jeep comes across a wild lion... she tries to pet it! And it's not like this lion was asleep or something -- it was actively hunting prey. Luckily, the safari leader wouldn't let the Kevina exit the vehicle and approach the feral, hunting lion to give it some cuddles.

The dog growls once at the kid as a warning, and the brother completely flips out and demands that OP put the dog to sleep. OP doesn't want to do that, obviously, but now the brother is saying that OP is choosing a dog over the safety of a child.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Idontworkherelady In today's episode, an entitled Karen in a supermarket tries to boss around another young lady who's shopping. The young lady isn't pay attention because... why would she? She doesn't work there, after all. The Karen rudely grabs the young woman, which startles the woman so she reflexively punches Karen in the face.

The young lady isn&apos;t pay attention because... why would she? She doesn&apos;t work there, after all. The Karen rudely grabs the young woman, which startles the woman so she reflexively punches Karen in the face. Karen absolutely freaks out, of course, but the young woman is just fine because she was minded her own business when the Karen grabbed her.

			<title><![CDATA[r/Entitledparents "YOU CAN'T WEAR BIKINIS AT THE BEACH!"]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Entitledparents This entitled mother comes to the beach and decides to start screaming at a 17-year-old girl for wearing a bikini. She says that the bikini is disturbing her precious son. Lady, if you think women in bikinis will disturb your son, then why on earth did you bring him to a public beach!? And to add to that, why don't you just walk 50 feet in any direction to where your son can't see the bikini anymore?

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;r/Entitledparents This entitled mother comes to the beach and decides to start screaming at a 17-year-old girl for wearing a bikini. She says that the bikini is disturbing her precious son. Lady, if you think women in bikinis will disturb your son, then why on earth did you bring him to a public beach!? And to add to that, why don&apos;t you just walk 50 feet in any direction to where your son can&apos;t see the bikini anymore?

			<title><![CDATA[r/Prorevenge He Took My Trees, So I Took ALL His Money... It's TREE LAW!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Prorevenge I think it's been a while since we've had a tree law video. Are you ready for the sweet, delicious justice of tree law? If you've never seen a tree law video before, then prepare yourself, because it turns out that trees are expensive... VERY expensive. Cutting down your neighbor's trees could mean that you owe literally millions of dollars. This douchebag neighbor who threatens to kill OP's dog makes the worst mistake of his life when he cuts down trees on OP's property!

			<title><![CDATA[r/Askreddit What's The Most Out of Touch Person You've Ever Seen?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Askreddit Today's Askreddit question is, "What is the most severe case of someone being completely out of touch with reality you've ever seen?" We've got spoiled rich kid, delusional CEOs, and morons who just don't get it.

OP also happens to be a fish owner, so he comes up with a bright idea. He puts bloodworms into the freezer, which are frozen in a red block to look like a popsicle. The food thief falls for it and takes a huge block out of the frozen blood worm block! If you like this podcast and want to see more, follow my podcast for more daily Reddit content!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, OP lives with her boyfriend, and during the Covid-19 quarantine her boyfriend's parents come to live with them in her apartment. The problem? They are insanely entitled and are constantly undermining OP at every turn. They disobey her rules, call her names, and act like they own the house even though they're staying there for free. So, OP kicks them to the curb and then wonders if she made the wrong move.

			<title><![CDATA[r/Relationships Should I Give My Child $70,000?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Relationships_Advice In today's episode, OP promised that he would match whatever money his son spent in buying a new car. Well, in a shocking twist, the teenage son ended up earning over $35,000 in the stock market. That means that OP has to add his own $35,000 to equal $70,000 for a new car. Should a teenage boy really get a brand new $70,000 car? Or should he break his promise to his son and do something else with the money?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Entitledkids At a funeral, the parents of a deceased teenage girl decide to bury their beloved daughter with some of the things that she loved in life. One of the items they put in her casket is an iPod, because she played piano and loved music. At the end of the funeral, OP notices that the iPod is missing, so he tells the deceased girl's parents about it. They go looking for the iPod, and it turns out that a spoiled little brat stole the iPod from on top of the girl's body. WTF???

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Prorevenge In today's story, an entitled rich girl thinks that daddy can just buy her way through college, so she slacks off and hardly does any work.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, a creepy martial arts instructor shows up at a school to teach kids about self defense. The guy is incredibly smug, and to make matters worse he gets a bit touchy-feely with some of the girls that the's teaching. So, when he spars with a girl student and he tells her to hit him as hard as she can, she does exactly that and lands a kick square into the family jewels.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Insaneparents I've covered a lot of crazy parents on this channel, but the parents in today's video are the craziest of the craziest. The father in the first story wants to cast some sort of evil vampire Christian spell on OP that sucks out his life force so that the father can literally become younger. We've also got a mom who forces her kids to drink their own... well, you'll just have to listen to that one for yourself.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, OP likes to work on cars and is in the process of restoring an old Impala, which is taking up all of the space in his garage. His girlfriend complains because she wants to park her car in his garage, but he refuses. So, while OP is away, she secretly steals her boyfriend's car and sells it to for scrap. When OP finds out, he goes full nuclear and has it investigated as a crime! Is he a butthole for selling out his girlfriend?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Talesfromretail In today's episode, an entitled Karen goes to the grocery store and gives her kids fruit to eat. She doesn't pay for the fruit, she just steals it off the shelves and hopes that her kids eat it all before anyone notices. When OP confronts her about it, she tries to get the cashier to weigh the fruit peels so she only has to pay for that. So, the manager gives her a lifetime ban for trying to scam the store out of free food! If you like this podcast and you want more, hit the follow button for daily Reddit content!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[r/Maliciouscompliance I Dumped Trash On My Boss's Head!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, a terrible boss forces his employees to dump the bar's trash by walking it through the front of the establishment, rather than taking it out back. Well, OP complies by taking the trash out the front, where his boss and a girl are sitting on the steps having a drink. The boss doesn't move, so OP lifts the trash over this head... and that's exactly when the trash bag breaks open, showering the boss in broken beer bottles and half-eaten bar food!

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;r/Relationships_Advice In today&apos;s episode, OP&apos;s brother and his family moves in with her. OP&apos;s nephew immediately begins acting like a monster, constantly calling OP bad names and stealing her things. He even steals her inhaler when she has an asthma attack! Luckily, another family member searches through the nephew&apos;s room and finds the inhaler. Is OP&apos;s nephew just an entitled kid, or is he actually a full-blown psychopath who&apos;s trying to murder her?

OP was walking down a stairwell in a building, minding his own business, when a woman confronted him and started shouting demands at him. When he refused to help her, she claimed that he assaulted her! The police show up, but luckily OP has video evidence that proves his innocence.

Without that video, there&apos;s a good chance that the woman&apos;s lies would have put him in jail.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;r/AmITheA**hole In today&apos;s episode, OP tragically suffered burn scars due to a childhood accident, and also has a prosthetic legs. OP crosses paths with a Karen and her little spawn, so naturally the Karen scolds OP for being outside. How dare someone so ugly show their face in public! OP wants to know if he&apos;s the wrong one in this situation, which is honestly so depressing. This is one of the most clear-cut examples of OP doing absolutely nothing wrong.

			<title><![CDATA[r/AmITheA**hole For Terrifying a Spoiled Brat on a Plane with My Facial Scars?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's video, we have an incredibly spoiled family who reacts badly to OP's facial scars. The kid gets scared by the scars, which (let's be honest) is understandable because it's just a kid. But what's way worse than that is the parent's reaction, who actually scolds OP for having the audacity to have facial scars. OP turns it around on the parent and scolds him for being such a despicable human being. What kind of douchebag scolds someone for having facial scars?</p>

<p>r/Prorevenge A garbage collector starts snooping into someone's trash and reading their mail. So, one woman decides that enough is enough and starts a plan of prorevenge. She caught a skunk and hid it in her garbage, and made sure to close the lid to let it bake for a few days in the sun. The next time the garbage collector opened the trash can, he was in for a shocking surprise! If you enjoyed this video, like and subscribe!</p>
