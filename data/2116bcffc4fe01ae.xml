      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Laszlo is a fourth-generation owner of the Granger Ranches, a 13,000-acre cattle ranch in Montana’s Madison Valley. Over the past 20 years or so, he and a team of public agencies and professionals have been restoring a large wetland on the property, which was drained generations ago for grazing use. </p><p>What has become known as the O’Dell Creek restoration project has restored some 15 miles of spring-fed streams and 1,000 acres of wetlands. The results include a 900 percent increase in waterfowl numbers, a 600 percent increase in waterfowl species diversity, an improved fishery with reduced water temperatures, the return of rare native vegetation, the reintroduction of imperiled species such as Trumpeter Swans and Arctic grayling, and a vast increase in use for migrating sandhill cranes. </p><p>With the rising water table, the bottomland became more productive and better able to support the ranch’s cow-calf operation and hay production. The Granger Ranches has actually grown its livestock operations, demonstrating that ecological balance, sustainable ranching, and economic viability can coexist. This work has garnered numerous awards, including the 2010 National Wetlands Award for Private Land Stewardship, and has been the subject of films and numerous articles. </p><p>Jeff and I talked about the history of the family ranch, draining of the valley floor, and all about the restoration project, from impetus through implementation.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Hallie Mahowald is the programs director for <a href="https://westernlandowners.org/">Western Landowners Alliance</a>, a landowner-led group that advances policies and practices that sustain working lands, connected landscapes, and native species. At WLA, Hallie manages people and strategy to support private stewardship across the West. She holds a B.A. in Environmental Science from the University of Denver and a M.A. in International Environmental Policy from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. In conjunction with her academic studies and early career in the non-profit sector, she worked on many natural resources management and sustainable development projects in the American West and Central and South America. Hallie currently serves on the advisory board of Colorado State University's Center for Collaborative Conservation and as vice president on the board of directors for the Central Colorado Conservancy.</p><p>We talked all about the reintroduction of Grey Wolves to Colorado, from the original ballot initiative that set it in motion, to the various arguments, to the management implications. It’s a complex issue that will require a whole lot of cooperation and experimentation. Lucky for us, Hallie is on the stakeholder advisory group that is helping to navigate all this. We also touched on public land cattle grazing, something I want to understand better and maybe cover on the podcast more fully in the future. Finally, we discussed a few of WLA’s various programs, which include their Habitat Lease Partnership program, the Working Wild Challenge, and Women in Ranching. You can learn about all these things and more at <a href="https://westernlandowners.org/">westernlandowners.org.</a> </p>]]></itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Dr. J. Drew Lanham is an author, ornithologist, and professor of wildlife ecology at Clemson University. His research focuses on songbird ecology, as well as the African-American role in natural-resources conservation. He is active on a number of conservation boards including the South Carolina Wildlife Federation, South Carolina Audubon, Aldo Leopold Foundation, BirdNote and the American Birding Association.</p><p>Dr. Lanham is a widely published author and award-nominated poet, writing about his experiences as a birder, hunter and wild, wandering soul. His 2016 book, <em>The Home Place: Memoirs of a Colored Man’s Love Affair with Nature</em>, describes his upbringing in South Carolina, his family history, and his lifelong affinity for nature. He writes “In me, there is the red of miry clay, the brown of spring floods, the gold of ripening tobacco. I am, in the deepest sense, colored.”</p><p>We discussed Drew’s rural upbringing and his family, his professional life, identity, birdwatching, hunting, and his interpretation of the Land Ethic. I really enjoyed learning his perspective through the book and this conversation. If you’re interested in Dr. Lanham’s work, consider reading <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Home-Place-Memoirs-Colored-Affair/dp/1571313508">The Home Place</a></em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Home-Place-Memoirs-Colored-Affair/dp/1571313508"> </a>and his latest, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sparrow-Envy-Field-Lesser-Beasts/dp/1938235819">Sparrow Envy: A Field Guide to Birds and Lesser Beasts.</a></em></p><p><em>“In his debut memoir, self-described “eco-addict” J. Drew Lanham explores the connection between trees and family trees, birds and brethren, and most importantly of all, the place where mother nature and human nature meet. Taken together, it makes for a unique reading experience; one in which the book’s meditative qualities far surpass any semblance of a conventional plot. Let the reader be warned, there are no fireworks here—simply the musings of an African-American naturalist who, throughout his lifetime, has trained himself to marvel at the minor. Trust me, that is enough.” - </em><strong><em>The Los Angeles Review</em></strong></p>]]></itunes:summary>

During the episode, we discussed our experience together on the ranch, Josh's journey as an outdoorsman, and his goals for Spoke Hollow.
