      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined by Matt "Money" Smith, Handsome Hank and Eddie Spaghetti via video chat for a mid-week DDFP! The crew first started talking about the NHL's 24 team playoff bracket as sports are slowly coming back during the COVID-19 pandemic (8:35). Next, Shek debates with the the guys that the Tennessee Titans would have a better chance at winning a Super Bowl with Cam Newton as quarterback (15:10). Then, the group revisits Shek's hot take that he would rather have Big Ben in 2020 over Lamar Jackson (28:55). They round out the show discussing the golf match between Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning (55:45). </p>

They rounded out the show by debating if Michael Jordan was too mean to his teammates (1:08:30)?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined by Matt "Money" Smith, Handsome Hank and Eddie Spaghetti via video chat for a mid-week DDFP!

Next, they kibitz about the future of Jameis Winston (32:15) and if Patriots fans would root for Tom Brady and the Bucs over their own team in a Super Bowl (42:18)? The guys wrap up the show with a sports 'what if' question surrounding Michael Jordan (57:15).</p>

Money and Hank first recap their trip to Mexico for the Chiefs vs Chargers game (4:09).

Finally, they round out the show with their Red Challenge Flag picks for Week 12 (51:13).</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by Handsome Hank! Hank first talks about the pickles that were gifted to all of DDFP but he ended up consuming most of them alone (3:49). Next, the duo talks about the NFL finalizing the pass interference penalty which allows coaches to challenge them up until the two minute warning or overtime (7:02). With news of the Tampa Bay Rays splitting time between Florida and Montreal, Shek and Hank discuss what that would be like for an NFL franchise (17:29). Then, the guys kibitz about great television shows they've been watching lately such as Barry and Chernobyl (26:28). Finally they round out the show ranking their best and worst NFL uniforms of 2019 (44:04). </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by John Gonzalez of The Ringer! The duo starts out joking about Shek not kicking out John's boss, Bill Simmons, out of their fantasy football league (4:50). Since John is from Philly they then get into the Eagles moving on from Nick Foles and the pressure Carson Wentz may have on him (9:56). Next, John breaks down the big Anthony Davis to the Lakers trade and who else potentially may join Davis in LA (29:25). They also get into why the Toronto Raptors championship is an outlier in the age of super teams (45:07). Finally, they round out the show talking about the great success of John's wife, Colleen Wolfe (1:11:13). </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by our old pal Maurice Jones-Drew who is back from vacation.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined by Matt "Money" Smith who finally makes his return to Studio 66! Money updates us on his busy schedule (3:00) before the duo gets into where they believe Josh Rosen will end up next season (13:38).

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by ESPN writer Mina Kimes to kibitz about all things NFL. Shek &amp; Mina first start talking about her love of the Seattle Seahawks and which Super Bowl loss hurt more between 40 &amp; 49 (3:00). Next, they get into two of the rookie QBs - Lamar Jackson &amp; Josh Allen, specifically with how well they've both ran the ball (9:35). Then Shek makes Mina use the literal 10 foot pole to answer some questions like if Le'Veon Bell will get his contract in 2019, if the Chiefs or Rams will make it to Super Bowl LIII and if Nick Foles is the better fit at quarterback for the Eagles (31:00)? Lastly, Shek wraps up the show by asking Mina some questions that will be appearing in the 2018 Sheky's (49:30).</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by Handsome Hank and on Skype by CBS Sports' Will Brinson for their 3rd annual NFC South QB rankings. First, the guys get into if the Browns should have drafted Bradley Chubb over Denzel Ward after Gregg Williams' comments (18:00). Next, Dave asks which 2018 off-season narrative will go away once the regular season starts up (23:55) and if Odell Beckham Jr. is the biggest Jenga piece in the NFL who is next (31:55)? Will declares the Atlanta Falcons his SB LIII champion while Dave says they will be at least a top 3 NFC team (50:30). Finally, Shek and Will list their 2018 NFC South QB rankings both having the same quarterback in the #1 spot.</p>

After catching up with MJD about his vacation, Shek asks how confident Maurice is in his Rams to make the Super Bowl after their recent off-season additions (3:30). Next, MJD makes the bold claim the Cleveland Browns will make the playoffs en route to a 10 win season since their roster has been much improved (11:50). Shek then explains why he's not a fan of the Jets welcoming back Darrelle Revis to sign a one day contract after he left them for the arch-rival New England Patriots (25:20). Unfortunately for Chicago Bears fans, Shek adds them to the list of teams who will not be making the playoffs in 2018 with MJD agreeing that they are the last place team in the NFC North (33:10). Lastly, the guys wrap up the show with who are the best newcomers in the NFC West (40:55)?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by Cleveland Browns legend Willie McGinest, who is now a member of the virtual Wall of Fame. Shek asks Willie who is the New England Patriots Jenga piece (6:50) and what he thinks of Danny Amendola's comments on Bill Belichick being like a school principal (9:15)? Willie also picks which team is better - the 2017 or the 2018 New England Patriots (16:30). Next, Antonio Brown who will be on the Madden 19 cover joins the DDFP (22:46). Shek and Antonio kibitz about the Le'Veon Bell contract situation (31:05), who the Steelers Jenga piece is and his thoughts on potentially being the greatest wide receiver of all-time (25:30). Shek ends the notion that Antonio isn't QB-proof (38:38) and totally misses A.B.'s handshake at the end (39:30).</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by NFL Network colleague Martin Weiss and Eddie Spaghetti as he makes the jump from behind the glass. Martin asks the group if the Steelers trio of Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell each swapped teams with Aaron Rodgers, DeAndre Hopkins and Todd Gurley II how much would their NFL careers be different (14:00)? Next, Shek makes fun of Spaghetti for attending awful movies like <em>Dan In Real Life</em> with a large group of his male friends, which poses the question do people actually walk out of movies (35:40)? Then, Spaghetti and EmmaVP explain how they're both very anti playing board games, such as Jenga or Connect Four, at bars (46:15).  Lastly, Martin tells the group he just came back from a vacation in Cabo that he went on alone (54:25).</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by former NFL wide receivers Reggie Wayne and James Jones to help Shek complete a few lists. The first ranking they get to is who's the greatest running back ever, to which James and Reggie both say Barry Sanders (3:30). Tony Romo said the Packers are the team to beat in 2018 so the gang debates if this statement will hold up (9:45). The next list the guys get to is Win, Place, Show - best quarterbacks of the last quarter century (20:00).  Since Antonio Brown is having a Hall of Fame career, the last list Shek, James and Reggie create are their top five wide receivers of all-time (38:50).</p>

The group starts to kibitz about Malcolm Butler's absence from Super Bowl LII and if he was playing would the Patriots have won another ring (6:40)?

Next, Shek brings up the quarterback finger bet and asks Willie for his opinion if Lamar Jackson will be starting for the Baltimore Ravens (23:00)? Then Willie told some stories from his playing days such as Rodney Harrison torpedoing him in the back or what kind of trash talk went on at the bottom of the pile (38:00).

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is in Dallas for the 2018 NFL Draft and is first joined by Move The Sticks podcast host Daniel Jeremiah to preview Thursday night (4:19). First, Shek asks DJ which players have the highest bust potential (8:41), DJ then explains why Sam Darnold is a better fit for the Browns and playing in the AFC North than Josh Rosen (10:58). Lastly Shek asks DJ who each of the 32 NFL teams would take first overall if they had the chance (17:07).

Shek asks Coach Shaw how he game planned against Josh Rosen and Sam Darnold when his Stanford teams faced UCLA and USC (41:48). The coaches answer would you rather the cerebral game manager or the gunslinger to which Mooch talks about his time with Brett Favre and Steve Young (44:47). Coach Shaw also gives an update on Andrew Luck's status and Mooch says why the NFL needs Andrew Luck (1:01:55). </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined by NFL Network's own Willie McGinest and Shaun O'Hara who start off the show by sticking up for fellow colleague, James Jones, after Shek's comments about Aaron Rodgers having the worst wide receiver group ever (12:00).

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is joined by former Cleveland Browns scout and creator of WilliamsonFootball.com, Matt Williamson (6:39), to kibitz about which drills at the NFL Combine actually matter to him (9:50), where Saquon Barkley ranks as a prospect for him (21:45) and how every team shapes their offense based on their quarterbacks skill set (15;55). Matt also gives his win, place and show for the quarterback prospects in the 2018 NFL Draft (23:41). Next, Handsome Hank sits down in Studio 66 (31:52) as judge to determine who was the culprit of the Big Bear controversy.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Dameshek is first joined by Patrick Claybon and Handsome Hank to revisit the now infamous "QB Finger Bet" regarding which teams will have a new quarterback in 2018 (33:30), as well as discuss the New York Jets' decision to cut Muhammad Wilkerson (41:20).

      <description><![CDATA[Shek and Rank kibitz with Minnesota Vikings defensive end Jared Allen about his worthy charity (HomesForWoundedWarriors.com), the 2013 Minnesota Vikings, playing outdoors, and which NFL mascots he could defeat in a fight. The fellas also welcome former Viking/current Raiders punter Chris Kluwe into Studio 66 to talk about his new book, “Beautifully Unique Sparkleponies,” his vocal support of gay rights, his band, road trip songs and kickers being too good. In addition, Around The League scribe Marc Sessler and Handsome Hank stop by for producer Black Tie's latest “Black List,” with topics including this summer's best sports story and Colin Kaepernick wearing a Miami Dolphins cap. Lastly, we end the podcast with a tune from Chris Kluwe's band, Tripping Icarus, titled "Misery."

      <description><![CDATA[Dave Dameshek is joined by "Handsome" Hank who fills in for Adam Rank, who is on assignment, with guest producer "Neck-tie" Milner. The trio open a can of worms on the best two-topping pizzas. Dave, as always, shows his age-ism by downplaying pineapple as well as the "scam" of hair conditioner. And by the way, half of the ATL debate club, Marc Sessler, joins the cast to share his list of the top quarterbacks in the league, much to the chagrin of Dave and Hank. Finally, Shek and Hank share their excitement for Super Bowl L in San Francisco as they prepare their restaurant checklist years in advance.

      <description><![CDATA[Shek and Rank honor the classic divisional round playoffs with an equally spellbinding edition of the podcast.  Highlights include Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo (@Brendan311) discussing his tweet about the New England Patriots' "gimmick" offense, driving to the stadium with Ray Lewis, why Joe Flacco succeeds in January, and the response a gay player would receive from his teammates. NFL personnel guru Daniel Jeremiah (@MoveTheSticks) breaks down another postseason Peyton Manning choke, the emergence of Colin Kaepernick, and who to draft first in 2013. Around The League's Dan Hanzus (@DanHanzus) talks about where last weekend's games ranked all time, who was at fault for the Denver Broncos’ loss, the Atlanta Falcons' near-collapse, and the most annoying people in commercials inspired by Black Tie's (@TundeSMD) weekly shout out.

      <description><![CDATA[Episode #31 proved to be too much show for just one podcast, so be sure after you listen to Side A, you flip it over to Side B to hear our discussion with Rank's delightful boyhood hero, the rugged Jack Youngblood. 
 Side A: Rank ambushes the show with his one-on-one interview with Bills star Fred 'Action' Jackson; we also bring in Handsome Hank to yap about the silly controversy surrounding Ndamukong Suh's alleged remarks directed at Matt Ryan; we also talk about Timmy Tebow's short and long-term future under center; we introduce the newest Tie to our rack of producers; and we jump in the DeLorean and head to next Tuesday to see who wins this weekend's big games.
 Side B: Jack Youngblood kibitzes about playing on a broken leg; the (mis)treatment he's gotten from his old franchise since it moved to St Louis; the Rams' '79 run to the Super Bowl; tearing his bum on the ice in Minnesota; and more!

 Side B: Jack Youngblood kibitzes about playing on a broken leg; the (mis)treatment he's gotten from his old franchise since it moved to St Louis; the Rams' '79 run to the Super Bowl; tearing his bum on the ice in Minnesota; and more!

      <description><![CDATA[That's right, football is back and the fellas could not be more thrilled about it's return. And you notice that nobody ever threatened to walk away from the NFL like the fans of other sports do during a labor strife. And you want to know why? Football is king, that's why. That is why today's show is chalk full of football talk. Who are the front runners for the Super Bowl? What coach is setting himself up for failure? And is Adam Rank's weight balloon beyond healthy levels?
All of that in more in this thin slice of heaven we like to call, The Dave Dameshek GRIDIRON Program. (Or football for now.)

And finally, the gang looks at the team that might have the best collection of all-time running backs.

      <itunes:title>Talking James Harrison with Men’s Journal author Paul Solotaroff</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[Is it time to start rooting for a new team? The fellas get to the bottom of this James Harrison business by getting the story straight from Men’s Journal writer Paul Solotaroff who opens up about his recent story about the Steelers’ enigmatic linebacker. Is the general public being duped by an elaborate work much like the fans who follow professional wrestling? We get in to that.
We also talk a bit about Roger Clemens, Terrelle Pryor and a name of Adam Rank‘s small, lonely fan base. In fact, we encourage you to vote in the poll on NFL.com.
Won’t you have a listen? It figures to be a thin slice of heaven.

      <description><![CDATA[They boys continue their discussion with NFL maven Jason La Canfora. The NFL's top information man dazzles us with his deep knowledge of punk, 80s metal and inter-league baseball. There might have been some football mixed in, too. But to be honest, it was hard to not be impressed by his encyclopedia-like knowledge of music -- even though he sided with Lynyrd Skynyrd over the Allman Brothers.

      <itunes:title>Classic L.A. Rams jersey talk and Jason La Canfora drops in</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[There is no argument that John Elway is the leader in the clubhouse for NFL players who wore No. 7. Even though there is a half-hearted argument given to Ben Roethlisberger. But is the jersey No. 7 the greatest sports number ever? The gang discusses that and Dave gives his view on who wore No. 7 the best -- Mickey Mantle or Elway.
The gang also gets into the business of which Los Angeles Rams jersey is the best of all-time, based off Adam Rank's Pick Six.
You might want to sit down for this news -- our own Necktie Milner got us a guest! And a damn good one, if I don't mind saying so -- Jason La Canfora.   Great guest, Dylan.
In other words, this was not only a pure delight, but just the first-part of a special edition of the Dave Dameshek Football Program.
