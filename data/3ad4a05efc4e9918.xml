Across the street from Foxconn employees, a human wall of special police in white hazmat suits is standing by. On some sections of the road, there are large trucks blocking the road, trying to intercept the workers. What would happen?

Foxconn Zhengzhou is one of Apple Inc.'s largest foundries in Asia, with a peak workforce of 300,000 employees at one point. From Oct. 29th to 30th, a large number of employees broke out of the plant after a fierce clash between the employees and the anti-epidemic workers. Some employees told overseas Chinese media that they witnessed batches of workers being hauled away from the dorm and quarantined. It’s exposed that abnormalities are found in the nucleic acid test results of nearly 20,000 people who are quarantined in an Evergrande's rotten-tail building. Once workers are placed in quarantine, they are left unattended, without medical care or food.
All these have scared the remaining workers. First, they are still afraid that they will be dragged away for quarantine; second, they are also afraid that the number of positive cases in Foxconn factories will continue to increase, and that eventually they will be infected.

Red China has always used its infrastructure feats to inspire patriotism among its people. China's leaders say these projects are critical to China's development, especially superhighways, bridges, and railways. 

According to a think tank, McKinsey Global Institute, infrastructure construction accounts for about 9% of China's economy, much higher than that of Western countries. In the US and Western Europe, infrastructure construction only accounts for about 2.5% of the economy. China's highway construction is comparable to the construction of the interstate highway system in the United States that began in the 1950s but at an astonishing rate. But does China really need so many super highways, bridges, and railways?

As the 20th Communist Party Congress came to a close in late October, official outbreak statistics rose rather than fell. Resurgent outbreaks exist in almost all of China's provinces and are spreading in places like Beijing and Tianjin. But the infected numbers are small and not actually align with the current scale of prevention.

The reshuffle of the Chinese leadership has spooked foreign investors. The next day, on Oct. 24th, Chinese stocks suffered their worst day in Hong Kong since the global financial crisis in 2008, as foreign investors rushed to sell Chinese stocks. Nearly all the stocks in the Hang Sheng index were lower, with Chinese internet and technology stocks being hit particularly hard. 
Analysts generally expect China's economy to slow in Xi's third term, not primarily because of the labor force demographics, productivity, real estate, etc. that drive growth, but because of the CCP's regressive economic policies.

The first meeting after the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party CCP ended on October 23rd, granting the CCP leader Xi Jinping a third term as the top leader, and the seven most powerful members of the CCP, the new generation of Politburo Standing Committee members were presented. We see that this is the team that’s the least competent in governing the country. 
A signal had been dropped the day before. On Oct. 22nd, at the closing of the 20th Communist Party Congress, the world was surprised to see an unprecedented scene. Former Communist Party leader Hu Jintao was &quot;persuaded&quot; to leave the podium in advance. 
How and why?

This is in southern China, where a flyover under construction suddenly collapsed. 

In the past, when Red China was apparently rich, the only noticeable thing was the shocking corruption; now that the economy is slowly crumbling, the risk of such tofu-dreg projects has grown significantly. When there was plenty of money, there existed a high number of tofu-dreg projects, how can we expect the quality of the projects to be guaranteed when the money is close to drying up? 

Tofu-dreg construction is the predecessor of rotten-tail buildings. When many tofu-dreg projects appeared in the last few years, it already foretold the emergence of the future storm of rotten-tail buildings. If developers can deliver tofu-dreg projects to home buyers, they won't let themselves get to the point where their developments are falling apart.

The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, has attracted global attention. On the first day of its opening, the Consul General of the Chinese Consulate in Manchester, England, personally came out to a protest scene and beat up a Hong Kong protestor who was protesting peacefully, causing shockwaves in Britain. 
The term war-wolf diplomacy surfaced around 2019 when Zhao Lijian used Twitter to slam foreign voices critical of China. Since then, other Chinese diplomats have joined the bandwagon, taking an aggressive posture abroad. It is fair to say that until 2019, little attention was paid to Zhao, but his tough and belligerent rhetorical style, both officially and online, quickly and radically changed the way China communicates with its allies and adversaries, spreading to the entire Chinese diplomatic circle. It replaced a decades-long tedious blend of roundabout diplomatic rhetoric and convoluted communist clichés that had characterized China's public statements before.

Residents in the Yangtze River Delta basically rely on the river as a source of drinking water, and Shanghai, in particular, relies on several reservoirs on the river. The overall lowering of water levels in the middle and lower reaches will lead to serious water shortages in these areas. For example, if the water level in the midstream section of Wuhan City is low, the water level in the downstream section of Jiujiang City in Jiangxi Province, Nanjing, the capital city of Jiangsu Province, and Shanghai will be low. The low water level in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will produce a phenomenon, that is, the seawater at the mouth of the Yangtze River will pour in. For the city of Shanghai, this year's record lack of rain and high temperatures have exacerbated the &quot;salty water&quot; crisis Shanghai currently experiences. This should also be the underlying reason for the unprecedented panic felt by Shanghai residents.

   <media:description>Public protests against the top leadership are extremely rare in mainland China, especially on the eve of an important political meeting. The National Congress of the Communist Party, which takes place twice every 10 years, is the most important event in Chinese Communist Party CCP politics. To ensure the security of the 20th National Congress, Beijing has been heavily guarded including the flow of people, logistics, and even routine financial operations being placed on hold. 
The real frustration of the Chinese people runs counter to the official atmosphere created by the Communist Party. The strict security measures and &quot;zero-covid&quot; restrictions have stirred up a wave of anger online, with many people having their movements restricted or forced into quarantine. 
Recently a number of cities have adopted strict lockdown measures, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, the top four cities in terms of GDP.

   <media:description>On October 7, Bloomberg reported that an unnamed U.S. official revealed that the U.S. has been conducting various military simulations to prevent the Chinese Communist Party or the CCP from invading Taiwan by force and that the White House is even planning an emergency response plan for TSMC.
President Tsai Ing-wen also expressed her great concern for Taiwan's semiconductor industry during her National Day speech on October 10 in the Republic of China, &quot;the concentration of the semiconductor sector in Taiwan is not a risk&quot;, she said.
We agree with the view that if China were to invade Taiwan and create a war, perhaps the biggest concern would not be the chips, but the collapse of the world order.

   <media:description>This is arguably the world's biggest rotten-tail project, a place called Xiong'an that was considered a partial replacement for Beijing. It’s located in Hebei province, a neighboring province to Beijing, and was a personal dream of the Chinese Communist Party Leader Xi Jinping. Unfortunately, the project, which was billed as a &quot;millennium project and a major national event,&quot; fell apart after only five years, demonstrating a complete crash of Xi's dream.

   <media:description>Chips making chips or Robots making Fries! This is happening in America. The Chinese Communist Party or CCP no doubt dreams about such an achievement. But on October 7, the American government almost crushed this dream of the CCP.  On that day, the US government issued a new regulation restricting the export of high-end chips and chip manufacturing equipment to China.

   <media:title>Tourist Traps: Xishuangbanna’s Lockdown Strands 1500 Tourists &amp; 200,000 Pinks Gathered in Beijing</media:title>

   <media:description>This is the airport in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province in southwest China. On the afternoon of Oct. 4, the government suddenly issued a notice announcing that no one would be allowed to leave the city starting at 2 p.m. The official terminology was complicated, avoiding the term “city lockdown,” but in reality, it was a de facto city closure. The lightning speed of the closure left some 1,500 tourists stranded at the airport. These tourists from out of town were shocked to find themselves surrounded by men in white with guns.
Before the local outbreak, both the central and local governments seemed to be hoping for a recovery of the tourism economy. Officials from the central government even helped Xishuangbanna with tourism promotion in mid-September. They made the stray herd of elephants that escaped from Xishuangbanna in 2021 into international friendship ambassadors and did a lot of publicity in the media. As Golden Week approached, Communist Party officials made a point of briefing the situation of the elephants who had returned to Xishuangbanna.
