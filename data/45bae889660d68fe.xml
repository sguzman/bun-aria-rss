			<description><![CDATA[Hello - zdrastvuitye! My name is Ann and I'd like to welcome you to One Minute Russian from the Radio Lingua Network. In this podcast I'm going to be teaching you the basics of Russian. The great thing about this language course is that you'll be learning all you need to know in 60 seconds - or thereabouts! Each one minute language lesson will equip you with just enough Russian to help you get by in lots of situations, either on holiday, or on a business trip to a Russian-speaking country, or just to impress your Russian-speaking friends or colleagues. Our course will be starting very soon. In the meantime, visit our website on http://www.oneminutelanguages.com]]></description>
