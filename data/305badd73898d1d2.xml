&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/sftgx1/my_adventures_trying_to_find_a_wired/"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of people, I had to put together a small office at home come March 
2020. While I'm quite comfortable now, my main issue is that my keyboard is a 
regular one, a &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/accessories/products/keyboards/wired-desktop-600?activetab=overview%3aprimaryr2"&gt;Microsoft 
600&lt;/a&gt; 
I'm quite happy with, but it takes a lot of space on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of research (clearly not enough) and I thought a mechanical keyboard 
would solve this. I got a nice 
&lt;a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-non-backlight-wireless-mechanical-keyboard"&gt;Keychron&lt;/a&gt; 
with brown switches because the key layout was excellent, but it came with two 
problems: it was way noisier than I was willing to stand and it was too high. I 
could have bought a wrist rest to solve the second issue, but the noise was also 
a deal breaker. I managed to sell it second hand just this morning. Red switches 
may fix a bit of this, but I was not convinced. Don't get me wrong: it's not a 
bad keyboard, it just wasn't a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been searching a bit more for a keyboard I might like: wired, no numpad, 
non-mechanical; I'm comfortable typing on membrane and chiclet. I discovered 
&lt;a href="https://ergocanada.com/"&gt;ergocanada.com&lt;/a&gt;, which has a nice catalog of compact 
keyboards (including some 
&lt;a href="https://www.ergocanada.com/ec_home/manufacturers/typematrix_1.html"&gt;aberrations&lt;/a&gt;), 
but so far I haven't found anything too convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matias has 
  &lt;a href="https://matias.store/collections/scissor/products/fk308pcbb"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which 
  might be exactly what I'm looking for, but several online reviews point at 
  quality issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adesso has &lt;a href="https://www.adesso.com/product/adesso-akb-111ub-slimtouch-mini-keyboard/"&gt;this 
  one&lt;/a&gt; 
  but again, looks like the quality is not the best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It turns out you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/keyboards-and-mice/keyboards/4y40x49493?&amp;amp;cid=us:sem|se|google|gs_smart+shopping_1po_push|gs_accessories||4Y40X49493|15914561996|129233503381|pla-1597507124330|shopping|brand&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3MLC49jX9QIViR-tBh0sjQ_NEAQYASABEgIfB_D_BwE"&gt;ThinkPad 
  keyboard&lt;/a&gt; 
  and connect it to a regular computer. I hate the trackpoint, though. It's not 
  entirely clear to me if this is a wired keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were willing to go wireless (I'm not, but &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;), there are a few options 
out there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logitech has the &lt;a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-keys-mini.920-010473.html"&gt;MX Keys 
  Mini&lt;/a&gt;, 
  which looks good, but lacks 4 keys I use regularly: Home, End, PgUp, PgDown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2A3LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english?fnode=18c3f275bd715bf9cca7fb147eebc4fecf497163097e9611903eff9be18043c348c7c50156d7e40186bc1b2d57688503f06efdc5dd354303febb70e0d794f4eb131950750257ce3a56d235e5d9a2054261e9bc45eb6715a6e131987244d34cec8547c546fe7e53178f3b9bd892746649"&gt;Apple Magic 
  Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;: 
  same as above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/microsoft-designer-compact-keyboard/8zhrtr7zcswq?activetab=pivot:overviewtab"&gt;Microsoft Designer 
  Compact&lt;/a&gt; 
  also looks good, though that emoji key kills me a bit. I want my right CTRL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jellycomb.com/collections/keyboards?page=1"&gt;Jelly Comb&lt;/a&gt; has some 
  nice ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I've given up: I can't seem to find a compact keyboard that I like 
and that I can be more or less sure won't break after the first week of use (I 
type hard). What I've learned after all this research&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is that a standard 
keyboard with chiclet keys is probably better than what I have right now. I'm 
eyeing &lt;a href="https://www.dell.com/en-ca/shop/dell-wired-keyboard-kb216-black/apd/580-admt/pc-accessories?ref=p13n_ena_pdp_vv&amp;amp;c=ca&amp;amp;cs=cadhs1&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;s=dhs"&gt;this very basic Dell 
keyboard&lt;/a&gt; 
for when mine breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: the Reddit thread linked above was useful. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/sftgx1/my_adventures_trying_to_find_a_wired/hus4c0o/"&gt;/u/5349 
suggested&lt;/a&gt; 
the &lt;a href="https://www.cherry.co.uk/cherry-stream-keyboard-tkl.html"&gt;Cherry Stream 
TKL&lt;/a&gt;, which apparently 
checks all the boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2&lt;/strong&gt;: I received my Cherry Stream TKL yesterday and couldn't be happier. 
It's everything the Keychron wasn't: very low profile and extremely silent. For 
anyone in my position (would like to get rid of the numpad for whatever reason 
but doesn't like mechanical keyboards) I think this is one of the best options 
out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yep, I did my own research. Get the vaccine.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">José María Mateos</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 17:01:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:rinzewind.org,2022-01-29:/blog-en/2022/searching-for-a-non-mechanical-tenkeyless-tkl-keyboard-and-giving-up.html</guid><category>Blog</category></item><item><title>How to use Keychron function keys in Linux</title><link>https://rinzewind.org/blog-en/2022/how-to-use-keychron-function-keys-in-linux.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've just bought a &lt;a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-non-backlight-wireless-mechanical-keyboard"&gt;Keychron 
keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. 
The move from a classical membrane keyboard to a mechanical one is not being as 
straightforward as I thought, but I like that I don't have a numerical keypad 
anymore, which was taking up precious space on my desktop. I also think it makes 
way too much noise, for my taste, despite the brown switches (hey, not blue!), 
but it's also probably me typing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed is that the function keys weren't working as I would expect 
them: just have the regular function work when I press the key, and have the 
multimedia goodies, which I don't use much, jump in when the &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; key is added 
to the mix. Looking around, I've found &lt;a href="https://github.com/ryazh3nk4/keychron_function_keys_linux"&gt;this github 
repository&lt;/a&gt; which 
provides a very simple solution for this.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">José María Mateos</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 17:16:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:rinzewind.org,2022-01-25:/blog-en/2022/how-to-use-keychron-function-keys-in-linux.html</guid><category>Blog</category></item><item><title>Cryptoenglish</title><link>https://rinzewind.org/blog-en/2021/cryptoenglish.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;English is my second language, which will be obvious to readers of this page 
because sometimes I screw up. It is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people out there that think that the &lt;em&gt;cryptospace&lt;/em&gt; is something 
completely useless, but I must thank it publicly for teaching me things about 
English that I didn't know before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there's the word "scam". It's already pretty short, but it turns 
out one can shorten it even more by writing it as "NFT". Amazingly, when 
pronounced, the shorter version is longer. Isn't it great?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">José María Mateos</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 15:13:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:rinzewind.org,2021-12-24:/blog-en/2021/cryptoenglish.html</guid><category>Blog</category></item><item><title>Percentage of Hacker News job postings that mention a remote option</title><link>https://rinzewind.org/blog-en/2021/percentage-of-hacker-news-job-postings-that-mention-a-remote-option.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Percentage of job postings on HN that mention a remote

&lt;p&gt;The entire plot is generated by an R script that you can found 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rinze/hn_remote/blob/main/hn_remote_main.R"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Any 
suggestions (you can find my e-mail address &lt;a href="https://rinzewind.org/blog-en/pages/about.html"&gt;on the "about" 
page&lt;/a&gt;) are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a secondary plot 
&lt;a href="https://rinzewind.org/blog_files/pelican_images/2021_10_remote_jobs_hn_02.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; 
that displays the raw number of postings (total and remote).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caveats, and why this is just an approximation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The script works by retrieving all first-level comments in the monthly &lt;em&gt;Who's 
  hiring&lt;/em&gt; post and assumes that every one is a job offer. That might not be the 
  case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These posts should comply with some formatting rules, specially regarding the 
  first line. The script only looks at the first line and checks if the word 
  "remote" is present, nothing more sophisticated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The script is also not checking if the job specifically says that remote is 
  &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an option in the first line, or whether there are geographical / time 
  restrictions (e.g. only Pacific time +/- N hours, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;

observations.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Original question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Dell Vostro 15 3000 running (X)Ubuntu 18.04. It's been working well, 
but yesterday I noticed the Bluetooth icon missing from the taskbar and started 
investigating why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue seems to be that the Bluetooth device my computer has is gone. This is 
a normal startup log, or at least what I understand to be normal, from 
&lt;code&gt;kern.log&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Jan  &lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;:24:15 serenity kernel: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;.593120&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Bluetooth: Core ver &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;.22
Jan  &lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;:24:15 serenity kernel: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;.593130&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; NET: Registered protocol family &lt;span class="m"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
Jan  &lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;:24:15 serenity kernel: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;.593131&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Bluetooth: HCI device and connection manager initialized
Jan  &lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;:24:15 serenity kernel: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;.593134&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Bluetooth: HCI socket layer initialized
Jan  &lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;:24:15 serenity kernel: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;.593135&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Bluetooth: L2CAP socket layer initialized
Jan  &lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;:24:15 serenity kernel: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;.593136&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Bluetooth: SCO socket layer initialized
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yesterday this appeared in the logs upon startup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Jan &lt;span class="m"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;09&lt;/span&gt;:31:51 serenity kernel: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="m"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;.944964&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Bluetooth: hci0: &lt;span class="nb"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; 0x0c52 tx timeout
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After this happened, no more Bluetooth. I tried restarting, I tried an older 
kernel, I double-checked the Bluetooth is activated in the BIOS, I tried loading 
manually the necessary kernel modules. I've listed those using a similar laptop 
I have, and are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;bluetooth             &lt;span class="m"&gt;544768&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt; btrtl,btintel,btbcm,bnep,btusb,rfcomm
ecdh_generic           &lt;span class="m"&gt;16384&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; bluetooth
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, it's like the device is not there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this started showing up in kern.log now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Jan &lt;span class="m"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;:13:34 serenity kernel: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;.768790&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; usb &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;-10: device descriptor read/64, error -71
Jan &lt;span class="m"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;:13:34 serenity kernel: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;.004853&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; usb &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;-10: device descriptor read/64, error -71
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm absolutely puzzled. The problem looks very similar to the one posted 
&lt;a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=193813"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I've tried resetting the device and it doesn't work. The laptop 
has been off all night and the device is still missing. If anyone could point me 
in the right direction I'd be grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ lsusb

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;No Bluetooth device there. Also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ rfkill list
&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;: phy0: Wireless LAN
    Soft blocked: no
    Hard blocked: no
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Additional details and solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, it looks like the Bluetooth device is gone and my Linux system sees 
an unknown USB device instead. I tried booting up with a Fedora 32 USB stick I 
had lying around and I could see exactly the same messages in the logs, so it 
looked like it wasn't a software problem. I also tried disabling the Bluetooth 
in the BIOS, then enabling it again after a reboot; this didn't fix the problem 
either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I found the solution in &lt;a href="https://www.dell.com/community/Inspiron/Bluetooth-gone-G3/td-p/7405868"&gt;this discussion in the Dell support 
forums&lt;/a&gt;, which detail pretty much the same issue I was reporting. One thing I 
hadn't tried was to shut the computer off &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; unplug the battery. I did 
that, and the next reboot brought the Bluetooth device back to life.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">José María Mateos</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 08:57:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:rinzewind.org,2021-01-24:/blog-en/2021/bluetooth-device-gone-and-back-in-dell-vostro-with-ubuntu-1804.html</guid><category>Blog</category></item><item><title>Against the outrage economy: a proposal</title><link>https://rinzewind.org/blog-en/2020/against-the-outrage-economy-a-proposal.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Internet &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; (be it a news article, a song, a thirty-second clip, etc) is 
mostly paid for by advertising. While subscription models do indeed exist and 
there is a gradation to them&lt;sup id="fnref:paid"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:paid"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, they are still a minority. Terms like 
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism"&gt;&lt;em&gt;surveillance capitalism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; should surprise absolutely no one at 
this point. The classical example are social media users, who not only work to 
keep the machine running by providing content for free, but at the same time 
generate information, either directly or in more subtle, second-order ways, that 
is processed to provide advertisers with optimal matches, so that they can place 
their advertisements in front of interested customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key here, from the businesses' point of view, is &lt;em&gt;user engagement&lt;/em&gt;, or how 
much time a given user spends on a given site. Taking this to the analog (or 
formerly analog) world, remember that &lt;a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/tape-shows-ethically-cnn-chief-a"&gt;Trump is very good for news 
networks&lt;/a&gt;. Anything that keeps the largest amount of people glued to 
the screen for the longest period of time helps achieve the best possible 
outcome, at least according to some metrics. This is why YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/down-youtubes-recommendation-rabbithole"&gt;is a rabbit 
hole&lt;/a&gt; and why the &lt;a href="https://novaramedia.com/2020/07/31/outrage-drives-clicks-rage-sells-stories-the-brutal-economy-of-the-culture-war/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;outrage economy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; works. No one will 
complain if a network is turned into a cesspool as long as the quarterly earning 
reports go in the &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, by design, there is a lack of context in this system. &lt;em&gt;User engagement&lt;/em&gt; is 
typically measured in time, but there are no emotional tags attached to that 
interaction window: a person was looking at our site for 5 minutes, but we do 
not know anything about the quality of those 5 minutes. Was the person reading 
articles that were making her be happier? Did she reach those articles because a 
friend &lt;a href="https://www.jamescullenthewriter.com/post/2019/10/22/does-posting-social-media-content-for-hate-shares-work"&gt;hate-shared&lt;/a&gt; them, and is probably having a negative reaction? This 
is not important because it runs counter to the basic premise: more &lt;em&gt;engagement&lt;/em&gt; 
leads to more ads being shown, so it has to be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Hence, the Trump effect 
that we mentioned above, etc. Any other consideration is 
secondary&lt;sup id="fnref:externality"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:externality"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, companies (and therefore advertisers) do care about the 
context&lt;sup id="fnref:friedman"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:friedman"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; there can be such a thing as bad publicity. We know that in 
the past ads have been pulled from YouTube videos due to concerns about certain 
content (see for instance, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/20/companies-including-nestle-epic-and-reportedly-disney-suspend-youtube-ads-over-child-exploitation-concerns/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/googles-ad-crisis-reaches-the-us-1513301112-d9d2792c-256d-4c36-9c41-b36b8a528b72.html"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;), and the same goes for 
&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/01/tech/facebook-top-advertisers/index.html"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/unilever-pauses-facebook-and-twitter-advertising-for-rest-of-2020-due-to-polarized-atmosphere-in-us.html"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. These are blanket bans because the 
granularity that typical ad management systems provide (allow or deny ad sales 
for certain keywords, geolocations, etc) does not allow to filter for the 
emotional aspect. Companies might still want to keep their advertisements up if 
they are shown along content that is not perceived as negative by the eyeballs 
being sold to the other side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, there is no way to signal our intentions when sharing a link. Every 
share is assumed to be neutral, but we know it is not. Plenty of traffic is 
driven by people that link to news articles, retweet tweets or share posts with
negative comments attached to them; other users in their immediate social circle 
will see in a very similar light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years back, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_in_blogs"&gt;blog spam&lt;/a&gt; was a problem&lt;sup id="fnref:blogproblem"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:blogproblem"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: automated 
bots took over the comment systems of popular blogging software and kept posting 
links to the websites of whoever was controlling them with the purpose of 
altering their rank in search engines. After a while, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rel=nofollow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
was proposed as a solution: it signaled search engines that they should not take 
those links into account when computing the importance of the target pages. 
After a time, most if not all blog engines automatically included this tag in 
comment links. It was a technical solution, but also an economic one: it was 
designed to lower the profitability of spammers' methods by not letting their 
pages appear among the first search results. &lt;a href="http://taint.org/2006/05/31/111003a.html"&gt;It did not end the 
problem&lt;/a&gt;, but it was something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal I am presenting here works in a similar way. Users should be able 
to tag content that is being shared in a negative light, so that advertisers on 
the target page know that they would be placing their products in an adverse 
context; under these conditions, perhaps they would prefer not to bid for any ad 
at all. It is not technology, but business logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would someone use this? Let's take a look at the incentives here: users 
would use this to &lt;em&gt;starve the beast&lt;/em&gt;, knowing that now they can link to media 
sites or articles they do not like with the expectation that visits coming from 
their links will not be monetized. Advertisers would be better off, as this 
would help them to better allocate resources. &lt;em&gt;Content&lt;/em&gt; sites (for instance, 
newspapers) might take a look at the type of articles they are publishing. 
Lastly, social media sites would absolutely be delighted with the idea&lt;sup id="fnref:not"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:not"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as 
it would help their stated purpose of bringing communities together in peace and 
love and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot would need to change for this to happen. Interfaces would need to change 
(&lt;em&gt;"I am hate-sharing / mocking / joining the mob here"&lt;/em&gt;); browsers would need to 
recognize whatever tagging system is used to send the proper headers over to the 
target page; ad systems would have to recognize this and let their clients 
record their preferences when this tag is present; users would need to 
understand why this is an option and what effects it has, etc. I am not saying 
this would be an easy thing and I'm not offering any particular implementation 
details, mostly because I just have a high-level diagram in my head, but having 
the idea out there in written form cannot hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a better solution would be for people to stop contributing to the 
outrage, but that would be asking them to &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.2402v1.pdf"&gt;stop being humans&lt;/a&gt;, so it 
is not even a starting point. This proposal offers a way out: you can still 
share that thing you want to mock, and at the same time you can send a signal 
that ad money spent on any resulting traffic would probably we wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:paid"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is for instance the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;, which is completely 
  closed to non-subscribers; mini-subscription services such as &lt;a href="https://www.substack.com"&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt;, 
  which allow some content to be posted in the open; newspapers like the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com"&gt;New 
  York Times&lt;/a&gt;, which allow a certain number of articles to be read for free 
  every month, etc.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:paid" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:externality"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;meaning that someone else will hopefully deal with the resulting 
  mess.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:externality" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:friedman"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a more cynical approach (thanks, Milton Friedman) is that companies 
  (should pretend to) care about what consumers think they should care about, if 
  and only if that can potentially impact the bottom line. It would be the 
  sister theory for Keynes' &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest"&gt;&lt;em&gt;beauty contest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:friedman" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:blogproblem"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when blogs ruled the Earth.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:blogproblem" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:not"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:not" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/i6lzx3/good_password_hygiene/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; 
on a subreddit I frequent and I thought I might as well publish it here. The 
context is some CRA accounts (the Canadian tax agency) being breached using 
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing"&gt;password stuffing&lt;/a&gt;. Password 
reuse is a bad thing; site A gets breached and then someone has a list of our 
credentials that might work somewhere else. A password manager mitigates this 
greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, the original text, with small corrections and additions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always use a password manager. It can be a paid one, like 
   &lt;a href="https://1password.com/"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.lastpass.com/"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;, 
   or something you keep locally, like &lt;a href="https://keepassxc.org/"&gt;KeepassXC&lt;/a&gt; and 
   then you sync it with your devices using Dropbox, Drive or similar. I use 
   this second option. Then create a new password for every site you register 
   to. Use the random password generator, never type it yourself. This is one 
   generated just now, as an example: &lt;em&gt;P0QNcP~Z|iw~5Q.H/(m&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to repeat: never reuse a password. If you use the same password on site 
   A and site B and site A gets breached, they'll also get access to site B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never, never, NEVER use true answers to the security questions. They're 
   easy-ish to guess, speciall for people with social media accounts. Instead, 
   use your password manager to store the answers and treat them as a second 
   password. They can be easier than the main password just in case you need to 
   spell them on the phone. Just hammer the keyboard. Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the name of your first pet? aumg345890&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activate 2FA when possible. Also, don't use SMS for that if given the option; 
   it's better use an app on the phone like Authy, or you can also use your 
   password manager to store these codes, most allow you to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you go this way never forget the password to your password 
   manager (edit: and make sure to make this password robust; for this you can 
   also use sequences of words as passwords, they're easier to remember. Example 
   &lt;a href="http://www.egansoft.com/password/index.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;); but it's pretty much the 
   only password you'll have to remember. If you use KeepassXC, make sure to 
   make an offline copy of your DBs from time to time. It's some work, yes, but 
   it's more work to have your bank / CRA account breached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
