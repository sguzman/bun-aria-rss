Anthony and Squeaks find out how you can put telescopes in different places to help you see further away and get better pictures of things in space!

K-2 Next Generation Science Standards

Disciplinary Core Ideas:

ETS1.A : Defining and Delimiting Engineering Problems - A situation that people want to change or create can be approached as a problem to be solved through engineering (K-2-ETS1-1).

ETS1.C: Optimizing the Design Solution - Because there is always more than one possible solution to a problem, it is useful to compare and test designs (K-2-E TS 1-3).

Performance Expectations:

K-2-ETS1-1 Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change to define a simple problem that can be solved through the development of a new or improved object or tool.

K-2-ETS1-3 Analyze data from tests of two objects designed to solve the same problem to compare the strengths and weaknesses of how each performs

If you were looking down at the Earth from space, what would you be able to see? Do you think you would be able to see your house? What if you were super far away?

Second Grade Next Generation Science Standards

Disciplinary Core Ideas:

ESS2.B: Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System Interactions - Maps show where things are located. One can map the shapes and kinds of land and water in any area. (2-ESS2-2)

ESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth’s Surface Processes - Water is found in the ocean, rivers, lakes, and ponds. Water exists as solid ice and in liquid form. (2-ESS2-3)


Performance Expectations:

2-ESS2-2 Develop a model to represent the shapes and kinds of land and bodies of water in an area.
 
2-ESS2-3 Obtain information to identify where water is found on Earth and that it can be solid or liquid

   <media:description>Teachers and parents: scroll down to check out the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for this episode!

Living in space is pretty different from living on Earth, and not just because people can float around! Today, Jessi and Sam the Bat learn about the weird ways things like fire and water behave when they are in space.

Next Generation Science Standards

Crosscutting Concept:

Patterns: Observed patterns in nature guide organization and classification and prompt questions about relationships and causes underlying them.

Next Generation Science Standards

Crosscutting Concept:

Cause and Effect: Events have causes, sometimes simple, sometimes multifaceted. Deciphering causal relationships, and the mechanisms by which they are mediated, is a major activity of science and engineering.
