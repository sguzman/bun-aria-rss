			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome the first guest to Probably a Podcast: Jalen Noble. You might recognize him from Love Island, Tik Tok, or quite possibly just his abs in general. What the girls thought was going to be a sex filled podcast instead turned into a straight up EMOTIONAL knowledge atomic bomb. Jalen takes Shannon and AG to church on topics such as: Toxic masculinity, why therapy is cool, and how to validate your beginning, middle, and end of a breakup. Are we absolutely perplexed that someone as attractive as Jalen could also be this in touch with his emotions? Yes. Are we the problem because of that? Also yes. Tune into episode 9: THERAPY IS SEXY to learn more. </p>]]></description>

The girls discuss how AG nearly escapes death of the Gin variety and what sexual endeavors shouldn't be done while driving. Talking during sex? Into it. Talking to your penis out loud after sex? Ehhhh. Shannon has yet another Raya story but this one was less interested in her and more into her medical record. Which hit show's leading man did she cross paths with in New York? How to say F U to a man who belittles your career and which red flags they've experienced and fallen for in the past. All of this and more explained in "The Streets Don't Wait" </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 3 dives into Shannon's trip to New York and all the antics that went along with it. Anna Grace is back and boofin' about her school spirited nudes, quaalude-like illness, and her knowledge on footjobs. The girls discuss a time Shannon took her sexting talent too far and the difference between being ghosted or weasled. Is it irresponsible to be a horrible kisser when you're extremely hot?
