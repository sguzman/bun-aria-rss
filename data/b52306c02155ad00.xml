He can go back and go, “That was a great moment.” But the artist’s got to go, “No, I was there.” It’s like, history is something that happens. You can’t be there at history. </i><i><br /></i> <i>— Julian Cope, May 10, 1991</i></p>
<p>It’s May of 1991. Deirdre is in London, chatting backstage with post-punk indie underground legend <strong>Julian Cope. </strong>Cope has just released “Peggy Suicide,” one of the most ambitious and successful albums of his career. And while Deirdre’s in town, they’re hatching plans for Julian to appear on “SNAP!”</p>
<p>But just days after that announcement, “SNAP!” was off the air. Deirdre left KCRW for good in June of 1991. Then she left LA, too, for a while.<br />The following year, she showed up in rural England to live with Cope and his family. Cope joins Bent By Nature to recount their unique relationship and roles in each other’s lives.<br /><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“There were moments when R.E.M., my former band, were hugely popular,” says ex-singer <strong>Michael Stipe</strong>. “And we were able to really push the boundaries of what's acceptable within mainstream culture.

                <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s September 4, 1986. And Deirdre has just met a kindred spirit in singer <strong>Syd Straw.</strong> Like Deirdre, Syd traveled in good company. You could pick out her voice on records by <strong>Los Lobos, Rickie Lee Jones, Was (Not Was), </strong>and more. As an early member of the indie supergroup <strong>The Golden Palominos</strong>, she was a feature on Deirdre’s playlists long before she became a regular guest.</p>
<p>Most artists that appeared on “SNAP!” will tell you how comfortable Deirdre made them feel. That absolutely resulted in fantastic on-air performances. But Syd and Deirdre took that to a whole new level. If Deirdre had an official partner-in-crime, it was Syd Straw, who appeared on the show five times. She would sing with a band, or over backing tapes that she brought with her, or she would just guest DJ. And no topic was off limits. They had their own wild chemistry: funny, fearless, and more than a little bent.</p>
<p>In 1989, Syd struck out on a solo career which eventually took her to New York City. But even now, Syd is rich with memories of the pioneering DJ and friend whom she called “The Godmother.”</p>]]></description>
                <itunes:summary><![CDATA[It’s September 4, 1986. And Deirdre has just met a kindred spirit in singer Syd Straw. Like Deirdre, Syd traveled in good company. You could pick out her voice on records by Los Lobos, Rickie Lee Jones, Was (Not Was), and more. As an early member of the indie supergroup The Golden Palominos, she was a feature on Deirdre’s playlists long before she became a regular guest. 
 Most artists that appeared on “SNAP!” will tell you how comfortable Deirdre made them feel. That absolutely resulted in fantastic on-air performances. But Syd and Deirdre took that to a whole new level. If Deirdre had an official partner-in-crime, it was Syd Straw, who appeared on the show five times. She would sing with a band, or over backing tapes that she brought with her, or she would just guest DJ. And no topic was off limits. They had their own wild chemistry: funny, fearless, and more than a little bent.

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1979, "Rapper’s Delight" was released and went on to become the first Top 40 hip-hop single. Sugarhill Gang almost had no choice but to follow the single up with a full-length. So in the early months of 1980, a six song, nearly forty minute album by a rap group was released. The debut, self-titled album by the Sugarhill Gang wasn’t received without controversy, and wasn’t received without skepticism. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When one thinks about the greatest rap groups of all time, Sugarhill Gang might be an afterthought, says <span>Lost Notes host Hanif Abdurraqib</span>. But, sometimes, legacy is not about the spark itself, but about the flame the spark causes.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

This one is about The Student Teachers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1977, a group of music obsessed friends got together and decided to form a band. Most of them were still in high school and almost none of them had even picked up an instrument before, but they lived and breathed the New York City music scene and wanted nothing more than to be a part of it. They worked in record stores, ran fan clubs, and spent every second they could together, hanging in clubs like CBGB’s and Max’s Kansas City — clubs they’d eventually headline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after they formed the band, they played a practice gig at one of their high schools and took off from there. They spent their days studying for physics tests and practicing for French finals and spent their nights drinking White Russians and rubbing elbows with their rock heroes.  In their two years together, they headlined their favorite clubs, went on tour, made recordings, got interviewed on the radio, opened for Iggy Pop and hung with David Bowie in the recording studio. As the decade came to a close and they got a little older, their love for each other dwindled, and the band imploded. But what a beautiful and wild ride it was. This is the story of the Student Teachers, in their own words. </span></p>]]></description>
