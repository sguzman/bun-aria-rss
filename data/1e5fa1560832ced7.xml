    <title>We Can Do Hard Things with Glennon Doyle</title>

    <description>I’m Glennon Doyle, author of Untamed, the book that was released at the very start of the pandemic and became a lifeline for millions. I watched in awe from my home while this simple phrase from Untamed – WE CAN DO HARD THINGS – the mantra that saved my life twenty years ago, became a worldwide rally cry.
Life is freaking hard. We are all doing hard things every day – we love and lose; we forge and end friendships; battle addiction, illness, and loneliness; care for children and parents; struggle in our jobs, our marriages, our divorces; we try to set and hold boundaries – and we fight for equality, purpose, joy, and peace right in the midst of all the hard.
On We Can Do Hard Things, my wife Abby Wambach, my sister Amanda Doyle, and I do the only thing that has ever made life easier: We talk honestly about the hard. We laugh and cry and help each other carry the hard so we can all live a little bit lighter and braver, free-er, less alone.</description>

      <title>Esther Perel: Love in War</title>
      <description>In this deeply intimate collaboration with beloved therapist Esther Perel, she dives deep in a couples therapy session with a Ukrainian couple torn apart by the war.

The wife is compelled to leave the country for the sake of her youngest son; the husband and older son are compelled to stay in the warzone for the sake of their country.

Miraculously, even amid unthinkable loss – and maybe especially amid unthinkable loss – love and connection are unrelenting.

Love does impossible things.

      <title>Sara Bareilles: How to Remember Yourself</title>
      <description>1. Abby shares with Sara the great personal impact Sara’s music has made on her life.
2. Sara and Glennon bond over the joy of solitude, the underrated gifts of being heavy-hearted, and the fact that “there are too many things to be worried about at all times” to be lighthearted.
3. When you are in deep stress, do you try to sabotage your job, relationship, etc.? (Before this conversation, Amanda thought it was just her.)
4. How playfulness and joy – connecting to the little kid who grew up into you – are vital to loving yourself. 
5. Sara’s beautiful journey with medication for depression and anxiety – and how she learned her anxiety often arises from an unexpressed need. 

About Sara:
Sara Bareilles is a Tony Award and Emmy Award nominated actor, and Grammy Award winning singer and songwriter.

On Broadway, Sara composed music and lyrics for Waitress, in which she was also the lead. Sara also produced original music and executive produced the musical drama series Little Voice. She plays Dawn Solano on the Emmy-nominated musical comedy series Girls5eva, and stars as The Baker’s Wife in the Broadway revival Into the Woods.

      <title>Alex Morgan: Believe in Your Own Greatness</title>
      <description>1. How the Abby+Alex sisterhood began, how hard it was for Alex to watch Abby suffer at the end of her career, and how friends can build each other up.
2. How to get back on the field – in life and in sport – after crushing defeat.
3. The way Alex’s mom helped Alex fulfill her dream, and what Alex is teaching her own daughter, Charlie.
4. How Alex finally stopped comparing herself to others and started resting in her own confidence.
5. Alex’s relationship with soccer – and does she still love it?

About Alex
Alex Morgan is a two-time FIFA Women’s World Cup Champion, Olympic Gold Medalist, UEFA Women’s Champions League Champion, and NWSL Champion. An entrepreneur, author, social media phenom, and marketing icon – Alex’s ability to inspire and excite fans stretches far beyond the pitch. She is the leading founder of TOGETHXR, a lifestyle and media company with a focus on youth and equality storytelling. As mom to Charlie, Alex is tackling motherhood while continuing to be a force on the pitch. In fact, I am not sure i’ve ever seen her as on fire right now, scoring goals at a wild rate for her NWSL team the San Diego Wave.

      <title>No More Grind: How to Finally Rest with Tricia Hersey</title>
      <description>1. The Nap Ministry’s Nap Bishop shares small, concrete ways to bring rest into our own lives – especially when rest seems impossible. 
2. Why so many of us feel like machines instead of humans – and the power of imagination as a spiritual practice to reconnect with our humanity and divinity.
3. Why grind culture – a collaboration of capitalism and white supremacy – wants to keep us exhausted, and how we can resist a culture of overwhelming busy-ness.  
4. Why everything changes when we embrace ease as our birthright. 
5. Creative ways to reimagine rest within our hectic daily lives. 

About Tricia
Tricia Hersey is a Chicago native who has called Georgia home for the last 12 years. She has over 20 years of experience as a multidisciplinary artist, writer, theologian and community organizer. She is the founder of The Nap Ministry, an organization that examines rest as a form of resistance and reparations by curating spaces for the community to rest via community rest activations, immersive workshops, performance art installations, and social media. Her research interests include Black liberation theology, womanism, somatics, and cultural trauma. She is the author of the upcoming book Rest is Resistance: A Manifesto which will be published in October 2022. You can learn more about her work and the book at thenapministry.com.

      <title>CARE-FRONTATIONS: Three Keys for Giving &amp; Receiving Criticism</title>
      <description>1. What happens inside us when we receive criticism–and how our brains ensure we’re always in the right (even when we’re not).
2. The three-ingredient recipe for a positive, productive “care-frontation” exchange.
3. The single biggest relationship killer (it’s not conflict) – and how conflict can bring you closer.
4. Amanda navigates a “care-frontation” with her son’s friend’s family – and Abby reevaluates her past relationship with criticism.

      <title>Indigo Girls: Sexuality, Sobriety, Faith &amp; Freedom</title>
      <description>1. Why Emily couldn’t stop crying (and it wasn’t because she was emotional).
2. The intervention that got Emily sober – and why Amy wasn’t there.
3. Glennon admits something that she’s never told anyone before.
4. Amy and Abby agree on the shared cost of internalized homophobia and misogyny.

About Indigo Girls:
One of the most successful folk duos in history – Amy Ray and Emily Sailers aka THE INDIGO GIRLS – has recorded 16 albums and sold over 15 million records.
Committed and uncompromising activists, they work on issues like immigration reform, LGBTQ advocacy, education, and death penalty reform. They are co-founders of Honor the Earth, a non-profit dedicated to the survival of sustainable Native communities, Indigenous environmental justice, and green energy solutions.
Their latest record, Look Long is a stirring and eclectic collection of songs that finds Indigo Girls reunited in the studio with their strongest backing band to date.

      <title>Christen Press: How to Get Your Bliss Back</title>
      <description>1. The moment Abby – as Christen’s USWNT roommate – walked into their hotel room and knew Christen was very different than any soccer player she’d ever known. 
2. The boundary that helps Christen love her people while protecting herself.
3. Christen’s take on death and how to keep the people we’ve lost alive in our lives.
4. How to show our people (including our little athletes) that we love them for who they are, not what they achieve.
5. The day Christen knew she was ready to fight for – and win – pay equity for the US Women’s National Team. 

About Christen:
Christen Press is a two-time World Cup Champion and Olympian, as well as a leading forward at Los Angeles Angel City FC. An entrepreneur and advocate for inclusivity, Christen, along with US Women’s National teammates – Megan Rapinoe, Tobin Heath, and Meghan Klingenberg – launched their company re—inc, a purpose-driven, global lifestyle brand. Christen was one of the key players leading the charge for the “Equal Play, Equal Pay” campaign to highlight the pay discrepancy between the women’s and men’s national teams, which led to the new CBA agreement – and to her role as Player Representative for the US Women's National Team Players Association.

      <title>How to Say No: Boundaries with Nedra Glover Tawwab</title>
      <description>1. Five signs that you might have a boundary problem.
2. Why each of us should stop pretending we’re not a needy person.
3. How to stop arguing like a lawyer – and start communicating like a kindergartener – to get what you need. 
4. How to know when to end an argument, how to exit a friendship, and how to respond to passive aggressiveness. 

About Nedra:
Nedra Glover Tawwab, MSW, LCSW, is a New York Times best-selling author, licensed therapist, and sought-after relationship expert. She has practiced relationship therapy for 15 years and is the founder and owner of the group therapy practice, Kaleidoscope Counseling. Every day she helps people create healthy relationships by teaching them how to implement boundaries. Her philosophy is that a lack of boundaries and assertiveness underlie most relationship issues, and her gift is helping people create healthy relationships with themselves and others.

      <title>How to Love Your Body Now with Carson Tueller </title>
      <description>1. The question Carson’s sister asked that made him radically reimagine his life.  
2. Why Carson is having the best sex of his life.
3. How Carson received sign-off from his Mormon Bishop for his first queer date.  
4. The accident that left Carson paralyzed from the chest down at 23.
5. How ableism hurts us all.  

About Carson: 
Carson Tueller is a coach, speaker and activist whose work provides people with the tools they need to live authentic, fulfilling, and powerful lives. He identifies as queer and disabled.  Carson grew up as a Mormon in a military family moving around a lot before settling in Utah.  His own journey into powerful living began in 2013 when, in the same year, he came out, and was then injured in an accident that paralyzed him from the chest down. Since then, Carson has brought his work to international nonprofits and presidential campaigns – and when he isn’t coaching or speaking, Carson can be found at the gym, reading non-fiction, or playing Pokemon with his niece and nephews.

      <title>Chelsea Handler: On Breaking Up &amp; Being Unbreakable</title>
      <description>Chelsea Handler comes to We Can Do Hard Things to talk for the first time about her breakup with Jo Koy, her definition of real love, and her commitment to never abandon herself. 

About Chelsea:
Chelsea Handler is a comedian, television host, best-selling author and advocate whose humor and candor have established her as one of the most celebrated voices in entertainment and pop culture. She was the host of E!’s top-rated “Chelsea Lately”, a tenure in which Handler was the only female late-night talk show host on-air. Her documentary series “Chelsea Does” was followed by her talk show “Chelsea” on Netflix in 2016. 

She has penned six best-selling books, five of which have reached #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list, including 2019’s Life Will Be the Death of Me. In 2020, she released her first stand-up special in over 6 years, the critically acclaimed “Chelsea Handler: Evolution” on HBO Max, which earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Comedy Album. 

Most recently, she launched her iHeart Radio advice podcast “Dear Chelsea” and embarked on the “Vaccinated and Horny” Tour, bringing her sensational stand-up set to 40+ cities across the nation and winning “The Comedy Act of 2021” at the People’s Choice Awards.

      <title>The Time Glennon &amp; Abby Called It Off – and Live Pod Squad Q&amp;A! </title>
      <description>1. How horrifying advice from a therapist led Glennon to end things with Abby–and how they reconnected.
2. The moments from past episodes that changed us–including Amanda’s new strategy to prevent her anxiety from creating relationship problems.
3. How we decide what to share publicly and what not to–and why we think the dichotomy of “sacred things” versus “private things” is dangerous.                
4. Simple guidance to a man who asks how to stand in the fight for women’s rights, a question from 68-year-old Donna that we can’t stop thinking about, and the story of Tish’s We Can Do Hard Things song.

      <title>Natalie Portman: How to Know When to Say YES</title>
      <description>1. The moment Natalie called Abby to invite her to be part of Angel City FC–the first majority, women-owned soccer franchise.
2. How to stop people-pleasing and learn to recognize a full body YES from inside of you.
3. Why and how Natalie shows up for big projects before she’s ready or qualified. (Dude Moves).
4. The best advice Natalie’s ever received–and why women should “Gossip Well.”
5. How Natalie counters gender expectations by over practicing empathy with her son and decisiveness with her daughter.
6. What Natalie says when a man suggests a woman is “crazy” or “difficult.”

About Natalie:
Natalie Portman is an Academy award-winning actress (BLACK SWAN), director, author, and activist. In Summer 2022, Portman will be hitting the big screen, returning to the Marvel universe as ‘Jane Foster’ in THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER.

Previously Natalie appeared in Pablo Larraín’s film, JACKIE, in which she starred as First Lady Jacqueline F. Kennedy. For the role, Portman was nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and won the Critics’ Choice Award. She wrote, directed, produced, and starred in A TALE OF LOVE AND DARKNESS, which made its world premiere at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and its North American premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. Other past film credits include Noah Hawley’s LUCY IN THE SKY, Brady Corbet’s VOX LUX, and Alex Garland’s highly anticipated second feature, ANNIHILATION.

Natalie and her producing partner Sophie Mas recently inked a first-look TV deal with Apple TV+ for their production company MounatainA. Through this deal, they are producing the Apple Original limited series LADY IN THE LAKE, which will be Natalie’s TV acting debut. Natalie’s other past production credits include the documentary EATING ANIMALS, which she executive produced and narrated. The film examines mankind’s dietary choices and is based on Jonathan Safran Foer’s memoir.

In addition to her film work, Portman devotes her time to several humanitarian causes, with an emphasis on supporting women and girls. She is also a founder of National Women’s Soccer League team Angel City Football Club.

In Fall 2020, Portman released her debut picture book, NATALIE PORTMAN’S FABLES, which is a New York Times’ Bestseller.

Portman is a Harvard graduate with a degree in psychology and studied at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

      <title>Why Grief – like Love – is Forever with Marisa Renee Lee</title>
      <description>1. Practical tips for guiding friends and family through your grief–and the permission slips to give yourself.
2. Why there is no such thing as grief etiquette–and how it’s less about what you say and more about what you do.
3. What it finally took for Marisa to surrender to the fact that she was not in control of her love or her grief. 
4. How to integrate love and grief in order to find joy again after loss–and how, 12 years after her mother’s death, Marisa includes her mom in her son’s life.
5. The life-changing perspective shift that Marisa gained from a conversation with Trayvon Martin’s mother Sybrina Fulton.

About Marisa:
Marisa Renee Lee is a called upon grief advocate, entrepreneur, and author of the upcoming book “Grief is Love.”

Deemed “the friend we all wish we had in times of need,” by Elaine Welteroth, Marisa is able to utilize research-based advice and wisdom to help others navigate the complicated and challenging emotions we face when experiencing loss, offering unique insights for women and Black communities.

She is no stranger to grief herself. In 2008, after a lengthy battle, she lost her mother to cancer. Shortly after, she lost her fertility, a pregnancy, and most recently, a cousin to the COVID-19 pandemic. These losses transformed her life and led her to question what healing truly requires outside the limited roadmap often handed to us by societal expectations. In the end, Marisa found that if we can own and honor what we've lost, we can have a beautiful and joyful life amid grief.

In addition to her work in the grief space, Lee is a former appointee in the Obama White House and CEO of Beacon Advisors, a mission-driven consulting firm primarily focused on racial equity. She is a rabble-rouser of social healing: former managing director of My Brother's Keeper Alliance; co-founder of the digital platform Supportal; and founder of The Pink Agenda, a national organization dedicated to raising money for breast cancer care, research, and awareness.

Lee also regularly contributes to Glamour, Vogue, MSNBC, and CNN and serves as an expert for Ritual's wellbeing app. She is a Harvard graduate and an avid home cook. Marisa lives in the Washington DC area with her husband Matt, their newborn son Bennett, and their dog, Sadie.

      <title>How to Survive This Absurd Life with Samantha Irby</title>
      <description>1. Sam’s life-changing strategies for (reluctantly) interacting with humans.
2. How we use humor to hide the lava of rage churning beneath our surface.
3. Sam’s friendship theory and why she doesn’t need a deep soul connection with every “lowercase f friend.”
4. Sam’s embrace of JOMO (Joy of Missing Out)–and why she genuinely believes no one else is having a better time (except maybe Abby).
5. The behind-the-scenes story of the “Fat Babe Pool Party” Shrill show–and why that episode was one of the most important things she’s ever written.

About Samantha:
Samantha Irby writes the "Bitches Gotta Eat" blog, and is the author of WOW, NO THANK YOU; WE ARE NEVER MEETING IN REAL LIFE; and MEATY. She has been a writer and/or co-producer for TV shows including And Just Like That, Work in Progress, Shrill, and Tuca &amp; Bertie.

      <title>Billie Jean King: Abby’s Hero Shares Her Hardest Battle</title>
      <description>1. How Billie Jean could not live as her full authentic self until age 51.
2. The moment Billie Jean knew that Abby was not okay after her USWNT retirement. 
3. How to visualize a reality that doesn’t yet exist – so you can be it, even when you don’t see it. 
4. How Billie Jean numbed herself through an eating disorder and how she recovered by not being a “good girl.” 
5. Why Billie Jean does not regret her pre-Roe abortion, and the degrading process she endured to access it. 

CW // eating disorders discussion
 
About Billie Jean: 
Named one of the “100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century” by Life magazine and a 2009 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Billie Jean King is the founder of the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative, founder of the Women’s Tennis Association and the Women’s Sports Foundation and part of the ownership group of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Angel City FC and the Philadelphia Freedoms. King also serves on the board of the Women’s Sports Foundation.

In her legendary tennis career, King captured 39 Grand Slam singles, doubles and mixed doubles titles, including a record 20 Wimbledon championships. Her historic win over Bobby Riggs in the 1973 Battle of the Sexes, is one of the greatest moments in sports history. In 2017, Fox Searchlight released the critically acclaimed film, Battle of the Sexes, which depicts the cultural and social impact of the groundbreaking match. 

In September 2020, King became the first woman to have an annual global team sports event named in her honor when Fed Cup – the women’s world cup of tennis – was rebranded as the Billie Jean King Cup. Her memoir, ALL IN: An Autobiography, is available now.

      <title>Astrology: Your Sign’s Secrets with Heidi Rose Robbins</title>
      <description>1. How Heidi ruined Glennon’s life with a jarring new identity–and why it’s a powerful moment for G to embrace her newfound sign.
2. How we each have a Sun, Moon, and Rising sign–and what each tells us about ourselves.
3. Heidi breaks down the 12 astrological signs–and astrology as a tool for self revelation.
4. Why we keep saying “Mercury’s in retrograde” and what the hell it means.

About Heidi:
Heidi Rose Robbins has been a professional astrologer for 25 years, helping thousands of clients all over the globe live with more authenticity and clarity. She hosts two podcasts, THE RADIANCE PROJECT, featuring poetry, astrology, and good company, and CHART YOUR CAREER, with co-host Ellen Fondiler. Twice a year, she leads Radiant Life Retreats, for people wishing to take a deeper dive into her work.

Heidi has written two books of poetry, This Beckoning Ceaseless Beauty and Wild Compassion, and has been a featured poet at two TedX events. Last year, her 12-book series The Zodiac Love Letters, was published by One Idea Press, and this upcoming fall, her new book, Everyday Radiance--based on her daily Instagram offerings--will be published by Chronicle.

Heidi grew up in Fargo, North Dakota, learning the zodiac with her A, B, C’s, and calls herself “a poet with a map of the heavens in her pocket.”

She lives in Los Angeles with her husband and two kids, Kate and Dylan.

      <title>Restart Your Sex Life with Dr. Lori Brotto</title>
      <description>1. Answers to fascinating sex questions from Pod Squaders–including how to get real in the bedroom after regularly faking orgasm.
2. Concrete mindfulness strategies to get out of your head and into your body, which have been proven to increase arousal and satisfaction.
3. Busting the myth about how long it should take to orgasm. 
4. Why talking about sex (including fantasies!) before having sex leads to more satisfying intimacy–and why that feels fun for Abby and impossible to Glennon and Amanda.
5. Where to start if you’ve never discussed pleasure with a partner–and Dr. Brotto’s advice to Glennon for retiring her reign as Silent Sex Queen.
About Dr. Brotto
Dr. Lori Brotto is a Professor in the UBC Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, where she holds a Canada Research Chair in Women’s Sexual Health. She is also the Executive Director for the Women’s Health Research Institute—one of only three institutes in Canada devoted to advancing research in women’s health, and maintains an active practice as a Registered Psychologist. Dr. Brotto was recently featured in the Netflix series The Principles of Pleasure, and is the author of Better Sex through Mindfulness: How Women Can Cultivate Desire and forthcoming The Better Sex through Mindfulness Workbook: A Guide to Cultivating Desire.

      <description>1. The shocking revelation that many women experience physical arousal but can’t reach orgasm because we are so “stuck” in our heads that we don’t even register it.
2. Glennon and Abby share about their periodic sexual droughts – and Dr. Brotto gives them (us) advice.
3. The biggest predictors of sexual problems for women – including stress/compulsive multitasking – and how to address them.
4. How to know if you are disconnecting from your body during sex, and how to reintegrate to increase your pleasure.

      <title>How to Be More Alive with Cole Arthur Riley </title>
      <description>In this beautiful conversation–in which Glennon names Cole’s book “This Here Flesh” the Next Right Book–we discuss: 
1. What we learned from Cole’s insight that, “If you’re not in your body, someone else is.” 
2. A mind-blowing revelation about all of our own faces that we will never stop thinking about. 
3. Why the phrase “If you don’t believe you’re beautiful, no one else will” is horseshit.  
4. Why dignity is the bedrock to being alive–and how to find it when we haven’t been loved well. 
5. The connection between fear and awe–and how to practice wonder as a cure for despair. 

About Cole: 
Cole Arthur Riley is a writer and poet. She is the author of the NYT bestseller, This Here Flesh: Spirituality, Liberation, and the Stories that Make Us. Her writing has been featured in The Atlantic, Guernica, and The Washington Post. Cole is also the creator and writer of Black Liturgies, a project that integrates spiritual practice with Black emotion, Black literature, and the Black body.

1. Ashlyn and Ali’s wedding, their vision for queer marriage visibility, and Glennon’s top moments of their magical day.
2. Ashlyn and Abby’s friendship–why Ashlyn pulled Abby’s final game captain’s band out of the trash and what she plans to do with it.
3. Who made the first move, which one “knew” first, and how Ashlyn and Ali’s love story started with friendship and mixtapes.
4. Their hardest night with their newborn, how Ali neutralizes mom guilt, and what they want most for Sloane as she grows up.

      <title>How to Be the Boss of Yourself with Bozoma Saint John </title>
      <description>1. The inspiring pep talk Bozoma gives herself in the mirror – and why we might all want to start using it to rally ourselves.  
2. How to navigate the tightrope of corporate expectations for women: to be both self-assured and humble; both hard and soft. 
3. The revolutionary realization that you don’t have to be the savior of others – you can save yourself, too. 
4. How to know when to dig deep, and stay and fight for change – and when to stop digging and go – and the moment Bozoma knew it was time to leave Netflix.
5. Why our inability to forgive ourselves for wrong decisions keep us in bad situations – and how Boz’s “it’s not you, it’s me” philosophy can guide us out. 

About Bozoma: 
Bozoma Saint John is a Hall of Fame inducted Marketing Executive, author, entrepreneur, and general badass. Boz has led Global Consumer Marketing at Apple Music &amp; iTunes; she was Chief Brand Officer at Uber; and Global Chief Marketing Officer at Netflix. Boz is currently named #1 Most Influential CMO in the world by Forbes, and has been named one of Billboard’s Most Powerful Women in Music for 10 consecutive years.

In 2021, Harvard Business School published a multi-media case study on her career, titled “Leading with Authenticity and Urgency”; through which she developed and taught a program at the University aptly named “The Anatomy of a Badass.” Boz was named as an Ambassador for the African Diaspora and Special Envoy to the President of Ghana. In the Spring of 2023, Penguin Books will publish her memoir, “The Urgent Life.” Boz counts her highest achievement as being a mother to her 12 year old daughter, Lael.

      <title>Jenny Lawson is Broken (in the Best Possible Way)</title>
      <description>1. Content warning: Discussion of suicide.
2. Jenny puts words to her experience of ADD – "being a kitten on cocaine" – and her anxiety – seeing "rainbow fire.” 
3. How Jenny felt guilty for years about a way her mental illness impacted her mothering – only to later learn it was her child’s favorite memory.
4. The moment she decided to be honest about her struggles – and how sharing our awkwardness can save the world and cure our loneliness.

National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 800-273-8255

About Jenny:
Jenny Lawson is an award-winning humorist known for her great candor in sharing her struggle with mental illness. She's written four NYT bestsellers, including Let's Pretend This Never Happened (a mostly true memoir), Furiously Happy (A funny book about terrible things), You Are Here (An owner's manual for dangerous minds) and Broken (in the best possible way), which recently won the Goodreads Choice award for Best Humor of 2021. One of those books is a coloring book but she insists it still counts. She lives in Texas with her husband and child and would like to be your friend unless you're a real asshole.

      <title>How We’ll Save Our Kids From the Gun Lobby’s Greed with Shannon Watts</title>
      <description>1. Why guns are now the leading cause of death for American children and teens, and who is profiting from America’s suffering.
2. What to say today when your child leaves the house to help protect them from gun violence.
3. The lie our leaders are selling us about why they won’t pass the reforms that 90% of Americans want, and how one mom became the NRA’s biggest nightmare.
4. How to safeguard our kids from the negative impact of for-profit active shooter drills in schools. 

About Shannon:
Shannon Watts was a stay at home mother of five when she founded Moms Demand Action, the nation’s first and largest grassroots movement fighting against gun violence – and the most powerful counter-movement the gun lobby has ever faced. Moms Demand Action now has a chapter in every state and, with over 8 million supporters, is now larger than the National Rifle Association. For almost ten years, Moms Demand Action volunteers have stopped the NRA’s priority legislation in statehouses roughly 90 percent of the time, helped pass hundreds of gun safety laws across the country, changed corporate policies and educated Americans about secure gun storage. Shannon’s book, Fight Like a Mother: How a Grassroots Movement Took on the Gun Lobby and Why Women Will Change the World, is now available in paperback.

      <title>How to Live So We Can Die Peacefully with Death Doula Alua Arthur</title>
      <description>1. What Alua has learned about living well from the many people she’s helped walk home as a death doula. 
2. The “deathbed test” that guides her toward what is important and helps her stay present.
3. Alua eases Abby’s immense fear of death by sharing her glitter-wave vision.
4. The most surprising thing she wants us to know about death.
5. Concrete steps we can take now to help prepare ourselves–and our loved ones–for the inevitable.

About Alua:
Alua Arthur is a death doula, recovering attorney, and the founder of Going with Grace, a death doula training and end-of-life planning organization that exists to support people as they answer the question, “What must I do to be at peace with myself so that I may live presently and die gracefully?” Going with Grace works to improve and redefine the end-of-life experience for people rooted in every community using the individual lived experience as the foundation. Alua was a keynote speaker at EndWell 2019, and has been featured in the LA Times, Vogue, Refinery29, The Doctors, and InStyle. She is inspired by the gift of LIFE itself and is always on the quest for the best donuts and fried plantains!

      <title>Cameron Esposito: How to Save Your Damn Self</title>
      <description>Glennon and Abby welcome their dear friend Cameron Esposito to discuss:
1. Cameron’s brutiful relationship with her body–and how it feels playing a sexy TV role.
2. The way Cameron grew up using humor as self-defense and to become socially “valuable”–and the moment she wondered if comedy was no longer working for her. 
3. Why Cameron says she’s able to cry for the first time in 35 years. 
4. How as a gender-nonconforming queer kid, Cameron felt “overnoticed”–and how being a comedian allows her to “hide in plain sight."
5. The rule Cameron and Glennon made to help them become better at friendship.

CW: eating disorders

About Cameron:
Cameron Esposito is a queer, gender non-conforming standup comic, actor, writer and host.
As a standup, Cameron has headlined tours and festivals nationwide and internationally. As an actor and host, Cameron has been seen across television and film, appearing in big budget films and beloved Sundance indies, and on Netflix, HBO, NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, Starz, Comedy Central, Logo, TBS, IFC, E! and Cartoon Network. Cameron's podcast, Queery, features hour long conversations with some of the brightest luminaries in the LGBTQ+ community, including Emmy and Grammy winning performers, Olympians, politicians, even an astronaut. Cameron's writing has been published by The New York Times, Vulture/New York Magazine, Vanity Fair, Bon Appetit, Refinery29 and more. Cameron's first book, Save Yourself, was an instant bestseller and is available in paperback March of 2022.

      <title>Why Elizabeth Gilbert Disappeared &amp; What She Came Back to Say</title>
      <description>Part Two of our gorgeous conversation with Elizabeth Gilbert:
1. Liz describes Rayya’s death as “a fist fight”–and how Rayya went out swinging.
2. In the wake of Rayya’s death, how Liz grieved, and what helped.
3. Liz’s spiritual practices: communing with a higher power, her recovery community, and starting over.

About Elizabeth: 
Elizabeth Gilbert is author of the international bestseller, EAT PRAY LOVE, which has been translated into over thirty languages, and sold over 12 million copies worldwide. The book became so popular that Time Magazine named Elizabeth as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2010, Elizabeth published a follow-up to EAT PRAY LOVE called COMMITTED—an instant a #1 New York Times Bestseller, as well as BIG MAGIC: CREATIVE LIVING BEYOND FEAR. She is author of two novels: THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS, and CITY OF GIRLS. And she is the creator of the Onward Book Club, which takes place on her Instagram via a live chat, as a way of spotlighting, studying, and celebrating the work of Black women authors. 

Elizabeth divides her time between New York City, rural New Jersey, and everywhere else.

2. The moment Liz imploded her life as she knew it.
3. How, after a decade of friendship, Liz finally told Rayya that she was in love with her.
4. The brutal chaos of Rayya’s addiction at the end of her life–and what Liz had to do and say to protect herself.

      <title>Enneagram: What does your number say about you? with Ashton Whitmoyer-Ober</title>
      <description>1. What is your Enneagram number–and how does this ancient wisdom explain WHY you do what you do? 
2. Why Glennon *really* didn’t want to accept her Enneagram number, and how she finally saw herself clearly in it. 
3. How the Enneagram helps Amanda have much more compassion for herself–and how she uses it to understand common patterns in her marriage. 
4. Glennon and Amanda use the Enneagram to dissect what is *actually* going on in their conflicts, and how to make each other feel seen and understood.

About Ashton:
Ashton Whitmoyer-Ober is an author, public speaker, Community Psychologist, and certified Enneagram educator. With a desire to see relationships strengthened and people empowered, she created Enneagram Ashton in early 2019. She is the author of Enneagram for Relationships, The Two of Us: A Three Year Couples Journal, and The Enneagram Made Simple.

      <title>Brené Brown &amp; Barrett Guillen Sisters Double Date!!</title>
      <description>1. Brené and Barrett share their parenting strategy that Brené calls “the opposite of raising a child that’s full of shame.”
2. The family of origin roles that Brené (the Protector) and Barrett (the Peacekeeper) had to adjust in order to work together–and the two keys to working well with family.  
3. The ways in which a child who grows up living on eggshells becomes an adult who is fearful–and how that fear shows up differently for Brené, Barrett, Glennon, and Amanda.   
4. The hilarious moment when each sister confesses a secret that they fear the other believes about them–and we find out whether or not it’s true. 
5. How Brené and Barrett are walking through the grief of their mother’s sudden decline, and how they circle back when the stress of that grief makes them shitty to each other.  

About Brené: 
Dr. Brené Brown is a research professor at the University of Houston where she holds the Huffington Foundation Endowed Chair at The Graduate College of Social Work.She has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy, is the author of six #1 New York Times bestsellers, and is the host of the weekly podcasts Unlocking Us and Dare to Lead. 
Brené’s books have been translated into more than 30 languages and titles include: Dare to Lead, Braving the Wilderness, Rising Strong, Daring Greatly, and The Gifts of Imperfection. Most recently Brené collaborated with Tarana Burke to co-edit You Are Your Best Thing: Vulnerability, Shame Resilience, and the Black Experience. 
In her latest #1 New York Times bestseller, ATLAS OF THE HEART, which has been adapted for television and now streaming on HBO Max, she takes us on a journey through eighty-seven of the emotions and experiences that define what it means to be human. 
Brené lives in Houston, Texas, with her husband, Steve. They have two children, Ellen and Charlie.

About Barrett: 
Barrett Guillen is Chief of Staff for Brené Brown Education and Research Group. With her team, Barrett supports both Brené and the organization by helping to prioritize competing demands, managing relationships, and building connective tissue and strategy across all business initiatives. Barrett holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Kinesiology from the University of Houston. After more than a decade in education in the Texas Panhandle, Barrett and her family moved back to the Houston area to join Brene’s team in making the world a braver place. Having the opportunity to work with her sisters every day has been one of the great joys of her life. Outside the office, you can find Barrett spending time with her family (immediate and extended), enjoying her daughter’s games, eating her husband’s famous burgers, floating in the water (any water!), or on the pickle ball court.

      <title>Jen Hatmaker: What We Win When We Lose It All</title>
      <description>1. Jen describes the shock of losing her 26-year marriage overnight. 
2. How, looking back, Jen sees that she knew something was wrong in her relationship well before she “knew” something was wrong–and the moment she reached out to Glennon to share it for the first time.  
3. Why Jen’s friends told her she was a “human spotlight” and “cleanup crew” in her marriage–and the pain of realizing she was powerful in every role other than wife.  
4. How Jen convinced herself that her marriage was enough when in reality she felt like a pot of water slowly building to a boil. 
5. The common hell of being lonely inside of marriage–and why we won’t be fully honest with ourselves, our partners, or our friends about what we are most afraid of.  

About Jen: 
Jen Hatmaker is the New York Times bestselling author of For the Love and Fierce, Free, and Full of Fire, along with twelve other books. She hosts the award-winning For the Love podcast, is the delighted curator of the Jen Hatmaker Book Club, and leader of a tightly knit online community where she reaches millions of people each week.

      <itunes:summary>1. Jen describes the shock of losing her 26-year marriage overnight. 
2. How, looking back, Jen sees that she knew something was wrong in her relationship well before she “knew” something was wrong–and the moment she reached out to Glennon to share it for the first time.  
3. Why Jen’s friends told her she was a “human spotlight” and “cleanup crew” in her marriage–and the pain of realizing she was powerful in every role other than wife.  
4. How Jen convinced herself that her marriage was enough when in reality she felt like a pot of water slowly building to a boil. 
5. The common hell of being lonely inside of marriage–and why we won’t be fully honest with ourselves, our partners, or our friends about what we are most afraid of.

      <title>Mothers &amp; Sons with Ocean Vuong (and Chase Melton)</title>
      <description>Glennon’s son, Chase, joins Glennon for a special conversation with his hero, author Ocean Vuong, to discuss:

1. Chase shares with Ocean the impact his work has had in his life–and Glennon thanks Ocean for helping mother her son.
2. What Ocean learned from his mother about how to navigate being an Asian boy in America–and Glennon’s recognition that she did not prepare Chase for the same realities.
3. Ocean’s new book, Time is a Mother, and why watching his own mother die gave Ocean a deep empathy and connection to every person.
4. His relationship to maleness–and why Ocean is interested in “staying and complicating” masculinity.

About Ocean:
Ocean Vuong, author of the critically acclaimed poetry collection Night Sky with Exit Wounds, and the New York Times bestselling novel On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is a recipient of the 2019 MacArthur "Genius Grant" and the winner of the Whiting Award and the T. S. Eliot Prize. In Time Is a Mother, Ocean's newest poetry collection available now, he reckons with his mother’s death, embodying the paradox of sitting within grief while being determined to survive beyond it. His writings have been featured in The Atlantic, Harper's Magazine, The Nation, The New Republic, The New Yorker, and The New York Times. Born in Saigon, Vietnam, he currently lives in Northampton, Massachusetts.

Brené’s books have been translated into more than 30 languages and titles include: Dare to Lead, Braving the Wilderness, Rising Strong, Daring Greatly, and The Gifts of Imperfection. Most recently Brené collaborated with Tarana Burke to co-edit You Are Your Best Thing: Vulnerability, Shame Resilience, and the Black Experience.

      <title>Hannah Gadsby: How to Communicate Better</title>
      <description>1. Why Hannah describes her later-in-life Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis as “an exfoliation of shame.”
2. How neurodiversity affects Hannah’s relationships–and how she connects to the world through what’s “interesting” instead of what’s “important.”
3. Hannah’s revolutionary commitment to stop using self-deprecating humor about her body, sexuality, and gender–and why we might all consider the same commitment.
4. Why it’s easier for Hannah to share her personal stories “in bulk” on stage instead of one-on-one.
5. What it takes for Hannah to prepare for conversations–like ours on We Can Do Hard Things.

About Hannah:
Tasmania’s own Hannah Gadsby stopped stand-up comedy in its tracks with her multi-award-winning show, Nanette. When it premiered on Netflix in 2018, it left audiences captivated by her blistering honesty and her singular ability to take them from rolling laughter to devastated silence. Its release and subsequent Emmy and Peabody wins took Nanette (and Hannah) to the world. Hannah’s difficult second album (which was also her eleventh solo show) was named Douglas after her dog. Hannah walked Douglas around the world, selling out the Royal Festival Hall in London, the Opera House in Sydney and the Kennedy Center in DC, a sit-down run in New York and shows across the US, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Douglas covered Hannah’s autism diagnosis, moving beyond the trauma at the centre of Nanette and instead letting the world see the view from Hannah’s brain – one that sees the world differently but with breathtaking clarity. The show was an Emmy-nominated smash hit and is available throughout the world on Netflix, recorded in Los Angeles. 

Hannah Gadsby’s “overnight” success was more than ten years in the making, with her award-winning stand-up shows having been a fixture in festivals across Australia and the UK since 2009. She played a character called “Hannah” on the TV series Please Like Me and has hosted multiple art documentaries, inspired by her comedy art lectures. In 2022, Hannah’s first book Ten Steps to Nanette: A Memoir Situation was published by Ballantine, an imprint of Penguin Random House, in the United States, Atlantic in the UK, and Allen &amp; Unwin in Australia.

Hannah has done plenty of other things over the course of more than a decade in comedy, but that will do for now.

Hannah Gadsby’s “overnight” success was more than ten years in the making, with her award-winning stand-up shows having been a fixture in festivals across Australia and the UK since 2009. She played a character called “Hannah” on the TV series Please Like Me and has hosted multiple art documentaries, inspired by her comedy art lectures. In 2022, Hannah’s first book Ten Steps to Nanette: A Memoir Situation was published by Ballantine, an imprint of Penguin Random House, in the United States, Atlantic in the UK, and Allen &amp; Unwin in Australia.

Hannah has done plenty of other things over the course of more than a decade in comedy, but that will do for now.

        <![CDATA[<p>1. Why Hannah describes her later-in-life Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis as “an exfoliation of shame.”</p><p>2. How neurodiversity affects Hannah’s relationships–and how she connects to the world through what’s “interesting” instead of what’s “important.”</p><p>3. Hannah’s revolutionary commitment to stop using self-deprecating humor about her body, sexuality, and gender–and why we might all consider the same commitment.</p><p>4. Why it’s easier for Hannah to share her personal stories “in bulk” on stage instead of one-on-one.</p><p>5. What it takes for Hannah to prepare for conversations–like ours on We Can Do Hard Things.</p><p><br></p><p>About Hannah:</p><p>Tasmania’s own Hannah Gadsby stopped stand-up comedy in its tracks with her multi-award-winning show, Nanette. When it premiered on Netflix in 2018, it left audiences captivated by her blistering honesty and her singular ability to take them from rolling laughter to devastated silence. Its release and subsequent Emmy and Peabody wins took Nanette (and Hannah) to the world. Hannah’s difficult second album (which was also her eleventh solo show) was named Douglas after her dog. Hannah walked Douglas around the world, selling out the Royal Festival Hall in London, the Opera House in Sydney and the Kennedy Center in DC, a sit-down run in New York and shows across the US, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Douglas covered Hannah’s autism diagnosis, moving beyond the trauma at the centre of Nanette and instead letting the world see the view from Hannah’s brain – one that sees the world differently but with breathtaking clarity. The show was an Emmy-nominated smash hit and is available throughout the world on Netflix, recorded in Los Angeles. </p><p><br></p><p>Hannah Gadsby’s “overnight” success was more than ten years in the making, with her award-winning stand-up shows having been a fixture in festivals across Australia and the UK since 2009.

      <title>Pro-Aging: Why the Best is Yet to Come with Ashton Applewhite.</title>
      <description>1. Why we’ve been sold a lie–and the truth that we actually get happier the older we get!
2. The two most important–and shocking–predictors of aging well.
3. Busting the most prevalent misconceptions and about getting older.
4. How believing the myths about aging literally harms our health and makes us more vulnerable to the fears we hold about aging.
5. Glennon paints a mental picture of her older self–and encourages the Pod Squad to do the same.

About Ashton: 
The author of This Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism, Ashton Applewhite is a leading spokesperson for the emerging movement to raise awareness of ageism and to dismantle it. A co-founder of the Old School Anti-Ageism Clearinghouse, she has been recognized by the New York Times, the New Yorker, National Public Radio, and the American Society on Aging as an expert on ageism. Ashton has written for Harper’s, the Guardian, and the New York Times, blogs at This Chair Rocks, and is the voice of Yo, Is This Ageist? She speaks widely at venues that have ranged from colleges and symposia to the TED mainstage and the United Nations. In 2022 she appeared on HelpAgeUSA’s inaugural 60 Over 60 List and on Fe:maleOneZero’s first international edition of 40 over 40 – The World’s Most Inspiring Women.

      <title>This is 46: Why I’m Pumped About Midlife</title>
      <description>1. How Glennon is using her 46th birthday as an intermission–to slow down and decide what to bring with her into Act 2.
2. The counterculture power of knowing what is enough, and letting ourselves go.
3. The way to transition from Role Living to Soul Living–and why Glennon has Joni Mitchell on repeat.
4. The real meaning of “crisis”–and the idea that living well now means reimagining everything we learned in the first half of life. 
5. Amanda’ s good news that if you don’t feel like Glennon does at this moment in life, it is very, very normal.

      <title>Double Date with Brandi &amp; Catherine Carlile!</title>
      <description>In this hilarious and heartwarming in-person double date with Abby and Glennon—and their dear friends and brilliant artists Brandi and Catherine Carlile—we learn:

1. Why Brandi was completely dismayed the first time she met Catherine;
2. Who made the first move—and why it made Catherine sweat;
3. All about the Carlile family compound—where they are raising their girls surrounded by family, band members, and exes;
4. How they communicate and deal with jealousy; and
5. Why Brandi believes this conversation—two queer couples sitting on a couch publicly discussing marriage, family, and domesticity—is revolutionary.

About Brandi:
Brandi Carlile is a six-time GRAMMY Award-winning singer, songwriter, performer, producer, #1 New York Times Bestselling author and activist, who is known as one of music's most respected voices.

Her new album, In These Silent Days, recently debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Americana/Folk Albums chart, Top Rock Albums chart and Tastemaker Albums chart and continues to receive overwhelming acclaim. The New York Times praises, “Larger than life and achingly human…she empathizes, apologizes and lays out accusations. She’s righteous and she’s self-doubting. She proffers fond lullabies and she unleashes full-throated screams," while NPR Music declares, “absolutely breathtaking, across the whole album Brandi Carlile pulls out all the stops. It’s just extraordinary…she’s just claiming rock god status." Carlile recently received five nominations at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards including Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance for the album's lead single, "Right On Time."

Following a breakthrough debut on "Saturday Night Live," Carlile and her band will embark on a series of landmark concerts next year including stops at Washington’s Gorge Amphitheatre, Los Angeles’ The Greek Theatre and New York’s Madison Square Garden among many others. In addition to her 6 GRAMMY Awards, Carlile has been recognized with Billboard’s Women In Music “Trailblazer Award,” CMT’s Next Women of Country “Impact Award" and received multiple recognitions from the Americana Music Association Honors &amp; Awards including Artist of the Year for the past two years.

      <title>Brandi Carlile: Live From My Couch! </title>
      <description>1. The two disagreements between Brandi and Glennon that started, and cemented, their friendship.
2. Brandi’s lifelong quest to continuously “calibrate” herself so that her outsides are in tune with her insides.
3. The trait Brandi loves most about Catherine—and the sticky note on Glennon’s desk with the same message. 

About Brandi:
Brandi Carlile is a six-time GRAMMY Award-winning singer, songwriter, performer, producer, #1 New York Times Bestselling author and activist, who is known as one of music's most respected voices.

Her new album, In These Silent Days, recently debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Americana/Folk Albums chart, Top Rock Albums chart and Tastemaker Albums chart and continues to receive overwhelming acclaim. The New York Times praises, “Larger than life and achingly human…she empathizes, apologizes and lays out accusations. She’s righteous and she’s self-doubting. She proffers fond lullabies and she unleashes full-throated screams," while NPR Music declares, “absolutely breathtaking, across the whole album Brandi Carlile pulls out all the stops. It’s just extraordinary…she’s just claiming rock god status." Carlile recently received five nominations at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards including Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance for the album's lead single, "Right On Time."

Following a breakthrough debut on "Saturday Night Live," Carlile and her band will embark on a series of landmark concerts including stops at Washington’s Gorge Amphitheatre, Los Angeles’ The Greek Theatre and New York’s Madison Square Garden among many others. In addition to her 6 GRAMMY Awards, Carlile has been recognized with Billboard’s Women In Music “Trailblazer Award,” CMT’s Next Women of Country “Impact Award" and received multiple recognitions from the Americana Music Association Honors &amp; Awards including Artist of the Year for the past two years.

      <title>Double Date with Megan Rapinoe &amp; Sue Bird! </title>
      <description>For their first (of hopefully many) podcast double dates, Abby and Glennon sit down with the icons, activists, and Olympians Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird. In this honest and hilarious conversation, we find out:

1. The delightfully awkward moment Megan and Sue first met;
2. What’s hard for each of them right now;
3. The boundaries they’re working on together;
4. How they communicate and deal with jealousy; and 
5. How they help each other show up in the world as champions for change.  

About Sue: 
Regarded as the world’s premier point guard, Sue Bird is the WNBA’s All-Time Leader in Assists and known for being selfless, driven, encouraging, funny and smart. Bird is a seasoned veteran and a born leader who has dominated at every level. She is one of only seven women to win an Olympic Gold Medal (she’s won five), a World Championship Gold Medal (she’s won four) an NCAA Championship (she’s won two), and a WNBA Championship (she’s won four – the last just weeks before her 40th birthday). Sue is also a five-time Euroleague Champion, a twelve- time WNBA All-Star, was voted by the fans as one of the WNBA’s Top 15 Players of All Time. Off the court, Sue spends time as a basketball analyst for ESPN and as an outspoken and visible activist advocating for Black Lives, equality, health and wellness and expanding opportunities for girls and all marginalized people.

About Megan: 
Two-time World Cup Champion and Olympic Gold Medalist, Megan Rapinoe is a fan favorite and one of the team’s most technical and craftiest players. A vocal leader on and off the pitch, Megan helped lead the USWNT to the 2019 Women’s World Cup Championship scoring some of the biggest goals of the tournament. Megan took home the tournament’s two top honors – the Golden Boot for top scorer, and the Golden Ball for the best player in the tournament. Megan is an advocate for equality for all and has been able to intersect her passion for humanity and authenticity.

Sarah Paulson’s acting work includes lead roles in FX’s anthology series "American Horror Story,” and playing Marcia Clark in "The People v. O. J. Simpson,” for which she won an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Critics’ Choice Award, and a Television Critics Association Award.

      <title>How to Live a Little Happier with Dr. Laurie Santos</title>
      <description>1. The simple exercises Laurie conducts with her students at Yale to help them reset their brains and restructure their days in order to access happiness.  
2. Why being “time famished” is one of the most common obstacles to happiness, the signals our bodies give us that we are starved of unstructured time, and what we can do to build more of it.  
3. How understanding that our brains are wired as “comparison machines” incompatible with happiness can lead to improved wellbeing.  

About Laurie: 

Dr. Laurie Santos is Professor of Psychology and Head of Silliman College at Yale University. Dr. Santos is an expert on human cognition and the cognitive biases that impede better choices. Her course, “Psychology and the Good Life,” teaches students what the science of psychology says about how to make wiser choices and live a life that’s happier and more fulfilling. The class is Yale’s most popular course in over 300 years and has been adapted into a free Coursera program that has been taken by over 3.3 million people to date. Dr. Santos has been featured in numerous news outlets including the New York Times, NBC Nightly News, The Today Show, CBS This Morning, NPR, GQ Magazine, Slate, CNN and O, The Oprah Magazine. Dr. Santos is a winner of numerous awards both for her science and teaching from institutions such as Yale and the American Psychological Association. She has been featured as one of Popular Science’s “Brilliant 10” young minds and was named TIME's “Leading Campus Celebrity.” Her podcast, The Happiness Lab, launched in 2019 has over 48 million downloads.

      <description>1. One easy thing we can do to increase our happiness by 1% when we’re feeling tired and overwhelmed.

      <title>Telling the Truth of Who We Are with Luvvie Ajayi Jones</title>
      <description>1. A hilarious, profound take on judging people, and why Luvvie’s telling the world–and has often told Glennon–to: “Fix your face.”
2. How to prepare for hard conversations with those we love–including the lists Luvvie brings to those talks that help keep her calm and vulnerable.
3. The importance of sitting with the fear behind the questions: “Who am I when I am not giving something to somebody?” and “What is my worth when I have nothing to offer?”
4. How we can affirm our teen Troublemakers to keep being different–that their power is in remaining as odd and amazing as they already are–and the complications that led to in Glennon and Abby’s home.

      <title>Be Still: How to Listen to That Something Inside That Always Knows</title>
      <description>1. What if we stop trying to figure out whether our feelings and intuition are “right” or “wrong”– and instead, just acknowledge them as real–and move toward them?
2. How Glennon is experiencing a little shift in peace, joy, and non-reactivity through her newfound relationship with meditation.
3. Why a lot of our suffering exists in the space between the Knowing and the Doing–and how life is at its best and most exciting when we shorten that gap.

      <title>New Year, Same You: Good News About Bad January Branding </title>
      <description>1. Why do we spend our lives trying to become what our culture ascribes as “good” only to burn ourselves out, wake up, and realize: I thought it would all be more beautiful than this?
2. Why Glennon says that stillness has been her greatest teacher–and how she was able to find it in her most rock bottom moments. 
3. How listening for and committing to the next right thing then leads us to the next thing–and why we should rush towards whatever looks and feels like freedom.

      <title>Walking Our People Through Hard Things with Kate Bowler</title>
      <description>1. What we should STOP saying to people who are struggling—and what to say, or do, instead. 
2. How Kate received the support she needed because people were willing to embarrass themselves in their attempts to show up—and why we shouldn’t be scared of doing it wrong.
3. Kate offers some words to a Pod Squader feeling anticipatory grief—and how to accept that we can’t always make it okay for the people we love. 

About Kate:
Kate Bowler, PhD is a New York Times bestselling author, podcast host, and a professor at Duke University. She studies the cultural stories we tell ourselves about success, suffering, and whether (or not) we’re capable of change. She is the author of Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel and The Preacher’s Wife: The Precarious Power of Evangelical Women Celebrities. After being unexpectedly diagnosed with Stage IV cancer at age 35, she penned the New York Times bestselling memoir, Everything Happens for a Reason (and Other Lies I’ve Loved) and her latest, No Cure For Being Human (and Other Truths I Need to Hear). Kate hosts the Everything Happens podcast where, in warm, insightful, often funny conversations, she talks with people like Malcolm Gladwell and Anne Lamott about what they’ve learned in difficult times. She lives in Durham, North Carolina with her family and continues to teach do-gooders at Duke Divinity School.

      <title>What to Do with Our Short, Precious Life with Kate Bowler</title>
      <description>1. Kate describes the overwhelming feeling of love—not anger—that she felt when she was sure she was near death. 
2. Why it’s time we throw out expressions like “Everything is possible” and “What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger,” and rewrite our cultural cliches. 
3. Why Kate delights in celebrating the holidays—and how to survive the holiday season when there’s grief and loss and fear in all of us. 
4. Kate and Glennon bond over their love for swear words—and how using them is a reflection of what’s going on inside of them.

      <description>1. Why Ashley says we have to talk about what hurts if we’re ever going to heal.

3. How many of us are really good at loving other people, but often struggle to let ourselves be loved.
4. Why Ashley says that nothing has ever given her more peace and power than knowing that she doesn’t really need others to believe in her—because she believes so deeply in herself.

      <title>FORGIVING &amp; FINDING PEACE with ASHLEY C. FORD</title>
      <description>1. How to find a way to live in peace: to actually love complicated parents without compromising our love for ourselves.
2. How we can’t change our past—and why Ashley says that forgiveness is accepting the fact that the past is never going to be different.
3. The importance of being able to hold two truths at the same time: that, for some of us, our parents did the best they could—and it wasn’t close to good enough.
4. Why Ashley says she struggles, even in adulthood, to accept love and care from people who are not obligated to love and care for her.
5. Why anger often reveals our passion points—and for Ashley, why that leads her to show up for children.

      <title>GET UNTAMED (Live!): This is How You Find Yourself </title>
      <description>1. What Tish said when asked, “Who has taught you the most about love?”— why it was the best day of Abby’s life, and led her to redefine what it means to be a mother.  
2. Glennon declares herself a great adventurer, without movement: an inner travel guide—and how the new journal will help steer us toward our next right thing. 
3. How the pandemic brought Amanda’s anxieties, traumas, and relational cracks, previously on a slow burn, to center stage—and what she’s learning from “Be Still and Know.” 
4. Why Glennon says whatever we’re envious of is what we need to go for—and how that led to the creation of this podcast.

      <title>Dr. Brené Brown: On Holding Boundaries &amp; Facing Our Fear</title>
      <description>1. Brené and Glennon role play through a scenario on how to put boundaries in practice with family members this holiday season.
2. Why Brené insists that starting “a love affair with the thing you’re most afraid of” will change your life.  
3. Glennon asks Brené the question she’s been dying to ask about how a woman’s work is defined and received in the world compared to her male counterparts. 
4. How understanding that grief and loss are an inevitable part of change helps us navigate toward the decisions that serve us. 
5. Brené answers questions from the Pod Squad and our rapid fire session on: tough emotions, tattoos, and her favorite place on Earth.

About Brené:

Dr. Brené Brown is a research professor at the University of Houston where she holds the Huffington Foundation Endowed Chair at The Graduate College of Social Work. Brené is also a visiting professor in management at The University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business.

      <description>1. Why Brené’s new book ATLAS OF THE HEART is a game changer for communicating hard emotions more easily. 
2. Brené breaks down the difference between stressed and overwhelmed—and gives us tools to navigate both.
3. How our survival strategies from our families of origin can become both our superpowers and our stumbling blocks in our relationships and wellness.  
4. How we can make sure our kids experience deep, steady belonging—even if they don’t feel like they “belong” out in the world.  
5. The one question that Brené now asks herself whenever she’s considering a decision—and how it’s changed everything.

      <title>RUNNERS &amp; CHEERERS: Marathon Life with Shalane Flanagan </title>
      <description>1. How a marathon is an analogy for life: the danger of comparison, the ride of emotions and self-doubt, that love is fuel, and that the world needs both runners and cheerers.  
2. The question Abby kept asking herself throughout the race—and why she’s still wearing her marathon medal while doing the dishes and running errands. 
3. Why race day was so profound to Glennon— even though she is strongly committed to NOT running—and how she experienced her first sports injury while cheering. 
4. A special visit by the kids’ middle school cross-country coach, Coach Loux, who became Abby’s marathon coach—and what she said at the 24-mile mark that shifted everything for Abby.  
5. A conversation with marathon champion Shalane Flanagan about the bond and joy of running—and how she played a magical part of Abby’s marathon day.

About Shalane Flanagan: 
Dedicated to giving back to the sport she loves, Shalane Flanagan is now an elite coach to the Bowerman Track Club, global spokesperson, and a mom, after retiring as one of America’s most decorated distance runners. Flanagan’s accolades include four-time Olympian, Olympic silver medalist, 2017 TCS New York City Marathon champion, World Cross Country Bronze medalist, and multiple American record holder. She is the third fastest American marathoner in history, with a time of 2:21.14. Shalane is the fastest American woman to run the Boston Marathon, 2:22.02. Along with her coauthor, Elyse Kopecky, she is the 3-time New York Times bestselling author of Run Fast. Eat Slow. and Run Fast. Cook Fast. Eat Slow. and Rise &amp; Run, which became an instant bestseller. Shalane attributes her long career and incredible success to her nutrient-dense diet. Shalane has left the track behind, but you’ll still find her logging high mileage on trail run adventures with friends! Recipes from all three of her cookbooks fuel these strenuous miles.

      <title>GABRIELLE UNION: Infertility, Bonus Parents &amp; Free Families</title>
      <description>1. Gabrielle shares—as rawly and honestly as we’ve ever heard—about the “emotional chaos” of her years experiencing miscarriage, infertility, and surrogacy.
2. Gabrielle and Abby discuss the label and perception of “stepmom”—Gabrielle shares what she avoids at all costs in that role, and the most vital part of the role for her: consistency.
3. How Gabrielle coached her NBA husband Dwyane before Zaya shared with him that she is gay, and how his reaction encouraged Zaya to tell the people on her “never-ever” list.
4. Gabrielle’s insistence that home is a sanctuary where all are embraced with love, understanding, and joy—and how, if you can’t get behind all of her family members, you’re not welcome.

About Gabrielle:
Gabrielle Union is an actress, executive producer, activist, best-selling author, and Time100 cover honoree. Union will next be seen in Disney’s remake of CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN developed by Kenya Barris for Disney+. She was last seen in “L.A.’s Finest,” the highly anticipated TV spinoff of the BAD BOYS movie franchise. She reprised her starring role as Syd Burnett opposite Jessica Alba in the series and served as an executive producer through her production shingle “I’ll Have Another.” Union formed “I’ll Have Another” in 2018 with the goal of telling stories that center marginalized communities with their specific point of views in an authentic manner. 
 
In May of 2021, Gabrielle released – in partnership with her husband Dwyane Wade – her second children’s book, “Shady Baby,” which became a New York Times best seller the first week of release. Her first book, We’re Going To Need More Wine: Stories That Are Funny, Complicated and True, was released in 2017 and instantly became a New York Times best seller. The highly anticipated follow up “You Got Anything Stronger?” was released in September of this year and was a New York Times best seller as well. 
 
Union has always had an eye for forward-thinking businesses centered around inclusion, accessibility, and affordability. In August of 2020, she relaunched her haircare brand “Flawless by Gabrielle Union” for women with textured hair. Prior to relaunching Flawless, Union co-founded Bitsy's with the goal of making healthy, allergen- friendly, school-safe snacks that are accessible and affordable for all families regardless of their socioeconomic or geographical status. Union serves as a leader and advocate for inclusion in the entertainment industry. She is also a champion of breast health and combating sexual violence.

      <itunes:summary>1. Gabrielle shares—as rawly and honestly as we’ve ever heard—about the “emotional chaos” of her years experiencing miscarriage, infertility, and surrogacy.
2. Gabrielle and Abby discuss the label and perception of “stepmom”—Gabrielle shares what she avoids at all costs in that role, and the most vital part of the role for her: consistency.
3. How Gabrielle coached her NBA husband Dwyane before Zaya shared with him that she is gay, and how his reaction encouraged Zaya to tell the people on her “never-ever” list.
4. Gabrielle’s insistence that home is a sanctuary where all are embraced with love, understanding, and joy—and how, if you can’t get behind all of her family members, you’re not welcome.

About Gabrielle:
Gabrielle Union is an actress, executive producer, activist, best-selling author, and Time100 cover honoree. Union will next be seen in Disney’s remake of CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN developed by Kenya Barris for Disney+. She was last seen in “L.A.’s Finest,” the highly anticipated TV spinoff of the BAD BOYS movie franchise. She reprised her starring role as Syd Burnett opposite Jessica Alba in the series and served as an executive producer through her production shingle “I’ll Have Another.” Union formed “I’ll Have Another” in 2018 with the goal of telling stories that center marginalized communities with their specific point of views in an authentic manner. 
 
In May of 2021, Gabrielle released – in partnership with her husband Dwyane Wade – her second children’s book, “Shady Baby,” which became a New York Times best seller the first week of release. Her first book, We’re Going To Need More Wine: Stories That Are Funny, Complicated and True, was released in 2017 and instantly became a New York Times best seller. The highly anticipated follow up “You Got Anything Stronger?” was released in September of this year and was a New York Times best seller as well. 
 
Union has always had an eye for forward-thinking businesses centered around inclusion, accessibility, and affordability. In August of 2020, she relaunched her haircare brand “Flawless by Gabrielle Union” for women with textured hair. Prior to relaunching Flawless, Union co-founded Bitsy's with the goal of making healthy, allergen- friendly, school-safe snacks that are accessible and affordable for all families regardless of their socioeconomic or geographical status. Union serves as a leader and advocate for inclusion in the entertainment industry. She is also a champion of breast health and combating sexual violence.

      <description>1. How, if you have been struggling in your romantic, parental, family, or work relationships through the lingering uncertainty of the last two years, you are not alone.
2. The revolutionary understanding that, in relationships, “behind every criticism is a longing; behind every anger is a hurt.”
3. What to do when your relationship is a bond of co-parenting / life management instead of a partnership of ongoing discovery. 
4. The link between trauma recovery and the process of enlivening “dead” relationships.
5. Esther’s everyday conflict resolution practices.

      <title>LANDING IN LOVE: Is the settling-in phase the best stage of love?</title>
      <description>1. How Glennon and Abby transitioned from the “falling in love” phase to “landing in love” at different times—and how Glennon felt “bamboozled” by it.
2. How the self-inflicted guilt of pursuing joy ruins everything.
3. Why a precious gift from Abby made Glennon feel like she’d finally landed in the right galaxy.
4. How the things about our partners that drive us nuts are the same things that attracted us to them.

      <title>FALLING IN LOVE: Is there really “the one” or is “the one” YOU? </title>
      <description>1. Why “falling in love” feels like you’re losing your mind—and Amanda’s experience when Glennon fell hard for Abby. 
2. Why Abby thinks the idea of “the one” is the most romantic way to live, and why Amanda thinks “the one” is unromantic and uninteresting.  
3. Glennon’s belief that loves are like plants: some loves are perennials that continue to bloom, others are annuals, full for a season and then back to earth to nourish soil—but that no love is ever, ever wasted.  
4. Why so many of us either think we can be fixed by love, or that we can fix others with our love.

      <title>Passion, Praise &amp; Getting Personal </title>
      <description>1. Glennon makes a “pod-pology”—and why we should stop saying, “I can’t imagine.” 
2. Amanda makes the case for no longer praising people as “superheroes”—and why we should stop giving them lip service and bring them a sandwich instead.  
3. How we abandon things we love because the environments surrounding them are unbearable—and how to recreate the environment and reclaim what we love.   
4. Amanda’s reaction to her new role opening up on the podcast—and how she feels like the very intimate stories she shares are “not personal at all.”

      <title>HOW TO SAY NO with Simone Biles and Laurie Hernandez</title>
      <description>HOW TO SAY NO with Simone Biles and Laurie Hernandez 

In this very special conversation, three GOATs and Glennon discuss:
1. What we can learn from Simone’s revolutionary decision at the Tokyo Olympics to choose her physical and mental health over the world’s expectations of her. 
2. The tiny decisions that helped Laurie practice trusting herself again after surviving a toxic coach.
3. Why Simone, Laurie, and Abby believe their talent is both a blessing and a curse. 
4. The places and times Simone and Laurie create where they have nothing to prove—to remind themselves they are human beings, not performance machines. 
5. How Simone and Laurie are a big part of one of Abby and Glennon’s favorite family stories.

About Simone: 
Simone Biles, one of the greatest gymnasts of all-time, is the first woman to capture five All-Around World Championship titles. She is the most decorated gymnast in World Championships history—male or female—with 25 medals overall (19 gold), and is a seven-time Olympic medalist (4 gold). A three-time Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year, she earned the rare distinction of having four skills named in her honor—called The Biles. 

Simone’s autobiography Courage to Soar is a New York Times bestseller.  

Simone advocates for change and supports initiatives that provide education and assistance for children and young adults associated with adoption and childcare.

About Laurie: 
Laurie Hernandez is a second generation American, as her grandparents are from Puerto Rico, making her the first U.S. born Latina to make the U.S. team since 1984. Laurie is an Olympic medalist, winning both Gold and Silver medals at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. Her book I Got This: To Gold and Beyond and her children’s book She’s Got This are both New York Times bestsellers. Laurie is a fierce advocate for the importance of mental health, and travels the country speaking to the next generation about following their dreams.

About The GOLD OVER AMERICA TOUR (GOAT):
Simone and Laurie—and an all-star team of gymnasts—are on the road this Fall for the 35-city Gold Over America Tour, showcasing their fierce talent and athletic brilliance in ways we’ve never seen before… their way! The show emerges from their personal values of empowerment, friendship, positive body image, mental health awareness, and self-confidence. Together, they are a united force proudly representing the sport of women’s gymnastics and inspiring audiences across the nation.

3. How Glennon feels like Ben Affleck in Good Will Hunting—and why she wants Amanda to “go see about a girl.”

      <title>UNBOUND with Tarana Burke—Part 2</title>
      <description>We’re continuing our conversation with activist, founder of the me too movement, and our personal friend and hero,Tarana Burke. We talk about: 

1. What Tarana would say to her twelve-year-old self that might have changed the trajectory of her life.

2. Tarana’s life-shifting realization that her relationship struggles with her mother were not due to her mother’s lack of desire to love her well, but her lack of capacity—and how Tarana built more capacity for her own child.   

3. The one thing Tarana said to her child that changed everything—and why Amanda now says the same thing to her children.  

CW: We reference sexual abuse and trauma.

About Tarana: 
For more than 25 years, activist and advocate Tarana J. Burke has worked at the intersection of sexual violence and racial justice. Fueled by commitments to interrupt sexual violence and other systemic inequalities disproportionately impacting marginalized people, particularly Black women and girls, Tarana has created and led various campaigns focused on increasing access to resources and support for impacted communities, including the ‘me too.’ movement, which to date has galvanized millions of survivors and allies around the world.

      <title>UNBOUND with Tarana Burke—Part 1</title>
      <description>Please join us in the first part of our joyful, energizing, and hopeful conversation with activist, advocate, and our personal hero,Tarana Burke. We talk about:
1. How the spoken and unspoken rules for girls led Tarana to constantly perform the role of “good girl” so that “her secret” would never be revealed.  
2. The impossible double bind so many survivors live through: that the protection of our community is what saves us, but the need to protect our community is what silences us.
3. Why Maya Angelou’s work changed everything for Tarana—and how, in her early twenties, she began documenting everything joyful in her life. 
4. How dancing with Rob was the one place Tarana could safely explore her sexuality with no demands on her body—and how meaningful that was for her.   
CW: We reference sexual abuse and trauma.
About Tarana: 
For more than 25 years, activist and advocate Tarana J. Burke has worked at the intersection of sexual violence and racial justice. Fueled by commitments to interrupt sexual violence and other systemic inequalities disproportionately impacting marginalized people, particularly Black women and girls, Tarana has created and led various campaigns focused on increasing access to resources and support for impacted communities, including the ‘me too.’ movement, which to date has galvanized millions of survivors and allies around the world.

3. Why Glennon describes herself as Dory from Nemo, and how she returned to meditation when her mind became unmanageable.

      <description>1. The story that led to Abby’s iconic haircut—how that decision terrified her, changed how she played the game, and changed how she lives her life. 
2. How Abby and Glennon view “brave” differently—and why Amanda believes their perspectives may be more similar than they think.

      <title>REAL, JOYFUL SEX with Emily Nagoski</title>
      <description>We welcome our very first guest, author and sex educator Emily Nagoski, who talks with us about how to finally build true, joyful, confident sex lives:

1. How our sex issues are totally normal—we’re all worrying about the same things. 
2. Why more than 75% of women do not orgasm from penetration alone—and why Glennon thinks the world doesn’t want us to know that.
3. The single factor that is most predictive of strong sustained sexual connection over time. 
4. How Abby’s still healing after a lifetime in locker rooms spent comparing her body to other women’s bodies.

CW: We reference sexual trauma, including what to say when someone discloses sexual trauma to you. 

About Emily: EMILY NAGOSKI is the award-winning author of the New York Times bestselling COME AS YOU ARE and THE COME AS YOU ARE WORKBOOK, and coauthor, with her sister, Amelia, of New York Times bestseller BURNOUT: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle.

2. Why more than 75% of women do not orgasm from penetration alone—and why Glennon thinks the world doesn’t want us to know that.
3. The single factor that is most predictive of strong sustained sexual connection over time. 
4. How Abby’s still healing after a lifetime in locker rooms spent comparing her body to other women’s bodies.

CW: We reference sexual trauma, including what to say when someone discloses sexual trauma to you. 

About Emily: EMILY NAGOSKI is the award-winning author of the New York Times bestselling COME AS YOU ARE and THE COME AS YOU ARE WORKBOOK, and coauthor, with her sister, Amelia, of New York Times bestseller BURNOUT: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle. She earned an M.S. in counseling and a Ph.D. in health behavior, both from Indiana University, with clinical and research training at the Kinsey Institute. Now she combines sex education and stress education to teach women to live with confidence and joy inside their bodies. She lives in Massachusetts with two dogs, a cat, and a cartoonist.

3. What Glennon really means when she says she’s a feminist—and why she’s baffled when a group fighting for their own equality turns on another group fighting for theirs.
4. Why Glennon says that the teenage years may be her favorite parenting era yet.

      <description>1. Why are we conditioned to spend so much of our precious time and energy on our appearance?
2. Why is it that when men put work into the world, the world asks if his work is worthy—but when women put work into the world, the world asks if she’s worthy? 
3. Why is half the population’s face allowed to exist as is, while the rest of our faces “need” to be covered in concealers, colors, botox, etc., etc....?
4. How is it that the ultimate way to insult a woman is to say that she’s “let herself go”?
5. The better “beauty” standard for women that is liberating Glennon right now.
