      <description><![CDATA[<p>Inflation. Unemployment. Consumer demand. All important economic data—but more important is how the Federal Reserve interprets it all and reacts. The central bank wields an especially powerful influence over markets, so understanding how its members think, what they are doing and why is important for any engaged investor.</p>
<p>We speak with Ira Jersey, Bloomberg’s Chief US Interest Rate Strategist, about how to read the latest inflation data through the Fed’s eyes.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inflation. Unemployment. Consumer demand. All important economic data—but more important is how the Federal Reserve interprets it all and reacts. The central bank wields an especially powerful influence over markets, so understanding how its members think, what they are doing and why is important for any engaged investor.</p>
<p>We speak with Ira Jersey, Bloomberg’s Chief US Interest Rate Strategist, about how to read the latest inflation data through the Fed’s eyes. We also talk about how exactly the Fed impacts the real economy as well as what’s on its balance sheet. Finally, Jersey gives his opinion on different types of bond exchange-traded funds, such as TIPS, junk bonds and single-bond ETFs. </p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Inflation upending the market over the past year, and the Federal Reserve’s pivot to higher interest rates, has sparked interest among investors looking to hedge this particular type of “tail risk.”</p>
<p>On this episode, Eric and Joel speak with Meb Faber, founder of Cambria and host of podcast “The Meb Faber Show.” Faber has designed two exchange-traded funds in this space, $TAIL and $FAIL.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A single-stock ETF might sound like an oxymoron, but it's about to become a massive new category. These ETFs, which aim to serve up inverse and leveraged exposure to single stocks, are already a thing in Europe—and now they've come to the US, with the SEC approving the first batch earlier this month. One of them, the AXS Tesla Bear Daily ETF ($TSLQ), shows early signs of being a big hit. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When markets plummet like they have this year, investors want to grab onto something—anything—that isn’t in free-fall. High-dividend exchange-traded funds, with their exposures to the energy and utilities sectors, have emerged as a rare bright spot, or at least a less-dim one. They’ve seen $25 billion in inflows already, which is a record—one that could double by the end of the year. </p>
<p>On this episode, Eric and Joel speak with Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, and reporter Suzanne Woolley about a category of ETFs punching above their weight. They discuss some of the noteworthy ETFs, including $VYM, $DVY, $HDV, $DHS; analyze holdings and performances, and share how investors can dabble with these made-for-the-moment products.</p>

<p>We talk to Vivek Ramaswamy and Anson Frericks, co-founders of Strive.

<p>On this episode of the podcast,&nbsp;Balchunas and Weber&nbsp;are joined by reporter Annie Massa to go over some of the bigger points Balchunas makes in his book.

Eric and his guest co-host, Scarlet Fu of Bloomberg Quicktake, interview Reggie about how ETFs are born, whether they need a rating system, the prospects of a bitcoin ETF, and why theme ETFs such as ARK have staying power.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If ETFs were living creatures, they might be cockroaches—they can survive almost anything. And yet Russia's invasion of Ukraine has presented a rare test. The VanEck Russia ETF, or $RSX, has seen its trading halted; the product holds shares of Russian companies, many of them in the energy and financial sectors. Investors may end up recovering only a fraction of their exposures; retail traders who used options to short the ETF ahead of its mid-February nosedive may not be able to collect their winnings, either. Elsewhere in the world, the exchange-traded product $VXX went haywire recently, with Barclays temporarily suspending share issuance. What's happening here?</p><p>On this episode of Trillions, Eric and Joel discuss these recent events with Dave Nadig of ETF Trends, and Katie Greifeld, ETF reporter with Bloomberg News and the co-host of ETF IQ on Bloomberg TV. They go over the unprecedented nature of RSX's circumstances and what it all means, and they explore why the best days of exchange-traded notes might be behind them.

      <itunes:title>Return Stacking to Solve the 60/40 Dilemma</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Everybody loves the 60/40 portfolio. And why not? It's worked really well for a long time, especially the past decade when both stocks (the 60) and bonds (the 40) went up. Yet investors fear the current inflationary environment could push both down. Enter “return stacking,” which attempts to solve this conundrum. Investors get the standard 60/40 allocation, only it’s leveraged in a way to add diversification and protection. (Oh, and by the way, that frees up a chunk of your portfolio for other exposures so you can have your cake and eat it, too….or at least that's what the backtest shows.) </p><p>On this episode, Eric and Joel speak with Corey Hoffstein, chief investment officer of Newfound Research, and Rodrigo Gordillo, president and portfolio manager of ReSolve Asset Management. Together, the two pioneered the concept with a widely-circulated research paper (which you can find at returnstacking.com) and an open-source model portfolio that allows anyone to implement the concept. The approach means higher fees than most ETF-based portfolios, but as the group discusses, inflation and rising rates mean investors might want to consider reconsidering their toolbox.</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The quest for a bitcoin ETF has lasted more than eight years. Countless filings have ended in rejection. Then, finally, it happened—the SEC allowed a bitcoin ETF to come to market, albeit one that tracks futures as opposed to holding bitcoin. The unlikely winner of this race? ProShares, whose ETF $BITO broke all kinds of records for a new launch. Valkyrie's version, $BTF, was also approved. </p><p>On this episode, Eric and Joel speak with ETF lawyer Jeremy Senderowicz of Vedder Price, Katie Greifeld of Bloomberg News, and James Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence about these developments.

Despite owning just .02% of Exxon Mobil — not long ago the world’s most valuable company — the little-known activist investor was able to install three new directors on the company’s board, an advance that could finally make the energy giant confront the challenges of climate change.

      <itunes:title>Introducing: Doubt</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>A few decades ago, nobody really questioned vaccines. They were viewed as a standard part of staying healthy and safe. Today, the number of people questioning vaccines risks prolonging a pandemic that has already killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. How we got to this moment didn’t start with the rollout of vaccines or in March 2020, or even with the election of Donald Trump. Our confidence in vaccines, often isn't even about vaccines. It’s about trust. And that trust has been eroding for a long time. Doubt, a new series from Bloomberg’s Prognosis podcast, looks at the forces that have been breaking down that trust. We'll trace the rise of vaccine skepticism in America to show how we got here — and where we’re going. Doubt launches on March 23.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Covering ETFs this year was like trying to hit a constantly moving target. Businessweek's annual “Jealousy List” -- stories by other outlets that the magazine's staff wish they would've published -- inspired Eric and Joel to bring an ETF version of the idea to Trillions. On this episode, Katherine Greifeld, Claire Ballentine, and Yakob Petersseil of Bloomberg News, who specialize in covering ETFs, join them to discuss a few of the articles they wish they had written this year, about topics such as ETNs, volatility, target date funds, and concerns about index funds. Honorees include New York's Josh Barro; ETF Trends's Dave Nadig; WSJ's Akane Otani, Sebastian Pellejero and Chana Schoenberger; and Institutional Investor's Leanna Orr. Eric also highlights some of his favorites by his colleagues at Bloomberg News. </p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Winter is coming. Actually, it’s pretty much always winter for new ETFs. And on this Game of Thrones-inspired episode of Trillions, Joel and Eric look at two products that have managed to survive the brutal fee wars with their unique approaches: the VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (MOAT), which screens for "wide moat" companies, and the Invesco Shipping ETF (SEA), which tracks industrial shipping companies. VanEck's Brandon Rakszawski and Invesco's Nick Kalivas join Joel (a big GoT fan) and Eric (who's never seen an episode) to discuss the ETFs' strategies, fees, and performance -- as well as the upcoming final season of the hit show.

      <title>Where To Invest $10,000 Right Now</title>
      <itunes:title>Where To Invest $10,000 Right Now</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>With many of the world's stock markets in turmoil, and interest rates on the rise in the U.S., it can be hard to spot investment opportunities.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>While the rise of ETFs has been good for ETFs, it has come at the expense of many mutual fund managers -- humans who have seen about $1 trillion in outflows over the past four years.

We're calling this special body of work "Use Your Disillusion I &amp; II," a nod to the seminal Guns N' Roses album. Why? Because - according to Barry - disillusionment is a major driver behind the rise of ETFs and passive investing.</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Movies get ratings, so why not ETFs? After all, there are more than 2,100 ETFs, with one new one launching every day, that provide exposure to every asset class, sector, region, country, commodity, currency, factor, theme, derivative and strategy that you can think of, as well as some you’ve never heard of. While most are “plain vanilla,” many come with twists, and some are downright dangerous carrying unforeseen risks.</p><p>Unforeseen risk was on full display this week as some inverse volatility exchange-traded products turned disastrous, falling over 90% in a day and forcing several banks to issue redemptions. In this episode, Joel and Eric discuss the recent market turbulence, welcome Eric’s new colleague James Seyffart to the show, and also introduce Bloomberg Intelligence’s new “ETF Spotlight” System. The green-yellow-red model couldn’t get any easier to understand and will help you discern safer products from the potentially lethal ones -- before it’s too late.</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

In order to achieve a feat like that in finance you need some attractive qualities. The ETF happens to have many. You can almost think of these as a disruptive technology, akin to the MP3 or Uber.
