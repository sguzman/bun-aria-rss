						<description><![CDATA[Last week on the Debunking Economics podcast Phil and Steve talked about the likely imposition of Austerity 2.0 around the world, in particular in the UK. Steve said there’s really no need for it. This week he explains more about how cuts in the government deficit starves the private sector of cash, which will guarantee a recession, or worse. Listen in for an easy-to-follow explanation of how a government deficit increases money in circulation and how reducing that deficit shrinks the money supply. They talk about Wynne Godley’s explanation of sectoral balances, and how the interplay between government spending and private sector money is how the economy works now. The complicating factor, is foreign spending. What happens when government money finds itself overseas?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Listen in to find out why you should be thinking of that as new money added to the UK’s £2.2 trillion economy, rather than an expense that has to be repaid. Slower spending by governments and fiscal tightening by central banks will shrink the money supply at a time when people are already struggling through lower real wages, higher inflation and cuts to public services.

						<description><![CDATA[Before her plans were ripped up, the UK’s newest Prime Minister was promising growth, growth, growth in an economy that has avoided it for a long time. And she was going to do it through that tried and tested method of trickle-down economics! Cut taxes for the rich and watch the economy grow. Sadly, we’ll never know whether it worked or not because the plans have been ditched and its back to higher taxes and less government spending. More austerity and low growth. But, Phil asks Steve, isn’t low growth what we need? If we want to save the planet surely we have to abandon the idea that each year we consume that little bit more? But how do you do that when entrepreneurs need the growth imperative to come up with those innovative ideas that improve our lives. Without the incentive for companies to grow wouldn’t we end up with a Soviet-style centrally planned economy, producing lots of stuff that nobody wants.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[We all know money has a value, but if you are borrowing it, it also has a cost. But aside from buying houses and a few other big items, we generally are more concerned with the value of the money we earn rather than the cost of the money we borrow. Today we&nbsp;look at the relationship between the cost and value of money, and ask whether the instability in interest rates is hindering our ability to plan for our future. What would happen if interest rates were fixed? And what about the rising cost of money, when governments need to spend more money to support us when times are tough – like now, for example?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The world is living in fear of rising inflation. Central banks are trying to combat it by pushing up interest rates, which means people also now fear how much their mortgage is going to cost. So, are they making matters better or just adding to the problem? This week Phil Dobbie asks Steve Keen if inflation is as big a problem as central banks make out, and whether hiking interest rates will fix the problem this time round. And why a 2% inflation target. It’s the aim of most central banks to get inflation down to that level, but it sounds like it had a rather haphazard, unscientific origin. If they changed the target to, say, 4 percent, what would happen? More to the point, what would happen if these banks did nothing at all?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Last week Kwasi Kwarteng, the new UK Chancellor, announced a cut in taxes at the same time that the government was stepping in to subsidise rising energy costs for homes and businesses. The cost of all this dwarfs the money spent on the furlough scheme. That means there’s a heap of government money being pushed into the public sector. Conventional economists, of the Friedman mould, would argue that we’re already seeing inflation driven by too much money, so what abut this next blast of government spending? Could it make inflation worse? And what about the repercussions on income disparity – from the budget and its unforeseen consequences. Hopefully someone in the Treasury is listening.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Whilst the US might be struggling a bit with inflation, its nothing compared to what’s likely to happen in Europe. This week Russia shuts down its gas pipeline to Europe, supposedly for repairs, but there’s no guarantee it will open again. Even if it does, supplies are a fraction of what they were and Europe wants to stop its reliance on Russia anyway – pushing prices sky high, with rationing the only likely solution. Meanwhile, the Euro is weakening as the dollar goes from strength to strength, and that’s adding to Europe’s inflation pressures. And throw a drought on to of all of that, adding to the energy and supply problems. Plus a growing wealth divide. Is there any good news for Europe? Steve Keen reckons the only answer, sadly, is for Europe to give-in to Putin and make swathes of Ukraine the sacrificial lamb as the only way to avoid economic collapse. Even then, Europe has a number of inherent problems to overcome.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

High gas prices from Russia are making LNG imports feasible, because Europe will pay more than Asia for supplies. It won’t completely bridge the shortfall, he says, but if Europeans make a 15 percent cut in usage, then there will be no need to negotiate with Putin. This week on the Debunking Economics podcast Steve Keen argues that the pricing mechanism ignores the needs of the poor and has, for decades, favoured the rich. The fact that governments need to subsidise low-income households against rising fuel prices, whilst energy companies report record profits, demonstrates just how broken the pricing mechanism is.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[As inflation grows around the world the US dollar enjoying multi-decade highs. To an extent, that’s helping mitigate the impact of inflation in the US by dampening the rising cost of imports. Most other places, though, are seeing the opposite happen. The rising dollar devalues local currencies making imports, including energy, more expensive, adding to inflation. This week Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen about the impacts of exchange rates on international trade and how nations could be starting to challenge the US dominance in currency markets. As Pola, a Debunking Economics Podcast listener asks, what happens as BRICs nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China) move to payments in their own currencies instead of using the US dollar? Beyond that, what if they develop their own trading currency, similar to the Bancor proposed by Keynes back in the 1940s.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The Tragedy of the Commons is a concept developed by William Forster Lloyd one hundred and fifty years ago.

Perhaps this year inflation will rise faster, so in real terms prices may dip, but in the long run, he reckons, the direction will always be north. Prof Steve Keen on the other hand, maintains that, at some point, things will rapidly head south. Why? Because banks are offering loans through the creation of new money, which makes it easier for them to meet consumer demand, irrespective of how realistic house prices are. And they get locked into a feedback loop, where valuations are based on previous valuations. Your house is worth more because all the other houses around you are worth more.

						<description><![CDATA[The UK the Chancellor’s wife Akshata Murty was in the news a couple of weeks ago when it was revealed that she was claiming non-domicile status in the UK, so most of her income from her shareholding in dad’s company in India could be taxed over there at a much lower rate. The issue for many was that she wasn’t paying her fair share of tax. But does her wealth present a bigger problem.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The UK the Chancellor’s wife Akshata Murty was in the news a couple of weeks ago when it was revealed that she was claiming non-domicile status in the UK, so most of her income from her shareholding in dad’s company in India could be taxed over there at a much lower rate. The issue for many was that she wasn’t paying her fair share of tax. But does her wealth present a bigger problem. This week Phil Dobbie asks Prof Steve Keen whether Akshata Murty is an example of the rentier class, who make money from having money. And does that necessarily mean the money is used less well than if it was in the hands of good old-fashioned capitalists? Or is it all just a bit of jealousy, because we don’t have wealthy parents?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

So will they make their way through it, or will these sanctions be the nail in the coffin for Putin’s plan? Or will they just make him more resolute?

Now a war in Europe is pushing the cost of fuel ever higher. But the Chancellors argument is that the government has to pay back the money it borrowed during the pandemic. If it did, it would take decades. But, as Steve Keen explains in this week’s podcast, Modern Monetary Theory suggests the money doesn’t need to be paid back, and tax is really on a mechanism for controlling the money supply.

Both noble aims, but the execution might have left something to be desired.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

According to Domain’s House Price Index, prices in Sydney have risen by a third in the last year, to a median value of $1.6 million. Housing affordability has never been a bigger issue, but how do you bring prices down when two thirds of the population are owner occupiers. That’s a question Phil Dobbie puts to Steve Keen, as he explains his two-pronged approach to containing house prices – first, limiting the value of loans to a multiple of the rental value of a property and, secondly, a big reset, which sees debt repaid and bonds issued to those who don’t currently own a property.

Paying for the furloughing of workers during the pandemic was one unavoidable example. But are their times when subsidies can distort the economy in unforeseen ways.

						<description><![CDATA[During his Tory Party conference speech, Boris Johnson said that he remembers something about Wilfredo Pareto, in the “cobwedded attic of (his) memories”. In his mind, Pareto was all about&nbsp;levelling up – that you can improve the lot of some of society without anyone else losing out. But Pareto is most famous for the 80:20 rule – at the time he observed that 80 percent of land in Italy was owned by 20 percent of the population. It’d be worse than that today. For example, in England half of all land is owned by less than one percent of the population. So, can you really expect to be able to improve the wealth of everyone? If the poor suddenly get rich, won’t they demand the swathes of land that is the domain of the uber-wealthy? Plus, doesn’t climate change place a ceiling on growth that puts paid to Jonson’s ambitions. Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen, and asks whether levelling up is a vain hope, and whether Pareto ever argued the case in the first place.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The world’s leaders are getting together in the UK at the end of this month to discuss how to tackle climate change. Meanwhile, fuel prices are rising higher and higher, and increasing talk of inflation. Prices are rising because, quite simply, demand is rising but supply is still constrained. Gas supplies in Europe are dependent on Russia and renewable energy has been held back by low winds and other weather-related influences. Now, to meet demand, countries are stepping up their use of fossil fuels. Energy supplies “at any costs” has been the approach in China. Phil Dobbie asks Steve Keen whether we’ll ever reach renewable targets whilst the energy industry is in private hands.

If not, have they really embarked on MMT but are afraid to admit it? Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Whilst the UK still lumbers under high COVID infection rates, and the economic recovery stalls, with GDP growth now at a trickle, the government wants to raise taxes. Even if you believed it was a fair tax, is next April – when the rise kicks in – the time to be taking spending money out of people’s pockets. But, as Phil Dobbie discusses with Prof Steve Keen, this is far from a fair tax. Those earning over £50,000 per year will pay disproportionately less than those on lower incomes. The money will help to fund the health care sector which is predominantly serviced by for-profit companies, some of whom are paying their senior staff very handsome salaries. We’re told we can expect more tax rises soon as the Tory government scrambles to reduce its debt burden. All of this ignores, of course, the ideas of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) that suggests governments can overspend if the excess money is used to create jobs. Even if you ignored MMT, doesn’t the issue of caring for the elderly, raise the obvious question about inheritance tax. Isn’t it time to tackle Britain’s problem of hereditary wealth?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

For example, paying companies to furlough workers will, in theory, enable those businesses to quickly bounce back, with a workforce ready to go. But what if the pandemic drags on for years to come? Already governments are talking about how they will claw back the massive increase in government spending. And, whilst large corporations might have the cash to survive, perhaps after a little restructuring, small businesses have the most to lose. They have also borrowed the most. So how does the global economy come back from this? Prof Steve Keen tells Phil Dobbie that it’s a shame this hasn’t been seen as an opportunity to embrace modern monetary theory. But it’s been shunned by governments and central banks who prefer the old way of doing things, which will be highly detrimental to all of us, but particularly those most in need.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

The concept of scarcity is at the very heart of how we are supposed to think. And yet, as Prof Steve Ken explains this week, that scarcity doesn’t really exist. There’s plenty of people available to do jobs, there’s masses of untapped energy potential from the sun. This challenges the idea of opportunity cost – why do A or B when you can do A and B? Ironically, the one recource which is scarce, the environment, is the one element that economics has traditionally blithely ignored. So, if its not to do with managing the allocation of scarce resources, what should be the real definition of economics?

						<description><![CDATA[Boris Johnson has enjoyed photo opportunities this week with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison with the announcement of an ‘in-principle’ free trade agreement between the two countries. It’s the first new one for the UK outside those that already existed through the EU. Great news for biscuit eaters, because Tim Tams are so much better than Penguins. But it’s seen as bad news by UK farmers who adhere to standards that don’t exist in the UK. Like hormone fed beef. So, is it a bad deal? And what about the idea for free trade generally. The argument since Ricardo’s day was that for agricultural it removes the constraint of land and, therefore, the law of diminishing marginal return.

						<description><![CDATA[Today on the podcast Phil Dobbie talks to Steve Keen about the value of things. Supposedly, price is a substitute for value, meaning if someone is prepared to pay more for something then they must value it more. But as they discuss, that only applies if everyone has the same amount of money. A poor household will place greater value, as a proportion of their wealth, on heating their home. A rich household will see extra use of that same resources as a discretionary item that they place little value on, particularly relative to their income. So, is the concept of value another broken element of a modern capitalist economy, and is there a way to allocate resources more effectively? We know, from the Soviet experience, that getting the state to do it creates even worse results.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Output will resume, demand will return, everyone will be back in work and the economy will rapidly expand back to where it was before COVID. Central banks appoint to supply chain disruption in the short term that might create transit inflation, but that’s the only obstacle to the road to recovery. Except, it’s not really working that way. There are forecasts for massive growth this year, but there’s not a lot of data to support these predictions. The US jobs recovery, for example, that was expected to see one million new jobs a month, has slowed right down. And yet the IMF expects the economy to grow by 6.4 percent this year, even though more than eight million Americans who had a job before the pandemic are still looking for work. So, what’s the best approach out of the crisis? What should Treasurers and policy makers the world over be focused on.

There’s also been a call for companies to be taxed where they earn their revenue, rather than declaring profits in countries where tax is lowest. Her reasoning is transparent, of course. She wants to raise corporate taxes in the US and doesn’t want countries to move overseas, or shift their profits out of America. Is it a good idea? Prof Steve Keen likes the idea of a coordinated approach to tax, but can’t see it happening in reality. And can you do it for corporate tax without considering other measures?

						<description><![CDATA[The UK chose to respond to a global pandemic by reducing the amount of money given in foreign aid. Yet COVID-19 is attacking every country in the world. So is climate change. And there will be other viruses to come. For example, Ebola is reported to be out of control in West Africa right now. It is not as infectious as COVID-19, but its fatality rate is way higher (maybe as much as 50 percent). So, how does the west protect the developing world, and itself, through mass vaccinations. Can it fund the vaccines with money it creates. Could we adopt an approach where the pound, the dollar and the Euro fund local production facilities in developing nations, just as the Chinese Yuan is funding belt and road initiatives in many countries. Never before has there been a need for such global cooperation, but how do we fund it?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The UK won’t see an end to lockdown measures until July, but after that the hope of many is that the economy will bounce back quickly. The Bank of England governor has called it a coiled spring. Many are comparing it to the roaring twenties. Part of the reason for this optimism is the argument that many people in the country have saved money during the lockdown, because they haven’t been able to spend on shopping or on overseas holidays. The household savings ratio increased significantly last year. But the figures are misleading, says Prof Steve Keen, on this week’s Debunking Economics podcast. National account figures ignore the servicing of debt, so the gap between income and consumption appears greater than it is in reality. If there was an increase in household savings you’d expect a decrease in the amount of household debt – but that’s not happening, says Steve. There’s a danger that the UK government will assume a rapid recovery, and pull back on stimulus measures that we’ll discover are needed further down the track. All because they ignored the impact of debt.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

James Strain, a Debunking Economics Podcast listener, suggested we talked about the need for de-growth. He said, “It seems to me that this is imperative to our transition to a more sustainable society, but it breaks so many long-held fundamentals in mainstream economics that it's hard to see how we would begin to make the transition.” Most attempts to transition to a green economy have been fairly piecemeal, and don’t acknowledge the need for a move to less consumption. There is an answer, though. Steve Keen wasn’t a supporter of carbon trading at the business level, but he reminds Phil Dobbie of his suggestion that countries allocated carbon points to individuals.

						<description><![CDATA[As the US government argues over whether to spend almost another $1 trillion to stimulate an economy ravaged by COVID-19, and the UK government likely to increase public sector borrowing by GBP215 billion this year, plus central banks lowering interest rates to often below zero, is there a chance our response to COVID-19 has been over the top? Some argue that the response, when the economy finally recovers, will be highly inflationary. Whilst others, Steve Keen included, believe deflation is going to be the issue, and it’ll be a long time before we see inflation rising. Phil Dobbie asks whether we’ll see governments use these inflation fears as an argument to curtail spending in 2021, even though the virus is still spreading and the job is far from done.

						<description><![CDATA[Would the UK be better off with tariffed trade with Europe? The public discourse seems to be focused on how to remove tariffs, but Prof Steve Keen argues that if they are sufficiently high they will encourage domestic production across a variety of industry sectors. The more complex the mix of industries the more self sufficient an economy becomes, which also increases the potential for developing a broader range of exports. The only limitation is scale – but with 65 million people, is Britain big enough to go it alone?

Meanwhile, central banks are seeing the need to step in, with monetary policy being used to fill the gaps where fiscal stimulus isn’t forthcoming. But are they kidding themselves? Can the economic consequences of a pandemic really be filled by a central bank dropping interest rates and buying back a large number of government bonds? In short, the answer is no. In this week’s Debunking Economics podcast Prof Steve Keen discusses the limitations of monetary policy measures with Phil Dobbie.

						<description><![CDATA[Remember climate change? Believe it or to, even with COVID-19 dominating our consciousness, the environment is still a thing. A new report by NGFS - a voluntary group of central bankers concerned about the environment – reckons the world’s global GDP could fall by 25 percent by 2100 if we do not do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Whilst their intent might be right, Steve Keen is concerned that their modelling is wrong. Like most of the economics profession there is no application of systems thinking. Models are too simplistic, ignore tipping points and assume a closed system that doesn’t account for vital external variables. He says the worst of humanity is dragging us into a crisis, exploiting the worst of human behaviour – that we don’t think it will personally affect us.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

For many it’s simply a form of revenue raising for governments, but once you accept that governments can create their own money in their own currency, the role of taxation changes.

In this edition of the Debunking Economics podcast Phil Dobie talks with Prof Steve Keen about how central banks, like the Bank of England, are creating money to cover this extra spending.

						<description><![CDATA[There are all sorts of theories on why there is such a huge discrepancy in income in society, and why it differs from one country to the next. For example, why does the USA have a far worse Gini index (41.4) than Japan (32.9)? Whilst there’s been lots of debate around education, ability, inheritance and opportunity, Blair Fix at York University in Toronto, has concluded that society’s hierarchy is really the overarching influence. If he’s right, that means regulation is the only way to stop income becoming so divided.

						<description><![CDATA[Economists tend to see income as related to the value labour adds to a product or service. By that rationale, during this crisis, nurses helping save lives contribute only a fraction of the CEOs who are watching their companies fall apart. Or is something else driving inequality? It’s largely the growth of the rentier class, says Steve Keen. Phil Dobbie asks whether technology could also be making thinks worse, not better. Is a skilled carpenter forced to charge less because of the availability of mass produced pre-packed furniture? And how can lots of office jobs, which create nothing, pay more than jobs that add directly to the value of something? Even if we fully understand the causes of inequality, will we ever rid ourselves of it?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Companies and governments are racking up massive debts to cope with the impact of COVID-19. Apart from grants for a month or two of partial salaries, the approach has largely been to extend easy short-term credit to those people and businesses struggling to survive. We can expect, once an initial amnesty on repayments has passed, many of these companies will go to the wall, adding to the massive peak in unemployment.&nbsp;How can economies grow when individuals are piled high in debt and governments are forced to use austerity to repay their massive spending programs. Steve Keen has argued that debt needs to be written-off, even before the Corona crisis. Now seems like the right time for society to discuss the benefits of a debt jubilee. The only downside seems to be a significant reduction in the size of the finance sector. Can we live with that?

						<description><![CDATA[Putting the Corona virus aside for a moment, on this week’s Debunking Economics podcast Phil Dobbie talks to Steve Keen about our use of energy. He raises the dilemma of energy prices – if they are too low, usage goes up, expanding our ecological footprint. If you try to counter that by artificially inflating prices, it’s the poor who suffer – as evidenced by the riots in Paris. So, how do we limit our appetite for energy, and can we do it without destroying the world economy? And, importantly, can we do it when power creation and distribution is largely in the hands of private companies?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The EU is debating whether funding to protect economies from the ravages of the Corona virus should come from centrally issued Corona Bonds, or from country-specific debt. In short, should Italy and Spain pay the price of their own misfortune and be landed with the bill to pay off for years to come, whilst totally sovereign nations, like the US, simply issue bonds which can be paid for by the central bank and for which the government has no intention of ever repaying. In this edition of Debunking Economics Phil Dobbie asks Prof Steve Keen whether the inflexibility of the Euro at a time like this will mean countries like Italy will no longer want to be part of it. Could this crisis expedite the demise of the Euro, and, perhaps, the EU itself? If so, is that a good thing?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The US government is now running a debt exceeding $23 trillion. When Donald Trump cam rot office it was already at $18.2 trillion. Regular Debunking Economics listeners will know the ability to rack up debt is a privilege for running the world’s reserve currency. There will always be demand for US dollar bonds.&nbsp;But why do so many countries seek US bonds, and how long can this imbalance continue for? Will there be a time when the US dependence on government debt will come back to bite it – or can we just sit and watch it grow?

						<description><![CDATA[The multiplier is a basic concept of economics. If you come across some money and spend it, the person you spend it with then spends a proportion of it again, the recipient of which also spends some of it. In this week’s podcast Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen about how savings and taxation influence the multiplier, including how different sectors influence the speed of the multiplier. Plus, the commonly held assumption that if money starts circulating too quickly then it’ll assume less value. And what about those who want to accumulate wealth – do they stop the multiplier working?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Today Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen about Milton Friedman’s concept of nominal value ,and how this runs counter to the argument that governments can create money to give the economy a sugar hit. The theory is, we’ll realise that the extra helicopter money has devalued the currency so, after an initial burst of growth, we’ll realise that we’re actually no better off. So where does this theory go wrong? Other than the fact that most money is created by commercial banks, not governments extending their debt.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Steve Keen admits it works at the individual level – you are listening to this podcast at the expense of doing something else, for example. But does the theory work when applied to broader economic thinking? No, says Steve – it’s a case of false equivalences, that renders it meaningless.

						<description><![CDATA[In this edition of the Debunking Economics Podcast Phil Dobbie and Steve Keen discuss business cycles. What causes them and how can we reduce their impact. As Steve explains, neo-classical economics teaches us that the turns in a cycle are caused by exogenous shocks when, in reality, it is the economies own internal cycle that is the root cause. Listen in to find out why business cycles really occur and what we can do to lessen their impact. Plus, Phil asks, why has the cycle stalled all of a sudden, and is it necessarily a bad thing?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Jeremy Corbyn pledged over the weekend that, if he was to become Prime Minister, he would deliver free high-speed full-fibre broadband to everyone by 2030. To do it he would renationalise Open Reach, the network arm of BT. Is any of this a good idea? Phil Dobbie asks Steve Keen whether the government can deliver a solution any faster than the private sector. Surely subsidies are a better approach. And can’t something be learnt from the experience in Australia, where politicking has destroyed the country’s hope of having decent broadband anytime soon. Instead, they have something that’s slower and more expensive than what Britain already has. Even if the government was to manage the roll-out – does it really need to be free? And, if we pursued the principle of Modern Monetary Theory, isn’t there a danger that we’d see more schemes like this, without the fiscal rigour that you’d expect when access to funding is more restrictive?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

There are lots of other factors determining how much you get paid, of course – your age, your education, where you live. Can these gaps ever be resolved? Probably not, says Steve Keen, who says the issue is one of hierarchy.

						<description><![CDATA[Steve Keen and Phil Dobbie had very different ideas about Brexit a few years ago. Now they both agree it’s a vote that should never have happened? So, is it the impact of tariffs?? Is it the impact on foreign investment? Is it impacts on the supply chain? No, many of those things, Steve believes, will be overcome. It’s the one unsurmountable thing that was never discussed ahead of the vote – the one thing that is likely to kill the whole idea. Now they agree on one thing, Brexit will never happen.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[One of the constraints of MMT is that to create more government money you need to have a sovereign currency. That rules out countries in the Eurozone and developing nations heavily reliant on the US dollar. Yet the idea of a Green New Deal is to resolve the issue of climate change using MMT. How can you pursue a global issue with a protocol that only applies in certain parts of the world? And how do you apply it without going down the dangerous road of world government?

But even so, the tariffs and other conditions are being felt in both countries. Steve Keen, who is not a fan of global trade, admits this one is having a destructive effect on the global economy.

						<description><![CDATA[At the Labour party conference recently, UK Shadow Chancellor outlined the policy aim of reducing the working week to 32 hours, with no loss in pay. It’s been lambasted by many, who see it as a way of reducing productivity and costing jobs as businesses fail against overseas competitors with a lower cost base. In this week’s podcast, Prof Steve Keen tells Phil Dobbie that the protagonists have got it wrong. The reason productivity has slowed is because companies are becoming too reliant on low cost labour. A rise in labour costs will encourage more investment in technology, which is what will increase productivity. It’s impossible to increase the productivity of low skilled labour because humans can’t improve their energy output without machines to help them.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Regular listeners will know that most money in circulation is created, bot by central banks, but by commercial banks when they issue loans. In this week’s podcast Phil Dobbie asks Steve Keen how fundamental this is to the slow growth, low interest economy the world has found itself in. Isn’t there a danger that banks will limit the supply when times are bad when, in fact, what the economy needs at those times is more money? Just how much influence do central banks have on the activities of commercial banks these days? Should there be more regulation to control how much money banks create? The answer is yes, but only for money created to fund certain times of loans.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The markets are concerned that we are on the verge of a global recession. How do they know? Not from reading tea-leaves but by studying yield curves. An inverted yield curve has signalled every recession since the 1980s. So, Phil Dobbie asks Steve Keen, does that mean next year is going to be 2008 all over again. In short, no is the answer. 2008 was caused by a collapse in credit-based demand. We’re not seeing the same level of decline in that demand this time. So, the good news is, we might not be heading for a recession. The bad news is it more likely to be a sustained period of stagnation and central banks aren’t helping us out of it.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[A little over 75 years ago World powers signed the Bretton Woods agreement, that saw the US dollar as the planet’s reserve currency, tied to reserves of Gold. In this week’s podcast Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen about how the agreement missed the opportunity to create a separate reserve currency, the approach preferred by John Maynard Keynes. They also discuss why the link to Gold reserves was eventually removed, the role of the IMF and World Bank, both born out of Bretton Woods, and whether now is the right time for another get together to sort out the world’s money system. With President Trump complaining a lot about currency manipulation lately, now seems as good a time as ever.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Economics is still built around the age-old factors of production – land, labour, capital and, perhaps, entrepreneurship. Yet, you can’t run machines without power and you can’t expect workers to function without food. So why isn’t energy implicitly included as one of the key functions of the economy? Clearly it should be. In today’s Debunking Economics podcast Professor Steve Keen explains how he is working with climatologist Tim Garrett and mathematician Matheus Grasselli to develop a new model, one that reflects the importance of energy in the functioning of an economy and the limits it places on global growth.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[As the UK Labour party grapples with ways to reduce the advantage of inherited wealth, so we all start life on an equal footing, Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen about the idea of a land tax.

						<description><![CDATA[Steve Bannister, from the University of Utah, is special guest on this week’s Debunking Economics podcast. He talks to Phil Dobbie about his approach to climate change modelling, based on GDP growth, energy use and carbon emissions. Steve Keen talks about the weakness of other modelling, including Nordhaus’ DICE model. Steve Bannisters model predicts things will even out eventually, but will we be alive to see it? Nope. The answer seems to be, there’s a need for a new source of energy.

						<description><![CDATA[Did your mum and dad teach you to save money rather than borrow? It was better to have cash than be in debt. Yet the whole approach to money has turned on its head. We don’t save as much as we used to. In fact, we borrow to invest. It’s a generational change. In this week’s podcast Phil Dobbie asks Steve Keen whether it’s something we should worry about. And is it any surprise we don’t save, when we’re slugged with bank fees and offered a very low interest rate? More to the point, why would we save when it’s easier to borrow?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Banks were bailed out during the financial crisis in 2008. In the US the Treasury bought billions in mortgage backed securities.

World leaders seem to be know towing to his demands for better trade deals, even though some would argue it smacks of protectionism. So, is Donald Trump doing a good job for America. In this edition of the Debunking Economics podcast Professor Steve Keen describes the US as a Mad Max economy – he tells Phil Dobbie the benefits will be short lived.

						<description><![CDATA[Governments have been using the terms ‘fiscal conservatism’ and ‘austerity’ to bring down government spending. Often it’s meant transferring government commitments (like on education) to private or individual spending (like student loans). Phil Dobbie asks Prof Steve Keen if this a sensible way to encourage growth. If we accept that more spending by government increases the availability of money for people to spend, where do you draw the line?

						<description><![CDATA[Karl Marx got a lot right, but he was wrong about the need to a revolution. In this podcast Prof Steve Keen explains how, if Marx had followed his own theories, he would have realised that there wasn’t a need for a shift to socialism. In this free 36 minute podcast Phil Dobbie talks with Steve about the basis of Marx’s theory, from the Labour Theory of Value through to Use Value and Exchange Value. The conclusion, says Steve, is that “the increasing organic composition of capital (as Marx called it) has no implications for the rate of surplus, has no implications for the rate of profit”. So, no need for a revolution after all.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[We often hear the argument that house prices have risen so much because there’s a lack of supply. Politicians argue that if more land was released to developers more homes would be built and the affordability issue would be fixed. Prof Steve Keen, meanwhile, has argued that it is the willingness of banks to offer massive mortgages that has pushed prices to high. In this podcast Phil Dobbie asks whether supply is still an important factor in the equation.

						<description><![CDATA[The <em>Oxford Review of Economic Policy</em> devoted its entire latest edition to rebuilding macroeconomic theory. That sounds like an acknowledgement that the theories that have guided the profession for decades might be flawed. Perhaps, you might think, it will explain why the global financial crisis happened, why growth has been so slow to pick up and why wages have stagnated. But, as Prof Steve Keen explains to Phil Dobbie, the papers do little other than tweak the edges of conventional theory. It’s far from a fundamental rethink, and some of the basic errors of economics – such as the assumption that the economy will always return to equilibrium – remain unchallenged.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Ever considered that the reason nobody has come up with an answer to how the EU border with Northern Ireland will work, is because there isn’t one. And that’s really bad news for the Republic of Ireland. In this podcast Phil Dobbie suggests that's the case.&nbsp;The choices of a frictionless border or North Ireland remaining within the EU are both unworkable.&nbsp;So what will happen if there’s a hard border? Phil discusses the issue with Prof Steve Keen, an ardent Brexiteer, who believes Britain’s exit will help towards the collapse of the EU and, in particular, the Euro. In the meantime, though, Ireland can expect to feel a lot of pain. Listen to find out why.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[There are two drivers for capitalism – the desire to consume and the desire to accumulate. Whilst the first is as strong as ever, the rising price of assets is making it harder to accumulate. So does this influence how effective capitalism is – will we work as hard if we know we can’t afford to accumulate? Or if they can afford to accumulate do they do it at the cost of consuming? Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen about how consumer behaviour is changing and the impact in the broader economy.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Earlier this year President Trump was complaining that China was guilty of currency manipulation. Cheap prices were giving the Chinese a competitive advantage, evidenced by a trade balance between the two nations that, last year, was $347 billion in favour of China. So what’s the best way of dealing with the strength of the Chinese economy. Prof Steve Keen suggests that the President was right at the onset – reindustrialise and wait for China’s main advantage, cheap labour, to diminish in importance. Sadly, his plans have gone by the wayside, so they’re stuck with Chinese imports for a long while yet.

						<description><![CDATA[It’s 10 years since the start of the global financial crisis, when the UK saw a run on the Northern Rock Building Society. A year letter the contagion spread, with banks falling like flies on both sides of the Atlantic. So what went wrong and are we repeating the mistakes. Phil Dobbie talks to Professor Steve Keen, one of a handful of people who predicted the crisis the first-time round. In this podcast he suggests that, this time, we might not see banks collapsing, but the economic impact will be just as spectacular.&nbsp;<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

A year letter the contagion spread, with banks falling like flies on both sides of the Atlantic. So what went wrong and are we repeating the mistakes. Phil Dobbie talks to Professor Steve Keen, one of a handful of people who predicted the crisis the first-time round. In this podcast he suggests that, this time, we might not see banks collapsing, but the economic impact will be just as spectacular.&nbsp;<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The UK Prime Minister has made noises about reining-in executive pay. Phil Dobbie asks Professor Steve Keen whether high executive salaries are really such a problem. If somebody can demand such a high salary shouldn’t we congratulate them and aspire to do the same ourselves. Isn’t it the politics of envy to think otherwise? Or are they distorting the economy – and perhaps the biggest influence on the value they add to the company doesn’t come from their expertise, but from elsewhere.

						<description><![CDATA[Funding retirement seems to be a global issue. Individual pensions often fall short of the required amount and governments struggle so much with the liability of future pension costs that they keep pushing back the age at which we can retire. Professor Steve Keen believes we have got the whole approach to retirement wrong in so many ways. For a start, by encouraging savings we are pulling money out of the economy. Secondly, pension funds are placing their money in the share market, pushing up the price of equities. In this podcast, with Phil Dobbie, he suggests we return to the idea of state pensions – or a universal basic income – with money created by the government. The problem is, we can’t use that money to buy imported goods to meet the demands of our ageing population. In short, we need to reindustrialise if we are to fix our retirement crisis.&nbsp;<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Australians talk of giving everyone a fair go. But it has different meanings for different people. For some, it implies freeing up the ability for people to get on with making a dollar without government interference. For others, it means the government offers the opportunity for all, presumably through subsidies and access to education. In this edition of the Debunking Economics podcast Phil Dobbie asks Professor Steve Keen how seriously should we take the laissez fare approach in the twenty first century. The answer, it seems, is that maybe the big government approach has gone a little too far.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Yet, few people see it that way. Once you do, it makes sense to see tax as an instrument that manages the strength of the economy, in unison with interest rates. Look at it like that and you see that tax should be low when economic growth is slow, not higher to cover the subsequent shortfall in government revenue.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The world’s Central Bankers have been meeting up in Portugal this week and seem to have colluded on the idea of raising interest rates sometime soon. It looks like the UK, Europe and Canada are in on it but, Professor Steve Keen reckons, they’ll soon be eating humble pie. Any rise in rates right now will quickly be reversed, because the bankers are ignoring the role of credit.

The lenders will receive their payments, whilst Greece continues to live through tough austerity measures in the vain hope of the economy recovering at some point. That seems unlikely – GDP per capita is sliding and the smarter folk are leaving the country. Phil Dobbie asks Professor Steve Keen how this particular Greek tragedy will end.

						<description><![CDATA[It’s the catch cry for those who like to spread fear – Corbyn in power would take Britain back to the 1970s, when Britain experienced runaway inflation, the three day week, class hatred and soviet style stagnation. Yet, as Prof Steve Keen explains to Phil Dobbie in this free edition of the Debunking Economics podcast, the downturn in the seventies was less to do with government policy and more to do with a turnaround in credit. Households that had been increasing their borrowing in the late sixties, started to pull back, taking money out of the economy. If you’re not convinced the seventies situation was the result of a Labour government and powerful unions, you have to ask, why was exactly the same thing happening in most of the western world?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[In the UK salaries are now rising slower than inflation – which means living standards are going backwards. Around the world salaries seem to have stagnated, even though unemployment is low. Conventional economic theory suggests that more competition for employees should push wages higher. Phil Dobbie asks Professor Steve Keen why that’s not happening. The cause, Steve suggests, is to do with the demise of union power and the rise of the financier.

						<description><![CDATA[A Debunking Economics listener asked for a podcast on the role of Shadow Banks. In particular, he wanted to know if shadow banks create money in the same way as conventional banks. The quick answer is, no, because they are not able to create deposits – but they do increase the ability for banks to extend more loans. Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen about the role of shadow banks and asks, do they need to be curtailed? And, if so, how? It’s an issue that’s been flagged by Janet Yellen, Governor of the Federal Reserve in the US, who suggested that the influence of shadow banking on the financial system is hard to measure.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Modern Monetary Theory states that’s, because the government of a country is the monopoly supplier of money, it has an unlimited capacity to pay for things and provide funds for other sectors. If the theory is right, why not provide enough money to ensure there is full employment, so full use is made of available labour? Phil Dobbie asks Professor Steve Keen whether he is a supporter of MMT. It seems he is, in part, but departs from the ideology when it comes to the theory relating to exports and imports.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Figures out in the US last week showed the unemployment rate had dropped to just 4.5 percent, a long way from the 10% rate back in 2009. Yet Donald Trump won an election, in part, because he was there to protect jobs for Americans. Phil Dobbie asks Prof Steve Keen What’s the problem when so many seem to be gainfully employed?

						<description><![CDATA[Mark Perry, Professor of Economics and Finance at the University of Michigan, believes that raising the minimum wage will push costs up so high companies won’t be able to afford them. He wrote in his blog, “a $15 minimum wage maximizes the probability that an unskilled worker will be unemployed at $0.00 an hour instead of being gainfully employed”. So, is that the case? Prof Steve Keen argues he is making the mistake of many economists, applying a micro-economic argument to macro-economics.

						<description><![CDATA[In the seventies US government debt was less than 40 percent of GDP. Now, it’s over 100 percent. And the US is still to pass a change to the debt ceiling, which inhibits the government’s ability to spend more money. In this edition of the Debunking Economics podcast, Phil Dobbie asks Professor Steve Keen when government debt becomes a significant issue. Conventional economics suggests too much spending can raise inflation, which reduces the attractiveness of government bonds, making it more difficult to raise money. And what about a reduction in a country’s credit rating? Steve suggests we think in too linear fashion on the issue. But there is a simple fix if the problem ever gets insurmountable.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Which comes first, demand or supply? If you want to grow an economy should you offer money or tax cuts to increase demand, or should you fund jobs to create supply and wages. Donald Trump, like many politicians before him, believes cutting taxes will make more spending power available to create more jobs. Is he right, when many classical economists have argued the opposite – that job creation is the key to spending power.

						<description><![CDATA[Donald Trump has talked about a 20 percent tax on exports from Mexico to help pay for the wall, but has also spoken about a broader tax on all imports. Many fear it’s a form of protectionism that could spark a trade war, but perhaps they are misunderstanding the intent of Trump’s plan. It’s possible he is following the thinking of Oxford professor Michael Devereux who argues that corporate tax should be applied where consumption happens, rather than where profit is generated. That would mean, irrespective of where goods are made, if they are consumed in America, companies would be taxed. Companies that tried to manufacture elsewhere and sell to the US could end up being taxed in both countries, so it heightens the incentive to produce locally.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

In this episode, Phil Dobbie explores the idea of stocking up with gold, with Professor Steve Keen. Is gold safer than keeping money in a bank? Is it premature to buy gold right now? What are the signs that an economic downturn and banking crisis is occurring?

						<description><![CDATA[It’s very easy to look at the big salaries in the city and compare it to the average wage and assume bankers are taking us for a ride. But, for time immemorial we have needed money as a more effective means of trade than bartering. Who wants a chicken egg in exchange for today’s paper? So, banks emerged as the intermediary that enables trade. But, as Prof Steve Keen explains to Phil Dobbie, banks don’t just act as an intermediary, they also create money, and focus on encouraging us all to build up debt. So, can we regulate banks to ensure they work in ways which are best for the community? Part of the answer, says Steve, is to see them focus more on equity than loans.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Phil Dobbie asks Professor Steve Keen about the role of public sector spending. We’ve learnt that the government can create money, through its central bank, and this is, in effect, pumping new money into the economy. The alternate approaches, tax increases or austerity, pull money out of the economy. So public sector spending is a good thing, particularly when the economy is experiencing hardship – but how do they determine what’s best to spend money on. Aren’t government’s notoriously bad at decided how and where to inject funds? Isn’t there a need to focus on productivity rather than pushing up wages?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The rich poor gap in modern society isn’t just related to income. In fact, recent statistics in the UK point to a narrowing of the income gap since the financial crisis. The bigger issue is the inheritance of wealth, giving some a head start and inflating house prices beyond the reach of many. In this edition Phil Dobbie asks Prof. Steve Keen whether a heftier inheritance tax is the answer. There’s discussion of the problems with that approach, how land tax is similarly distortionary, and a suggestion of a better way of narrowing the gap – but we’d better do something about it, before civil unrest reaches fever pitch.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>Journalist Phil Dobbie and economist Steve Keen agree on lots of things, but fall on either side of the Brexit camp. One believes Britain should have remained to fight EU bureaucracy from the inside, the other suggests the community is fundamentally flawed, along with the concept of free trade, and will collapse soon anyway.</p><p>In this FREE podcast Phil questions Steve on whether, irrespective of the ideology, Brexit will inflict a lot of short term hurt on many of those who voted for it. There’s also discussion on Theresa May’s 12 point plan, which both agree seems to ignore the opportunity and focuses on making the mistakes of the European partnership in other parts of the world. In other words, will Theresa May just make things worse?</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

There’s also discussion on Theresa May’s 12 point plan, which both agree seems to ignore the opportunity and focuses on making the mistakes of the European partnership in other parts of the world. In other words, will Theresa May just make things worse?</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The media, governments and mainstream economists are obsessed with concerns over government debt. Yet in the UK and most other developed nations private debt is a bigger issue. Why is it that we expect our governments to operate without borrowing, whilst many of us are mortgaged to the hilt? In this edition of The Debunking Economics podcast we examine the two types of debt and the consequences of each rising to high levels. Also, why does one tend to rise while the other falls? What can we learn from the 1920s? And why is the trade balance a related, but more important, issue.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[Back in 1817, in his catchy titled book ‘On the principle of political economy and taxation’, David Ricardo gave the mathematical argument for free trade based on comparative advantage. The argument goes that we’d all be better off if countries focused on what they’re best at producing, even if someone else might do a better. In this episode Prof Steve Keen explains to Phil Dobbie why the theory doesn’t hold – we only need to look at the industrialisation of Japan as an example.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

They are upset because they are not seeing their lifestyle improve, yet the rich elite seem to be accumulating the wealth with little or none of it trickling down to the rest of the population. In this episode of The Debunking Economics podcast Steve Keen says money needs to be forced to circulate rather than accumulate. But how do you do that? Phil Dobbie asks Steve whether higher taxes are part of the solution, which would be ironic given the US President elect has done a good job of evading them.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
