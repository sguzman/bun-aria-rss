										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Python, a data class is a class that is designed to only hold data values. They aren&#8217;t different from regular classes, but they usually don&#8217;t have any other methods. They are typically used to store information that will be passed between different parts of a program or a system.</p>
<p>However, when creating classes to work only as data containers, writing the <code>__init__</code> method repeatedly can generate a great amount of work and potential errors.</p>
<p>The <code>dataclasses </code> module,  a feature introduced in Python 3.7, provides a way to create data classes in a simpler manner without the need to write methods. </p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll see how to take advantage of this module to quickly create new classes that already come not only with <code>__init__</code>, but several other methods already implemented so we don&#8217;t need to implement them manually. Also, we can do that with just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>We expect you to have some intermediate python experience, including an understanding of how to create classes and object-oriented programming in general.</p>
<h2>Using the <code>dataclasses</code> Module</h2>
<p>As a starting example, let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re implementing a class to store data about a certain group of people. For each person, we&#8217;ll have attributes such as name, age, height, and email address. This is what a regular class looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Person():
    def __init__(self, name, age, height, email):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.height = height
        self.email = email</code></pre>
<p>If we use the <code>dataclasses</code> module, however, we need to import <code>dataclass</code> to use it as a decorator in the class we&#8217;re creating. When we do that, we no longer need to write the <strong>init</strong> function, only specify the attributes of the class and their types. Here&#8217;s the same <code>Person</code> class, implemented in this way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person():
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str</code></pre>
<p>We can also set default values to the class attributes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass
class Person():
    name: str = &#039;Joe&#039;
    age: int = 30
    height: float = 1.85
    email: str = &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;

print(Person())</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Person(name=&#039;Joe&#039;, age=30, height=1.85, email=&#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)</code></pre>
<p>As a reminder, Python doesn&#8217;t accept a non-default attribute after default in both class and functions, so this would throw an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass
class Person():
    name: str = &#039;Joe&#039;
    age: int = 30
    height: float = 1.85
    email: str </code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">

        506 

    TypeError: non-default argument &#039;email&#039; follows default argument</code></pre>
<p>Once the class is defined, it&#8217;s easy to instantiate a new object and access its attributes, just like with a standard class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">person = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)
print(person.name)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Joe</code></pre>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve used regular data types like string, integer, and float; we can also combine <code>dataclass</code> with the <code>typing</code> modules to create attributes of any kind in the class. For instance, let&#8217;s add a <code>house_coordinates</code> attribute to the <code>Person</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class Person():
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str
    house_coordinates: Tuple

print(Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;, (40.748441, -73.985664)))</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Person(name=&#039;Joe&#039;, age=25, height=1.85, email=&#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;, house_coordinates=(40.748441, -73.985664))</code></pre>
<p>Following the same logic, we can create a data class to hold multiple instances of the <code>Person</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import List

@dataclass
class People():
    people: List[Person]</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the <code>people</code> attribute in the <code>People</code> class is defined as a list of instances of the <code>Person</code> class. For example, we could instantiate an object of  <code>People</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">joe = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;, (40.748441, -73.985664))
mary = Person(&#039;Mary&#039;, 43, 1.67, &#039;mary@dataquest.io&#039;, (-73.985664, 40.748441))

print(People([joe, mary]))</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    People(people=[Person(name=&#039;Joe&#039;, age=25, height=1.85, email=&#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;, house_coordinates=(40.748441, -73.985664)), Person(name=&#039;Mary&#039;, age=43, height=1.67, email=&#039;mary@dataquest.io&#039;, house_coordinates=(-73.985664, 40.748441))])</code></pre>
<p>This allows us to define the attribute as being any type we want, but also a combination of data types.</p>
<h2>Representation and Comparisons</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, <code>dataclass</code> implements not only the <code>__init__</code> method, but several others, including the <code>__repr__</code> method. In a regular class, we use this method to display a representation of an object in the class.</p>
<p>For instance, we&#8217;d define the method as in the example below when we call the object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Person():
    def __init__(self, name, age, height, email):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.height = height
        self.email = email

    def __repr__(self):
        return (f&#039;{self.__class__.__name__}(name={self.name}, age={self.age}, height={self.height}, email={self.email})&#039;)

person = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)
print(person)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Person(name=Joe, age=25, height=1.85, email=joe@dataquest.io)</code></pre>
<p>When using <code>dataclass</code>, however, there&#8217;s no need to write any of that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass
class Person():
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str    

person = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)
print(person)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Person(name=&#039;Joe&#039;, age=25, height=1.85, email=&#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that without all that code, the output is equivalent to the one from the standard Python class.</p>
<p>We can always overwrite it if we want to customize the representation of our class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass
class Person():
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str

    def __repr__(self):
        return (f&#039;&#039;&#039;This is a {self.__class__.__name__} called {self.name}.&#039;&#039;&#039;)

person = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)
print(person)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    This is a Person called Joe.</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the output of the representation is customized.</p>
<p>When it comes to comparisons, the <code>dataclasses</code> module makes our lives easier. For example, we can directly compare two instances of a class just like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass
class Person():
    name: str = &#039;Joe&#039;
    age: int = 30
    height: float = 1.85
    email: str = &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;

print(Person() == Person())</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    True</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we used default attributes to make the example shorter.</p>
<p>In this case, the comparison is valid because the <code>dataclass</code> creates behind the scenes an <code>__eq__</code> method, which performs the comparison. Without the decorator, we&#8217;d have to create this method ourselves.</p>
<p>The same comparison would result in a different outcome if using a standard Python class, even though the classes are in fact equal to each other:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Person():
    def __init__(self, name=&#039;Joe&#039;, age=30, height=1.85, email=&#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.height = height
        self.email = email

print(Person() == Person())</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    False</code></pre>
<p>Without the use of the <code>dataclass</code> decorator, that class doesn&#8217;t test whether two instances are equal. So, by default, Python will use the object&#8217;s <code>id</code> to make the comparison, and, as we see below, they are different:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(id(Person()))
print(id(Person()))</code></pre>
<pre><code>1734438049008
1734438050976</code></pre>
<p>All this means that we&#8217;d have to write an <code>__eq__</code> method that makes this comparison:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Person():
    def __init__(self, name=&#039;Joe&#039;, age=30, height=1.85, email=&#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.height = height
        self.email = email

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Person):
            return (self.name, self.age,
                    self.height, self.email) == (other.name, other.age,
                                                 other.height, other.email)
        return NotImplemented

print(Person() == Person())</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    True</code></pre>
<p>Now we see the two objects are equal to each other, but we had to write more code to get this result.</p>
<h2>The <code>@dataclass</code> Parameters </h2>
<p>As we saw above, when using the <code>dataclass</code> decorator, the <code>__init__</code>, <code>__repr__</code>, and <code>__eq__</code> methods are implemented for us. The creation of all these methods is set by the <code>init</code>, <code>repr</code>, and <code>eq</code> parameters of <code>dataclass</code>. These three parameters are <code>True</code> by default. If one of them is created inside the class, then the parameter is ignored.</p>
<p>However, we have other parameters of <code>dataclass</code> that we should look at before moving on:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>order</code>: enables sorting of the class as we&#8217;ll see in the next section. The default is <code>False</code>.</li>
<li><code>frozen</code>: When <code>True</code>, the values inside the instance of the class can&#8217;t be modified after it&#8217;s created. The default is <code>False</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few other methods that you can check in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.dataclass">documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>When working with data, we often need to sort values. In our scenario, we may want to sort our different people based on some attribute. For that, we&#8217;ll use the <code>order</code> parameter of the <code>dataclass</code> decorator mentioned above which enables sorting in the class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass(order=True)
class Person():
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str</code></pre>
<p>When the <code>order</code> parameter is set to <code>True</code>, it automatically generates the <code>__lt__</code> (less than), <code>__le__</code> (less or equal), <code>__gt__</code> (greater than), and <code>__ge__</code> (greater or equal) methods used for sorting.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s instantiate our <code>joe</code> and <code>mary</code> objects to see if one is greater than the other:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">joe = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)
mary = Person(&#039;Mary&#039;, 43, 1.67, &#039;mary@dataquest.io&#039;)

print(joe &gt; mary)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    False</code></pre>
<p>Python tells us that <code>joe</code> is not greater than <code>mary</code>, but based on what criteria? The class compares the objects as tuples containing their attributes, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print((&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;) &gt; (&#039;Mary&#039;, 43, 1.67, &#039;mary@dataquest.io&#039;))</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    False</code></pre>
<p>As the letter &quot;J&quot; comes before &quot;M&quot;, it says the <code>joe &lt; mary</code>. If the names were the same, it would move to the next element in each tuple. As it is, it&#8217;s comparing the objects alphabetically. Although that can make some sense depending on the problem we&#8217;re dealing with, we want to be able to control how the objects will be sorted.</p>
<p>To achieve that, we&#8217;ll take advantage of two other features of the <code>dataclasses</code> module.</p>
<p>The first is the <code>field</code> function. This function is used to customize one attribute of a data class individually, which allows us to define new attributes that will depend on another attribute and will only be created after the object is instantiated.</p>
<p>In our sorting problem, we&#8217;ll use <code>field</code> to create a <code>sort_index</code> attribute in our class. This attribute can only be created after the object is instantiated and is what <code>dataclasses</code> uses for sorting:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass(order=True)
class Person():
    sort_index: int = field(init=False, repr=False)
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str</code></pre>
<p>The two arguments that we passed as <code>False</code> state that this attribute isn&#8217;t in the <code>__init__</code> and that it shouldn&#8217;t be displayed when we call <code>__repr__</code>. There are other parameters in the <code>field</code> function that you can check in the documentation.</p>
<p>After we&#8217;ve  referenced this new attribute, we&#8217;ll use the second new tool: the <code>__post_int__</code> method. As it goes by the name, this method is executed right after the <code>__init__</code> method. We&#8217;ll use <code>__post_int__</code> to define the <code>sort_index</code>, right after the creation of the object. As an example, let&#8217;s say we want to compare people based on their age. Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass(order=True)
class Person():
    sort_index: int = field(init=False, repr=False)
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str

    def __post_init__(self):
        self.sort_index = self.age</code></pre>
<p>If we make the same comparison, we know that Joe is younger than Mary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">joe = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)
mary = Person(&#039;Mary&#039;, 43, 1.67, &#039;mary@dataquest.io&#039;)

print(joe &gt; mary)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    False</code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to sort people by height, we&#8217;d use this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass(order=True)
class Person():
    sort_index: float = field(init=False, repr=False)
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str

    def __post_init__(self):
        self.sort_index = self.height

joe = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)
mary = Person(&#039;Mary&#039;, 43, 1.67, &#039;mary@dataquest.io&#039;)

print(joe &gt; mary)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    True</code></pre>
<p>Joe is taller than Mary. Notice that we set <code>sort_index</code> as a <code>float</code>.</p>
<p>We were able to implement sorting in our data class without the need to write multiple methods.</p>
<h2>Working with Immutable Data Classes</h2>
<p>Another parameter of <code>@dataclass</code> that we mentioned above is <code>frozen</code>. When set to <code>True</code>, <code>frozen</code> doesn&#8217;t allow us to modify the attributes of an object after it&#8217;s created.</p>
<p>With <code>frozen=False</code>, we can easily perform such modification:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass()
class Person():
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str

joe = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)

joe.age = 35
print(joe)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Person(name=&#039;Joe&#039;, age=35, height=1.85, email=&#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)</code></pre>
<p>We created a <code>Person</code> object and then modified the <code>age</code> attribute without any problems.</p>
<p>However, when set to <code>True</code>, any attempt to modify the object throws an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Person():
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str

joe = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)

joe.age = 35
print(joe)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FrozenInstanceError: cannot assign to field &#039;age&#039;</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the error message states <code>FrozenInstanceError</code>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a trick that can modify the value of the immutable data class . If our class contains a mutable attribute, this attribute can change even though the class is frozen. This may seem like it doesn&#8217;t make sense, but let&#8217;s look at an example.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s recall the <code>People</code> class that we created earlier in this article, but now let&#8217;s make it immutable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass(frozen=True)
class People():
    people: List[Person]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Person():
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str</code></pre>
<p>We then create two instances of the <code>Person</code> class and use them to create an instance of <code>People</code> that we&#8217;ll name <code>two_people</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">joe = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)
mary = Person(&#039;Mary&#039;, 43, 1.67, &#039;mary@dataquest.io&#039;)

two_people = People([joe, mary])
print(two_people)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    People(people=[Person(name=&#039;Joe&#039;, age=25, height=1.85, email=&#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;), Person(name=&#039;Mary&#039;, age=43, height=1.67, email=&#039;mary@dataquest.io&#039;)])</code></pre>
<p>The <code>people</code> attribute in the <code>People</code> class is a list. We can easily access the values in this list in the <code>two_people</code> object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(two_people.people[0])</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Person(name=&#039;Joe&#039;, age=25, height=1.85, email=&#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)</code></pre>
<p>So, even though both <code>Person</code> and <code>People</code> classes are immutable, the list is not, which means we can change the values in it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">two_people.people[0] = Person(&#039;Joe&#039;, 35, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)
print(two_people.people[0])</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Person(name=&#039;Joe&#039;, age=35, height=1.85, email=&#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the age is now 35.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t change the attributes of any object of the immutable classes, but we replaced the first element of the list with a different one, and the list is mutable.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all the attributes of the class should also be immutable in order to safely work with immutable data classes.</p>
<h2>Inheritance with <code>dataclasses</code></h2>
<p>The <code>dataclasses</code> module also supports inheritance, which means we can create a data class that uses the attributes of another data class. Still using our <code>Person</code> class, we&#8217;ll create a new <code>Employee</code> class that inherits all the attributes from <code>Person</code>.<br />
So we have <code>Person</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass(order=True)
class Person():
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str</code></pre>
<p>And the new <code>Employee</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass(order=True)
class Employee(Person):
    salary: int
    departament: str</code></pre>
<p>Now we can create an object of the <code>Employee</code> class using all the attributes of the <code>Person</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(Employee(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;, 100000, &#039;Marketing&#039;))</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Employee(name=&#039;Joe&#039;, age=25, height=1.85, email=&#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;, salary=100000, departament=&#039;Marketing&#039;)</code></pre>
<p>From now on we can use everything we saw in this article in the <code>Employee</code> class as well.</p>
<p>Take note of the default attributes. Let&#8217;s say we have default attributes in <code>Person</code>, but not in <code>Employee</code>. This scenario, as in the code below, raises an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@dataclass
class Person():
    name: str = &#039;Joe&#039;
    age: int = 30
    height: float = 1.85
    email: str = &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;

@dataclass(order=True)
class Employee(Person):
    salary: int
    departament: str

print(Employee(&#039;Joe&#039;, 25, 1.85, &#039;joe@dataquest.io&#039;, 100000, &#039;Marketing&#039;))</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we saw how the <code>dataclasses</code> module is a very powerful tool to create data classes in a quick, intuitive way. Although we&#8217;ve seen a lot in this article, the module contains many more tools, and there&#8217;s always more to learn about it.</p>
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define a class using <code>dataclasses</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use default attributes and their rules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a representation method</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare data classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sort data classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use inheritance with data classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with immutable data classes</p>
</li>
</ul>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="h-why-learn-tableau">Why Learn Tableau?</h2>
<p>Tableau is one of the most popular business intelligence tools in the world — it is one of the top 3 leaders in the market, <a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/data-analytics/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-analytics-and-business-intelligence-platforms-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as ranked by Gartner</a>. </p>
<p>In 2022, more than <a href="https://www.slintel.com/tech/business-intelligence-bi/tableausoftware-vs-microsoftpowerbi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30,000 organizations </a>use Tableau, and more than <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3258348988&amp;geoId=92000000&amp;keywords=tableau" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200,000 job vacancies on LinkedIn</a> require at least some knowledge of it. Tableau is not only regularly used by data professionals, such as business analysts and data analysts, but also by a broad range of others, such as digital marketers, consumer experience specialists, and more.</p>
<p>By learning Tableau, you can get a valuable skill that will help you grow your career. The best way to prove your skills to employers and stand out from the crowd in interviews is to obtain the <a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/certification/desktop-specialist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tableau Specialist Certification</a> and build a portfolio of projects. </p>
<p>In this article, we’ll provide you with 5 steps to prepare you for certification, give you experience to master Tableau, and, finally, help you build a project portfolio. These 5 steps will grow your career. </p>
<h2 id="h-how-to-learn-tableau">How to Learn Tableau?</h2>
<p>With the rise in Tableau’s popularity, the options for training have grown rapidly. Selecting the right way to learn Tableau can be difficult.</p>
<p>Watching workshops on YouTube or reading specialist blogs on the internet seem like attractive options, but mastering Tableau requires deep knowledge and hands-on experience — the rest can be learned on the job. </p>
<p>If you want to learn Tableau, get certified, and build your portfolio in just a few months, we’ve created a series of Tableau courses that will teach you everything you need.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Download Tableau and get used to the interface</h3>
<p>There are both free and paid versions of Tableau available for download. For students, or people who just want a 14-day trial, Tableau can be downloaded <a href="https://www.tableau.com/support/releases/desktop/2022.2.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> for PCs and Macs. After the 14-day trial, users can convert to a paid license. For those who want long-term access without paying, there’s <a href="https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/products/public/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tableau Public</a>. As long as you aren&#8217;t working with sensitive data and are able to always save to the cloud, Tableau Public is a fantastic choice.</p>
<p>Once Tableau is installed and ready to go, we can familiarize ourselves with the Tableau interface by following the <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/guides/get-started-tutorial/en-us/get-started-tutorial-home.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting guide</a>. It’s a good idea to learn the interface before jumping into detailed Tableau online training, like <a href="http://placeholder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dataquest’s first Tableau Course</a>.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Start building charts and dashboards</h3>
<p>Jumping  into data sources and building charts and dashboards is the most fun thing to do with Tableau . But that’s easier said than done! A clean datasource is important when learning how to create visual analytics. Tableau offers great options for data cleansing and manipulation, but that’s probably not the first thing we want to learn. Instead, let&#8217;s find a clean datasource to work with. There are plenty of options on <a href="https://kaggle.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaggle.com</a>, such as <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/board-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this dataset</a> on board game rankings, or this data on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackywang529/toronto-bikeshare-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toronto’s 2017 bike share usage</a>. Dataquest has a great course in the Tableau track about  <a href="http://placeholder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shaping and designing a dashboard</a>.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Publish and share your dashboards</h3>
<p>Sharing our insights with others is even more rewarding than building dashboards. There are two ways to share a dashboard: statically or interactively. </p>
<p>Sharing a static dashboard can be done by exporting it as a PDF, Image, or Powerpoint. When doing this, we lose all interactivity, including filters, click actions and tooltips (hover-overs). Still, this is a good sharing method because it’s simple and software agnostic. All of these options can be found in the top line Dashboard menu. </p>
<p>If we want our data consumers to have interactivity, we need to publish our workbooks to Tableau Public, Online or Server. Only Tableau Public allows us to publish and share without paying for a membership, so it’s our best option while building a portfolio. Tableau has a <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/guides/get-started-tutorial/en-us/get-started-tutorial-share.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great resource</a> for the best way to share your dashboards, so pick the path that works best for you. </p>
<h3>Step 4: Build your portfolio</h3>
<p>Hopefully, the thrill of publishing the first dashboard has been a positive experience. It’s time to think about growing our Tableau portfolio. To make the Tableau learning experience engaging and rewarding,  it’s helpful to work on something enjoyable. Too many online  Tableau classes use the perfect superstore sales dataset, which is neither realistic, nor inspiring. Instead, try  using one of the many dataset aggregators to find data you’re passionate about. We’ve used <a href="https://kaggle.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaggle</a> a few times. There’s also the site <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our World in Data</a> and the Dataquest article <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>24 Free Datasets for Building an Irresistible Portfolio (2022)</em></a>. Whether it be sports, politics, films, or any other passion, there’s a good chance that a free dataset exists on the topic. </p>
<h3>Step 5: Get certified </h3>
<p>To complete your learning journey,  consider a <a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/certification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tableau professional desktop certification</a>. The two levels of desktop certification are <a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/certification/desktop-specialist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desktop specialist</a> and <a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/certification/certified-data-analyst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certified data analyst</a>. The specialist exam is a multiple choice test, while the certified data analyst exam is a combination of multiple choice and problem-solving questions. Both are great resume boosters and offer a learning milestone to build confidence in your Tableau skills. There are options for preparing here:  <a href="https://mkt.tableau.com/files/TableauDesktopSpecialist_ExamGuide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exam prep doc from Tableau (guide)</a>.</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />
<h3>Takeaway</h3>
<p>Acquiring Tableau skills and getting certified can take anywhere from 1 to 6 months–or more. Some people learn very quickly,  while others may take longer, due to other life commitments. It all depends on your timeline and your dedication to learn Tableau at the pace you want. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Building projects is an extremely succesful way to learn, but building Python projects for beginners can be difficult. Learn how to build with success!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I could give my former self one piece of advice when I was struggling to learn Python as a beginner, it would be this: <strong>create more Python projects</strong>.</p>
<p>Learning Python can be difficult. You can spend time reading a textbook or watching videos but then struggle to actually put what you&rsquo;ve learned into practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you might spend a ton of time learning syntax but eventually get bored or lose motivation. (That happened to me. A lot).</p>
<p>To increase your chances of success, you <strong>must</strong> build Python projects. Why? Because building fun projects will accelerate your learning and keep motivation at an all-time high. It&#8217;s the ultimate learning tool.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of over 50 incredible Python projects you can try yourself or use as inspiration. There are projects for beginner, intermediate, and advanced learners.</p>
<h2>Before You Build Your First Python Project</h2>
<p>If you have some programming experience, you might be able to dive straight into building a project.

<h2>Additional Python Project Ideas</h2>
<p>Still haven&rsquo;t found a project idea that appeals to you? Here are many more, separated by experience level.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t tutorials; they&rsquo;re ideas that you&rsquo;ll have to dig into and research on your own, but that&rsquo;s part of the fun! And it&rsquo;s part of the natural process of learning to code and working as a programmer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pros use Google for answers&nbsp;all the time&nbsp;&mdash; so don&rsquo;t be afraid to dive in and get your hands dirty!</p>
<h3>Python Project Ideas: Beginner Level</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a code generator.</strong> This can that take text as input, replaces each letter with another letter, and outputs the &ldquo;encoded&rdquo; message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a countdown calculator.</strong> Write some code that can take two dates as input, and then calculate the amount of time between them. This will be a great way to familiarize yourself with Python&rsquo;s datetime module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write a sorting method.</strong> Given a list, can you write some code that sorts it alphabetically, or numerically? Yes, Python has this functionality built-in, but see if you can do it without using sort()!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build an interactive quiz.</strong> Which Avenger are you? Build a personality or recommendation quiz that asks users some questions, stores their answers, and then performs some kind of calculation to give the user a personalized result based on their answers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tic-Tac-Toe by Text.&nbsp;</strong>Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game that&rsquo;s playable like a text adventure. Can you make it print a text-based representation of the board after each move?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make a temperature/measurement converter.</strong> Write a script that can convert Fahrenheit to Celcius and back, or inches to centimeters and back, etc. How far can you take it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a counter app.</strong> Take your first steps into the world of UI by building a very simple app that counts up by one each time a user clicks a button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a number-guessing game.</strong> Think of this as a bit like a text adventure, but with numbers. How far can you take it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build an alarm clock.</strong> This is borderline beginner/intermediate, but it&rsquo;s worth trying to build an alarm clock for yourself. Can you create different alarms? A snooze function?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Python Project Ideas: Intermediate Level</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Build an upgraded code generator.</strong> Starting with the project mentioned in the beginner section, see what you can do to make it more sophisticated. Can you make it generate different kinds of codes? Can you create a &ldquo;decoder&rdquo; app that reads encoded messages if the user inputs a secret key? Can you create a more sophisticated code that goes beyond simple letter-replacement?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make your Tic-Tac-Toe game clickable.</strong> Building off the beginner project, now make a version of Tic-Tac-Toe that has an actual UI &nbsp;you&rsquo;ll use by clicking on open squares. Challenge: can you write a simple &ldquo;AI&rdquo; opponent for a human player to play against?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scrape some data to analyze.</strong> This could really be anything, from any website you like. The web is full of interesting data, and if you learn a little about web-scraping, you can collect some really unique datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a clock website.</strong> How close can you get it to real-time? Can you implement different time zone selectors, and add in the &ldquo;countdown calculator&rdquo; functionality to calculate lengths of time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automate some of your job.&nbsp;</strong>This will vary, but many jobs have some kind of repetitive process that you can automate!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automate your personal habits.</strong> Do you want to remember to stand up once every hour during work? How about writing some code that generates unique workout plans based on your goals and preferences? There are a variety of simple apps you can build for yourself to automate or enhance different aspects of your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a simple web browser.</strong> Build a simple UI that accepts &nbsp;URLs &nbsp;and loads webpages. PyWt will be helpful here! Can you add a &ldquo;back&rdquo; button, bookmarks, and other cool features?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write a notes app.</strong> Create an app that helps people write and store notes. Can you think of some interesting and unique features to add?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a typing tester.</strong> This should show the user some text, and then challenge them to type it &mdash; while timing them and scoring them on for accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a &ldquo;site updated&rdquo; notification system.</strong> Ever get annoyed when you have to refresh a website to see if an out-of-stock product has been relisted, or to see if any news has been posted? Write a Python script that automatically checks a given URL for updates and informs you when it identifies one. (Be careful not to overload the servers of whatever site you&rsquo;re checking, though &mdash; keep the time interval reasonable between each check).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recreate your favorite board game in Python.</strong> There are tons of options here, from something simple like Checkers all the way up to Risk &mdash; or even more modern and advanced games like Ticket to Ride or Settlers of Catan. How close can you get to the real thing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a Wikipedia explorer.</strong> Build an app that displays a random Wikipedia page. The challenge here is in the details: can you add user-selected categories? Can you try a different &ldquo;rabbit hole&rdquo; version of the app, wherein each article is randomly selected from the articles linked in the previous article? This might seem simple, but it can actually require some serious web-scraping skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Python Project Ideas: Advanced Level</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a stock market prediction app.</strong> For this one, you&rsquo;ll need a source of stock market data and some machine learning skills, but many people have tried this, so there&rsquo;s plenty of source code out there to work from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a chatbot.&nbsp;</strong>The challenge here isn&rsquo;t so much making the chatbot as it is making it&nbsp;good. Can you, for example, implement some natural language processing techniques to make it sound more natural and spontaneous?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Program a robot.</strong> This requires some hardware (which isn&rsquo;t usually free), but there are many affordable options out there &mdash; and many learning resources, too. Definitely look into <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> if you&rsquo;re not already thinking along those lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build an image recognition app.</strong> Starting with handwriting recognition is a good idea &mdash; Dataquest even has <a href="https://app.dataquest.io/m/244">a guided project to help with that!</a> &mdash; but once you&rsquo;ve learned it, you can take it to the next level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make a price prediction model.</strong> Select an industry or product that interests you, and build a machine learning model that predicts price changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create your own sentiment analysis model.</strong> Sure, there are many pre-built ones available, but can you collect a large corpus of text data and build one of your own? (Or, less challenging: optimize an existing sentiment analysis model for the particular text you&rsquo;re analyzing.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create an interactive map.</strong> This will require a mix of data skills and UI creation skills. Your map can display whatever you&rsquo;d like &mdash; bird migrations, traffic data, crime reports &mdash; but it should be interactive in some way. How far can you take it?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Each of the examples in the previous section built on the practice of choosing a great Python project for beginners. Next, you can advance to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Think about what interests you, and choose a project that overlaps with your interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about your Python learning goals, and make sure your project moves you closer to achieving those goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start small. Once you&rsquo;ve built a small project, you can either expand it or build another one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to get started. If you haven&rsquo;t learned the basics of Python yet, I recommend diving in with Dataquest&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-for-data-science-fundamentals/">Python Fundamentals course</a>.</p>
<p>If you already know the basics, there&rsquo;s no reason to hesitate! Now is the time to dive in and find your perfect Python project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rudolf Bayer and Edward M. McCreight coined the term <strong>B-tree</strong> data structure at the Boeing Research Labs in 1971. They published a scientific paper titled &quot;Organization and maintenance of large ordered indices&quot; and introduced a new data structure for fast data retrieval from disks. Although the B-tree data structure has evolved over the decades, understanding its concepts is still valuable.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll cover in this tutorial:</p>
<ul>
<li>B-tree data structures</li>
<li>B-tree properties</li>
<li>Traversing in a B-tree</li>
<li>Searching in a B-tree</li>
<li>Inserting a key in a B-tree</li>
<li>Deleting a key in a B-tree</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<h2>What Is a B-Tree Data Structure?</h2>
<p>A B-tree is a self-balanced tree data structure that is a generalized form of the Binary Search Tree (BST). However, unlike a binary tree, each node can have more than two children. In other words, each node can have up to <em>m</em> children and <em>m-1</em> keys; also, each node must have at least $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$ children to keep the tree balanced. These features keep the tree’s height relatively small. </p>
<p>A B-tree data structure keeps the data sorted and allows searching, inserting, and deleting operations performed in amortized logarithmic time. To be more specific, the time complexity for accomplishing the mentioned operations is $O(log {n})$, where <em>n</em> is the number of keys stored in the tree.</p>
<p>Let’s assume we have to store a tremendous amount of data in a computer system. In this common situation, we&#8217;re definitely unable to store the whole data in the main memory (RAM), and most of the data should be kept on disks. We also know that the secondary storage (various types of disks) is much slower than RAM. So, when we have to retrieve the data from the secondary storage, we need optimized algorithms to reduce the number of disk access.</p>
<p>The B-Tree data structure tries to minimize the number of disk access using advanced techniques and optimized algorithms for searching, inserting, and deleting, all of which allow the B-tree to stay balanced and, therefore, ensure finding data in logarithmic time. </p>
<p>To reveal how powerful B-tree is in minimizing disk access, let’s refer to the book <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em>, which proves that a B-tree with a height of two and 1001 children is able to store more than one billion keys. Still, only a disk access of two is required to find any key (Cormen et al., 2009).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll discuss the properties of B-tree and how it works in the following sections.</p>
<h2>B-Tree Properties</h2>
<p>There are three types of nodes in a B-tree of order m, and each of them has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root Node
<ul>
<li>A root node has between $2$ and $m$ children.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internal Nodes
<ul>
<li>Each internal node has between $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$ and $m$ children — both ends are included.</li>
<li>Each internal node may contain up to $m-1$ keys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leaf Nodes
<ul>
<li>All leaf nodes are at the same level.</li>
<li>Each leaf node stores between  $\lceil \frac{m-1}{2} \rceil$ and $m-1$ keys — both ends are included.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The height of a B-Tree can be yielded via the following equation:</p>
<p>$h \leq log _{m}{\frac{n+1}{2}}$, where <em>m</em> is the minimum degree and <em>n</em> is the number of keys.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The illustration below shows a B-tree data structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/s000.png" alt="s000.png" /></p>
<h2>Traversing in a B-Tree</h2>
<p>To traverse a B-Tree, the traversal program starts from the leftmost child and prints its keys recursively. It repeats the same process for the remaining children and keys until the rightmost child.</p>
<h2>Searching in a B-Tree</h2>
<p>Searching for a specific key in a B-Tree is a generalized form of searching in a Binary Search Tree (BST). The only difference is that the BST performs a binary decision, but in the B-tree, the number of decisions at each node is equal to the number of the node&#8217;s children.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s search key 102 in the B-tree above:</p>
<ol>
<li>The root&#8217;s key is not equal to 102, so since k &gt; 100, go to the leftmost node of the right branch.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/s001.png" alt="s001.png" /></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Compare k with 103; since k &lt; 103, go to the left branch of the current node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare k with the leaf&#8217;s key; k exists there.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/s002.png" alt="s002.png" /></p>
<p>As shown, if the key we&#8217;re looking for isn&#8217;t in the range of the parent node, then most likely the key is in another branch. The algorithm will keep doing this to reach a leaf node. If it doesn&#8217;t find the key, the algorithm returns NULL.</p>
<h2>Inserting a Key in a B-Tree</h2>
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve discussed traversing a B-tree and searching for a specific key in a B-tree data structure. This section will discuss how we can insert a new key into a B-Tree.</p>
<p>Inserting a new node into a B-tree includes two steps: finding the correct node to insert the key and splitting the node if the node is full (the number of the node’s keys is greater than m-1).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>If the B-Tree is empty:</strong> 
<ol>
<li>Allocate a root node, and insert the key.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>If the B-Tree is not empty:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Find the proper node for insertion.</li>
<li><strong>If the node is not full:</strong> 
<ol>
<li>Insert the key in ascending order.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>If the node is full:</strong> 
<ol>
<li>Split the node at the median. </li>
<li>Push the median key upward, and make the left keys a left child node and the right keys a right child node.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Deleting a Key in a B-Tree</h2>
<p>Deletion is one of the operations we can perform on a B-tree. We can perform the deletion at the leaf or internal node levels. To delete a node from a B-tree, we need to follow the algorithm below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>If the node to delete is a leaf node:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Locate the leaf node containing the desired key.</li>
<li>If the node has at least $\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor$ keys, delete the key from the leaf node.</li>
<li>If the node has less than $\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor$ keys, take a key from its right or left immediate sibling nodes. To do so, do the following:
<ol>
<li>If the left sibling has at least $\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor$ keys, push up the in-order predecessor, the largest key on the left child, to its parent, and move a proper key from the parent node down to the node containing the key; then, we can delete the key from the node.</li>
<li>If the right sibling has at least $\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor$ keys, push up the in-order successor, the smallest key on the right child, to its parent and move a proper key from the parent node down to the node containing the key; then, we can delete the key from the node.</li>
<li>If the immediate siblings don&#8217;t contain at least $\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor$ keys, create a new leaf node by joining two leaf nodes and the parent node&#8217;s key.</li>
<li>If the parent is left with less than $\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor$ keys, apply the above process to the parent until the tree becomes a valid B-Tree.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the node to delete is an internal node:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Replace it with its in-order successor or predecessor. Since the successor or predecessor will always be on the leaf node, the process will be similar as the node is being deleted from the leaf node.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This tutorial discussed B-trees and the application of B-trees for storing a large amount of data on disks. We also discussed four primary operations in B-trees: traversing, searching, inserting, and deleting.

					<description><![CDATA[Trying to learn data science can be overwhelming, but this is a valuable skill to have in today's business world. Here's how you can approach it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/learn-data-science.jpg" alt="learn-data-science"/></figure>
<p>
<p>Demand for data scientists is at an all-time high. If you’re considering a career in data science, now’s a great time to enter the field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the unfortunate reality is that most people who try to learn data science fail. They fail because their method is filled with flaws that sabotage their progress. Don’t worry: failure is 100% avoidable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key to learning data science quickly and effectively is finding the right approach.</p>
<p>This article will show 5 reasons why most learning methods cause people to fail. I&#8217;ll unveil the correct way to learn, which I discovered 10 years ago, after transitioning from a history teacher to a machine learning engineer.</p>
<h2 id="h-why-do-most-data-science-learners-fail">Why do most data science learners fail?</h2>
<h3 id="h-high-barriers-to-entry">High barriers to entry</h3>
<p>Many would-be data science learners give up because they think learning data science is too expensive. Bootcamps and certification programs can come with huge price tags that scare people off. Many learners don’t realize there are more affordable ways to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-boring-curriculum">Boring curriculum</h3>
<p>Affordable courses don&#8217;t guarantee success. Many online courses consist of dry video lectures or recordings of other people writing code. This isn’t engaging, so learners end up tuning out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, these types of courses have completion rates of <a href="http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5% to 15%</a>. Not great odds. </p>
<h3 id="h-life-gets-in-the-way">Life gets in the way</h3>
<p>Many data science courses have rigid schedules. Courses begin in a particular week, end in another, and may require live sessions at specific times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People who are learning online often have jobs, families, or other obligations. That can make keeping up with those schedules a challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-the-difficulty-curve-is-off">The difficulty curve is off</h3>
<p>If courses are too easy or too hard, most learners will eventually fall off the wagon. One common problem in online data science programs is that they’ve been built with pre-existing courses stuck together. One course might seem too easy, but the next is too hard. This happens because these courses weren’t built together.</p>
<h3 id="h-lessons-don-t-feel-relevant">Lessons don’t feel relevant</h3>
<p>People tend to stick with their studies when they feel like they’re making progress toward their goals. But many data science courses are focused on lectures and drills, rather than doing real-world data science work. This can leave learners feeling like they are treading water.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-the-right-way-to-learn-data-science">The right way to learn data science</h2>
<p>Before I founded Dataquest, I taught myself the skills required to go from working in a non-technical job to <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/i-barely-graduated-college/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working as a machine learning engineer</a>. </p>
<p>Through that experience — and through the experiences of the hundreds of thousands of learners who’ve gained data science skills on Dataquest over the last eight years — I’ve come to understand a lot about what works and what doesn’t when it comes to learning data science. </p>
<p>And it’s all built into the Dataquest experience.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-dataquest-s-learning-loop">Dataquest’s “learning loop”</h3>
<p>For learners to be successful, <strong>we need to feel like we’re making progress</strong>. The importance of this can’t be understated. We need to feel like we can immediately use the skills we’re learning.</p>
<p>That’s why Dataquest is hands-on. You’ll be writing and running real code and working with real datasets from day one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our side-by-side learning platform, you’ll read about a concept on the left side of the screen, then be challenged to write and run real code to apply what you’ve learned on the right side.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZQTMGQr1Nl-i3iv9fHvaH687dmooiLB6Tz1e-Q85XgZ3GwNMTmC5WDDglYYGZhBgRa9F6mCJTzVKgzuIJH9sEHBNXcIXU_gVow_9rebmCEE1K2dEw67vxVkNxlOBhHWF8-gSFVgqhAZr_2D-69tt9Ov1sDhhmr0p04GNu1QIoEbkRDY0uzf9j-t7HA" alt=""/></figure>
<p>This simple learning loop repeats through every single one of our courses. You learn something new and <em>immediately</em> apply it to a real data science problem. Each screen builds on the previous screen and leads into the next one.<br><br>That means that as you’re learning, you’ll know you have truly grasped the material because you’re using it to do real data science work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’re not watching lectures. You’re not filling in the blanks or answering multiple choice questions. You’re writing and running code, exactly like you will in a real data science job.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-tailored-course-paths">Tailored course paths</h3>
<p>An important part of this approach is that our courses are carefully sequenced to ensure there are no gaps. One course always leads into the next one, and each has a very specific goal in mind.</p>
<p>For example, here are some of our career paths:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Scientist</a>
<ul>
<li>35 courses</li>
<li>26 projects</li>
<li>No prerequisites</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Analyst</a>
<ul>
<li>25 courses</li>
<li>20 projects</li>
<li>No prerequisites</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Engineer</a>
<ul>
<li>19 courses</li>
<li>16 projects</li>
<li>No prerequisites</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of our students love these paths because they contain everything  they need to know to obtain a position. Yeah, really! If you want to become a data analyst, every ounce of information you need is within the <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Analyst career path</a>.</p>
<p>Plus, there are no prerequisites. Anybody can do it!</p>
<p>You can get started for free by clicking on any of the links above.</p>
<h3 id="h-fun-real-world-projects">Fun real-world projects&nbsp;</h3>
<p>While all of our courses get you working hands-on with real data, we also know that it’s critical to synthesize the skills as you learn.<br><br>That’s why most of our courses end with guided projects that challenge you to answer real data science questions using the skills you’ve learned in previous courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These projects are fun learning tools that help cement your new knowledge, but they’ll also help you when it’s time for your job search, as you can include them in your project portfolio. (Hiring managers love it when you do this, by the way.)</p>
<p>Example projects in the data science path include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/course/for-loops-and-conditional-statements-in-python/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Prison Break</strong></a> — Have fun analyzing a dataset of helicopter prison escapes using Python and Jupyter Notebook.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-functions-and-jupyter-notebook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets</strong></a> — Work as a pretend data analyst for a company that builds mobile apps. You’ll use Python to provide value through practical data analysis.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-for-data-science-intermediate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Exploring Hacker News Posts</strong></a> — Work with a dataset of submissions to Hacker News, a popular technology site.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/course/pandas-fundamentals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Exploring eBay Car Sales Data</strong></a> — Use Python to work with a scraped dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.</li>

<p>This approach worked for me, and it’s working for Dataquest students too!<br><br>You don’t have to take my word for it, though. Here’s what some recent learners have to say about their Dataquest experience:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/learner-spotlight-dilara-karabey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dilara</a>, Data Scientist at Perfist: “After I completed my Dataquest courses, I decided I should start looking for a job or an internship. I was hired as a data science trainee in **ten days**, and got promoted in four months.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/learner-spotlight-rahila-hashim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rahila</a>, Technical Data Scientist at Clinfocus: “<strong>Dataquest definitely won my heart </strong>with the in-browser coding experience. I had come across so many platforms and tried the free coding experience with others, but Dataquest [&#8230;] was a better way to learn.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/learner-spotlight-viktoria-jorayeva/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Viktoria</a>, Data Scientist at Fractal Analytics: “Things like statistics and programming are not easy to learn. But <strong>Dataquest explains them more clearly</strong> than all other resources [and is] understandable even for a person without specialized education.”</p>
<p>And you don’t have to take their word for it, either! Dataquest is free to start, so dive in, start learning,, and see how the Dataquest difference can help you.</p>

<p>After you have created your notebook, you will be taken to the notebook&#8217;s editor page where you can start writing and running your code! Now let&#8217;s get started with some machine learning!</p>
<h2 id="h-loading-data">Loading Data</h2>
<p>Before building the machine learning model, we need to load the data. We&#8217;ll use one of the inbuilt datasets provided by the <code>seaborn</code> library.&nbsp; Seaborn comes with a number of important datasets in its library. When installed, these are automatically downloaded and ready for use! The following commands import the library and provide the list of datasets available from the <strong><code>seaborn</code></strong> library.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
sns.get_dataset_names()</code></pre>
<p>This will return the list of datasets available in seaborn as shown below:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Out&#91;1]: &#91;'anagrams', 'anscombe', 'attention', 'brain_networks', 'car_crashes', 'diamonds', 'dots', 'dowjones', 'exercise', 'flights', 'fmri', 'geyser', 'glue', 'healthexp', 'iris', 'mpg', 'penguins', 'planets', 'seaice', 'taxis', 'tips',...]</code></pre>
<p>We can load the dataset with the <code>load_dataset()</code> function. In this article, we will use the <code>Iris</code> dataset. This dataset contains information about different types of flowers.

<p>After downloading the dataset, we will need to split it into training and test sets. The training set is used to train our machine learning model while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of our model. We can use the `train_test_split()` function from `scikit-learn` to split our dataset into training and test sets. This is also the right time to import all the required libraries.</p>
<p>The code to reproduce the above result is below:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># Import other required libraries
import sklearn
import numpy as np

# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
y = df&#91;'species'].values
X = df.drop('species', axis=1).values 

# Create training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.4, random_state=10) 
X_train.shape, X_test.shape</code></pre>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Out&#91;3]: ((90, 4), (60, 4))</code></pre>
<h2>Build and Evaluate Machine Learning Model</h2>
<p>Now that we have our training and test sets, we can start building our machine learning model. We will use the `LogisticRegression` class from `scikit-learn` to build our model.<br><br>To train our model, we will call the fit function on our LogisticRegression object and pass in our training set as a parameter. After training our model, we can now make predictions using our test set. To do this, we will call the predict function on our LogisticRegression object and pass in our test set as a parameter. This function will return a list of predictions for each of the samples in our test set.<br><br>Evaluating the performance of your machine learning model is important to ensure that your model is working as expected. There are many different metrics that you can use to evaluate the performance of your machine learning model. In this article, we will use accuracy as our metric.<br><br>To calculate the accuracy of our model, we will need to compare our predictions with the actual labels in our test set. We can use the `confusion_matrix` function to calculate the accuracy of our predictions.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>logreg = LogisticRegression()
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = logreg.predict(X_test)
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))</code></pre>
<p>The above command will produce the following output:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>precision recall f1-score support 
setosa 1.00 1.00 1.00 18 
versicolor 1.00 0.96 0.98 24

<p>The output above shows that the model accuracy is 98% which is a great result.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, you learned about the popular data science and machine learning unified analytics platform, Azure Databricks. You learned how to launch the Databricks workspace and how to build and evaluate a machine learning model using the Databricks notebook. You are now ready to start your machine learning journey with Azure Databricks!<br><br>The last step would be to delete the resources you have created if you don’t intend to use them in the future. This is easy to do. The first step is to go to the Azure portal, where you can look at a list of the resource groups.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What certificate should I get for data science? We interviewed data science recruiters about job applications and none of them cared about certificates.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want a data science job ASAP? Then you’re probably wondering what certifications you need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, one of the most common data science <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-certifications-courses-for-Data-Science/answer/Charlie-Custer-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">questions on Quora</a> is: “What data science certificate should I get?” </p>
<p>We talked to 15 hiring managers in the field, and here’s what they said: <strong>You do </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> need a data science certificate to get a job in data science.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>That’s right&#8211;recruiters are far more interested in your skills than what certifications you have.</p>
<p>Does that mean certificates aren’t valuable? Not at all. In this article, we’ll explain what certifications really mean to hiring managers and compare some of the best industry certifications available right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonus: We’ll let you in on some of the best-kept secrets among recruiters, including what they pay most attention to when weeding out resumes.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-how-data-science-certificates-impact-your-job-search"><strong>How Data Science Certificates Impact Your Job Search</strong></h2>
<p>Surely, data science certificates aren’t worthless, right? To find out, we<a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-career-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> talked to more than a dozen hiring managers and recruiters </a>in the data science field about what they wanted to see on applicants’ résumés. </p>
<p>None of them mentioned certificates. Not one.</p>
<p>Here’s what we learned: certificates certainly won’t hurt your job search as long as they’re presented correctly. But they’re unlikely to help much.</p>
<h3 id="h-why-data-science-certificates-fall-short"><strong>Why Data Science Certificates Fall Short</strong></h3>
<p>You might be wondering why these certificates aren’t worth the paper they’re printed on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is that there’s no universal standard and no universally accredited certification authority. Different websites, schools, and online learning platforms all issue their own certificates. That means these documents could mean anything&#8211;or they could mean nothing at all!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why employers tend not to give them more than a passing glance when qualifying candidates.</p>
<h2 id="h-what-s-the-point-of-a-certification-then"><strong>What’s the Point of a Certification Then?</strong></h2>
<p>If certifications won’t help you get a job in data science, then what’s the point of earning one? That’s a great question!&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, data scientist certifications aren’t completely useless. At Dataquest, we issue certificates when users complete any of <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/data-science-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our data science courses</a>. Why? Because it’s a great way for students to demonstrate that they’re actively engaged in learning new skills. </p>
<p>Recruiters <em>do </em>like to see that applicants are constantly trying to improve themselves. Listing data science certificates can help your job application in that way.</p>
<h3 id="h-what-s-better-than-a-data-science-certificate-a-portfolio"><strong>What’s Better than a Data Science Certificate? A Portfolio!&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>What’s most important to recruiters is whether you can actually do the job. Certificates aren’t proof of real skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what can you do to prove your abilities in the field of data science? Complete a <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/career-guide-data-science-projects-portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">portfolio of projects</a>! </p>
<p>Portfolios are like the holy grail of data science skills. That’s why hiring managers look at them first. Depending on what they see in your portfolio, they’ll either discard your application or send it to the next round of the hiring process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of Dataquest’s courses contain interactive projects you’ll complete to help you build your portfolio. Here are just a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/course/for-loops-and-conditional-statements-in-python/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prison Break</a> — Have some fun using Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze a dataset of helicopter prison escapes.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-for-data-science-intermediate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exploring Hacker News Posts</a> — Work with a dataset of submissions to Hacker News, a popular technology site.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/course/pandas-fundamentals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exploring eBay Car Sales Data</a> — Use Python to work with a scraped dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can sign up for free! Check out <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/data-science-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our courses here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Long story short: </strong>data science certificates are unlikely to help your résumé get noticed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When considering which certification to get, don’t focus on “which data science certificate is best.” Instead, find the platform that best helps you learn <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fundamental data science skills</a>. That’s what’s going to help you land a job in the field.</p>
<h2 id="h-how-to-choose-a-data-science-certificate-program-in-5-steps"><strong>How to Choose a Data Science Certificate Program in 5 Steps</strong></h2>
<p>Finding a data science program that offers a certificate is easy. A quick Google search will turn up dozens.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have a difficult decision to make. You need to compare all these programs to decide whether the certificate is worth your time and money.</p>
<p>Let’s simplify this process. Here are five key things to consider when looking at a data science certification:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content of the program</li>
<li>Cost of the program</li>
<li>Prerequisites or qualifications needed</li>
<li>Time commitment required</li>
<li>Reviews from previous students</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s look at some real-life examples to compare.</p>

<h2 id="h-tip-beware-of-prerequisites-and-qualifications"><strong>Tip: Beware of Prerequisites and Qualifications!</strong></h2>
<p>Before you start looking for data science courses and certifications, there’s something you need to be aware of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While some programs like Dataquest, Coursera, and Udemy do not require any particular background or industry knowledge, many others <em>do</em> have concrete prerequisites.</p>
<p>For example, DASCA’s Senior Data Scientist Certification tracks require at least a Bachelor’s degree (some tracks require a Master’s degree). That’s in addition to a minimum of 3-5 years of professional data-related experience!</p>
<p>Some programs, particularly <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-bootcamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offline bootcamps</a>, also require specific qualifications or have extensive application processes. Translation? You won’t be able to jump in right away and begin learning. You’ll need to factor in time costs and application fees for these programs when making your choice.</p>
<h2 id="h-what-about-university-certificates-in-data-science"><strong>What About University Certificates in Data Science?</strong></h2>
<p>If you’re considering a data science certificate from a university, don’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the expensive certification programs offered online by brand-name schools are not very meaningful to potential employers. This includes those offered by Ivy-League schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, a number of these online programs are not even administered by the schools themselves. Instead, they’re run <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/highline/article/capitalist-takeover-college/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by for-profit, third-party firms called Online Program Managers</a>. </p>
<p>What’s worse is that data science recruiters know this. That’s right&#8211;employers are keenly aware that a Harvard-affiliated certificate from EdX and a Harvard University degree are two <em>very different</em> things.</p>
<p>Plus, most data science hiring managers will not have time to research the academic rigor of every data science certification they see on a résumé. So even if your university-based certificate is actually worth something, recruiters likely won’t notice it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On average, most résumés are only given 30 seconds of review time. Since certificates don’t tell much about a candidate’s ability, more focus will be given on skills and projects.</p>
<p>Entry-level applicants are evaluated from the data science projects that are listed on the résumé or found on GitHub. Higher-level applicants are assessed on previous industry experience and completed projects, not certificates.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-the-sticker-shock-of-university-certificates">The Sticker Shock of University Certificates</h3>
<p>University certificates tend to be quite expensive. For example, consider the cost of some of the most popular options out there:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ecornell.com/certificates/data-science/data-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cornell’s three-week data analytics certificate</a> – $3,600</li>
<li><a href="https://learnmore.duke.edu/certificates/data-science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duke’s big data and data science certificate</a> – $3,195</li>
<li><a href="https://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/375/certificate-in-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Georgetown’s professional certificate in data science</a> – $7,496</li>
<li><a href="https://extension.berkeley.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&amp;certificateId=28652248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UC Berkeley’s data scientist certification program </a>– $5,100</li>
<li><a href="https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/professional-graduate-certificates/data-science-certificate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvard’s data science certificate </a>– $11,600</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-data-science-skills-employers-desire"><strong>How to Get the Data Science Skills Employers Desire</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Do you want to learn Tableau? Then practice, practice, practice! Here are six resources that will build your Tableau skills — and your portfolio!</h3>
<p>Tableau is an incredibly powerful, all-encompassing data visualization tool. It can create beautiful, crisp data visualizations using a variety of chart types. It also has a number of powerful, built-in calculations. This creates endless possibilities for Tableau Projects, either self-guided or as part of a wider community, that you can complete to go from a beginner Tableau developer to intermediate — or from intermediate to professional. </p>
<p>What follows is a list of resources that can guide you through tableau project ideas to help you build your skills!&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Start Building&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Staring at a blank canvas is simultaneously freeing and challenging! We can feel overwhelmed by all the possibilities. However, if we have an interesting data source or an analysis, then there’s no better way to learn than by simply jumping into a challenge! </p>
<p>You can run the full scope of a data visualization project from data discovery to dashboard design and implementation. When you&#8217;re done, share it on <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/discover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tableau Public</a> profile, and invite friends and coworkers to comment on your project. </p>
<p>If the prospect of a blank canvas excites you but you’re unsure where to find data, check out this resource on <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">24 free datasets for building a data portfolio</a>. You can find additional datasets using <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/">Google&#8217;s dataset search</a>, at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle.com</a>, or at <a href="https://data.world/search?type=resources">data.world</a>.  </p>
<h2>Makeover Monday</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re struggling to find inspiration for your own Tableau project idea, the Tableau Community has you covered. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Makeover Monday</a> is an eight-year tradition. Since 2016 (with a brief hiatus in 2022), they&#8217;ve posted a chart and an accompanying dataset on their website. Tableau users can then take the dataset to make a better version of the original visualization. The projects shared in this group don&#8217;t take much of your time, and doing one a week is certainly feasible. The data is curated and, typically, clean so you can focus on visualization. </p>
<p>If you’re on Twitter or LinkedIn, you can also share your results with like-minded data professionals using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=makeovermonday&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#MakeoverMonday</a>.</p>
<h2>Workout Wednesday&nbsp;</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=makeovermonday&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Workout Wednesday</a> challenges us to explore niche Tableau features, usually in the calculation or design layers. These are good Tableau projects for practicing more advanced calculations or chart types that we may not use every day. It’s a great tool for pushing our Tableau boundaries and discovering useful functionalities that we may not discover otherwise. </p>
<p>Results appear online with an accompanying blog post or how-to video. We can then take the techniques we’ve learned and apply them to another Tableau project idea.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Real-World Fake Date (RWFD)</h2>
<p>Another Tableau project example created by the vibrant Tableau community is called <a href="https://sonsofhierarchies.com/real-world-fake-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Real World Fake Data (RWFD)</a>. A major issue I’ve seen in delivering Tableau training is the datasets can often be non-conceptual. Sure, we can visualize the IMDB rating of every season of <em>Seinfeld</em>, but how does that help grow a business? RWFD tries to correct this by providing data that reflects a real-world business environment. The analysis more closely resembles the type of work that would be asked of a data professional in a job-like situation. </p>
<p>Similar to Makeover Monday and Workout Wednesday, RWFD has a dedicated user group that shares, comments on, and encourages each other’s data visualization efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-tableau-viz-of-the-day">Tableau Viz of the Day</h2>
<p>Tableau Public has a phenomenal feature called <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/discover/viz-of-the-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Viz of the Day</a>. Every week, Tableau features Tableau project examples created by other authors in the Viz of the Day feature of Tableau Public. These are typically elaborate and professional data visualizations that push the limits of what&#8217;s possible with Tableau functionality. While the majority of the Viz of the Days may not be relevant to you, they can still be a wonderful source of inspiration. </p>
<p>Most of the time, you can download the Viz of the Day workbook. If there’s a specific design element or calculation that we&#8217;re curious about, we can download the Tableau file and try to reverse-engineer it. We can then, if we want, try to apply the same methodology and functionality to a project or data source we are already working on.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Building a Tableau Portfolio</h2>
<p>A Tableau portfolio, typically on Tableau Public, is one of our most valuable tools for networking and growing as Tableau professionals. Filling out a Tableau public portfolio can be daunting. But hopefully this article has given you some ways to get started. </p>
<p>No matter how you build out your Tableau Projects, keep in mind the value of the Tableau community. Participating and sharing your Tableau projects will lead to engagement and mentorship — both will help grow your skill sets and career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this tutorial, we&#8217;ll learn what regularization is and why we use it. We&#8217;ll also discuss regularization techniques and how to use them. </p>
<p>After you finish this tutorial, you&#8217;ll understand the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularization in machine learning </li>
<li>L1 regularization (lasso regression)</li>
<li>L2 regularization (ridge regression)</li>

<p>In this tutorial, we assume you know the fundamentals of machine learning, including the basic concepts of linear regression. If you&#8217;re not familiar with machine learning or are eager to refresh your machine learning skills, you might like to try our <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/">Data Scientist in Python Career Path</a>.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Basically, we use regularization techniques to fix overfitting in our machine learning models. Before discussing regularization in more detail, let&#8217;s discuss overfitting.</p>
<p>Overfitting happens when a machine learning model fits tightly to the training data and tries to learn all the details in the data; in this case, the model cannot generalize well to the unseen data. The following illustration, called the generalization curve, shows that the training loss keeps decreasing by increasing the number of training iterations:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/j6P8EPq.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Although minimizing the training loss is a good thing, the validation loss starts to increase after a specific number of iterations. The increasing trend of the validation loss means that while we are trying to reduce the training loss, we increase the model&#8217;s complexity, so it cannot generalize to new data points.</p>
<p>In other words, a high variance machine learning model captures all the details of the training data along with the existing noise in the data. So, as you&#8217;ve seen in the generalization curve, the difference between training loss and validation loss is becoming more and more noticeable. On the contrary, a high bias machine learning model is loosely coupled to the training data, which leads to a low difference between training loss and validation loss.</p>
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve learned that preventing overfitting is crucial to improve the performance of our machine learning model. In the following sections, we&#8217;ll learn about regularization and its techniques.</p>
<h2>What Is Regularization?</h2>
<p>Regularization means restricting a model to avoid overfitting by shrinking the coefficient estimates to zero. When a model suffers from overfitting, we should control the model&#8217;s complexity. Technically, regularization avoids overfitting by adding a penalty to the model&#8217;s loss function:</p>
<p>$$\text{Regularization = Loss Function + Penalty}$$</p>
<p>There are three commonly used regularization techniques to control the complexity of machine learning models, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>L2 regularization</li>
<li>L1 regularization</li>
<li>Elastic Net</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s discuss these standard techniques in detail.</p>
<h2>L2 Regularization</h2>
<p>A linear regression that uses the L2 regularization technique is called <em>ridge</em> regression. In other words, in ridge regression, a regularization term is added to the cost function of the linear regression, which keeps the magnitude of the model’s weights (coefficients) as small as possible. The L2 regularization technique tries to keep the model’s weights close to zero, but not zero, which means each feature should have a low impact on the output while the model&#8217;s accuracy should be as high as possible.</p>
<p>$$\text{Ridge Regression Cost Function} = \text{Loss Function} + \dfrac{1}{2} \lambda\sum_{j=1}^m w_j^2$$</p>
<p>Where $\lambda$ controls the strength of regularization, and $w_j$ are the model&#8217;s weights (coefficients).</p>
<p>By increasing $\lambda$, the model becomes flattered and underfit. On the other hand, by decreasing $\lambda$, the model becomes more overfit, and with $\lambda$ = 0, the regularization term will be eliminated.</p>
<h2>L1 Regularization</h2>
<p>Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (<em>lasso</em>) regression is an alternative to ridge for regularizing linear regression. Lasso regression also adds a penalty term to the cost function, but slightly different, called L1 regularization. L1 regularization makes some coefficients zero, meaning the model will ignore those features. Ignoring the least important features helps emphasize the model&#8217;s essential features.</p>
<p>$$\text{Lasso Regression Cost Function} = \text{Loss Function} + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^m |w_j|$$</p>
<p>Where $\lambda$ controls the strength of regularization, and $w_j$ are the model&#8217;s weights (coefficients).</p>
<p>Lasso regression automatically performs feature selection by eliminating the least important features.</p>
<h2>Elastic Net</h2>
<p>The Elastic Net is a regularized regression technique combining ridge and lasso&#8217;s regularization terms. The $r$ parameter controls the combination ratio. When $r=1$, the L2 term will be eliminated, and when $r=1$, the L1 term will be removed.</p>
<p>$$\text{Elastic Net Cost Function} = \text{Loss Function} + r \lambda \sum_{j=1}^m |w<em>j|+ \dfrac{(1-r)}{2} \lambda\sum</em>{j=1}^m w_j^2$$</p>
<p>Although combining the penalties of lasso and ridge usually works better than only using one of the regularization techniques, adjusting two parameters, $\lambda$ and $r$, is a little tricky.</p>
<h2>Demonstrating Regularization Techniques with Python</h2>
<p>In this section, we&#8217;re going to apply L2 and L1 regularization techniques to the Boston Housing dataset and compare the training set score and test set score before and after using these techniques.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s load the dataset and split it into a training set and a test set, as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import mglearn as ml
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from numpy import genfromtxt

dataset = genfromtxt(&#039;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-mehdi/tutorials/main/boston_housing.csv&#039;, delimiter=&#039;,&#039;)
X = dataset[:,:-1]
y = dataset[:,-1]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=0)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can train the Linear regression model and then print the training set score and the test set score:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">lr = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f&quot;Linear Regression-Training set score: {lr.score(X_train, y_train):.2f}&quot;)
print(f&quot;Linear Regression-Test set score: {lr.score(X_test, y_test):.2f}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Linear Regression-Training set score: 0.95
    Linear Regression-Test set score: 0.61</code></pre>
<p>Comparing the model performance on the training set and the test set reveals that the model suffers from overfitting.</p>
<p>To avoid overfitting and control the complexity of the model, let&#8217;s use ridge regression (L2 regularization) and see how well it does on the dataset:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
ridge = Ridge(alpha=0.7).fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f&quot;Ridge Regression-Training set score: {ridge.score(X_train, y_train):.2f}&quot;)
print(f&quot;Ridge Regression-Test set score: {ridge.score(X_test, y_test):.2f}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Ridge Regression-Training set score: 0.90
    Ridge Regression-Test set score: 0.76</code></pre>
<p>Although the training set score of ridge regression is slightly lower than the linear regression training score, the test set score of ridge is significantly higher than the linear regression test set score. These scores confirm that ridge regression reduces the model&#8217;s complexity, leading to a less-overfit-but-more-general model.</p>
<p>The <code>alpha</code> parameter specifies a trade-off between the model&#8217;s performance on the training set and its simplicity. So, increasing the <code>alpha</code> value (its default value is 1.0) simplifies the model by shrinking the coefficients.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s apply the lasso regression to the dataset and explore the results.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
lasso = Lasso(alpha=1.0).fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f&quot;Lasso Regression-Training set score: {lasso.score(X_train, y_train):.2f}&quot;)
print(f&quot;Lasso Regression-Test set score: {lasso.score(X_test, y_test):.2f}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Lasso Regression-Training set score: 0.29
    Lasso Regression-Test set score: 0.21</code></pre>
<p>As shown, lasso performs quite disappointingly, and it&#8217;s a sign of underfitting. The lasso model doesn&#8217;t work well because most of the coefficients have become exactly zero. If we want to know the exact number of features that have been used in the model, we can use the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(f&quot;Number of features: {sum(lasso.coef_ != 0)}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Number of features: 4</code></pre>
<p>This means that only 4 of the 104 features in the training set are used in the lasso regression model, while the rest are ignored.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s adjust <code>alpha</code> to reduce underfitting by decreasing its value to 0.01:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.01).fit(X_train, y_train)
print(&quot;Lasso Regression-Training set score: {:.2f}&quot;.format(lasso.score(X_train, y_train)))
print(&quot;Lasso Regression-Test set score: {:.2f}&quot;.format(lasso.score(X_test, y_test)))</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Lasso Regression-Training set score: 0.90
    Lasso Regression-Test set score: 0.77</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    /Users/mohammadmehdi/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sklearn/linear_model/_coordinate_descent.py:647: ConvergenceWarning: Objective did not converge. You might want to increase the number of iterations, check the scale of the features or consider increasing regularisation. Duality gap: 4.690e+01, tolerance: 3.233e+00
      model = cd_fast.enet_coordinate_descent(</code></pre>
<p>Rerunning the code below shows that by decreasing <code>alpha</code>, the Lasso model uses 32 of the 104 features: </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(f&quot;Number of features: {sum(lasso.coef_ != 0)}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Number of features: 32</code></pre>
<p>Although we can reduce <code>alpha</code> even more, it seems that its optimum value is <code>0.01</code>.</p>
<p>The last technique that we&#8217;re going to use is elastic net. Let&#8217;s see how well it does.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet
elastic_net = ElasticNet(alpha=0.01, l1_ratio=0.01).fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f&quot;Elastic Net-Training set score: {elastic_net.score(X_train, y_train):.2f}&quot;)
print(f&quot;Elastic Net-Test set score: {elastic_net.score(X_test, y_test):.2f}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Elastic Net-Training set score: 0.84
    Elastic Net-Test set score: 0.70</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">    /Users/mohammadmehdi/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sklearn/linear_model/_coordinate_descent.py:647: ConvergenceWarning: Objective did not converge. You might want to increase the number of iterations, check the scale of the features or consider increasing regularisation. Duality gap: 1.474e+02, tolerance: 3.233e+00
      model = cd_fast.enet_coordinate_descent(</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>In general, to avoid overfitting, the regularized models are preferable to a plain linear regression model. In most scenarios, ridge works well. But in case you&#8217;re not certain about using lasso or elastic net, elastic net is a better choice because, as we&#8217;ve seen, lasso removes strongly correlated features.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This tutorial explored different ways of avoiding overfitting in linear machine learning models. We discussed why overfitting happens and what ridge, lasso, and elastic net regression methods are. We also applied these techniques to the Boston housing dataset and compared the results. Some other techniques, such as early stop and dropout, can be used for regularizing complex models, while the latter is mainly used for regularizing artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>Parameters are among the most versatile and useful features in Tableau — especially following the 2020 addition of parameter dashboard actions. As with just about anything in Tableau, we can start small and work our way to greater complexity — Tableau parameters are no different.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Use Parameters in Tableau?</strong></h2>
<p>But before we start, you may be wondering <em>What is a parameter in tableau, and why would we use one?</em> Fantastic questions. A tableau parameter is similar to a calculated field in that it&#8217;s not a part of the dataset — instead, the tableau developer creates it. It&#8217;s also similar to a filter, in that an analytics consumer will usually see a Tableau parameter on a dashboard they can click to customize the view. It differs from a calculated field and a filter in that it gives us far more flexibility in its creation and its behavior once we deploy it. </p>
<p>Before we begin creating a parameter in Tableau, here are some of the most common uses of Tableau parameters: </p>
<ol>
<li>Creating a top x filter</li>
<li>Changing the dimension or measure displayed in a chart</li>
<li>Selecting a single value to highlight </li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>How to Create a Parameter in Tableau</strong></h2>
<p>Creating parameters in Tableau begins the same way as creating a calculated field. Click on the drop-down arrow to the right of the search bar. Select <strong>Create Parameter</strong>. We’ll then presented see this widget. Let’s go through it. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JLOmdNAUvXRrazZqHNlNm9Af5TuryXS2NQWzlHeTJWEoFH3EtF6PpqmeJZOoc2aNmyWnaRZ9BPSZg0yw9R_DngZsdaW4O_hODPcEYsCfB_hOYbqlezmHqN5o1IB8JU2bTnJIItqa62_XNv0LmME-c6Q9EXxgetmewGZo_ABUvXcce3jq1Dnqxkld5zqxP-1Ttf11Bg" alt="Create parameter" /></figure>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/s3MACSGuR6z3hQ3nay1tcoZRrOBr_BjQ0CU7F2NwrVNjeWK_DVdT2v9if0T1R59AO3wlRZ11a1Z2moKp3aoQdYqjgGviMSawsqn0sKY8PtU_coD32ovJzOXRG_F3fQW96Wyy18t02v63eIY-aryB5_BYOqrjl_VzbuaD3yMUs9Fi8P1nV4D8stPv2_1gCcCis-PkDw" alt="Parameter 1" /></figure>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> This will be the name of the parameter. </p>
<p><em>(Pro-tip — I like to start all my parameters with a prefix like “Para” or “@” so they are easier to identify.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Data type:</strong> Where we select if this will be a float, integer, string (text) or date type. </p>
<p><strong>Display format:</strong> Allows us to format the value (e.g., change it to a currency). </p>
<p><strong>Current value:</strong> This is the default starting value.</p>
<p><strong>Value when workbook opens:</strong> Here, the default is current value, and we won&#8217;t interact with this in the beginner tutorial, but as we gain more experience with parameters, there are some useful features in here. </p>
<p><strong>Allowable values: </strong>The default is all, which means any value that is a float (so all decimal numbers) are valid input. A <em>List</em> means that we, as the developer, give the user a predefined list of allowable values to pick from. <em>Range </em>(not available for text parameters) allows us to set a start and end point, and all values between the start and end points will be valid. </p>
<h2><strong>Creating a Parameter in Tableau</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s look at two examples of when and how to create a parameter in Tableau. I’ll be using superstore sales dataset, which is built into Tableau. The first example is to make a dynamic target that a user can control to quickly see which dimensions fall above or below the target. </p>
<p>Before creating the parameter, let’s build a quick chart by adding <strong>Subcategory</strong> onto <strong>Columns and Sales </strong>onto <strong>Rows</strong>. Now for the parameter, let&#8217;s follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the arrow next to the field search bar, and select <strong>Create Parameter</strong>.</li>
<li>Name the parameter “Para Subcategory Target.”</li>
<li>Change the data type to <strong>Integer</strong>.</li>
<li>Change the current value to 5,000.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/T1EKcWpOorVb9ztAOdNvaacEZXCO5QiM0ml2NCOY3KeuLciGJE3mhD11W0zalkL3EhQXkJMwxPggpXdMZL5_AQ-0GUDX1BDZ56WA4D5LVYnbXsX9XBGy87BE77scr_zs4iS6DDfGImlTUYpV7O-8SboWcD37KJP7ae_WBguUUdwV2o3aG3l6rsULkbYx02MJJ71rdg" alt="Create parameter" /></figure>
<p>When we click <strong>OK</strong>, a new section in the calculated field pane appears, named “Parameters.” In that list, we should see the <em>Para Subcategory Target</em>. </p>
<p>If we right-click on the parameter and select <strong>Show Parameter</strong>, the parameter control section appears on the left. It will produce a box that looks similar to the filter, with the title “Para Subcategory Target” and the value 5000. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RR3mnxDJwRSgbgqu_nxYGjgIO6I73xyUMRL_O2u9f_T6uEt87Z08_uEdthpXSqDFrs02f923FBLyu2bDoOMuOHqG8wNcIK2-m7m7flqjTf68mUqMiYvngichbpvNWg75vT6gMTqu8px5nLjLfue5BIwFxOn4DtwMlNw4IFqdL-1EGSBIIWUX_IJ2U_E2ljxPnkFUBQ" alt="Show parameter" /></figure>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZMS3196-CSac_s2ConXF06awZOW6Q76XlOKJ2dVU_2RRJv-38d7Gp0kn9fzbqKkI9J30gg-Fv1KfJI1aztLm5E1DuDwGghATtdEvPtmJ0Sl7F9ab5SBiU3hpsoEvEpHiR3xn1ZvugoM9-ruDbap1KZRrxI3_sB9ogxEki9RnCHGavFDwZ70o9UVp5Akdt3GIWgLtmQ" alt="Sub-category" /></figure>
<p>Parameters on their own aren&#8217;t helpful, so we must always take the second step of adding them either to our visualization or to a calculated field. For example, if you type 6000 into the parameter control, nothing will change in our bar chart. Let’s add this parameter to the chart. </p>
<ol>
<li>At the top of the field list there’s an option to change the pane to “Analytics.”</li>
<li>In the Analytics pane, drag a reference line onto the chart.</li>
<li>For Value select <strong>from parameter</strong> and pick the <strong>Para Subcategory Target</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>fill below</strong>, and select <strong>red</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this, we have a dynamic target, and we can easily see which subcategories are underperforming. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B1JoNIR8QTsWcw_d9TClGRAVuDzdCSFBCc6x3HLADF9GN7NEjYpIcvBtNw-7mMvMb9rTQZ4KHnbbEn8YAb3Ef9JOhlGf_zwd_hn3Z_hkCKXb5MH5-7qzWRLu_uYHesC3kwG3s_R1PXKY3XmX1EVPdOFhJkeQ_bYzBi6Q2_szQqrIf4FPI5P72CgHc2n9AIgkAzdq7g" alt="Reference line" /></figure>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bU5pe_m_ZzVDCSvuaYTMp0eWfvVz6tiioW6knztU84zT1MqCpu7FZZ1GhCuoAMJssf4pW__JlNmzKqUpbTapehU2qVlhBRmDNisKbU_Tbdm7MyL6RAyD8dhNOC2_b-XmEmpVqdHi9E-fxAtJl1Sej_Kl1pj8zvjaPZ46Vcwnh3FMyVI9XZNmXlvHZ8rwlxIPA1lBOg" alt="Para Subcategory Target" /></figure>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QKvdsHEp92NTbFicjrFuuonB5zOVsS7grEeac2MKKDH19Vn67yivssOmu8HCO6hzttWRZxHUQFPpgGjGMeKN1bwNRwqhBJ9Jw2ceZ9XppLFYHGkvFkGsGfx2wh3N6DOMFGDyQriGbjBr5ykazhK7XMeACX13Nrkbhbcu-J81qgm0buszIUuIPNA6MxPFZcplbmV-IA" alt="Para Subcategory Target" /></figure>
<p>Another common use case for a parameter is as a dynamic dimension swapper — a parameter that will change the dimension in the chart based on the user input. Let’s create a second parameter. This one will be called “Para Dimension Swap.”</p>
<ol>
<li>For this second parameter, set the type to <strong>String</strong>.</li>
<li>Make it a <strong>List</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list, enter the following, each on its own line: <strong>Subcategory, Region, State</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Create a Calculated Field like the following:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WGMXeN10ainmfaKybTsAjtzLfAHnHQCWPoxgZxwCtFY1leKynGWLluU6afe7iKCrYu8PO0rGQzd03OynIHEHD_xnYsux9K8kCuYMBuKkX5IpsPFrozYm6coBPfSdTMWm3IjtWDoVGKgriBQfXfid3AQ2Yemy4pNZyg90PBoX42k_PflkMGnXFgm1Znyp" alt="Calculated field" /></figure>
<p>We can now take our new calculated field and drag it on top of the <strong>Subcatergory</strong> dimension in our chart. If we right-click our <strong>Para Dimension Swap</strong> parameter and click <strong>Show Parameter</strong>, we can let the data consumer choose how they view this chart. And, of course, with the original parameter still there, we can also adjust the target reference line as we conduct our analysis. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SQjSiuhwCgDvX_oNmZqW1XC-8W3eUaWc9s-EheBQMyisqtAiw_Dvz7xWRrsGrhye2kcpspsf-kSXqqEjZGtAC85Gj_m_VXid-7tmrVVXU91WOQWQwT7ZCK-fqqsyj_RvHzOpWJa_NI2m41J38fsbNP2tS9WzLGZaW-6fhpD1NKMC6scFtXtXtsUi5yMR" alt="Calculated field" /></figure>
<h2><strong>Using Tableau Parameters</strong></h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve just explored two introductory examples for implementing Tableau parameters, but the use cases are endless. Mastering Tableau parameters can revolutionize the Tableau development experience and open up a world of possibilities as we create a tailored data consumption experience for our user.</p>
<p>As we gain experience with parameters, we can try concepts such as measure swapping, dimension highlighting, and sheet swapping. And once we’re feeling very confident, we can include parameter actions on a dashboard, which are incredibly powerful in their own regard. </p>
<p>Now, pull up your favorite workbook, and try out some parameters of your own! </p>
