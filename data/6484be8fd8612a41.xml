										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever want kids.</p>
<p>There was so much I wanted to do/see during my life and I felt like having kids would get in the way.</p>
<p>Two things changed when I got to my late 30s though.</p>
<p>First, my wife&#8217;s sisters started having kids and I got to see how fun/crazy they are.</p>
<p>Second, I started accomplishing a lot of the things I had wanted to do&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>I went back to school and <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/free-ivy-league-degree/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">got a graduate degree</a></li>
<li>We got to travel the world and <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/early-retirement-preview/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">visit 50+ countries</a></li>
<li>I <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/start-a-business/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">built a successful business</a></li>
<li>I <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/time-has-finally-come/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">achieved financial independence</a> and was able to stop working</li>
<li>I finally fulfilled my childhood dream of <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/ultralearning-experiment-results/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">writing and releasing an album</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I would have been able to achieve a lot of those things without the 5+ years of complete freedom that FI provided.  So thanks to FI and my neices/nephews, I finally came around to the idea of having kids.</p>
<p>But the prospect of being a parent is scary (especially to someone like me who is a big planner and a bit of control freak).</p>
<p>Thankfully, FI helped quell some of those concerns as well&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Thoughts of sleepless nights were less worrying knowing that we didn&#8217;t have to wake up to go to work</li>
<li>Caring for a new person is less intimidating knowing there&#8217;s enough savings in the bank to handle any unplanned expenses</li>
<li>Parenting with both parents at home is a lot less scary than imagining doing it solo while one person&#8217;s off working</li>
</ul>
<p>So not only did FI allow me to get into a state where I actually wanted to have kids, it also made the prospect of kids a lot less intimidating.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough beating around the bush&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ridiculously pleased to tell you that there is now a Mad Fientist Jr. :)</p>
<p>He arrived on July 14th and Jill and I are both over the moon!</p>
<h2>A Brand New Appreciation for FI</h2>
<p>I wanted to write this post because I feel like lately, I&#8217;ve been mainly focused on the downsides of FI whenever I talk about it.</p>
<p>Since the FIRE world exploded in 2018, most FI content feels like this -> &#8220;FI IS THE BEST THING EVER AND IT WILL SOLVE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS AND WILL INSTANTLY MAKE YOU HAPPY!!&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s obviously not the case but it&#8217;s unsurpising most of the online content seems to suggest that.  Here&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>
<p>When a new blog/podcast starts or when a newspaper is trying to get as much traffic as possible, which do you think will get the most clicks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 10 Ways FI Improved my Life and How It Can Change Yours!</li>
<li>Money is Not the Reason You&#8217;re Not Pursuing Your Dreams :/</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously the first heading would, so that&#8217;s why most FI content tends to focus on the positives.</p>
<p>But since I&#8217;ve been doing this for over a decade and don&#8217;t need to get more readers/listeners/clicks, I feel it&#8217;s my duty to share the full story.  And since the positives are so well covered by other sites, I tend to dwell on the negative aspects whenever I&#8217;m interviewed, so that you get a more-balanced picture.</p>
<p>I wanted to write this post though because since having our son, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever appreciated what FI provides more than I do now.</p>
<p>Jill and I can focus fully on our new addition and we can watch him grow without any distractions.  My mom and stepdad came to visit for 18 days and we got to enjoy time with them and didn&#8217;t have to share our attention with work.  We can nap in the middle of the day and stay up all night if we need to.</p>
<p>I can honestly say I haven&#8217;t felt this level of contentment, happiness, and gratitude since I left my job in 2016, and I&#8217;m so happy we worked hard and made the sacrifices we did to get to this position.</p>
<h2>Fully Realizing the Benefits</h2>
<p>Over the last two years, I feel like I&#8217;m entering a new stage of life where I am finally reaping the benefits of my past investments (rather than just accumulating more investments).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m learning how to enjoy spending money (more on this soon) and man, is it fun :)</p>
<p>As we celebrate 20 years of being together in December, investing in my relationship with Jill has yielded a beautiful son and a partnership that&#8217;s never been as strong and loving as it is now.</p>
<p>My focus on health and nutrition over the past decade means that even though I&#8217;m an older dad, I&#8217;ll hopefully feel just as young as the other dads that I&#8217;ll be interacting with soon.</p>
<p>And achieving FI has helped me get mentally and financially prepared to have the cutest little kid I could imagine.</p>
<h2>Your Investments Will Be Worth It</h2>
<p>Apologies for all this self-reflection today but I wanted you to know that your hard work and sacrifices will likely pay off in a bigger way than you ever even imagined (because that&#8217;s how I feel now).</p>
<p>Your investments will only be worth it if you actually start cashing them in though so that&#8217;s what my future posts/podcasts will be focusing on.  </p>
<p>Since my publishing schedule will be even more sporadic now that we have a newborn, <a href="https://pages.madfientist.com/podcast-advice" rel="noopener" target="_blank">click here</a> to join the 100,000+ others on the email list and get updated when new posts get published.</p>
<h2>6+ Years of FI</h2>
<p>My FI anniversary (Aug 1st) came and went without me even noticing this year.</p>
<p>I can say that this is the best that post-FI life has been though so I&#8217;m even more excited for the future.  </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know this is where I wanted to be but now that I&#8217;m here, I can&#8217;t imagine being anywhere else.  And I&#8217;m thankful that FI helped me get here.</p>
<p><em>P.S. Big thanks to Paul H. for the amazing Mad Fientist baby onesie!  I promise he likes it a lot more than the picture indicates :)</em></p>
<p><em>P.P.S. I released a short podcast episode about this so <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0iKNxbI8u9qy3pjnifuTw9?si=5ca52a65ad244ec3">click here</a> to check it out!</em></p>

<h2>Full Transcript</h2>
<div class="transcript">
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Hey, what&#8217;s up, everybody. Welcome to the Financial Independence Podcast, the podcast where I talked to some of the best and brightest in personal finance to find out how they achieved financial independence. <br/><br/>I&#8217;m really excited about today&#8217;s show. I&#8217;m talking to a buddy of mine named Patrick, who I met way back in 2016 at FinCon San Diego, which is a financial conference.<br/><br/>And he was a Mad Fientist listener at the time. And just came up and talked to me and my wife. And I quickly realized one, he&#8217;s a really fun guy to talk to, but also he had a really interesting story to tell. So I&#8217;m excited to share it with you today. Patrick&#8217;s story is a bit of a rags to riches, to rags, to riches story.<br/><br/>And there&#8217;s lots of stuff that he learned along the way, and I&#8217;m excited to dive into some of it, but a brief summary&#8230; he built up a multi-million dollar business over the years, and he was living the multimillion dollar entrepreneur lifestyle a bit. And sadly it all came crashing down during the global financial crisis.<br/><br/>So he had to eventually declare bankruptcy and start from scratch again. And when he was rebuilding up his life and his business, he realized he needed to get his personal finances in order. And that&#8217;s how he ended up finding the financial independence world. And that led to him completely changing his outlook on spending.<br/><br/>And he ended up trimming his expenses to less than 50% of before the financial crisis. And he was able to build up his business and his investments, and he was able to reach financial independence in just eight years after declaring bankruptcy. So it&#8217;s an incredible story with lots of lessons learned, no doubt. So without further delay, Patrick, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it! <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Thank you for having me on, Mad Fientist. This is an honor to be on your podcast.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> So we go way back. We met back in 2016 at FinCon San Diego. And I have to say out of my entire decade of being the Mad Fientist, I think when I met you, that was the coolest I ever felt. And it just so happened to be, my wife was there and she got to experience it too. So yeah, if we just go back to 2016 and we were just milling around in some big convention hall and you came up to me and you just said some very kind things in front of my wife, and I could just tell by her face, she&#8217;s like, what is going on here?<br/><br/>This guy is like, he looks like a really nice normal guy smart. And he&#8217;s saying all these really nice things about, you know, just weird financial writing on the internet. And yeah. So I have to say thank you for that. That was a highlight of being the Mad Fientist.<br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> That was crazy. I remember that too. I was talking about how I first met you. I actually was, I met JD Roth first, and then I was like &quot;Do you know the Mad Fientist?&quot; He was like, of course, you know, because I knew I had listened to your podcast when you interviewing him. And I know, is that, can you introduce me to him and was like, Hey yeah, sure.<br/><br/>You know, so, and then when I met you, I was, I was star struck, dude. I remember when I asked you to get to take a picture with you and your wife was looking at us, like what&#8217;s going to picture him here.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Exactly <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, and for me, I I&#8217;m the sports marketing industry. So we do a lot of big corporate events or we know the big sporting events. So I get to meet a lot of celebrities you know, Hollywood and sports celebrities. And but I don&#8217;t get as star struck as, as well as when I met the Mad Fientist, that was like, I gotta get a picture.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s what you said that, yeah, that, that reminded me. You said something about like, yeah, like you had met some famous basketball player or something and and yeah, you&#8217;re more excited to meet me. And like, I was just as dumbfounded as my wife, because I&#8217;ve just been writing some weird financial stuff into the internet and never expected any sort of a response like that.<br/><br/>And and yeah, it was, it was pretty special. So I, I appreciate all the kind words and it was good to meet you all those years ago and hear some of your story, which I&#8217;m so excited to get into today, obviously. And so yeah, thanks for taking the time.<br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Being on your show is definitely a highlight of my FI experience because you&#8217;re the reason why I started this whole FII journey and to be on your show after all these years is basically a bucket list type of opportunity for me. So thank you again.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Oh, no, my pleasure. And yeah, like I meant to do it a long time ago because when we met in 2016, I was like, wow, Patrick has such an interesting story. I need to get them on the podcast, but then completely forgot all about it after that. And then it wasn&#8217;t until recently, just a few months ago, you had tagged me on a YouTube video that you had published.<br/><br/>And I watched it and was like, oh yeah, this is why I was to have Patrick on all those years ago. So I&#8217;m so excited. We&#8217;re getting to do it today. So for my audience who is not familiar with you, could you maybe just tell a little bit about yourself and how this whole FIRE thing came about for you? <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Definitely. So I&#8217;m originally from Africa, east Africa, the small country called Rwanda, and we&#8217;re best known for having a mountain gorillas that you can actually visit in the mountains in the wild, which is one of those experience that you have to to do if you have a chance. And so I grew up in Africa, very modest lifestyle, single mom.<br/><br/>And when I was 14, I had a chance to go to high school in Belgium and and I took it. And then so I went to high school in Belgium. I was playing basketball. And then a few buddies of mine, teammates, were playing in the US and so had a chance to go to college in the US.<br/><br/>And of course that took it because being from Africa, having a chance to live in America, it&#8217;s too big of a dream. You know, because for us going to Europe is somewhat an achievable dream because it&#8217;s not that far and a lot of people have done it. And so for a kid out of Africa, especially my country Rwanda, a lot of people go to Europe or even South Africa, which is a modern African country to really experience I guess the first world living.<br/><br/>And then when I got a chance to come to the US I took it and my plan was to come here do the whole collegiate experience and then go back to Europe and play at a pro level, like a lot of my friends were doing, but I hurt myself my second year. And then it wasn&#8217;t the same anymore.<br/><br/>So that dream was was done. And then I decided to stay in the US, which was the best decision of my life. And then got a job, started working in a sports marketing, as we talked about. Saw these ads saying sales make a lot of money as I can do that.<br/><br/>So I got the job. And after four years of like a telemarketing type of a telesales, telemarketing, what you have to call these top CEOs of big companies and pitch them, kind of like that movie, Glengarry Glen Ross, or the boiler room basically, you know, yeah.<br/><br/>You learn quick. I love those kind of movies because they remind me of my start in working, basically hitting the phone, it&#8217;s kind of like a stockbroker in a way, where you got to make a hundred calls a day and hope that you talked to 10 people and out of the 10 people, maybe a sign up one person.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> And this commission- only sales. Is that right? So you didn&#8217;t have any sort of base salary and you just earned solely off the commissions of what you sold. Is that right? <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yes. So, it was a commission only sales, and that if you sold a package, which is hard to do, but if you sell a package, you make a lot of money, thousands of dollars per package. And so we knew that I was feast or famine basically. You sell something, you make a lot of money, you sell nothing and you&#8217;re dead broke for that month, basically.<br/><br/>So it was a high turnover job because it&#8217;s not made for everybody because you have to accept rejection every single day. And in the toughest thing with a commission only sales job too, is the fact that you have to reinvent yourself every month because&#8230; I have a buddy of mine who was my CPA, and he always tells me how his job, at the beginning of each year, he already knows how many clients he&#8217;s going to doing taxes for. So he already has a book of business that he knows, we will come back every year, so he doesn&#8217;t have to go fetch a new business. Whereas for me, I can have a huge month. Then the first of the next month, I have to start from scratch.<br/><br/>I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m going to get my next deal. So it&#8217;s kind of like you have to reinvent yourself every single month.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Wow. So, so you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re just basically cold calling and hoping for the best. And you&#8217;re not really taking any warm leads into the next month.<br/><br/>Is that right? <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Exactly. I&#8217;ve been doing this since 1998. And. It&#8217;s still as hard as it was on day one. You know, of course now I have a book of business. Because you can do a great job to a customer who said, once they get their clients to let&#8217;s say, super bowl and the super bowl happens to be in your hometown, then it makes sense for you to invite a few of your top accounts and then take them to a super bowl for a nice weekend of a fun and party.<br/><br/>So you can get to meet your clients at a personal level and generate more revenue in the future because now you know&#8230; so if there&#8217;s a relationship type of packages that we sell, where you get to spend time with your client outside of a boardroom, where you get to really know him at a personal level and that usually helps your bottom line.<br/><br/>Say the Super Bowl was just in LA and you do a big junket and you invited your clients. It doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re going to do next year when the super bowl is in Phoenix so that&#8217;s why you have to find another client who is in Phoenix, who wants to do the same thing.<br/><br/>So that&#8217;s why you have to always, always, always get new leads and new clients .<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> So it sounds like what the job like that you would need some serious money management skills to be able to smooth out those highs and lows so that you can sustain yourself for every month, no matter what&#8217;s happening. It sounds like you did that, but it was just because you were so good at sales that you&#8217;re able to maintain a really lavish lifestyle. Can you talk about adjusting to that sort of income and then how you actually used that to inflate your lifestyle quite a bit. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah. So I get my job and then I become the king of of cold calling and then four years into it, I had learned the sales aspect of it, I learned the the operational sides of it. And then I was like, you know what? I think I can do this for myself. I&#8217;d have to work with somebody.<br/><br/>So that was one of my biggest accomplishment in life because four years after college, I just jumped in and started my own company in the same industry. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Oh, wow. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yes. So I wasn&#8217;t married. I had no kids. So there was nothing to lose really and everything to gain. So I jumped in and then I started my new company and the idea behind that whole thing was like, I was telling my current customers that I was starting a new company and all excited for me. And I thought I was going to get everybody to join me. But then they didn&#8217;t really join me as I thought they would.<br/><br/>Because when I did my my business plan, I counted for a certain number of accounts that would come with me. And then nobody showed. So I had to really dig deep and find new accounts to start my company. So it was tough the first six months, I thought I was going to be a bust.<br/><br/>And then after month six, I just blew up and got a bunch of deals. And the Super Bowl was in San Diego that year 2003. And I was basically sold that in a month. I like 200 people going to the Super Bowl. And I was like, wow, this is ridiculous. And then the following year I kept growing the business.<br/><br/>I went from basically $0 to $5 million in four years. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Wow. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yes. In revenue. And I had a whole sales team at that point. I had 10 people working for me. I had a whole event planning team on site. I had two event planners. I had an accounting team onsite. So we had a bunch of accounts at that point and everything was rolling.<br/><br/>And of course, with money coming in and I hadn&#8217;t seen that much money in my lifetime. So I started spending all the money as well. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Let&#8217;s just recap real quick. Did you graduate college in 98? Is that right?<br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yes. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> And then you worked for somebody else until about 2002 and then 2002, you started your own company and then it took six months to a year to get ramped up. And then 2003 you&#8217;re really cooking.<br/><br/>Is that, is that about right? <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yes.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Nice. Okay. So you got all this money coming in and yeah, talk about how that changed how you spent. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> I guess rewind a little bit, when I finished college, I started my job. A lot of people in the office talking about investing in stocks and this and that and stocks splits and all of that.<br/><br/>So I started kind of of studying up on that a little bit. And then in 2000, early 2000, I jumped in and invested $5,000 in the tech mutual fund. So it was basically all the .coms were in this fund. And then and you know, what happened that year? The whole .com bubble burst.<br/><br/>And then my $5,000 basically turned into $1,800 in like six months. So at that point, I was like, okay, I don&#8217;t believe in the stock market, I&#8217;m never going to invest in this thing again. And so I did not touch the stock market. And then in 2003, when when the money started flowing in, for me, I bought a house.<br/><br/>I bought a townhouse in downtown in a really ritzy area. And then of course when you have a new house, you have to get a new car too. At that point, I was driving an infinity FX 35. And at that point my monthly payment was about $400 or $500.<br/><br/>So I just bought a house and then I was like, okay, now just get a nice car to park in front of this house. So I went and bought a Mercedes, like the most expensive Mercedes out there where my monthly payment&#8230;I leased it, it was a three-year lease. And I was spending $1,100 a month.<br/><br/>And, Mad Fientist, I got to tell you, one thing about me was, I had a spreadsheet. So I was spending out of control, but it was always on my spreadsheet. So if it made sense of my spreadsheet, I spent it. So the way I did it for the car, as an example, I was like, okay, so I&#8217;m paying $500 for this car right here. This one is going to cost me $1,100. So it&#8217;s only $600 extra. Do I have $600 extra? Yes, I do. Okay.<br/><br/>So you know, trips, bottle service. I remember one of my birthdays was epic where we had a Cristal, think we had like 10 bottles of Cristal. So I was just spending thousands of dollars in a stupid manner.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> As someone who has never had Cristal, how is it? Is it really that much better than any other champagnes or&#8230; because I want to have had Krug champagne on a business class flight that I booked with miles on Qatar Airlines and that the Krug was amazing. Like I&#8217;m not a champagne fan, but I could drink that Krug all day.<br/><br/>Is Cristal the same sort of quality then? <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yes, it goes down smooth, like you can tell it&#8217;s a little different than the Corbel. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> But it&#8217;s not worth the money you&#8217;re spending on that one bottle though. You&#8217;re trying to get drunk and they all taste the same really. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s true. We were up in Islay, Scotland, which is where they produce all the peaty whiskies, and this completely wasted guy came up to the bar next to us and ordered a dram of whiskey for 95 pounds. So that&#8217;s like pretty much one shot of booze for 95 pounds. And we were sitting there drinking our four pound dram of something good but not 95 pounds.<br/><br/>And it took everything I had not to just swap mine for his cause I was like, there&#8217;s no way he&#8217;s going to notice. He can&#8217;t even stand up. Like, this is all going to taste the same to him and it took everything I had not to just swap that over and see what 95 pound dram actually tasted like. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, exactly. <br/><br/>So basically I was spending out of control, I was not saving anything, but one thing I did that was great though. At that time, I bought a bunch of rental properties in Arizona and I bought four properties in the same month. That was when the real estate was booming in the U S and I remember that time in Arizona and Phoenix area, there were saying, like, finding a house at $200,000 is going to be a thing of the past, you know, like these homes are going to $500,000. So I was like, yeah, let me just go in.<br/><br/>Because, as I said before, I didn&#8217;t believe in the stock market. So I was like, okay, this real estate thing. When I bought that townhouse, it appreciated real quick, within a year. And then by &#8217;05, appreciated like a couple of hundred grand on my townhouse in downtown San Diego.<br/><br/>And then I was like, okay, now I&#8217;m a believer in real estate. And then of course at that time, everybody was saying real estate never goes down. It only goes up. And when I bought those homes in Arizona as rental properties it was going great too. I hired a property manager in Phoenix and they were doing everything for me and getting an 8% cut on the rent.<br/><br/>So I didn&#8217;t have to do anything. I was just collect the checks every month. Yeah, it was just fantastic. And at that point I was like, okay, I have to ramp it up and get more properties because this real estate thing is ridiculous, you know? I&#8217;m going to be a multimillonaire in no time.<br/><br/>So as I was spending money, money was still flowing in, you know, we&#8217;re growing real fast. And my wife always makes fun of me because I had a personal shopper at Nordstrom. And so she would call me every time they had a new arrival and it put them clothes out for me.<br/><br/>I was really living it up, but I don&#8217;t regret it because I really had a great time. <br/><br/>And then in 2008, it all came to a screeching halt when the recession hit. I still remember September 2008, when the Lehman brothers went belly up then everything just stopped in my industry because this is a discretionary spending that really is not necessary for companies, no marketing dollars to spend on their clients.<br/><br/>So when the going gets tough, that&#8217;s the first thing they cut. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> So I don&#8217;t know if you remember in &#8217;08, they were laying off thousands of people, and my biggest accounts were like AIG and all these other companies that were spending stupid money on these corporate junkets and so everybody now from September until December, they all wanted their money back or canceling events and then not spending anything on corporate events.<br/><br/>So we didn&#8217;t sell anything in three months. We actually just reimbursing people. And at that point I knew, okay, this is not going well. And in December of &#8217;08, I I made a decision to basically close shop.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Wow. So at that point, you&#8217;re used to this lavish lifestyle, I guess you have some fixed expenses that are going to be not changing no matter what&#8217;s happening in the market. So you still got that $1,100 a month Benz payment, and then you got your condo that you own in San Diego that you live in, but then you got the four rental properties in Phoenix.<br/><br/>So all those bills are still coming due. Did did you maintain your tenants throughout that time? <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> No, not at all. So all the tenants started not paying and so we&#8217;re doing eviction and it was tough to try and get somebody out to get somebody in and were trashing the places. So my monthly expenses at the time were probably like about $12,000-$15,000 on my personal expenses. Company expenses, I was probably spending like $70,000 a month just to break even. So that&#8217;s when I was like, there&#8217;s no way I can continue because the money&#8217;s not flowing anymore.<br/><br/>And I still am paying that $70,000. To pay my team and as well as all the other fixed expenses that I had to pay. So I made a decision to basically close shop and I had to file for bankruptcy. So I really hit rock bottom at that time.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Obviously that must&#8217;ve been a really trying time personally. Where do you go from that? Especially when you know, the economy wasn&#8217;t really picking back up very quickly at that stage.<br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> It was really, really rough because I had no plan B, so this was my plan A, B, C, D all of them been combined in one, and then now I just lost it. And the reason why I had to file for bankruptcy was because. I had a bunch of loans that I had personally guaranteed.<br/><br/>And, there was no way I could have survived it. So I let my properties go in Arizona. And filing for bankruptcy is it&#8217;s, I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s a great thing, but it gives you a fresh start. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Right. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Did you know that when you file for bankruptcy, they expunge all your debt, but they don&#8217;t expunge your student loans. So those you pay, they don&#8217;t expunge those, but if you have money invested in the 401k or any other retirement accounts, they do not touch that.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Oh, wow. I had no idea. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yes. So let&#8217;s say instead of buying homes in Arizona, I had a SEP IRA or invested in a 401k and I had a few hundred thousand dollars in that, in that account, they would not have touched it. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Wow. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s a good thing, you know, because you had a bunch of debt that you don&#8217;t have to pay any more, but at the same time, you know, like if you were invested in the retirement account, you at least have a starting point.<br/><br/>You&#8217;re not from zero. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Right. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> So when I hit rock bottom in &#8217;09 and filed for bankruptcy. When you file for bankruptcy, you have to take a little online class, because they don&#8217;t want you to come back. Cause a lot of people either you get it or you don&#8217;t get it, you know?<br/><br/>And then you&#8217;re going to be back 10 years later, as far as filing for bankruptcy. But that hit me really hard because I was like, wow, you know, like, this is ridiculous. I mean, you can&#8217;t go any lower than I am right now because I lost everything. And so that class really hit me hard.<br/><br/>And that&#8217;s when I started doing some research on personal finance and then I found Dave Ramsey first and you know how he also had a bunch of real estate and went bankrupt also. And then he always preaches cash is king. I mean, I couldn&#8217;t finance a pen anywhere at that point.<br/><br/>You know, my credit score was, I think it was like 450 in &#8217;09 and so I was using just cash for everything. And so I was like, okay, I gotta figure out my life and I started listening to him and then doing some research a few years later, then I found the Mad Fientist.<br/><br/>And, and when I find the Mad Fientist podcast that really, really opened up my life and gave me a new lifeline. Because you had Mr. Money Mustache. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah, first guest. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yes. First guest. So I listened to what he said, and I was like, wow, that&#8217;s possible? I had no idea. This was possible.<br/><br/>And then you had JL Collins and you had JD Roth. And so all of these other FI influencers. So I started just basically just listened to your shows all the time. And then I started investing in the stock market again, because everybody was talking about index fund investing.<br/><br/>And so I started putting some money aside, investing in the stock market. And then I also knew that I had to lower my expenses because everybody was, was was talking about that on your show as well. You know, you have to us to find a way to lower your expenses. So that&#8217;s what I did. Also I forgot to tell you, I&#8217;ll also start a new company, but in the same industry, but at a smaller scale instead set of having a whole team.<br/><br/>Now, it was just me. And I was outsourcing the event planning. I was outsourcing everything else. So it was just me on the phone and just creating a smaller company in the same industry, which I knew. And this time around, I was like, okay, I have to make sure that I get something out of this industry because the first time around, I got a lot of fun, but I got nothing to show for it after.<br/><br/>So this time round, okay, I have to really now learn how to save. I learn how to invest. So any money that I make now is going towards my savings.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Right. And, so talk a little bit about decreasing your expenses. Cause I think in your video you maybe had mentioned that you decreased them by 50% over that period. Was it painful, was there things that you really missed that you&#8217;ve since added back to your life?<br/><br/>Just talk about taking such a drastic expense cut. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> At that time I was paying about about $7,000 a month in all my expenses. And I knew I could do better. And so the first thing that we did was we sold our house and so my wife had a nice condo that we lived in and we sold it and by selling and then started renting, we basically shaved off a thousand dollars from the mortgage to renting.<br/><br/>And then we continued by finding ways to shave off expense that we didn&#8217;t really need. And so I went to 6,000, 5,000, 4,000. And and then in 2013, we did something really crazy, Mad Fientist, we had about $250,000 saved up at that point. And and we&#8217;re like, okay what are we going to do with this?<br/><br/>And it was in index funds and brokerage accounts. So we decided to take down a whole chunk, which was a hundred percent of our liquid assets. When I think about it, I cringe because we took all that money and bought a condo in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Oh, wow. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> And the thinking behind the whole thing was okay well, if you buy a condo in Mexico, then we can really lower expenses because living in Mexico is basically 50% off of living in San Diego. So if we can go to Mexico, then we can really shave off even more money.<br/><br/>And the fact that my company, I could make calls from anywhere. I don&#8217;t have to be in the US. And so the idea behind buying a property in Mexico was okay, let&#8217;s rent it out now. And I didn&#8217;t even know Airbnb existed in 2013. I knew VRBO, I didn&#8217;t know Airbnb. I think they were still at the infancy stage or they were not as big as VRBO for renting your house.<br/><br/>So we&#8217;re thinking we&#8217;re going to rent it out and then use it as well. And then a few years later, I think we had a five-year plan of actually moving to Mexico and really shaving off, going from like $7,000 to probably go into that $2,000. And when you buy a place in Mexico, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with buying a property in Mexico, you cannot get a loan from Mexico, so you have to buy cash. So a lot of Americans who buy homes in Mexico, they have to either use cash or take a an equity loan out of their home and then use that to buy the place in Mexico. So it was really, really risky because Mexico, you know, when you go to Mexico for a weekend, you having a good time.<br/><br/>But it&#8217;s not a first world country. So you don&#8217;t really know when you buy a place in Mexico, if the place is actually yours, because there&#8217;s this thing called, which is a trust. So they don&#8217;t want to allow Americans to actually own a property in Mexico. So you have to put it in a trust that you open with a Mexican bank, and then that trust is renewable, every year. It costs like $400 a year. So the title of the house is in that trust, which is under my name and I can gift it to somebody. I can sell that property.<br/><br/>I can do whatever I want, it&#8217;s my property, but it has to be in the trust. So a lot of different rules that happen where you don&#8217;t really know. So what happened is the bank goes belly up, then what happened? You start to think about all these things, <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> But we were like, you know what, let&#8217;s just give it a try and see.<br/><br/>So we really put all of our chips in that one basket. And then with Airbnb, the place exploded as far as renting.<br/><br/>And so we were netting probably about $2,000 a month in rental income, after all expenses.<br/><br/>And the following year in 2014, we bought another place in Playa Del Carmen on the east coast, the Caribbean side of Mexico. And the reason why it was we&#8217;re trying to hedge kind of saying, okay, instead of buying another place in Cabo, how about we bought another place in a whole different area of Mexico?<br/><br/>So if Cabo goes bust, at least we have another place so we can kind of hedge. And so we bought that one and then it went also unbelievable as far as renting our Airbnb. So now we&#8217;re netting over $3,000 a month on just those two properties. In my head I was like, okay, so we net netting $3,000.<br/><br/>So all I need to do now is get below $3000 in expenses and then I&#8217;m free. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> So we kept moving every year. It seemed like we were moving just to shave off money from our rental. And our family members were making fun of us because we wouldn&#8217;t hire a moving company because I was so cheap at that point.<br/><br/>So I did a lot of moving of a big furniture. And every time we moved, we shaved off $500. That&#8217;s why we moved. And so in 2017 we had accumulated enough or we&#8217;re making enough money and had lowered our expenses to a level where we actually hit FI and you know how I found out I hit FI? I went on the MadFientist Lab and then I was like, I don&#8217;t know what kind of a mumbo-jumbo algorithm you use here, but let me try this. I put all the numbers. Okay. This is just, my expenses is how much I have invested and then click results. And then the Mad Fientist told me, well, you have hit FI, my friend.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s great. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> And at that time, my monthly expenses were about $2,800. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Wow. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> So I had lowered my monthly expenses to $2,800. And this is kind of crazy when you think about it too, because I live in San Diego.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Right. Yeah, exactly. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> San Diego is not a cheap place to live.<br/><br/>So that&#8217;s when I knew in 2017 that I had hit FI. And then in 2019 that&#8217;s when another huge milestone of mine, I hit that millionaire mark.<br/><br/>Yes. So it was crazy though for, you know, a kid from Africa, who grew up with nothing. Because when you&#8217;re in Africa, when you dream about being a millionaire&#8230; being a millionaire in Russian rubles, means nothing. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Or Cuban pesos, or even you know, Rwandan Francs that, okay.<br/><br/>You have a million Rawandan Francs, but being a millionaire in the US is a big deal. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Oh, yeah, definitely. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> And especially because in &#8217;09 I had nothing. It is my best accomplishment ever because especially where I came from, you know, and also my spending habits, pre recession.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah, so obviously, I guess during this time you&#8217;re building up the smaller business that you had started in 2009. Is that right? Is that what produced the income besides the rental properties? <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yes, so every money I was making, I was basically saving it and I became a saving machine at that point. Because in sales, you always think about you always trying to measure yourself with the next sales guy.<br/><br/>Because I remember when I started, you know, I was like, okay, I made a hundred grand. How much did you make? So it&#8217;s kind of a competition amongst sales people. But after &#8217;09, I didn&#8217;t really care how much I made. The biggest thing that was important for me is how much I saved.<br/><br/>So I don&#8217;t care I made 200 grand. If I don&#8217;t save anything, it means nothing. But if I save a hundred grand, then that&#8217;s a huge accomplishment because not many people can do that. <br/><br/>And it became an obsession of mine, basically, trying to find a way to save as much as I could and invested. And at that point I believed in the index investing, I believed in real estate. So my portfolio is half and half right now. Where it&#8217;s half real estate, half index fund.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> So I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of meeting your lovely wife. When in the story, did she come into the picture and was she on board with this crazy FIRE idea slash cutting expenses to 50% of what they were before?<br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> My wife is my ride or die because I met her in 2007. So she got to experience the spending Patrick. I always tell her I got you because of my Mercedes. But she she&#8217;s frugal by nature. So she, she wasn&#8217;t really wowed by all the flash and the bling.<br/><br/>And so when everything hit rock bottom, she was actually my rock because it was still early in our dating life. And if I was her, the way everything was hemorrhaging around me, I would have cut my losses and be like, okay guy&#8217;s not worth it. You&#8217;re supposed to marry up not married down, right? <br/><br/>So she stood by me and she was all in. Like every time we come up with our crazy ideas she&#8217;s always all in and always gave some great advice and when we took that big risk of buying our place in Cabo, she was the driving force.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> I wanted to quickly go back and ask you about that transition from spending as much as you were pre-2008 to then spending what you spend now or in 2017 when you hit FI. And it&#8217;s sort of a selfish question because I&#8217;ve always been naturally frugal and now that I don&#8217;t need to be as frugal, I&#8217;m trying to see what kind of spending actually moves the needle for happiness. Is there anything you miss that you cut out or was there anything that you&#8217;ve added back into your life after drastically cutting your expenses or anything interesting that you learned in those two sort of mindsets?<br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> You have to change that mindset. And that was the biggest thing for me in &#8217;09 was to change my mindset, I became a saver instead of a spender. And to do that though, you have to have a why, and if you don&#8217;t have a why it&#8217;s going to be tough.<br/><br/>So me, I spend money on experience.<br/><br/>I love traveling. So my wife and I, we&#8217;re trying to take at least two months a year going places. So what we do, we just go eight days at a time, eight days to Hawaii and then come back home.<br/><br/>And then the next month we take eight days, go to Jamaica and then come back home. And we usually do that for about two months every year. And that&#8217;s where we spend our money just to go have those memories of going to these festivals and concerts and things like that. <br/><br/>And so it&#8217;s personal again though. So I don&#8217;t knock anyone for doing what they doing. You know, if you have the money and can buy yourself a new car, go ahead and do it because you have to enjoy life, but enjoying life for me is not buying material stuff anymore.<br/><br/>So that&#8217;s why personal finance is personal. <br/><br/>A lot of my friends, they&#8217;ll always ask me how come you always on vacation? That&#8217;s why I started my YouTube channel, because I was like, maybe I should share how I did it. You know, my journey. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s awesome. And so speaking of your YouTube channel, where can people find you if they want to learn more about you, your story, or get in touch? Where can people go?<br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> So I&#8217;m active on Twitter. And my Twitter handle is @frugalsafari. <br/><br/>I have frugalsafari.com as well, where I started blogging after I met you in 2016. But then I realized I&#8217;m not a big writer, so there&#8217;s a few articles there, but maybe I should go back and write a few more, but also have a YouTube channel now called the Aime to Invest, cause my name is Patrick Aime.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> A I M E <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yes. So my YouTube channel is called Aime to Invest. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Nice. Okay, I&#8217;ll link to a link to Twitter, I&#8217;ll link to the website, and I&#8217;ll definitely link to the YouTube channel as well. And you&#8217;ve heard this show before, so, you know, I always end every interview with what&#8217;s one piece of advice you&#8217;d give to somebody on the path to financial independence?<br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> The biggest piece of advice I would give is know your expenses. Because a lot of people, I feel like the majority of Americans and everybody in the world, they don&#8217;t know how much they spend on things. So if you ask them how much you spend on your expenses every month, they don&#8217;t know. And if you don&#8217;t know how much you spend, then you&#8217;re going to have a hard time controlling your finances, because it&#8217;s controlling you at that point.<br/><br/>You have to know how much you spend every month, because once you know that, then you can have a game plan on how to achieve financial independence. So know your expenses. Itemize your expenses on a spreadsheet so you know how bad or how good it is so you can have control of your finances.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Couldn&#8217;t agree more, Patrick, thank you so much for joining me. And everyone out there go give Patrick some love on YouTube because I accidentally woke him up early on a Sunday. He had to set an alarm for the first time in years because I&#8217;m in Scotland, so that&#8217;s usually eight hours difference.<br/><br/>But it was even worse because the clocks changed last night in America and they didn&#8217;t change year. So we only figured that out today. So he had to wake up super early on a Sunday. So Patrick, thank you for doing that. This has been fantastic. Really enjoyed chatting with you and yeah, you&#8217;re welcome back anytime. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Mad Fientist, this is definitely a bucket list moment for me. We went from taking that selfie together in 2016 to now being on your show and the fact that I hit financial independence was because of you, because you showed me the way with all your interviews. So thank you so much. And this is definitely a memory that I will not forget.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s great to hear, Patrick. And I&#8217;ll use that picture of us as the main picture for this episode. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> And that&#8217;s what started the whole journey for me, basically San Diego meeting the Mad Fientist. And now I&#8217;m on the Mad Fientist show. <br/><br/>It doesn&#8217;t get any better.<br/><br/>This is basically what you call Hollywood ending, man, Hollywood ending.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s awesome, man. Thank you so much. I enjoyed it and I know the audience will too. So I really appreciate you taking the time and waking up early on a Sunday morning and hopefully I&#8217;ll see you somewhere in the world. <br/><br/><strong>Patrick:</strong> Let&#8217;s do it and say hi to your lovely wife from me. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> You do the same. Alright. Thanks buddy. Bye.

<div class="transcript">
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Hey, what&#8217;s up, everybody. Welcome to the Financial Independence Podcast, the podcast where I get inside the brains of some of the best and brightest in personal finance to find out how they achieved financial independence. Today&#8217;s episode is a long time coming. I actually interviewed my guest two years ago, which because of the coronavirus pandemic seems like a lifetime ago.<br/><br/>But the reason I haven&#8217;t published the episode yet is because I&#8217;ve been waiting for something really special to happen&#8230;and that just happened last month. I&#8217;m excited to tell you that I am now British, which is something I never expected to be in my life, but I&#8217;m so happy that I am at this stage because over the last six plus years, I&#8217;ve been sending in lots of money and applications and spending lots of time trying to get my British citizenship so that I can just come and go as I please.<br/><br/>And thankfully that finally was successful and now I&#8217;m a dual US/UK citizen, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. So to celebrate, I&#8217;m finally releasing the UK episode and I&#8217;m excited to introduce my guest, who is Barney from The Escape Artist. And those of you in the UK will know Barney cause he&#8217;s probably one of the biggest FIRE blogs in the country.<br/><br/>So when Barney was up in Edinburgh for the Edinburgh festival in 2019, he stopped by my flat and we sat down for an hour and just chatted about FIRE in the UK. And we dove into a lot of, you know, UK-specific stuff, but we also compared it to how people in the US pursue FI and the differences between the two countries that make some things easier and some things more difficult.<br/><br/>So without further delay&#8230; Barney, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it. <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Hey man, it&#8217;s great to be here at last. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> So this is actually a real weird one for me. You are actually sitting in my living room, which I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever done one at home before. But you came up from London.<br/><br/>We were going to do it in a pub or somewhere cool, since this is the UK episode, but I realized I don&#8217;t have my traveling mic. So you had to come to my apartment and use the one that&#8217;s attached to my desk. So welcome to my flat.<br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Edinburgh is just beautiful. It&#8217;s just such a cool city. And it&#8217;s great to be here while the Fringe is on. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah, the Fringe is the world&#8217;s largest arts festival. Well, it&#8217;s part of the world&#8217;s largest arts festival and it&#8217;s the whole month and it&#8217;s just one big party in the city. So you&#8217;ve definitely come on the right day. So, so yeah, this is the long awaited UK episode. I&#8217;ve gotten so many emails from UK readers asking, you know, what&#8217;s the differences between the US and the UK and you know, how do you pursue FI in the UK and all these things, and you&#8217;re going to be the man to help with that.<br/><br/>But before we get into all that, can you maybe just give my audience a little bit of details about yourself and give a little background story about how you achieve financial independence? <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Sure. I think that for a lot of people that are financially successful, if you kind of scratch the surface, there&#8217;s often a trauma kind of in their earlier life that got them started on that path.<br/><br/>And for me when my parents, when my parents moved house when I was 11 years old back in 1981, they did the classic British thing. They bought the biggest house they could, they took out as much debt as they possibly could. And their timing was awful because this was 1981. And interest rates went to 17% and my parents kind of had this realization that they&#8217;d overstretched themselves.<br/><br/>And so they had then to do a kind of period of belt tightening and the newspaper got canceled. My dad stopped buying beers, started brewing his own beer. The holiday got canceled that that year. And I think I took away from that was that debt was a kind of very scary thing. And ultimately the bank could kind of take the house away from you.<br/><br/>And so kind of from that point on, you know, I made choices in my, in my education and in my career that would put me on that path to kind of having money. And so, you know, when I went to college, I studied economics. When I graduated, I chose like a, really a profession where I could earn safe money. So I trained as a chartered accountant and qualified, and then worked in corporate finance for 20 years.<br/><br/>And really for the last 10 of those years, I was very focused on just putting away as much money as I could, because I&#8217;d had an experience at one of my jobs where I realized that kind of I was trapped. I had I had a mortgage at that point. We had children on the way. My wife had given up her job and so the whole kind of burden of providing for the family was on my shoulders. And I, I took a job that I hated. And from that point onwards, I saved at least half of my income every month. Fast forward to 2013 and I realized that I had enough. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah, you said you were trapped, which maybe leads into the whole theme behind your blog so maybe you do want to tell the story about the escaping from the prison camp. <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Yeah, so the prison camp is my kind of analogy or my metaphor for the situation that a lot of us kind of put ourselves into where we kind of create our own prison. We trap ourselves through our spending choices by taking on debt, by kind of societal expectations.<br/><br/>And that can lead you to a point where you&#8217;re no longer happy doing that, you know, doing a job, but you feel you have no choice, but to carry on doing that. And, and I, I certainly felt trapped at that time in my life. And I just couldn&#8217;t see a way out of the prison camp other than to kind of slowly dig my way out stone by stone, rock by rock, but by saving money.<br/><br/>And that the prison camp analogy is based on a kind of World War Two story of, you know, The Great Escape, the film, The Great Escape, where the prisoners literally kind of dug their way out to the prison camp in this amazingly kind of painstaking, slow, laborious process. And that, that kind of amused me that analogy.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s great. And I want to go back to something you said, you mentioned, what was it? 17% interest. <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Yeah, yeah, absolutely. One day there&#8217;ll be 17% again. And you kind of wonder what the world will look like at that point. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> It will look very different. No doubt. Yeah. That&#8217;s I just released a post not too long ago about whether you should pay off your mortgage early or something.<br/><br/>And I&#8217;m definitely in the camp where I&#8217;m just looking to buy a house just so I can lock in some of these low, low interest rates. Cause they may potentially be, you know, once in a lifetime interest rates and yeah, it would feel pretty good to have a 30 year mortgage at 3% or something. If, if interest rates do go up to what they were before.<br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Well, everything in finances is cyclical.<br/><br/>The problem is, you know, history never quite repeats itself in the same way. So you kind of know things are going to change, but you don&#8217;t know exactly how and you don&#8217;t know exactly where. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> So obviously based on your history and your background in economics and your accent obviously proves that you are a Brit, you&#8217;re going to know a lot more about the UK side of things than I am, even though I live here.<br/><br/>A lot of my focus is still on the U S because that&#8217;s where most of my money is. So before we dive into some of the nitty gritty details about, you know, pursuing FI in the UK versus the US maybe, could we talk about, are there any like broad cultural differences that sort of change the change of the game in any way?<br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Yeah. The first thing to say is that when I was, I mean, I got serious that, that career crisis that I mentioned that really put me on the path to aggressively saving 50 plus percent that happened in 2002, 2003. And so you have to remember at that time in the UK, there was no financial independence movement.<br/><br/>There was no awareness of the U S financial independence movement. So, I mean, the book, Your Money or Your Life, I think came out in 1990, but when I was going through my journey, I had, no, I hadn&#8217;t read that book. I had no awareness of all of it. And you just didn&#8217;t have the, the tools, the resources, the blogs, the podcasts that we have today. And that, that is just a massive help. And, and the fact now is that, you know, we in the UK benefit from that accumulated body of knowledge that&#8217;s been built up, you know, mostly in the US not, not completely, but mostly in the US we benefit from that massively. And it&#8217;s pretty easy to convert most of that content over to a, to a UK actionable plan.<br/><br/>You know, the differences in terminology are relatively simple to, to translate, you know, it&#8217;s not hard to convert our IRA to workplace pension. It&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s not that hard to convert VTSAX to VWRL et cetera. So, so, you know, we have this kind of huge advantage of the internet now, and the body of knowledge, you know, in 2013, the thing that kind of triggered the realization that I had enough was stumbling across Mr. Money Mustache&#8217;s site. And it, it just kind of blew my mind. And so I guess, you know, since then I&#8217;ve been kind of observing the differences between the US blogs and the, the kind of the UK content on financial independence and trying to create some, some UK content on financial independence, on The Escape Artist.<br/><br/>And. What I, you know, what you realize is that you&#8217;re doing that in a slightly different historical context and a slightly different cultural context. And I think one of the reasons that the the American movement kind of took off quicker earlier, faster&#8230;partly there&#8217;s a historical tradition to draw on there that goes all the way back to kind of Henry David Thoreau and Walden, all the way to kind of blogs like Early Retirement Extreme and then Mr. Money Mustache. So there&#8217;s that historical strand of frugality and self-reliance and rugged individualism in, in, in American culture and a focus on freedom. And in some ways there&#8217;s more of a burning platform in the US because I think the pressure of marketing, advertising, and consumerism is even greater in the US than it is in the UK.<br/><br/>I mean, certainly as a Brit, when I went to America and you kind of, you went from four TV channels of which one or two had adverts to cable to seeing cable TV, and just flicking through 70 channels that were running 24/7, just with this, these infomercials and these adverts kind of beamed at you, you kind of realize that the pressure of commercialism is greater in the U S and so I think one of the things that&#8217;s meant we&#8217;ve been slower in the UK to stumble across some of the secrets of financial independence is in some ways there was less of a burning platform for us, there was perhaps a greater focus on tradition, culture, community than in some parts of America, which, you know, some parts of America can seem pretty kind of brutally commercial.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. I absolutely agree. Having lived in both places and, you know, having lived in the UK for probably 10 years in total by now, I can definitely see that. And I agree that there&#8217;s&#8230;obviously, yes, there&#8217;s a focus on freedom in the States that may be more pronounced. And also, yeah, you&#8217;re just being bombarded with things all the time.<br/><br/>And like, I couldn&#8217;t believe it. I went back to my parents&#8217; house for Christmas just last year, I think. And the commercials on TV out lasted the program. So I was going crazy after a while, so I literally timed it and it was six minutes and 20 seconds of advertisements to six minutes in like six seconds of actual program.<br/><br/>People are paying like a hundred dollars a month for this privilege of getting just bombarded with all the stuff that they don&#8217;t have. <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Yeah. So just the existence of the BBC, I think is a kind of moderating factor. You know, the, you just don&#8217;t have that constant constant stream of adverts. There is this kind of tradition of public sector broadcasting, which, which kind of includes the concept of entertaining, but also educating as well. So we have all these kind of great, we benefit from, you know, from these great nature documentaries on the BBC produced it know great cost, great expense. And so that&#8217;s kind of part of the, the upside, I think of the British culture. But it may be one of the reasons why FIRE was kind of slower to take off over here.<br/><br/>The other, the other thing I do think we have to touch on actually is, is the kind of legacy of the class structure in the UK. It&#8217;s definitely a relevant part of our history. So if you kind of think back in you know, a couple of hundred years ago, you had this kind of post feudal society where you&#8217;ve got the aristocracy at the top of the pile and they&#8217;re living off passive income. So, you know, they own the stocks in the stock market. They own that most of the land that they own rental properties. And then you&#8217;ve got a you&#8217;ve got a middle class that, that the kind of the doctors and the lawyers, et cetera, who have good incomes and are kind of saving steadily.<br/><br/>And then you traditionally had a kind of a working class who live paycheck to paycheck and that class structure, it leaves a legacy because kind of one of the ways I think about getting to financial independence in the UK today is you have to change your mindset. Kind of starting off from a working class mindset where you&#8217;re living paycheck to paycheck, and you kind of have to learn those middle-class habits of kind of thrift you know, caution, prudence learning to put aside some money, but even then, that&#8217;s not enough. You can&#8217;t just have a middle-class mindset if that prevents you from kind of exposing your money to risk and exposing your money to the volatility of you know, owning real assets like the stock market or like rental property. And so in some ways, you know, an individual&#8217;s journey from kind of starting out to quitting their job means going from a kind of working class mindset to a middle-class mindset and ultimately throwing that off and becoming your own boss and your own kind of if you like the CEO of your own of your own life which, which means kind of you know, being, being your own Lord of the Manor as it were.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> And that appears to be a very difficult to do because as you&#8217;ve seen, you know, this whole thing has not grown as quickly or or as broadly as it has in the States. And I think that&#8217;s probably because it&#8217;s such a big identity shift for people in the UK who,ou know, have always considered themselves working class. And just always imagine they would be working class because that&#8217;s what their parents were and that&#8217;s where their grandparents were. And, you know, obviously in America, like the American dream, everybody is born and think they they&#8217;re going to be the richest person in the country. And obviously that doesn&#8217;t happen to everyone but I see that difference there too. It&#8217;s like people do feel like they can move up and they all think that they will. Now, that&#8217;s great because that drives people and gives them, you know, motivation to work hard and do things like that. But also, I worry that that&#8217;s sorta some of the discontent and unhappiness in the States, especially these days with social media, where you can see the people that have made it and you haven&#8217;t quite made it there yet because you, and you may not because not everybody will. And so in Scotland, at least, like I find that it looks like more people are broadly happier just on day-to-day life and they&#8217;re happier with their position and make the best life that they can at that level.<br/><br/>Do you agree with that? And if so, do you think it&#8217;s more of a benefit or more of a hinderance?<br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> That&#8217;s a great kind of insight. I mean, I am a great believer in meritocracy. I&#8217;m a great believer in social mobility. I&#8217;m a great believer in that idea that anyone should be able to kind of rise to be the CEO.<br/><br/>The downside of that is that if you create a truly meritocratic society and then individuals fail, they&#8217;ve kind of got no one to blame other than themselves. And it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s like, It&#8217;s like you&#8217;ve unleashed a set of expectations there that if people are unable to meet through whatever reason, you know, maybe, maybe it&#8217;s there it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s something that they did wrong, maybe it&#8217;s just bad luck. You know, luck plays a huge part in life, in money, and investing, as we all know. And so if you live in a culture that is meritocratic and socially mobile, such as the US that&#8217;s great for a mindset of, I can do anything, but that the kind of the flip side of that is failure hurts more.<br/><br/>And you know, you could, you can make a very good argument for, you know, that there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s almost this comfort in kind of staying in your, in your world and what you know, and so. You know, meritocracy has a cost. It&#8217;s if you look at kind of suicide rates, for example, suicide rates, suicide is not a problem in feudal societies because everyone knows their place and even people at the bottom of the pile, they don&#8217;t beat themselves up about that. Cause it&#8217;s just, that&#8217;s just the hand that they were dealt. So one of the kind of downsides of meritocracy is it just feels harder when you fail. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s a good time to bring up what we were talking about just before we started the interview and how you were saying how you&#8217;re focusing more on, you know, talking about enjoying that journey to financial independence, rather than that end goal.<br/><br/>Can you maybe talk about that focus and what made you shift to that. <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Yeah this is a theme that I&#8217;ve been exploring more and more in recent blog posts, because I think that the, the carrot of early retirement is so kind of powerful as a, as an image as a kind of an attention grabber as, as a hook for a lot of people and particularly a lot of media coverage of financial independence just focuses on that.<br/><br/>Here are the people that retired in their thirties or here are the people that retired in their forties, but that crowds out the kind of more subtle benefits of this way of life, of this way of thinking about the world. And so, I&#8217;ve been kind of exploring that in recent blog posts. <br/><br/>I wrote a blog post recently called &quot;Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s in it for you right now&quot;.<br/><br/>Just looking at the benefits from pursuing financial independence you know, the benefits, things like, you know, having a mission, having a goal, having a clear idea of where you want to get to, kind of forcing yourself to take action, forcing yourself to exercise your frugality muscle, forcing yourself to exercise your actual muscles and start kind of walking rather than just getting ferried around in cabs.<br/><br/>These are the kind of immediate benefits of pursuing financial independence because ultimately, I think that if the way that you&#8217;re thinking about this is I will accept 15 or 20 years of misery and deprivation in order to get to the promised land, that&#8217;s a bad trade. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. Couldn&#8217;t agree more. And, what you said, highlights that, even if you are uncomfortable with the idea of maybe moving up to another level that you hadn&#8217;t even thought about, or if you are very comfortable and happy in the current level that you&#8217;re at, which is great, like, this is all at the end of the day about happiness and living a fulfilling life.<br/><br/>So if you&#8217;re already there. Yes, that carrot of early retirement is probably not going to be too motivating. But as you said, there are so many other benefits and I will link to that post in the show notes, so anybody can check that out if they want to dive in more. But yeah, I couldn&#8217;t agree more.<br/><br/>So we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve covered sort of this cultural, societal differences, but also, you know, the government here is very different. The social nets in place are different. And so surely that plays into it. One on a tax perspective, you&#8217;re going to be paying more taxes, but then you also have, you know, less distance to fall if things do go wrong. Could you maybe talk about those differences? <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Yeah, so I think it&#8217;s absolutely right that it&#8217;s harder to get to financial independence in the UK in the sense that post-tax incomes are typically lower than in the US for two reasons. One is, the tax burden is higher in the UK, and secondly, it&#8217;s just not quite as rich an economy.<br/><br/>And so you&#8217;re trying to save 50 plus percent of your income out of post-tax income, which is lower in the UK than the US, so that let&#8217;s make no bones about it&#8230;that makes it harder. No doubt. The counter balance to that is that you hopefully do not have to pay for health insurance from your post tax income.<br/><br/>But again, that&#8217;s an interesting one because when I was in my corporate job, I had private health insurance through my job. And so for me to walk away from that, I kind of had to get over the mental hurdle of what if the NHS isn&#8217;t there to fix me in a reasonable period of time, because, as we all know, there are waiting lists for a number of operations in the UK.<br/><br/>And so part of the equation is what if I needed one of those operations and I wasn&#8217;t prepared to wait one or two years for it. So again, that&#8217;s kind of thinking about, am I mentally prepared to self insure? Because the truth is, the NHS is excellent for very urgent conditions.<br/><br/>You know, life-threatening, urgent, acute conditions, but you always have the option to buy in private medical treatment at short notice, if that&#8217;s what you want to do. And actually, when I&#8217;ve looked at the kind of cost benefit analysis of that, some of the kind of general health insurance premiums are so high, I just think, look, I&#8217;ll keep myself healthy and hopefully I won&#8217;t need it, but if I just need to buy in an operation at some point, I can afford to do that. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s really interesting. That&#8217;s a good way to think about it. Because I had heard that lots of people had private health insurance, but I didn&#8217;t think you could self-insure in that way.<br/><br/>So you&#8217;ve been just relying on the NHS since then? <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Yeah. I mean, touch wood. I haven&#8217;t had great call to kind of visit the NHS for myself too much since then. But, I take comfort from the fact that having looked at some of the kind of costs of operations, it&#8217;s actually not much more to buy it in than it is to pay the annual insurance premium.<br/><br/>So it&#8217;s relatively affordable if you have kind of FI levels of net worth. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s fantastic. As someone who is an American living in the UK the NHS just is, I love it. And we&#8217;re a bit spoiled in Scotland because the population is lower and I think there&#8217;s more coverage with doctors per person in the population so we don&#8217;t have to deal with a lot of the things that you may have to deal with down in England. But I just absolutely love the feeling of going into a doctor&#8217;s office and them just asking all these questions, trying to get to the bottom of why you don&#8217;t feel well, and then them referring you to anyone that they think could help better without thinking about costs or how much is it going to be to see a specialist or how much is this prescription going to be?<br/><br/>It just boils down to, how do you feel? How can we make you feel better? And we&#8217;re going to do all these things because we think those are the things that are gonna make you feel better. And it just, it&#8217;s very refreshing for peace of mind and for someone who&#8217;s a relatively healthy person, I have really enjoyed just the security of it and just knowing that it&#8217;s there. And, as you said, you always have the option to go private to, which is no doubt, a lower cost than going private in the States would be. <br/><br/>And in Scotland, there&#8217;s also free education. So free higher education, which is something that people in England may not have the same sort of privilege of having. Is that correct? <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> That is absolutely correct. And that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s changed since I went to university. Back then it was kind of a no brainer in the sense that only perhaps 10% of the population went to university and you got free tuition fees. And that has changed. And this is very fresh in my mind right now because my daughter&#8217;s just about to go off to university in the next few weeks. And so I&#8217;m very well aware of the cost. The cost has gone up and it&#8217;s cost is now born by the by the student. And. In some ways the returns to a college education have decreased because if 50% of the population are going to college education, then ultimately you&#8217;ve just got a much broader pool of people competing for the same jobs that you used to have, the 10% of the population competing for.<br/><br/>So, back in the day, university was an absolute no brainer in the UK. Now, I think it&#8217;s a more kind of balanced cost benefit decision to be made. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> So eliminating potentially big student loan debt, if you&#8217;re in Scotland or I believe even in England, the costs of higher education are lower and then taking away the burden of paying for your own health insurance or finding a job that provides you health insurance so that you can cover healthcare costs. Those two things seem like a huge leg up on someone&#8217;s journey to financial independence. Do you think that those benefits outweigh the lower wages or do you think in general it is still more difficult?<br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a whole range of factors. And I think the fact that college tuition is free in Scotland or was free in England for me. That&#8217;s a huge advantage in the column for the UK. I still think that when you kind of add everything up, it&#8217;s somewhat easier to get to financial independence in the US than the UK, but that includes a very broad range of factors.<br/><br/>You know, part of which is behavioral, as well as the kind of pure economics of it. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah, based on what I&#8217;ve seen, I would agree with you. I think the higher incomes that you can potentially achieve in the States are obviously a big benefit to someone pursuing FI. <br/><br/>To move on to some of the more nitty gritty details.<br/><br/>The first thing I wanted to talk to you about is pensions because I have a pension from my very first job in my career. And it is the most annoying thing because if you have foreign accounts over 10,000 dollars, you have to tell the government that you have them every single year. So I have this pension from, I think it was 2004 was probably when I started the job and I worked there for three or four years so I have exceeded that amount, but not by much. So I have this annoying account that I can&#8217;t transfer the money to the States, because all my other money I&#8217;ve just transferred to the States, and this thing is locked down and I was even considering like giving it to my wife, Jill, just so it wasn&#8217;t mine anymore and I wouldn&#8217;t get into trouble with the government if I forgot to tell them about it one year. And I&#8217;ve thought about giving it to charity. All these things and I have not found a way to get rid of it.<br/><br/>So maybe just talk about the prevalence of pensions here. If they are similar to a 401k, in some ways, if they&#8217;re different. And, is there any way I can get that money out of my name? <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Is that a UK pension?<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> It is, yes. <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Okay, so I divide UK pensions into two, broadly. So there&#8217;s the pension scheme that your probably in with your workplace pension, but that relates to your current employment.<br/><br/>And then there&#8217;s SIPS, self invested personal pensions and normally the way that your workplace pension works in the UK is that there is some form of matching going on. So maybe you&#8217;re asked to put in 5% and if you put in up to 5%, then your employer may put in up to 10%.<br/><br/>So maybe they kind of double what you put in it. If that&#8217;s the case, if there&#8217;s any sort of matching, then you never leave free money on the table. You always put in the most that you can to get your employer match at a hundred percent. So that&#8217;s kind of step one. Step two is people&#8217;s current workplace pension.<br/><br/>Most people have no idea what&#8217;s going on with it. And so. I say to people just dig out the paperwork. What happens time and time again is people join a job, they get sent a stack of papers to look at, they never kind of get around to reading it all. It&#8217;s all very lengthy, boring, confusing. And so people kind of bury their head in the sand. The problem with that is that you will get defaulted into an automatic kind of default fund choice where someone else has made the decision for you and it&#8217;s probably a suboptimal asset allocation. So if you don&#8217;t make a conscious choice with your workplace pension, you&#8217;re probably being put into something like a 60/40, 60% equities, 40% fixed income.<br/><br/>And if you&#8217;re 25 that&#8217;s a disaster, or if you&#8217;re 30, that&#8217;s a disaster because 40% of your pot is earning not enough to keep up with inflation and only 60% of it is doing the heavy lifting that equities do over the long term. So the first thing most people need to do is just understand what fund their contributions are going into.<br/><br/>You know, normally you can just make a choice to go 100% equities in a global equity tracker tracker fund. Now often Vanguard is not on the option for a workplace pension, but there&#8217;s almost always a kind of Vanguard lookalike. In other words, a low-cost global equity index tracker fund, where that&#8217;s a hundred percent equities.<br/><br/>So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the next thing to look at. And then, if you want to get more kind of hands-on and more clever, you have the option of what&#8217;s called partial transfers, where you can take money out of your workplace pension and move it across to a self-invested personal pension to benefit potentially from lower fees and the ability to access Vanguard&#8217;s product range.<br/><br/>And so you often have to stay in your workplace pension to carry on getting the contributions, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t shift money out of it and get control over that money by, by what&#8217;s called a partial transfer. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That is great to hear because I did not realize that and I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do.<br/><br/>So yeah, exactly as you said, I did all the right things. I was 22 and that was starting my career. And I was like, oh, I know I need to get this match so I&#8217;m going to do this. And then I actually looked into the investment, so I&#8217;m invested in better things than whatever the default was, that&#8217;s for sure.<br/><br/>But now if I can transfer that into my own thing, and have lower fees and then maybe put all my riskiest investments in there. And then that way, if it does get to zero, then at least I don&#8217;t have to deal with the account anymore. And if it grows to something even more impressive, then at least then it&#8217;s worth the hassle of dealing with it with the IRS every year.<br/><br/>So that could be a potentially really good choice to make. <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> You raise a great point about risk there. In your pension, you&#8217;ve got time on your side. You&#8217;re not going to be able to access that until you&#8217;re 55 or 57 or whatever the age may change to be in the future.<br/><br/>So for anyone that&#8217;s five or 10 years plus away from that point, you should be taking as much risk as possible in that workplace pension. Why would you not be 100% in a global equities index tracker fund? <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> You said tracker fund. So this is a good time to maybe match up some terminology.<br/><br/>So in the UK, a tracker is an index fund and that&#8217;s the common word for it. Could you maybe go through the list of common US terms that I use a lot on my blog and some of the other bloggers use as well, like 401k, IRA, and maybe try to match it up with the UK equivalent? <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> So a lot of UK readers read the US blogs and they see people talking about VTSAX and they see people talking about VTI, which are two of the popular Vanguard total market funds in the US.<br/><br/>And I just say to people in the UK, we have great equivalence for that in the Vanguard UK product lineup. So if you convert VTSAX or VTI into VWRL which is the Vanguard all-world equities ETF, or there&#8217;s a mutual fund called the Vanguard global all-cap index fund.<br/><br/>Those are great kind of replacements for those popular US funds and VWRL and the Vanguard global all-cap index on are truly global funds. So they include the US at its full weighting. They include the UK, Japan and the whole of the rest of the world. So it&#8217;s a kind of easy win just to convert VTSAX to VWRL or and so.<br/><br/>So that&#8217;s an easy one. In terms of IRAs, individual retirement accounts, are analogous to self-invested pension plans. 401ks are analogous to our workplace pension schemes. <br/><br/>Other things that people read about on US blogs are, travel hacking and credit card credit card rewards, which there&#8217;s less of an opportunity for that in the UK. And so I just say to people, you know, that&#8217;s nice if you can get yourself an Amex Platinum card and you might get 1% cash back and like 1 percent is worth having, right. But you&#8217;re probably not going to be able to fly around the world on your credit card rewards in the same way that our American friends seem to be able to do.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah, my brother-in-law who is Scottish, he just can&#8217;t stand the amount of things that I get through credit card points. And he is just always desperate to try to get into the same sort of things. The signup bonusesare usually a quarter or less of what you could get in the States and then the ongoing earning is like you said, max, maybe 1% cash back.<br/><br/>So yeah, the people in the States do have it really good. <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Yeah. And there&#8217;s a couple of other kind of aspects in terms of the tax sheltering that are different. So in the UK, money that&#8217;s locked up in a pension is locked up in a pension. There is no concept of you can access it, but you pay a discount, which I understand is possible in the US so when you&#8217;re thinking in the UK about how much is enough, you can take the great kind of guidance that&#8217;s on many of the US blogs and the concept of the safe withdrawal rate and the 25 times rule of thumb.<br/><br/>That is, I would argue as applicable in the UK as it is in the US. Because, you know, we can from the UK, invest globally. So I just don&#8217;t buy the argument that says, the safe withdrawal rate, maybe 4% in the US but the UK stock market is less dynamic and has delivered less growth.<br/><br/>You know, we have the ability to invest into the US stock market. We have the ability to invest globally, as I said before, from the UK. So that&#8217;s no reason for the safe withdrawal rate to be lower in the UK. But it&#8217;s a kind of two-fold calculation. So calculation number one is, do I have 25 times my annual spending in my invested net worth.<br/><br/>And then the second question to ask yourself is, do I have enough to bridge the gap? In other words, do I have enough outside of my pensions to take me from age, let&#8217;s say 45 to age 55. You need 10 years outside of your SIPP or outside of your workplace pension to bridge that gap. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s something I actually calculated when I was on the path to FI, even though I didn&#8217;t know that there were ways to get the money out.<br/><br/>And so if you&#8217;re interested, you can go to madfientist.com/spreadsheet. And that spreadsheet actually does divide it out and it has an after retirement age, before retirement age calculation, just so you can see, how much of your money is free to use now and how much of it in the States is going to be a little bit harder to use potentially and then in the UK, it&#8217;s going to be impossible to use. <br/><br/>You mentioned ISAs which I think is the equivalent to the IRA. I just recently discovered the lifetime ISA, which seems like a pretty sweet account. And I just convinced my wife to set one up for herself because I believe you have to set it up before you&#8217;re 40, but then you could keep contributing to it until you&#8217;re 50 and it&#8217;s an account where every year you can put 4,000 pounds into it and then the government will give you a thousand pounds on top of that for that same contribution. So you&#8217;re effectively getting a 25% return instantly. Are there any other sweet accounts like that, that I may not be familiar with? Or what are the types of accounts that you sort of recommend to your readers to take advantage of? <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Okay. So in, in terms of pure tax efficiency, the most tax efficient way to save in the UK is via a pension at your workplace pension or a self invested personal pension. So the way that that works is if, for example, you&#8217;re 40% taxpayer, if you put in 60 pounds into your pension, the government groceries that up to 100 within the space of a year. And so you&#8217;re getting a 40 pounds return on a 60 pound investment, free of risk, essentially, and guaranteed by HM government. And so there&#8217;s not many deals that are better than that available, plus the fact that when you get to access your pension, you can take 25% of it as a tax-free lump sum.<br/><br/>So that&#8217;s a great deal. The problem with that though is the loss of liquidity, the loss of access, the lockup until you&#8217;re 55 or 57 or whatever that may change to in the future. The beauty though of ISAs, individual savings accounts, is that there&#8217;s no lockup. So let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re kind of in your twenties and you&#8217;re going full bore for financial independence.<br/><br/>It would be a mistake for someone like that to use their pension as their sole savings vehicle. They need to they need to use their ISA. You have a 20,000 pounds limit every year, if you&#8217;re married, that means you effectively as a couple, you have 40,000 of tax-free savings ability and that is use it or lose it.<br/><br/>So it absolutely makes sense to use it. And so that kind of conventional ISA, I would suggest you use first because that shelters the money effectively from income tax and capital gains tax and there&#8217;s no liquidity lock up to it at all. Then in addition to that, you have the lifetime ISA that you mentioned. The problem with the lifetime ISA is that if you don&#8217;t use it to buy a house and you want it back before retirement age, you pay a penalty, which essentially means that you&#8217;re slightly worse off for having done that.<br/><br/>So lifetime ISAs work for people under 40 who know that they&#8217;re going to use the pot to buy a house, or they know that they can wait until retirement age. But if you&#8217;re not sure that you&#8217;re gonna buy a house and you might want to get your hands on it, then it&#8217;s not as advantageous as just a conventional ISA.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. Luckily for my wife, this will be after retirement age. So she&#8217;s comfortable with it being locked up. Or she&#8217;s not very comfortable with it, but she was able to be convinced that she should do that. <br/><br/>And so the lifetime, I say, you mentioned that you could get that money out early for home purchase. That&#8217;s a first time home buyer purchase, is that correct? <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Yes, I think so. Yeah. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Okay. So this brings us nicely into real estate. So there&#8217;s something I had just learned from a Mad Fientist reader. Actually, it was meeting up with somebody for a beer a couple of weeks ago, and he told me about the fact that you could potentially Airbnb out one of your rooms in your residence and earn up to 7,500 pounds without paying taxes on it.<br/><br/>Is that something that you&#8217;ve come across? <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Yeah, the government has a rent-a-room scheme where you can, as you say first 7,500 pounds is free of tax. And I just don&#8217;t know why more people don&#8217;t do this. To me, if you read the newspapers, which I don&#8217;t recommend actually in most cases, you&#8217;ll read about the pensions crisis, whereby many people don&#8217;t have enough in their pension to sustain them. And you&#8217;ll also read about something about the housing crisis. Housing is expensive in the UK, there is a shortage of decent quality rooms to rent that give you kind of a lower cost option than buying your own home or renting a whole house out.<br/><br/>And the rent-a-room scheme is the answer to both. So people with spare rooms and not enough in their pension get income and younger people that want cheap accommodation, they get cheap accommodation. So to me, we have this crazy situation where there&#8217;s a housing crisis at a time where I think there&#8217;s something like 19 million spare rooms in England not being occupied. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Speaking of real estate, how do you feel that plays into somebody&#8217;s FIRE journey? Is it as lucrative, potentially, as it is in the States are the differences? What is your take on real estate investing? <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> So my take on real estate investing. There&#8217;s two traditional classes of assets that have worked for wealth building, wealth accumulation, and getting to financial independence. You know, one is equities/stock market and the other is real estate. And in some ways, if you really want to get there quickly, one way to speed up the journey is to kind of go extreme on the property side. So if I&#8217;d wanted to have got to financial independence ,quicker one of the options that we could have done is rather than buying a house and kind of settling down in it, we could have like buy a house, do it up, flip it, and just keep flipping, keep moving up the property ladder because there&#8217;s no capital gains tax on your primary principal residence. And so with the stock market outside of a tax sheltered account, there&#8217;s income tax and capital gains tax, and the equivalent in property is that for buy-to-let properties, you are subject to capital gains tax, but for your own home you can escape those capital gains. And so it&#8217;s a tax efficient way to accumulate wealth and kind of roll up value in your house. <br/><br/>What say to people though, is if you own a house in the UK, you probably have a big chunk of your net worth in UK real estate. Just because housing is so expensive here and therefore I don&#8217;t personally think it makes a lot of sense to then add to that exposure to UK real estate in terms of then building up a buy-to-let portfolio, because you&#8217;ve kind of got all your eggs in one basket and essentially, Brexit has been a reminder to people who have a lot of money in the property basket that things can happen and the situation can change and that assets that they thought were kind of uncorrelated are in fact correlated.<br/><br/>So the way that I&#8217;ve done it is to buy a house, to own that house, to pay the mortgage off, but then to use stock market as my kind of primary source of wealth building for that kind of risk reason. <br/><br/>Also if you look at the data in the UK, if you look at last a hundred years or so, it wa it would seem to indicate that an unleveraged real estate and the stock market perform pretty similarly in terms of total returns, but the beauty of the stock market versus buy-to-let landlording is it&#8217;s a truly passive investment. So there&#8217;s no boilers breaking. There&#8217;s no phone calls late at night from your agent or from the tenants. So the beauty of stock market investing is it can be made essentially free of hassle.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> So we&#8217;re getting to the end of the interview here and there&#8217;s possibly questions that I didn&#8217;t even know to ask. And there may be things that I don&#8217;t even know about in the UK that you would recommend to somebody on the path to FI. Is there anything we haven&#8217;t touched on yet that&#8217;s worth speaking about or is there anything so different that I just don&#8217;t even know?<br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> So I think it&#8217;s worth talking about in the UK context, kind of geographic arbitrage, just in the sense that a lot of people who are on this path to financial independence are based in a high cost of living area, you know, London or the Southeast and they&#8217;re living there now and they&#8217;re on the property ladder and they have a lot of money tied up in expensive London housing, or expensive Southeast housing and one option to kind of massively accelerate your journey is to sell up in London at some point and just move somewhere much cheaper.<br/><br/>So that the kind of example that I give it&#8217;s somewhat of an extreme example, but it does kind of make the point. If you&#8217;re slaving away as a professional in London, in a small terrace house, life can feel like a bit of a grind and yet, a short plane ride away in the south of France, the real estate is amazing in the sense that you had modern two bedroom apartments that you could buy on the beach front for 50-60,000 euros. And just imagine how many people there are in London sitting in their half a million or 1 million pound semi-detached house or terraced house who at a stroke could just sell up, go and live on the beach in the south of France. <br/><br/>And look, I&#8217;m not suggesting that everyone do that because it&#8217;s a really important part of financial independence is working out what you do when you get there and what that looks like and how do you build a kind of meaningful life with a community and you don&#8217;t just kind of take yourself off to the beach and live isolated. But it does show you the power of being prepared to be flexible. It does show you that the power kind of thinking outside the box and it does show you how much money we in the UK kind of sink into our houses and that they can end up kind of being an anchor in the sense that they tie you to one place and they kind of trap you in one place.<br/><br/>So I do say to people in the UK, if you don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;re going to be living somewhere for ideally 10 years, then you&#8217;ve really got no business buying there because the costs are so high, not just the kind of purchase price, but the stamp duty, et cetera, you&#8217;re better to stay flexible at this point in the cycle.<br/><br/>And you know, at some point, conditions will change and maybe there&#8217;ll be a housing bust and some great bargains will be available. I mean, imagine the bargains that would be available if we went back to those 17% interest rates. So the wheel will turn and at some point there will be bargains to be had.<br/><br/>But, but right now, to me, it makes no sense to tie yourself to one place if you don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;re going to be there long term, when, when housing costs are so high in the UK. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> And just like with all geographic arbitrage, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to even be international. You could, move an hour and a half outside of London, still be close to your family and friends and maybe cut that house price in half. Or even move up to Edinburgh&#8230; Don&#8217;t inflate our house prices, but yeah, somewhere like Edinburgh, that&#8217;s beautiful and still a city with all the amenities that you enjoy in London, but maybe a quarter of the cost, which is maybe what property prices are up here.<br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Well, I don&#8217;t want to give away your personal location, brandon, but we are sat here in a beautiful kind of crescent of Georgian and housing, which in London would just be insanely expensive.<br/><br/>So the quality of life here is amazing. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> I completely agree. Yeah, this is like a very reasonably priced, flat, fully furnished that we rent and it&#8217;s in the center of the city and it&#8217;s a capital city in Europe, and yet we pay not much compared to what they pay down in London, which is really good. <br/><br/>We&#8217;re we&#8217;re getting to the end of the interview and this has been incredible so I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me. Obviously people can find you at theescapeartist.me. Is there anywhere else I should point them to?<br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> No, the blog is the place to find me. I am on social media, but you can kind of find that through the blog. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Great. Well, I can&#8217;t let you go without asking the question that I&#8217;ve asked all my guests so what&#8217;s one piece of advice you&#8217;d give to somebody on the path to financial independence? <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> My piece of advice would be to start and to start as early as you can. And just get on with it, right. There are no downsides to getting on this path. It is not binary in the sense that it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re having to commit to a path that you can&#8217;t change as you go along.<br/><br/>So I often see people kind of procrastinating, kind of agonizing over you know, what&#8217;s the best fund or what&#8217;s the best strategy. The best thing that you can just do is think 80/20, get started, take some action, and get on the path and you will figure out the rest as you go along, you don&#8217;t have to figure it all out upfront. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s great advice. And this has been an absolute pleasure. So thank you so much for joining me. This is a long time coming. I think sometime last year we were trying to meet up in a pub somewhere because I thought the UK episode should take place in a London pub. But that didn&#8217;t happen so this has been a long time coming. So I really appreciate you joining me. <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> I just wanted to say thank you, Brandon, because your podcast was one of the things that gave me the confidence to quit my corporate job. In 2013, I&#8217;d stumbled across the Mr. Money, Mustache website, and that was just amazing, but it&#8217;s one thing to read information kind of cold on the internet that doesn&#8217;t necessarily give you enough comfort to kind of change your life.<br/><br/>It&#8217;s kind of terrifying to quit a job that is going well, that you&#8217;re successful in, and that forms part of your identity. And to make that transition, I just needed to hear other people that had been there, done that, and walked that path and your podcast just brought that to life for me. So I honestly don&#8217;t think I would have got up the courage to quit my corporate job if it hadn&#8217;t been for your podcast. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s absolutely incredible to hear and I did not realize that. So congrats for being able to take the leap and it&#8217;s amazing that I played a little bit of a part in that.<br/><br/>So thanks for saying those kind words and thanks for joining me. And it&#8217;s 2:45 PM now. So I think that&#8217;s a late enough to warrant a celebratory pint for all our hard work today. So let&#8217;s let&#8217;s close this up. Thanks again, Barney. And I&#8217;ll hopefully speak to you again soon. <br/><br/><strong>Escape Artist:</strong> Thank you. No, we&#8217;re late to the pub now. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Onward to the pub.<br/><br/>All right. Thanks again.

<h2>Full Transcript</h2>
<div class="transcript">
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Hey, what&#8217;s up, everybody. Welcome to the Financial Independence Podcast, the podcast that gets inside the brains of some of the best and brightest in personal finance to find out how they achieved financial independence. You may remember last year, I had an episode with Morgan Housel, and Morgan&#8217;s one of my favorite financial writers, and it was a great episode.<br/><br/>And you may remember that I actually didn&#8217;t do the interview. It was my buddy Gouri who interviewed Morgan as part of a Bogleheads meeting. And Gouri&#8217;s big is big in the Bogleheads. And he actually invited me to join that same sort of discussion for the Bogleheads group that he was running. So that&#8217;s what today&#8217;s episode is.<br/><br/>And if you don&#8217;t know who the Bogleheads are, they&#8217;re a group that are dedicated to Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard. All the index fund investing and everything that talked about on the Mad Fientist, that&#8217;s a group that really goes in depth in that philosophy of investing. So they have a fantastic and very active forum.<br/><br/>They have these local meetups that, you know, Gouri is part of and it&#8217;s a really great organization all around. So if you&#8217;re interested, definitely head over to bogleheads.org to check it out. And obviously I&#8217;ll put links to that in the show notes. So I sat down with Gouri and a bunch of other Bogleheads on a zoom call and we had a great chat for a couple hours.<br/><br/>What you&#8217;re going to hear today is the interview portion of that. And the interview is fantastic because as always Gouri did a ton of research beforehand and asked great questions. So without further ado, this is my chat with Gouri for the Bogleheads. <br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> We&#8217;ll begin with something that you often end with on your podcasts, which is you ask your guests who, you know, are leaders in the FI space, or often the self-improvement space.<br/><br/>You ask them what&#8217;s one piece of financial advice you would give towards financial independence. So I asked you that question. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a question I love to ask because there&#8217;s so many different answers I&#8217;ve gotten over the years, but for me, I would say experiment, which, you know, in the Mad Fientist, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have said that when I started the Mad Fientist.<br/><br/>So it&#8217;s not me just saying that because it fits with my science theme or anything. But it&#8217;s really the truth because if I&#8217;ve learned anything over the past 10 years of doing this and like really thinking about it hard, it&#8217;s that we&#8217;re really bad at knowing what we really, really want. And the only way to find out is to try things, hopefully them at a low cost, low commitment sort of situation so that you don&#8217;t, you know, get yourself into a situation where you can&#8217;t reverse that choice. But it&#8217;s really about experimenting because especially like for me I&#8217;m naturally frugal guy. Spending has been a big focus of mine recently.<br/><br/>And you know, after post-FI to figure out like, what is the best use of money? And now that it&#8217;s not as tight anymore you know what, what&#8217;s actually going to make me happier and what&#8217;s not really going to move the needle and things like that. So, yeah, experimenting and just realizing that you don&#8217;t have to be right, right away, because you are probably pretty bad at actually figuring out what you really want to do or what you want to be here, what you want to spend your money on.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> Excellent. Yeah, it&#8217;s so great to hear. And there&#8217;s so much there that I&#8217;d like for us to follow up on. One is when, you know, you say experiment, try it out there. There are tons of people that we hear about who, whether they&#8217;re planning for financial independence, early retirement, or just retirement in general, they dream about this next phase of life.<br/><br/>They plan, they plan the savings part of it, but then when they get there, they&#8217;re kind of absent the social structure or interaction or meaning. How do you, how do you suggest people, you know, building on what you said about experimenting? How do you suggest people fill that void in advance? <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> So like, I&#8217;m sure a lot of people out there are probably similar to what I was, where I blamed my job for the reason I wasn&#8217;t living the life that I thought would make me happiest and wasn&#8217;t doing the things that I thought I really wanted to do with my life. Like it was such an easy scapegoat and only after leaving the job and then trying to do all those things that I thought I wanted to do, I realized it wasn&#8217;t my job holding me back. I was very lucky. I was a software developer and the technologies I used allowed me to be very productive, very quickly so I could get my work done in, you know, a quarter of the time that some other teams that I worked amongst were able to do it. So my time scales were never tight and I had plenty of free time. So it was only once that I removed that easy scapegoat did I realize that actually I could have been doing all of these things with the job and, you know, I would have been not had to also try to figure out all these crazy post-FI things that come up that you never even expect because I would have still been working.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I would say one just try to remove the easy scapegoat of your job and start trying to do these things that you really think you&#8217;re going to do post-FI, because one, some things aren&#8217;t big enough to really get you out of the bed in the morning. Like I remember I thought like, oh, I&#8217;ll learn a new language and then that way, when we traveled to wherever in the world, I&#8217;ll be able to know this new language&#8230;it&#8217;s going to be amazing, but you know, like when you don&#8217;t have anyone forcing you to get out of bed in the morning to conjugate verbs it&#8217;s hard, it&#8217;s hard to, to force yourself to do that. And you&#8217;re not exactly leaping out of bed to do that either.<br/><br/>So the more you can get started on these things while you&#8217;re still in the grind, the daily grind, I think. The way better off, you&#8217;re going to be, because one, you&#8217;re going to have momentum. You&#8217;re going to sorta like come across these challenges that have nothing to do with your job earlier and start to work through them and realize, hey, actually, it&#8217;s not my job that&#8217;s holding me back. It&#8217;s for me, like personally, it was my self doubts and some of the artistic things I wanted to do. And yeah, if you, if you just start early and don&#8217;t think of like, I think the other problem is like, it&#8217;s like for me back then, it was a finish line. Everything was going to be great after that finish line and everything wasn&#8217;t working prior to that finish line.<br/><br/>And I think that was definitely the wrong way to do it. I think the more you can view it as just a spectrum where every dollar you&#8217;re saving is adding to that power that you have to, you know, to take more time off or follow that passion project to another level and things like that, I think the better off you&#8217;ll be, and then the less crazy FIRE or post-FI life would be after, because it&#8217;s not going to be just like flipping a switch. It&#8217;s just going to be this gradual progression into, oh, actually now I have the power to have unlimited free time. And now I know how to deal with that and use it properly because I&#8217;ve practiced along the way as I&#8217;ve incrementally got more free time.<br/><br/>So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s how I would view it just as a spectrum, not as a goal line. <br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> Excellent. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. It reminds me of someone interviewed Michael Phelps and in, I think one of the Olympic runs, his goggles failed and water got in his eyes and he had to do the whole thing with eyes closed.<br/><br/>And they interviewed him after and said, how was he able to perform at such a high level? And he said he did that in his head. Over and over again. So it reminds me of how you&#8217;re saying prepare. So I&#8217;m following up on a few of the things you mentioned. So you mentioned passion project. I think your followers will know that you pursued FI to record and release your own music and you were able to do that.<br/><br/>So huge, congrats again there. And you know, I know. You&#8217;re modest. So I&#8217;ll let folks know that the release went really well and had success on the charts. Why don&#8217;t you tell us a bit more about that, how it was to pursue this lifelong goal and, you know, how&#8217;s it been since? <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. So you mentioned the charts and I&#8217;d love that to be because the music was so amazing and it just got played on radio everywhere.<br/><br/>Actually, it was just the Mad Fientist audience had grown so big over 10 years and I&#8217;d never asked them to do anything. And I asked them to buy the album and, and thousands of them did. And yeah, it was ridiculous. A ridiculous one week on the charts. And then it was done. But yeah, that wasn&#8217;t the main goal.<br/><br/>That was again, like I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve mentioned a bit earlier. I blame my job for holding me back on that for so long. But it was only once I quit my job and had all the time in the world to pursue it, that I realized it was way more than that. It was, it was really just a ton of self doubt. I never thought I could actually do it.<br/><br/>So I was not even trying to do it because I thought if I tried and then failed, I&#8217;d lose the dream forever. And I never wanted to do that. Cause I was like, I really need to write and release an album one day. So I didn&#8217;t want to lose the dream, but trying every time I tried it just made it so much more evident that I would never actually be able to do it.<br/><br/>So that&#8217;s why I just put off doing it. So I never made progress and it took me till three and a half years after I left my job before, you know, I&#8217;ve I finally got fed up and I was like, look, this is the whole reason I was wanting to have all this free time. And in the first years after leaving my job, I filled it with, you know, Mad Fientist stuff. I filled it with fun stuff. I was saying yes to everything. Cause I could have all this time. And I was like, I need to just really get serious about this. And it was brutal. But it was actually Atomic Habits by James Clear&#8230;I read his book, got to speak to him on my podcast, which was amazing. And it was that coupled with another book called Ultralearning.<br/><br/>And then there was a music specific one that was just an ebook, but it was actually phenomenal. So if any musicians out there care, Gouri, I&#8217;ll send you a link to that. Cause it&#8217;s not a very big book, but it was it was very instrumental in me actually making progress. At the end of the day, just boiled down to like putting in the time.<br/><br/>So sitting in the chair and being uncomfortable and just forcing yourself to do that and trying to not focus on what you produce by the end of that day, just focusing on okay&#8230;put five hours into the chair and it was all mostly productive. You know, like I would lose confidence, I would lose willpower and by the end of the day, I was like watching YouTube tutorials, which, you know, it was not really productive, but I could sort of make it seem productive for my five hours at least. So anyway, it took all of that and then the pandemic hit and, and then I just locked myself inside for 15 months. Scotland was very locked down.<br/><br/>My wife&#8217;s Scottish and we lived in Edinburgh, or we did at that time, and just locked myself inside and never truly believed that I would do it. And until it came out. I still don&#8217;t really believe it, but I listened to it and I&#8217;m like I&#8217;m really proud of it. It was definitely, yeah, the most challenging thing I&#8217;ve ever tried to do.<br/><br/>And it meant so much to me. So yeah, you&#8217;ll listen to it. It&#8217;s not like Grammy award-winning stuff. It&#8217;s like my weird it&#8217;s like synthesizer like experimental synth-pop stuff that I loved growing up. So it&#8217;s a really weird genre of music, but it&#8217;s yeah. My only goal line was that I was comfortable enough with it to release it.<br/><br/>And I did. So that it&#8217;s that was the whole reason I wanted to pursue FIRE in the first place. And like I said before, I didn&#8217;t actually need to be FI to do it, but I sorta did as well, because that took away all my excuses. <br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> Well, congrats again on achieving that it&#8217;s tremendous and I&#8217;m not a typically a synth pop listener, but absolutely enjoyed your music.<br/><br/>So thanks again for getting it out there. So a few things, one is a lot of folks in the FI space. You know, will talk about, of course, saving and investing and reducing your living expenses and increasing your savings rate. And I think folks, you know, interest in pursuing it, having a lot of access to that information more common underlying message that surfaces is a lot of this is about happiness, right?<br/><br/>So. Can you, can you elaborate on what happiness is, you know, like for you or what success means to you and for this audience, the Bogleheads famously are not defined by a fancy house or fancy car, even though many of them could easily afford that sometimes many times over. So yeah. What does, what does success mean to you and, and how, how has it been in early retirement?<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah, well, so success is to me, those personal wins, like I can think back over the last 10 years and the things I&#8217;m most proud of or things that, you know, I haven&#8217;t shouted about or told anybody about really. And it&#8217;s just those, like knowing how hard I worked on that album and all of the hurdles that I had to overcome.<br/><br/>Like, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m super proud of and yeah. Getting on the billboard charts for a week, is funny, and just adds to the ridiculousness of my life in a great way. Like, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s so funny to think about every time I think about it, but that, that was, that&#8217;s nothing that it&#8217;s thinking back at all those things that I had to overcome.<br/><br/>And yeah, happiness is a tricky one because I had a great comment on my last post and. It was sort of talking about happiness and like finding new sources of motivation after FI. Because for people like me, if you think about money since I was a, you know, a kid&#8230;my parents were throwing quarters in the deep end of the pool and I would spend all day like finding money and I just loved it.<br/><br/>So for somebody is where money has been so important for so long&#8230;for now that to not matter anymore. Cause I don&#8217;t want the fancy house or the fancy cars or I don&#8217;t want to waste money in any way and things like that. So that&#8217;s been, that&#8217;s been really interesting to try to come to grips with that and find new sources of motivation because now I don&#8217;t have to do anything.<br/><br/>And as I said, in my most recent posts, it&#8217;s like a lot of the really fun things have a lot of discomfort upfront. But now that I don&#8217;t have&#8230;I don&#8217;t have money driving me through that initial discomfort, I worry that I&#8217;m missing out on some, like longer-term fun in some areas just because, you know, I&#8217;m like, well, I don&#8217;t want to do that. I don&#8217;t have to do that because I don&#8217;t need to earn another dollar or whatever. So, so yeah, happiness is a tricky one. And in that, so this goes back to the comment I was going to mention. So it was, I thought was really insightful. The guy had said, I think as humans, we always need something to be uncomfortable with or unhappy about or striving for something better. And he brought up the fact that like, you know, there&#8217;s a lot of, maybe I&#8217;m not too big in the the rest of the FI community anymore, just cause I&#8217;ve been working on the music stuff, but apparently in the FI community, there&#8217;s lots of divorces happening and things and people reach FI and then, you know, they need that unhappiness. So they find it in their partner or things like that. And I can see how that I could see how that happens. Cause you, you know, I could, I could throw everything at my job and be like, that&#8217;s why my boss is making me mad and my colleagues are making me mad and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m unhappy.<br/><br/>But then when you, when you can control everything and do whatever you want. Then you either have to come to accept that. Oh, it&#8217;s just you, that&#8217;s finding those things to be unhappy about or angry about or. You know, sometimes the, sadly maybe put it on the person closest to you or the people around you.<br/><br/>So, yeah. So it&#8217;s still one that I haven&#8217;t figured out yet. And I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s not to say, like, I feel so lucky and I&#8217;m definitely happier now having been able to pursue all these things that I&#8217;ve always wanted to, and, you know, not have the stresses of money or worrying about, you know, if the markets are tanking or anything like that.<br/><br/>But yeah, it&#8217;s not a golden ticket to a happiness and rainbows, which I think early me when I was pursuing it, I put that on, on FIRE. I was like, well, yeah, I&#8217;ll be happy when I&#8217;m FI. So I&#8217;ll just be miserable now and just grind it out. And again, going back to the advice that I was given earlier is like, yeah, don&#8217;t put off happiness until the finish line either.<br/><br/>Don&#8217;t put off, you know, pursuing your things that you want to do. Don&#8217;t put off, you think you&#8217;re thinking about what post-FI, life&#8217;s going to look like, because yeah when you cross the finish line, that&#8217;s just at the end of the day a slightly higher number on a screen. And it really maybe it was more anticlimactic than you may expect it to be.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> Got it. Yeah. Very insightful stuff. So two, two particular things. So let&#8217;s say a two-part question one building on your comments. One is this concept of enough, right? You and I know people in the FI space in life in general, who had earned a lot, can still learn a lot and really. Adjusted this mindset to just say, you know, any additional money has very little marginal value.<br/><br/>Why, am I needing to work or seeking work? But there are also people who either enjoy what they do, maybe they&#8217;re entrepreneurs, or some people are paid really well dislike the rat race. But enjoy accumulating, enjoy watching their portfolios grow and you know, within the FI community, there&#8217;s this one more year syndrome, right?<br/><br/>People don&#8217;t feel comfortable. Can you elaborate on how you achieve this? I&#8217;ll call it a zen-like state of you have enough. Right. We know someone who, who says any additional money he gets, he gives to charity. And I just feel like. That&#8217;s such an enlightened state, right? Like we&#8217;re socialized, like apart from societal&#8217;s influence on the importance of money, there&#8217;s a practical importance.<br/><br/>So that&#8217;s one. And then the second you spoke about relationships and specifically in the FI community, can you elaborate on yours to the extent you&#8217;re comfortable, what it&#8217;s like being, because you mentioned publicly, Jill still works. She loves what she does. You guys converged in this journey and what has that been like to be&#8230;and I&#8217;ll talk about like gender roles or societal pressures or influences to be the spouse who&#8217;s not working and to be a guy, you know, not working and in our society. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Oh yeah. Ireally don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;ve reached a Zen like state sadly, but I&#8217;m working towards it.<br/><br/>Like I think the big thing for me was never feeling I needed to impress anyone with money. And I think that just gives you such a huge advantage where like I would rather people think I was poorer than I am, because I just had a, you know, a middle-class upbringing, like like times are always tight. And I, my identity is so tied to that.<br/><br/>So to then either go into the next societal bracket you know, upper class or something would just be a total identity&#8230;I don&#8217;t think my brain could handle it. So I&#8217;m always, so I&#8217;m lucky in that sense where I&#8217;ve never felt the need to impress people with, with flashy, anything. I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m Zen yet because because you mentioned charity, like I still can&#8217;t give money away.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m not wasting it and that&#8217;s why I have such trouble spending it because I don&#8217;t want to waste it. And I know one day, I&#8217;m going to be at that stage where I can make better use of it. So in this meantime where I still have this psychological hangup. Yeah. I just I&#8217;m protecting it so that I don&#8217;t waste it away and have some sort of lifestyle inflation that caused me to not to be able to give it away.<br/><br/>But there&#8217;s still a part of me that I guess just has this scarcity mindset like, oh, like I gotta keep it all just in case something really bad happens or. I don&#8217;t know where that comes from. Like I said, maybe it was because times were so tight growing up and I never felt like we were deprived of anything, but, you know, there was, you know, every penny was accounted for and I still feel that in my mindset hasn&#8217;t caught up with the actual situation yet.<br/><br/>So, yeah. So a long way to go in the zen part. To get to the spouse part. Yes. My wife was complete opposite end of the spectrum from me. She wasn&#8217;t, she never spent money to like impress other people. So I don&#8217;t think it was like that far, but she never, she just didn&#8217;t care about money. If it was in her account, she would spend it. And if it wasn&#8217;t you, she wouldn&#8217;t. Whereas I was like, you know, spreadsheets for everything and go into, you know, knowing what I bought at this store versus the store and all that stuff. So yeah, thankfully we&#8217;ve come together and she&#8217;s a lot more conscious of spending money and I&#8217;m not as crazy about it, which has worked out great.<br/><br/>And as you said, she&#8217;s, she loves her job. She&#8217;s an optometrist. She can&#8217;t think of anything else you&#8217;d want to do, but she&#8217;s also. Seeing the benefits of having savings. So to go to COVID at the beginning of the pandemic in Scotland. People weren&#8217;t taking it as seriously as we felt needed to be, you know, things needed to be taken care of.<br/><br/>So she was able to just say, look, I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m just not coming in. And then she, she was off for the first three or four months of the pandemic because she was worried about giving us her elderly patients. And she didn&#8217;t think the PPE was all in the right state. And then once that came back, she was able to go back.<br/><br/>And then for the past, like six months, we&#8217;ve been traveling to the States since we were finally able to, and we&#8217;ve been able to see friends and family. So she&#8217;s obviously not worked that time. So she&#8217;s seen the benefits of that. And obviously I&#8217;ve seen the benefits of not being so crazy with money.<br/><br/>So, thankfully we have met in the middle and I think we both made each other better with our relationships with money. But as far as her working in me, not, like this is going to sound crazy. Cause you know, I&#8217;ve been writing about financial independence on the internet since 2012, but I really don&#8217;t like talking about to people I know in real life. So I still will just say I&#8217;m a software developer that works from home, which is technically true because I write software for the Mad Fientist website. But yeah, I feel really weird talking about that in person. So yeah, I&#8217;m at home, but I was at home before, before we provided me the hit FI and again, I don&#8217;t think, I don&#8217;t think it bothers me that even if, even if that wasn&#8217;t the case and that was, if all of our friends that I was just unemployed and she was working yeah, I don&#8217;t know how I would feel about that. I don&#8217;t think I, I would hope I wouldn&#8217;t care that much. Because again, like the things that drive me are the personal things that I accomplished that, you know, I still don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t tell anybody anybody about anyway. So I think I had hoped that I would be okay with that. But, you know, like I said, it&#8217;s harder to, reality&#8217;s often way different than you imagined it would be. So, yeah, but so far I haven&#8217;t had any issue because again, I just mostly tell people I&#8217;m a I work from home for myself as a software developer.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> Excellent. Great to hear within the, you know, the actual FI experience, if you could talk more about the highs and lows of it. So what surprised you were you blindsided by anything? Were there some disappointing surprises and then some like phenomenal surprises you didn&#8217;t even consider? <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. One is losing money as a source of motivation.<br/><br/>That wasn&#8217;t what I expected. I always thought. Yeah. I always, always thought, wow, just, yeah, just do fun stuff with it. But as part of that experimentation, I told you about earlier, like we experimented one year and we traveled the whole year and we ate out like four or five nights a week. And we tried all that stuff and realized like, it&#8217;s actually way more fun when it&#8217;s special and you get to look forward to it over a few months and you plan for it.<br/><br/>And same with eating out. It&#8217;s like, well, if it&#8217;s a Friday night thing, then you&#8217;re looking forward to Friday nights. So we&#8217;ve tried a lot of that stuff. So, so I thought, you know, so I guess pre-FI, would&#8217;ve thought that, you know, Ooh, if we had extra money, this is going to be great. We could go do even more fun stuff.<br/><br/>But through experimentation, I feel like we&#8217;ve got the, got the sweet spot and more&#8217;s not necessarily better in a lot of cases. It&#8217;s worse. So, so that was a big surprise. And that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s still something that I&#8217;m trying to come to grips with. And I don&#8217;t only, I haven&#8217;t even talked to you about this story, but like I realized now that my cheapness was the only thing, keeping my eating and check when we&#8217;re traveling.<br/><br/>So like when we go somewhere, like sightseeing is just the stuff I do in between eating and drinking and tasting all the foods and trying all the different stuff. And on these, on these past trips ever since we&#8217;ve been able to travel since COVID. I&#8217;ve just gone crazy. And I realized that the only thing that was keeping that in check was my frugality and my cheapness.<br/><br/>And now that that&#8217;s not there, it&#8217;s like, well, I need it. I need some self control, I guess, when it comes to food. So yeah, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s things like that you don&#8217;t really think about. So that was a surprise. I think the, just the peace of mind has been fantastic. Like I still, like I said, I, I still feel like a teenager.<br/><br/>So like the thought of like my car breaking down. Still gives me some stress and anxiety, but you know, having enough and then having more than enough as sort of eased that and been like, okay, we can handle, you know, the car breaking or an unexpected repair and things like that, that I think has really drastically improved my just like baseline, at ease-ness, I guess.<br/><br/>So that&#8217;s been fantastic. Those are the big ones. And then, yeah, just realizing that all your excuses before. All the blame I was placing on my job was just totally misplaced and it was more, it was all the internal stuff and stuff that I still had to deal with. Yeah, just the self-doubts and the motivation and the procrastination, all that stuff.<br/><br/>Yeah, it wasn&#8217;t my job. So those are the big ones. <br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> Got it. So thanks for sharing, especially, you know, some of these vulnerable topics, like. You know what you&#8217;re opening up about a lot of it&#8217;s personal. So some of the things I think it&#8217;s funny, you know, to hear your comments about Ramit for a lot of folks in the space you know, there are diehard mustachians folks who read Mr. Money Mustache, and whose blog changed their lives. And then Ramit, you know, I would joke to myself, I really value his content as well. But in my head, I think of him as somewhat of an anti Mustacian. So I understand that, you know, you felt liberated to some extent I&#8217;d love to hear more about what you&#8217;ve grown to enjoy spending on.<br/><br/>You mentioned food, and then I&#8217;d also love to hear about the evolution of travel. Like it sounds like. You know, we all want to travel. It&#8217;s a very common primary goal. And then some people travel a lot. So when it sounds like your, your ambition for travel has kind of perhaps changed. So I&#8217;d love to hear more about that.<br/><br/>And then on the topic of travel and living abroad, how did, how has being financially independent living abroad? How did, how do you feel that would differ from living in the States? Like a lot of people in the FI space consider moving abroad and they try to optimize, you know, where they&#8217;re going to live either travel around or settle.<br/><br/>So your thoughts on those? <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah, sure. Yeah. I&#8217;ll address the anti-Mustacian Ramit, which I, I thought too. And that&#8217;s why I was so excited to get them on my show because I was like, yeah. You are, you are opposite ends of the spectrum. I think they say a lot of the same things and just different ways, but I think having both in your ears is great and that&#8217;s I was lucky to talk to both of them and that&#8217;s, and again, I I&#8217;m going to be going back to Ramit because I feel like I&#8217;m naturally like Mr. Money Mustache. Like that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s my natural inclination, I guess. So having Ramit there challenging all that stuff&#8230;listening to MMM is like an echo chamber. But Ramit, challenges me in as far as some of the stuff that has helped me not be so crazy with the spending, it was reframing things.<br/><br/>So one of the things that&#8217;s helped is like, $10 to me is just as valuable as it was when I was a college student. In my mind, it&#8217;s the same. It&#8217;s like that&#8217;s 10 bucks. I&#8217;m not going to waste 10 bucks or I&#8217;m going to save 10 bucks if I can. So the trick that I&#8217;ve been doing recently is anytime I&#8217;m like freaking out about an expense that I think I really shouldn&#8217;t be freaking out about.<br/><br/>I calculate what that expense is like in my college years. Cause that&#8217;s what, that&#8217;s where my brain, I feels like still is with money. So, you know, taking my net worth back in 2000 and dividing it by my net worth now. And then multiplying it by the expense that I&#8217;m worried about. And then it&#8217;ll be like, oh, that&#8217;s a nickel.<br/><br/>You&#8217;re actually stressing out about a nickel in, you know, college times. So that&#8217;s been helpful.<br/><br/>And then forcing myself to spend with the portfolio is it should allow me to spend, has been really nice because it&#8217;s. It&#8217;s made me a lot more generous, which is something I&#8217;ve always wanted to be.<br/><br/>But I always was, like I said before, I&#8217;m always like, oh, every penny&#8230;I need to squeeze it tight in case anything happens. Whereas now, this year, it&#8217;s like, you know, going out to dinner with my family, it&#8217;s like, hurry up and try to pay before anybody else even has a chance and same with drinks with friends and things like that.<br/><br/>So that&#8217;s been really nice because well, I got to spend it this year. I&#8217;m forcing myself to spend that much and there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to do that naturally, because like I said, I feel like we&#8217;ve dialed in our spending quite well. So anything more is just going to be, you know maybe not as, maybe not as useful or not bring as much happiness.<br/><br/>So it&#8217;s like, so then yeah, doing those things day to day has been really nice. Just. Before I would have maybe stressed about that. Like you got to dinner with friends and like somebody orders the fancy cocktail and your drink of water. And then you&#8217;re like, oh, and that&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s the mindset. I wasn&#8217;t when I was a student, I want to get out of that.<br/><br/>And now the times have changed forcing myself to spend that this year. And again, it&#8217;s not, I&#8217;m not wasting any money. Cause like I said, I don&#8217;t want to waste money. I want to protect it in case one day I definitely will be giving it away. And the third thing that&#8217;s helped with that is also.<br/><br/>Allowing myself to enjoy investments. So rather than just dump all my money into Vanguard index funds, which is what I&#8217;ve done for the last 20 years instead, it&#8217;s, I&#8217;m thinking about buying a house, for example. So to me that&#8217;s an ultimate luxury. It&#8217;s not really a great investment, but I think it&#8217;s a luxury that I&#8217;m really looking forward to right now.<br/><br/>And my wife is as well. So, in my mind, as I think about it as an investment, rather than me spending on myself, which that makes it a lot easier to, to, you know, accept. And so I think that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re going to do over the next few months is buy a house in Scotland and hopefully, you know, make it really comfortable and nice and all of that.<br/><br/>And then, and then for the music stuff, it&#8217;s like, instead of buying the cheapest synthesizer, that&#8217;ll let me make the sound. I buy the one that&#8217;s going to hold its value the best. And it&#8217;s going to maybe be a future classic that is going to maybe even go up in value. So that&#8217;s helping me spend a bit more in the near term, but then hopefully getting a lot of enjoyment out of it.<br/><br/>And then, you know, maybe even, you know, making it an investment where if, if not making money, at least not losing money and that&#8217;s been, that&#8217;s been helpful. And, and, you know, mentally being able to spend on myself a little bit more. And I&#8217;m sorry, but I forgot the second question?<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> question. Living abroad versus being FI in the States.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. Well, luckily, so that was one thing I never skimped on when we were in our twenties and I&#8217;m thankful for that. We did travel. I was really good at travel hacking and that&#8217;s like, I love doing stuff like that. That&#8217;s like having spreadsheets and plans and that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s like how my brain loves to be all the time.<br/><br/>So travel hacking was just right in my wheelhouse. So we got to, we visited, I think, 50 countries over our lifetime so far, and we had great, great trips and it didn&#8217;t break the bank. But obviously, yeah, especially since now, COVID has made travel a bit less fun where I&#8217;m so glad I didn&#8217;t skimp on that when we were younger.<br/><br/>But now I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m older, I&#8217;m turning 40 this year. I don&#8217;t know&#8230;.I feel like I&#8217;ve done my fair share. Like I&#8217;ve got that out of my system. I feel like it&#8217;s out of my system and now we just flip flop back between Scotland and America. Cause my wife&#8217;s family is in Scotland and my family&#8217;s in America and luckily those are two great, beautiful rich places that have so much to offer that you can, you know, continue to explore for a lifetime and not get bored with them. So we&#8217;re always so excited to do that, but now I think our travels more based around people. So it&#8217;s not all right, which, which country could we go to to see these things or eat these foods or whatever it&#8217;s now like, where to go to see these people and have fun with them. So that&#8217;s been a huge shift. So I think travel is going to decrease for us in the future as well. It&#8217;s just going to be mainly just bouncing between those two places.<br/><br/>As far as like how that impacts FI, I know travel in my twenties was very impactful and showing me that, you know, what I thought was normal in America was actually extremely extravagant and there&#8217;s a lot of really unfortunate situations out there where people are really struggling to get by. And that allowed me to keep my spending in check, I think, and never, you know, feel like I deserved nicer things or anything like that. So that was huge in just giving me the mindset to save so much money over those years.<br/><br/>You know now I just became a British citizen on July 1st, which was really exciting after so long, so many applications trying to get it. So now we don&#8217;t have to worry about visas and stuff, but obviously the healthcare thing, that&#8217;s a huge weight off my chest now&#8230;the National Health Service is fantastic in Scotland.<br/><br/>So there are benefits in places, you know, it&#8217;s probably more difficult to pursue FI there just because of the higher taxes and things like that and there&#8217;s less loopholes, which is what my whole site was built on back in the earlier days&#8230;just finding interesting loopholes for early retirees or future early retirees.<br/><br/>So there&#8217;s a lot less of that, but then there&#8217;s a bigger social safety net. So, you know, you have a lot more stuff covered as well. So. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know if that exactly answers your question, but hopefully it&#8217;s helpful.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> Yeah, that was very helpful. Thanks. So a few things in what you said, one is that you&#8217;re considering buying a house.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m certain that the Boglehead audience would like to hear more about, especially given how analytical you are and how, you know, you commented, it&#8217;s not necessarily a good investment or it&#8217;s often not a good investment, but also if you could talk about, on top of that, share your thoughts previously, you mentioned you were considering buying real estate as a part-time investment. So you mentioned, you know like a unit near a ski resort that you could, you could use personally when you in ski season and then you could rent it out when you&#8217;re not using it, and then COVID happened. So obviously that changed, but how are your, your thoughts going forward on that?<br/><br/>Does it still interest you? And then can you elaborate on your purchase analysis and how you decide where are you currently leaning? <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Sure. So that plan is pretty much out the window. And again, that&#8217;s always me coming back to my default, which is like, how could I optimize this for the numbers as perfectly as possible?<br/><br/>And that, that whole plan of having two places, one in Scotland, one in America, and the thought was that we buy in places that the peak tourist season was pretty much opposite. So we could live in the non-high-peak tourist place while we rent out the peak tourist place and then use that money to pay for the other one and then vice versa.<br/><br/>And it was all a numbers thing and that&#8217;s, again, it&#8217;s just old habits die hard. I&#8217;m trying to get out of making numbers-only decisions, which is where Ramit comes in, where he&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s more than a spreadsheets and you have to live outside the spreadsheet. <br/><br/>And you know, sometimes decisions should be more than just optimizing numbers. So I realized like all the stress that could come from renting things out and at least I know myself well enough to know that that would just cause a huge amount of stress. Cause yeah, I&#8217;m an introverted guy and I do enjoy interacting with people, but conflict with people that I just know that if I&#8217;m a landlord, I&#8217;m not going to be too happy. And I&#8217;ll probably be a lot more stressed, so it would just add a lot of negative things and yeah, the numbers may be great, but I don&#8217;t think would actually benefit. So now the idea is to just buy a base in Scotland finally get to enjoy some of our stuff that has been&#8230;we just literally today, Jill and I were in the closet at my dad&#8217;s house going through the closet because there&#8217;s boxes in there that we haven&#8217;t seen since we moved out of Vermont, like six years ago or something. So yeah. Being reunited with all that stuff is going to be nice.<br/><br/>And then we can just store it all in Scotland. And then when we come to the State, if we want to go skiing, we can just rent an Airbnb. Or if we want to come to Pittsburgh and see all of my family here, we can just rent a apartment in the city.  I think it&#8217;ll allow us to be a lot more flexible in the States.<br/><br/>And then in Scotland, we&#8217;ll have a home base to go back to. The idea is, Scotland will be the place where we can get stuff done and see Jill&#8217;s family and just really spend time with them and Jill can work if she wants to pick up some shifts and things like that.<br/><br/>And then the States, we can just use that time to see people here and have fun and do things like skiing and visiting friends. So yeah, it&#8217;s changed quite a lot. <br/><br/>And then as far as the the analysis for buying a place in Scotland, not really looking at it numbers based, trying not to at least.  <br/><br/>We know where we want to be.  We know that the type of property we want.  Thankfully it hasn&#8217;t popped up yet because we&#8217;re in the States and we&#8217;re not going to be back in Scotland till mid-October. So hopefully we can deal with that when we get back. But yeah, I think it&#8217;s hopefully just going to be the property that decides it and not any crazy number analysis from me.<br/><br/>I have some money set aside for that. And yeah, hopefully we just find a property that, that works and then try to be homeowners again after renting for so long <br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> That sounds fantastic. It&#8217;s another example of optimizing for happiness. You&#8217;ve commented that you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re not in this FI space to be evangelical.<br/><br/>You started the blog to kind of keep yourself accountable, right, with an external motivator and. It helps people who are ready, interested in the journey. So this question is really like for a lot of Bogleheads, they&#8217;re the beacon in their community, whether it&#8217;s a social circle or family, people come to them for guidance and advice.<br/><br/>What have you seen in the space? Because there&#8217;s so much advice out there, right? And certain things resonate with some people more than others. Obviously. What have you seen be most effective for the folks that want to improve. They want to save better. They want to invest better, but they find it so incredibly challenged.<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. That&#8217;s yeah, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s tough. It&#8217;s a tough one for me just because it has come so naturally, like I said before, it&#8217;s just been such a focus in my life for some reason, for so long, I guess it would have to just go back to tracking. And really, so this is a, this is probably a good actual example.<br/><br/>So I have a, I have another personal spreadsheet where just one column will have like all the things, all the big purchases I made that year. And then another column will have&#8230;all the spreadsheet purists are going to be like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need a spreadsheet for that!&#8221;, but I just love working with cells.<br/><br/>So then I have another column that&#8217;s the highlights of the year. And I think like, obviously if I was struggling with that, I think that would be really beneficial to keep those lists, you know, your big purchases and then your highlights and then revisit it in future years and, you know, tracking your spending is obviously huge.<br/><br/>And I think like, yeah, tracking your spending and then tracking these big purchases, I think would be the first step, because I feel like a lot of people maybe are just buying what other people think, or they see other people doing that and they&#8217;re buying and it&#8217;s certainly not adding to their happiness in any way.<br/><br/>So I think writing those things down and then looking back on it and be like, oh, actually those things weren&#8217;t really that important or that trip wasn&#8217;t that great or eating out wasn&#8217;t that great. So, yeah, but again like I said, I&#8217;m so naturally focused on this stuff that it&#8217;s a bit harder for me to think about what would be really beneficial.<br/><br/>But I think even now, as I&#8217;m trying to come to grips with my new spending patterns, it&#8217;s been helpful for me. And it&#8217;s something that I still do. So it&#8217;s just a recording, all the, all the big purchases, all the highlights, and then trying to figure out, Hmm. What does that mean for what I actually enjoy or get value?<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s definitely helpful to hear. And for folks who, who don&#8217;t know the Mad Fientist compiled a PDF of the one piece of advice, answers that he got from his podcast guests. So that&#8217;s available at madfientist.com/advice. I believe you go to that, enter your email and you&#8217;ll get that.<br/><br/>So in closing, before we turn it over to audience questions, you mentioned James Clear&#8217;s Atomic Habits. I think that&#8217;s a universal favorite. Everyone. I know that&#8217;s read it just kind of swears by it on top of the other habit books out there that proceeded.  It very practical. And you mentioned Ultralearning, any other books you recommend or documentaries? Especially for the Boglehead crowd. Doesn&#8217;t need to be finance-related could be, you know, spanning life?<br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. So JL Collins, the author of The Simple Path to Wealth, was my second podcast guests, way back in 2012, way before The Simple Path to Wealth and he had recommended How to Obtain Freedom in an Unfree World by Harry Browne.<br/><br/>And there&#8217;s a lot in that book that I definitely don&#8217;t agree with&#8230;my wife particularly had big issues with some of it. But it did make you think a little bit differently about the boxes you put yourself in and the constraints that are all self-imposed pretty much.  <br/><br/>And back then 2012, you know, FIRE wasn&#8217;t as big of a thing and definitely wasn&#8217;t anywhere near mainstream, like it got to be in 2018. So that helped just with my mindset at like, oh, actually society doesn&#8217;t know best. And these other people don&#8217;t know best. And the things that I think I&#8217;m restricted by are actually your restrictions.  They&#8217;re just my own mental restrictions and I can actually do anything that I really want. So I would say that was a pretty impactful non-financial book. <br/><br/>Early Retirement Extreme. That was what got me into this in the first place. I saw in 2011, I think it was, that JD Roth at Get Rich Slowly had interviewed or had written a book review of Early Retirement Extreme and that, that reads like a academic book, but there&#8217;s a lot of great stuff in there.  I&#8217;ve read it at least three times and finally got to speak to Jacob just last year, which was it was a big thrill for me cause he was the guy that made the light bulb go off in my head.<br/><br/>So yeah, Early Retirement Extreme is still one of my favorites. <br/><br/>So those two, I would read them with an open mind and yeah, they&#8217;re not Bibles, they hopefully get you thinking. <br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> Fantastic. Well, thanks again. I meant to mention earlier when we were talking about relationships that your wife, Jill has a guest post on your blog and also a podcast a conversation that if folks haven&#8217;t listened to, I highly recommend those&#8230;very engaging, very, just warm and enjoyable. So with that Brandon, thanks again.  <br/><br/><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Thanks a lot, Gouri. It&#8217;s always a pleasure to chat with you and hopefully we&#8217;ll see you back in Edinburgh soon.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> I&#8217;d love that. And likewise.<br/><br/>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A Mad Fientist reader named Brian reached out to me and said that he increased his savings rate by utilizing some of the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/category/tax-avoidance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tax-avoidance strategies</a> I write about here.</p>
<p>Not only did these strategies help him to save more, they also allowed him to take advantage of other tax benefits that he hadn&#8217;t previously been eligible for (which then reduced his costs even more)!</p>
<p>He asked if I&#8217;d be interested in a case study (with his actual numbers) and I said yes!</p>
<p>Take it away, Brian&#8230;</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>If you’re frugal and willing to learn a little bit about the nuances in the tax code, you can save a massive percentage of your earnings every year.</p>
<p>This can be done by stacking the benefits of tax-advantaged savings. </p>
<p>By maximizing tax-deferred accounts first, a moderate income earner drives down their adjusted gross income (AGI). This in turn, may drastically reduce or even eliminate some of their largest yearly expenses.</p>
<h2>How to Reduce Your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)</h2>
<p>Reduce your AGI by contributing to the following accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional 401k</li>
<li><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/traditional-ira-vs-roth-ira/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Traditional IRA</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Health Savings Account (HSA)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits of a Lower AGI</h2>
<p>Lowering your AGI opens the possibility for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Becoming eligible for premium tax credits for health insurance</li>
<li>Reducing or eliminating student loan payments</li>
<li>Claiming additional tax credits (retirement savings credit, etc.)</li>
<li>Receiving stimulus payments or other one-time benefits</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Numbers</h2>
<p>Here is the strategy I’ve implemented for the past few years&#8230; </p>
<p>My total income was $58,070 for tax year 2020. </p>
<p>After contributing the maximum of $19,500 to my Traditional 401K and $6,000 to my Traditional IRA, my AGI was lowered to $32,570.</p>
<p>Now, here’s the interesting part. I purchased my health insurance through the ACA marketplace*. I’m fortunate to have good health, so I always select a high deductible health plan (HDHP) that is HSA compatible. I then maximized the HSA contribution ($3,550 for tax year 2020). This resulted in a health plan with a monthly premium of about $54 after the ACA Tax Credit (thanks to my lower AGI). </p>
<p>I’ve done this for the past few years and it’s been a great way to obtain low-cost health insurance while building up what the Mad Fientist calls the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ultimate Retirement Account</a>. </p>
<p>Another bonus to accessing an HSA is that you can use it to lower your AGI even further. My already significantly-lowered AGI of $32,500 then became $29,020, which allowed me to claim the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit** for $200 (which in turn lowered my final tax liability).</p>
<p>The end result was a federal tax bill of about $1,607. Not bad! </p>
<p>Additionally, I live in a state where most of my income would fall in the 9% tax rate, so reducing state tax liability is another perk to consider when reducing your AGI. That being said, I’ve excluded state taxes for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p>Here is an annual breakdown of my numbers compared to a lower savings rate of 5%:</p>
<table style="margin:25px;">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><strong>Low Saver</strong></th>
<th><strong>High Saver</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Income</td>
<td>$58,070</td>
<td>$58,070</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>401k Contribution</td>
<td>$2,904</td>
<td>$19,500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traditional IRA</td>
<td>$0</td>
<td>$6,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HSA</td>
<td>$0</td>
<td>$3,550</td>
</tr>
<tr style="font-weight:bold">
<td>AGI</td>
<td>$55,166</td>
<td>$29,020</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>And here are my annual costs:</p>
<table style="margin:25px;">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><strong>Low Saver</strong></th>
<th><strong>High Saver</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Health Plan</td>
<td>$5,408</td>
<td>$648</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FICA Taxes</td>
<td>$4,365</td>
<td>$4,365</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Federal Taxes</td>
<td>$4,944</td>
<td>$1,607</td>
</tr>
<tr style="font-weight:bold">
<td>Cost Savings</td>
<td></td>
<td>$8,097</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>New Tax Changes &#8211; ARPA</h2>
<p>Due to the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA passed in March 2021), participants in the ACA marketplace receive additional subsidies on the same level of income for 2021 and 2022. </p>
<p>Also, higher income earners may now qualify for a subsidy. This opens the door to qualify for low- or no-cost health insurance even with a slighter higher AGI. I’m currently exploring the option of keeping my monthly premium the same, while <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/#roth-conversion-ladder" rel="noopener" target="_blank">converting some of my traditional IRA to a Roth IRA</a>, which would not have been possible prior to the ARPA.</p>
<h2>AGI and Student Loan Payments</h2>
<p>For those with federal student loans, reducing your AGI can also significantly reduce or eliminate student loan payments, depending on your repayment plan. </p>
<p>I was fortunate to graduate with a very modest amount of debt, so I was able to pay the balance off in a couple of years. However, I’ve known others with large debts relative to their income that used this strategy to bring their monthly student loan payments down to $0 while building up healthy retirement accounts. Some have even combined this with Public Service Loan Forgiveness to wipe out their loans completely after 10 years!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, it is possible to save a massive amount for retirement while minimizing or eliminating other expenses.  I encourage your readers to explore how they can stack the benefits available to them in order to save more for retirement while living a great life during their working years. </p>
<p>I look forward to any responses in the comments on other tax savvy ways to save.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p><em>* My employer only offers a low deductible health insurance plan, which normally would exclude me from taking part in the ACA marketplace. However, the premiums are higher than the minimum value standard which allows me to opt into an ACA plan.</p>

<h2>Full Transcript</h2>

<div class="transcript">
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Hey what&#8217;s up everybody, it&#8217;s the Mad Fientist. Welcome to the Financial Independence Podcast.  
<br/><br/>
Sorry it&#8217;s been a while since my last episode but after being trapped in Scotland for 15 months because of the pandemic, I was finally able to make it back to the States and I just decided to take a few months off so I could focus on spending a lot of quality time with the family that I had been missing over the past year.  
<br/><br/>
So since it&#8217;s been a while, I just have a short episode today to get back into the swing of things.  
<br/><br/>
If you&#8217;ve listened to the show before you know that every year on my anniversary of leaving work I&#8217;ve posted either a podcast or an article about some of the things that I&#8217;ve learned over the past year and this is actually my fifth one so that means five years ago, on August 1st, was the last day I went into a normal job and I really can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been five years but it has so this is my five year update and I actually think it&#8217;s gonna be my last and I&#8217;ll explain more as this episode continues on but yeah, I really don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m gonna do any more of these annual updates so rather than ramble on let&#8217;s just dive into everything that I learned over the past year of post-FI life!
<br/><br/>
So let&#8217;s start with the good stuff&#8230;so the pandemic has just highlighted how valuable having savings is and yeah, FI savings is obviously great because you don&#8217;t have to work at all but even some amount of savings just to give you the power to do other things is so important.
<br/><br/>
So many times over the last year, it&#8217;s been apparent that just how valuable that is&#8230;from Jill not having to work when she felt like it was unsafe to do so, to not really having to go inside anywhere for any reason at all and being able to just isolate properly when necessary, to just coming back from our travels to the States and having to quarantine for 10 days in the UK&#8230;that would have been extremely stressful if we were juggling full-time jobs or had some places we needed to be but we were able to just roll with it and be like, okay we just have to stay hunkered down for 10 days and it&#8217;s not fun but it&#8217;s not a huge deal.  So this past year, more than any other, just really highlighted how valuable that is and I actually just came across a quote that perfectly sums it up and it was on the Planing our Pennies&#8217; blog, and it was Mrs. PoP&#8217;s last article, and in it she said, &#8220;There&#8217;s no downside to having a high net worth&#8230;it acts like a giant shock absorber that smooths over life&#8217;s bumps and after a while it feels like life is a game and you&#8217;ve discovered the mother of all cheat codes.&#8221; That quote to me is just perfect because the giant shock absorber that smooths over life&#8217;s bumps, I think is the perfect way to describe that feeling of having a nice chunk of savings in the bank over the last year.  As you know, the world has been so uncertain and everything&#8217;s a bit weird and scary and just having that financial peace of mind to know that you can roll with the punches and you can get over some of these hurdles that are unexpected and it just takes so much stress and anxiety away that&#8230;you know, when I was a teenager, what if my car breaks down?  I don&#8217;t want to spend $500&#8230;that would use up all my money if I had to fix a car problem or if anything else broke that I wasn&#8217;t expecting and the more you build up the less stressed you get about these unexpected things that do happen in life and this past year just highlighted how important that is for my mental well-being&#8230;just to know that there&#8217;s there&#8217;s enough there and you can deal with things that happen and life&#8217;s bumps are going to be a lot more smoothed out because, as Mrs. PoP said, you have this giant shock absorber that can make any bumps you do face a lot smoother and easier to deal with.
<br/><br/>
Moving on to the absolute best thing that happened over the past year is that I finally released the album that I had been wanting to write my entire adult life.  And this was the whole reason I wanted to achieve FI in the first place, actually.  I thought it was my job that was getting in the way of me doing this and I thought I&#8217;d have to save up enough so that I would never have to work again in order to devote the proper time to actually achieve this big goal of mine and it turned out that I didn&#8217;t actually need to do that because the thing that was holding me back all these years of trying to achieve this is wasn&#8217;t my job, because I had plenty of spare time that I could have used towards working towards it.  It was actually a lot of mental hang-ups I had about trying to pursue it, because I was worried I&#8217;d fail, and so I probably could have actually done it when I had a job, but it did take achieving FI, and then a global pandemic to lock me inside for a year, to do it.
<br/><br/>
But I actually did it and it is by far the thing that I&#8217;m most proud of and if you&#8217;ve listened to it, you know it&#8217;s not going to win a Grammy or be on the radio or anything like that but it was the thing that I really wanted to accomplish more than any other and it was definitely the most difficult thing that I&#8217;ve tried to do so the fact that I was able to actually do it after all these years of not being able to, and not really believing I&#8217;d ever be able to was just a huge personal accomplishment for me and is something that i&#8217;m really proud of and I look forward to writing the next one because I&#8217;ll hopefully be in a completely different mindset than I was leading up to this one and now that I know I can do it, then i&#8217;m expecting this next one&#8217;s going to be a lot more fun to make.  So I&#8217;m really looking forward to that but since this was the whole reason I wanted to achieve FI in the first place, that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to do any more of these annual updates because every other annual update that I&#8217;ve given has sort of been revolving around me trying to get to this goal because that was like the end of my FI journey so now that I&#8217;ve done that, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to do any more annual updates because now it&#8217;s just a case of just living life as anyone is living life.  And the money equation is solved, and I was able to accomplish the thing that I wanted FI to lead to so any other future updates&#8230;I just don&#8217;t see the point of them really because it doesn&#8217;t have much to do with achieving FI in my eyes.  So it makes sense to just end on this high note and this will be the the final annual update.
<br/><br/>
Since I&#8217;m talking about the album, I just want to thank all of you guys out there who pre-ordered it and made the release week of the album even more exciting and that is because you guys helped me actually get onto the Billboard charts, which is ridiculous, especially considering the type of music it is and has no business being anywhere near the charts, so just want to thank you so much for that because it made it even more exciting than it was to begin with.  And even though nothing really came from being on the charts for one week, it just adds to the ridiculousness of my adult life so far.  I still smile anytime that I think about it so thank you for the support, it really meant a lot to me.  And if you haven&#8217;t checked out the album yet then you can go to madfientist.com/album and there&#8217;s a Spotify QR code that you can open up Spotify on your phone and do the search-by-image feature and then it&#8217;ll just pop up the album or you can just enter your email address and I will send you an email with all the links to the album and also tell you where I did end up on the chart for that amazing week way back in February.  And while you&#8217;re there in Spotify or Apple Music or wherever you listen to music, if you could follow me there, that would be great because that&#8217;s hopefully where a lot more activity is going to be happening over the next couple years.
<br/><br/>
So those were the really positive things over the last years that are FIRE related.  
<br/><br/>
One of the things that still is a challenge for me that i&#8217;m working through is losing money as a motivating factor.  I&#8217;ve written about this in the past, and I&#8217;ve maybe even talked about it on podcast, but for someone like me who has been focused on money for as long as I can remember and has been trying to you know reach FI and do all these saving goals, money has been a huge motivating factor in my decisions.  So from studying hard in high school, to what I majored in in college to what jobs I chose and everything.  And now, when money isn&#8217;t as important or more money isn&#8217;t as important&#8230;losing that as a source of motivation has been really interesting and I&#8217;m still not exactly sure I&#8217;ve come to grips with it and it&#8217;s almost made me rethink what I recommend for other people because I think being motivated by earning money is a positive thing and&#8230;I just came across a quote from Warren Buffett recently and it&#8217;s actually a quote about how he intends to leave money to his children and the quote is, he plans to leave them enough money so that they can do anything but not so much that they could do nothing and one I think that&#8217;s a great way to think about how much money you leave your kids but it also made me reflect on where I&#8217;m at now and, like I said, there&#8217;s no really motivation to earn more money and even though I&#8217;m incredibly lucky to be in that position, it still comes with complications because technically, yeah I don&#8217;t have to do anything but a lot of things in life come when you&#8217;re being forced to do something maybe you don&#8217;t exactly want to do, like for instance, going into work&#8230;yeah, it&#8217;s not great but you get this forced socialization that you may not have had and you&#8217;re interacting with people that are outside your social circle that may be difficult at times but it is also really rewarding and&#8230;to go back to the album, right now I could potentially promote it a lot more, which would then maybe get me signed to an indie label, which would then open up a lot of doors for fun music festivals to perform at, and things like that.  But since I don&#8217;t have money motivating me to reach out to the labels or get myself out there on social media or do any of these not-fun things in the short term, then I&#8217;m potentially missing out on a lot more fun in the long term so so that Buffett quote really made me think about FIRE in a new light and it made me think maybe the ideal savings goal to save enough so that all your essential expenses are covered and then continue working to fund your discretionary expenses.  So to go back to the Buffett quote, that would allow you to do anything, because you could technically survive by leaving your job and doing whatever you wanted to at that stage, so you could do anything at that point but it&#8217;s not really enough to allow you to do nothing.  Because you could get by and survive but there would be absolutely no fun in your life, which you wouldn&#8217;t want to continue for very long, so maybe that&#8217;s a good sweet spot&#8230;to save up enough so that all your essential expenses are covered so you can eat and you can have shelter and you can be warm and all the things that are essential for survival, so that then frees you up to do anything you want with your life but it&#8217;s not enough that you get comfortable and you do nothing.  And that may be a good sweet spot for motivation but on the flip side, most of the really great benefits that I talked about at the beginning of the episode&#8230;feeling like you can handle anything that comes to you and not having the stress and anxiety about future bumps in the road and all those things&#8230;those only really started to come into effect when we felt like we had more than enough.  So i&#8217;m not exactly sure what my conclusion is on this because on one hand, I feel like Fat FIRE is the way to go in in the sense that having more than enough and knowing that you&#8217;re gonna be okay no matter what comes around in the next few years or whatever, I think that is really valuable.  But then on the other hand, losing money as a motivation is difficult because then you don&#8217;t have to do things and I think maybe you miss out on things just because in the short term, they may be a little uncomfortable and since you don&#8217;t have to do these uncomfortable things, you don&#8217;t but then you&#8217;re potentially missing out on some long-term benefits.
<br/><br/>
So I&#8217;m not exactly sure where I fall on this but I think that maybe Lean FIRE is something to avoid because you don&#8217;t get either in that sense so you&#8217;re you&#8217;re not feeling like you have so much extra that you can handle whatever comes at you in the future years but you have enough that you don&#8217;t really have that money motivation to continue doing things.   So I&#8217;d be interested to hear your thoughts on this but at least in my really early days thinking about this topic, I&#8217;m thinking maybe Lean FIRE is probably not the way to go and maybe one of those other two bookends is a better goal for your FI savings.  But again, this is really early days in my thinking on this so i&#8217;d be interested to hear your opinions on it so head to madfientist.com/episode61 and leave a comment because i&#8217;d be interested to hear what you think about it.
<br/><br/>
Continuing on from the having more than enough idea, I&#8217;m trying to also think about my spending and trying to deprogram my frugality in a sense, because as I discussed with Ramit Sethi on the podcast interview I had with him, I know that I&#8217;m a bit too extreme in that sense.  And now that the market has recovered and finances are looking good, I know that I don&#8217;t need to be that frugal with things and I know that there&#8217;s potentially ways I can increase my spending that are not wasteful, because i&#8217;ll never be wasteful with money, but at least I can start thinking about ways to use my money in a positive and beneficial way, so that&#8217;s definitely something I plan to either write about more or maybe get Ramit back on the show to talk about more because I i feel like that&#8217;s a common problem with people like me, who are naturally frugal or have a frugal upbringing, sort of trying to deprogram some of that when it&#8217;s no longer necessary to be that extreme in your frugality.  So stay tuned for a deeper dive into that topic and if that&#8217;s something that you&#8217;re interested in, subscribe to the email list, which is definitely the best way to stay up to date with this stuff now because i&#8217;m posting even more sporadically than I used to in the past because i&#8217;m obviously working a lot more on the music project.  So if you&#8217;re wanting to just get updated whenever a new post or podcast comes out, just head to madfientist.com/advice and you can put your email address in there and you&#8217;ll get a pdf of all the great advice I&#8217;ve received on the Financial Independence Podcast from my guests over the years.  And if you want to check out the past four years of my annual updates I will link to all of those in the show notes of this episode so you can go to madfientist.com/episode61 and from there you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes and articles about everything that I learned in my previous four years of FI.
<br/><br/>
So that was a short but sweet one today.  I have some other interviews coming up that I&#8217;ll be publishing soon but I hope you&#8217;re all doing well out there hopefully you&#8217;ve been able to meet up with your friends and family that you hadn&#8217;t seen for a while.  Anyway, thanks a lot for listening and I&#8217;ll see in the next one!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Over seven years ago, a Mad Fientist reader reached out with an amazing story&#8230;</p>
<p>He and his wife planned to achieve financial independence with a family but the incredible part was that they had a VERY BIG family&#8230;13 kids to be precise!</p>
<p>Not only that, they were planning to do it on a single salary (which at the time, was around $104,000 per year).</p>
<p>For the full story, check out the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-retire-early-with-13-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original guest post here</a>.</p>
<p>Well, seven years on and they reached their goal&#8230;six years ahead of schedule!</p>
<p>Rob kindly agreed to provide an update on how they did it&#8230;</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>A lot of things in the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-retire-early-with-13-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first article</a> are still the same, but there have been some significant changes in the past seven years. A few of the major highlights: we now have 14 kids, we have eight grandkids, and I plan on reaching FIRE at the end of this year, instead of 2027 which was mentioned in the original article. </p>
<p>The other big news is we wrote a book <a href="https://amzn.to/3dm151S" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">A Catholic Guide to Spending Less and Living More: Advice from a Debt-Free Family of 16</a>, being released on Amazon and Ave Maria Press websites on April 23rd. More on these and other things below.</p>
<h2>FIRE with an Even Bigger Family</h2>
<p>During the summer of 2016 we took in a newborn as a foster baby. He is almost five now and looks to be a permanent addition to the clan.</p>
<p>Our four oldest kids are married (only one was when the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-retire-early-with-13-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original article</a> was written) and between them we have eight grandkids.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/how-to-retire-early-with-14-kids.jpg" alt="How to Retire Early With 14 Kids" width="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7155" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/how-to-retire-early-with-14-kids.jpg 821w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/how-to-retire-early-with-14-kids-300x216.jpg 300w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/how-to-retire-early-with-14-kids-768x552.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px" /></p>
<p>The eight oldest kids are out of the house. The six youngest, ages 4-17, are still living at home. I am trying to talk them into moving out (without success).</p>
<h2>Spending on Grandkids</h2>
<p>I may actually have to keep working because my wife loves shopping for things for the grandkids. Things she would never ever buy for our own kids have suddenly become “necessities” for the grandkids. Yard sale, hand-me-down and thrift store clothes were good enough for our kids but apparently the grandkids need new clothes.</p>
<h2>Reaching FI Earlier than Expected</h2>
<p>We haven’t hit the lottery or taken up robbing banks, I am too afraid of jail to do that. So, what has changed to allow us to predict an earlier FIRE date?</p>
<p>My income has only gone up a small amount since 2014. Around 2% per year. </p>
<p>Two years ago, my wife, Sam, started working part time at our church. She averages 10 hours a week. It’s not a large sum, but it gets saved, not spent. </p>
<p>Our budget hasn’t changed too much, our food costs are down a moderate amount due to kids moving out. </p>
<p>We have managed to up our savings rate. We are both over 50 so the max we can contribute to our 401k and IRAs has gone up. We max out the 401K, ROTH IRAs and HSA every year and we <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t touch the HSA money</a> (which I learned not to do years ago from the Mad Fientist). </p>
<p>Add in the 401k match from my employer and we are saving around $53,000 each year specifically for retirement. We also put money into an emergency fund each month. We have been building up the emergency fund so that we will have a minimum of a year&#8217;s worth of savings. I will feel more comfortable with that level of cash. Our savings rate is around 50% of our gross income.  </p>
<p>We are still debt free; our house was paid off in 2012 and we haven’t had any credit card, car or other debt since the late 80’s. We do have an unused home equity line of credit we could tap if everything goes sideways. </p>
<h2>Post-Retirement Income</h2>
<p>When I retire our gross income will go down, but our net income will be about the same since we will no longer be maxing out various accounts. We will still put money into our Roths since at the least my wife will have income. And we will keep putting money each month into our emergency fund. </p>
<p>We should definitely have the FI (financially independent) part down by year end. What the RE (retire early) part looks like remains to be seen. I am planning to leave my full-time job (shh don’t tell my boss) and the regular paycheck and benefits that go along with that around December 31st. But I will do “something”. Side hustle, sell more on eBay, maybe work part-time. But it will be on my terms. And my wife will still be working at the church. </p>
<h2>Family Health Insurance After Retirement</h2>
<p>We are excited and nervous for this to happen. The biggest worries are having six kids at home to provide for, including finding new health insurance. </p>
<p>I have created an account on our state’s health marketplace. It looks like we can get a silver level plan at a reasonable rate. </p>
<p>I also looked into health sharing ministries, but we have a few kids with some pre-existing health conditions, which makes these plans not optimal for us. </p>
<h2>The Book</h2>
<p>Last February (2020 &#8211; right before everything went into the toilet) we were approached by Ave Maria Press to write a book on finances from the perspective of a large Catholic family who was debt free. We fit that definition, although we are not writers and have never written a book before. We went back and forth with ideas and potential themes and chapters for a few weeks. We came to an agreement with the publisher and started the book in March, and then you-know-what hit…this actually helped the writing of the book.</p>
<p>With all the kid’s activities, along with everything else, cancelled, we found ourselves with a lot of free time. We spent April and May working on the book in the evenings and the weekends. Our older kids all wrote tips and suggestions that were woven into the text of the book. We ended up writing more than the publisher wanted and had to hack 10,000 words out of the first draft. We turned in that first draft in early June. The summer was spent going over corrections and suggestions from the publisher and by September the final version was set in, if not stone, at least wood. </p>
<p>We are currently learning the ropes of marketing and promoting a book. Doing interviews, podcasts and you know, writing articles like this. </p>
<h2>Retiring Early with 14 Kids</h2>
<p>I have had a paying job since the fall of 1980 when I was 15 and pumping gas after school at the local gas station. And a fulltime job since 1986. I will be 57 and my wife 53 at the end of the year, it is time. We are looking forward to this new chapter of our lives. </p>

<h2>Full Transcript</h2>


<div class="transcript">
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Hey, what&#8217;s up everybody? 
<br/><br/>
Welcome to the Financial Independence Podcast, the podcast where I get inside the brains of some of the best and brightest in personal finance to find out how they achieved financial independence. 
<br/><br/>
I can&#8217;t believe it, but I am finally interviewing the person that introduced me to this whole idea of financial independence in the first place. 
<br/><br/>
And that is Jacob Lund Fisker from EarlyRetirementExtreme.com. 
<br/><br/>
I came across Jacob way back in 2011, I was reading GetRichSlowly.org, which I&#8217;ve interviewed the writer behind that blog, JD Roth, on a previous episode of the podcast. So I was reading his site, and he did a review of a book called Early Retirement Extreme, and it just blew my mind. And that was when I realized that early financial independence was possible. If you saved enough money, you could then live on it and not have to rely on work anymore. So I&#8217;d say that was probably the most influential article I&#8217;ve ever read in my life, because it completely changed everything. And over the years, I&#8217;ve heard lots of stories from people about who introduced them to the idea of FIRE. And, you know, Mr. Money Mustache is a big one. And even this podcast has introduced some people to the concept, which is amazing to me. But Jacob and ERE is what did it for me. So it&#8217;s an honor to be able to talk to the guy that changed my life in so many ways. So rather than ramble on here, I just want to dive into it&#8230; 
<br/><br/>
Jacob, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.
<br/><br/>
This is a long time coming. So I started this podcast way back in May of 2012. And you were going to be my first guest, because you were the entire reason I knew about this whole thing called financial independence in the first place. But I chickened out and ended up asking a guy named Mr. Money Mustache, who was also a software developer like myself. And thankfully, I didn&#8217;t know how big he was at the time and how big he would go on to become but yeah, this is, this is a huge treat to be able to talk to you after all these years. And to thank you for the huge impact you&#8217;ve had on my life. Because I was trying to think about it before this call and I can&#8217;t think of anyone other than maybe my parents and my wife who have had a bigger impact on my financial life than you have.  And it was all from an article on Get Rich Slowly. And I think it was maybe when JD was reviewing your book back in 2011. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob Lund Fisker:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I think that was the one. I recently did a 10 year update and Get Rich Slowly as well. But I think that like only only two of them. But like, at that time I was I was I was mostly sort of like fading out of existence, like right when you started is when I more or less ended. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah, it was crazy. You just passed the torch to Mr. Money Mustache and that&#8217;s why I was like, well, I could talk to him because he&#8217;s a software developer. That would be fun. And yeah, it was just around that time.
<br/><br/>
Maybe that&#8217;s where we can kick off because I&#8217;m interested to hear what you&#8217;ve been up to. So you had you had written the book. And it&#8217;s a fantastic book. I&#8217;ve read it at least three times. And you finished up what you were trying to say with the website. And you were moving on and you passed the torch to MMM and I believe at the time you were becoming a quant trader. Is that right? 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> Yeah, something I never quite sure what my title was actually supposed to be. But it was me staring at financial data&#8230;a giant screen setup and trying to see some patterns there. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> What was that experience like? And how long did you end up doing it for? 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> I was there three and a half years until 2015. Essentially, my experience&#8230;when I was sort of like a young physicist, so to speak, I was very dismissing of anything financing business. But as I sort of like, matured a little bit more and got into sort of like the postdoc era of my life, I began to sort of kind of get acquainted with the whole financial independence thing, I started reading into finance and economics and actually thought working in the business and Wall Street could be could be really fun. And but that was that unfortunately happened sort of like around 2007-2008.
<br/><br/>
And then the great credit crisis essentially happened then there was like, tons of layoffs and all hiring essentially froze. And then I thought, Well, okay, that&#8217;s kind of like it for me. Just kind of forget about that.
<br/><br/>
And so I basically did that. And when I was sort of writing on the blog, instead and I was always making these kind of comments about like, if there had been more physicists on Wall Street, maybe this wouldn&#8217;t have happened. Like total physicist arrogance, we can fix everything.
<br/><br/>
And then one of one of my readers actually commented back and said if I&#8217;m still interested, maybe he could make that happen. So I was like, Yes. Okay, let&#8217;s try this, right, because my sort of philosophy is to try as many different things as you possibly can so essentially, sort of like self actualize to the fullest. By doing many different things, I&#8217;m learning many different things. So he essentially got me into the company in Chicago. So we left California in 2011-12. So basically, just before you started podcasting.
<br/><br/>
So same time, I sort of took that as an opportunity to stop blogging because I really felt that I but said everything there was to say, in the blog, I finished the book, which was sort of like the canonical textbook of both FI and also sort of like the extended theory part of it, I mean, to be FIREd, it&#8217;s just like a small aspect of what, when I was sort of like going on about so so I did that for a few years. 
<br/><br/>
Yeah, I think the greatest takeaway&#8230;is how big a difference there was between, like the academic side, sort of like the internet armchair expert, and then the actual practitioners.  Because in other fields, like science and engineering, you&#8217;re used to having one line of insight, sort of like goes from not knowing anything to maybe being like a hobbyist to being like a serious amateur. And then you have people working in the business. And then at the very top, you have like professors who understand everything.  That, you would agree, is typically how it goes.  I don&#8217;t know if that goes away in computing these days. But that&#8217;s how it would go in and like for example, physics, whereas in, in finance, or high finance, or like Wall Street stuff (Wall Street does not mean the physical location essentially means everything that has to do with trading and making deals that are outside the retail level), it has essentially forked. So they&#8217;re like two different communities that almost have like a wall between them. So you have, you have the academic side of it. And then you have the practical side. And what&#8217;s weird is that like the practical side is way bigger, way more well-financed, and in a sense more advanced. Whereas the academic side, they have essentially access to worse data, because data is expensive.  So it will be something like end of day closing prices, you can get a subscription to that. On the actual practitioner side, you will have everything tick by tick from multiple different exchanges. There&#8217;s not just the market in the US. I mean, when I when I quit in 15, there were like 40 different I think, exchanges and dark pools just in the US. So way more data, and that sort of like leads to sort of like different interpretation, different behaviors in those separate groups. 
<br/><br/>
And yeah, so that was my biggest surprise. My biggest insight from it was probably how agnostic or how neutral people were, in practitioners are in terms of like, what&#8217;s the best strategy is more sort of like, Well, I mean, this strategy might be good for this. And this might be good for that. But all sort of like look at what works and and just go with that. It&#8217;s not like as a theoretical academic level, where it&#8217;s all an improvement and stuff we already know and Nobel Prize winners have shown that and therefore everything must cite back to something, some previous work. 
<br/><br/>
I sort of like the more dogmatic so I mean, I think that sort of like spilled over into the rest of my life. So these days, I&#8217;m so far less to sort of like fly off a tangent because someone is wrong on the internet. So I think that is sort of like the biggest life lesson in that. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s a great takeaway. Did it affect how you view your own personal investments at all? I know back in the day, when I was reading you, you were one of the people that wasn&#8217;t on board with the whole buy and hold index investing, just set it and forget it sort of thing, which I want to dive into a little bit more. But first, did did your time in the industry on that practitioner side of Wall Street? Did that influence how you invested as an individual or a family? 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> Not really.  I mean, first of all, it&#8217;s like what I was was doing was like completely different than what I can do as a retail investor. So no, that&#8217;s not really been any change, I will actually say I&#8217;m probably better as a retail investor than I was as a professional. I tend to be more risk adverse, and this is not optimal for the industry. Let&#8217;s put it that way.
<br/><br/>
Like one of the fun things, where every everybody I work absolutely enjoyed playing poker. And I hate poker. I mean, that was interesting. I think in terms of the whole sort of like the index investing thing. I think the my reputation has been somewhat exaggerated in the FIRE movement. I mean, I wrote a few posts and asked some questions about the systemic effects mass adoption of index investing could have on the markets as such. And that sort of eventually turned into, &#8220;this Jacob guy who just hates index investing&#8221;. I think my bigger concern was the whole fire-and-forget attitude. Let&#8217;s, just hand everything over to an app. Let&#8217;s, you know, you want to want something quick and easy, something simple. So just do that. And then you can forget about it. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> I&#8217;d be interested to hear what you think of the FIRE movement? Especially, I think maybe 2017-2018 just seemed like it was going crazy. What were your thoughts on it at that stage? Because this is, you know, seven years after you felt like, you&#8217;ve pretty much said everything you wanted to say about it?
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s kind of like doing the podcast today. It&#8217;s like, well, man, I just like the 10 years ago, I&#8217;d forgotten all about it right now. And I need to revisit my notes, essentially. Yeah, I mean, it definitely hit the mainstream at that at that point. And, you start getting contacted by various journalists, because I mean, I&#8217;m sort of still known as one of the progenitors of it. And so of course, they want my opinion on it.
<br/><br/>
And I think what happened, essentially, you get, like a different kind of different kind of exposure. I mean, if you started if you go like, way back, way back, if you go back to sort of like this, the present iteration, which I think kind of started with me, we were only like, at least I was sort of like the loudest loud mouth bunch, right? I mean, I remember sort of, I mean, back then FIRE was not a thing, that sort of financial independence was not a thing in the personal finance world. I mean, when I was starting up, I was like, you know, these like, blogging awards, and I was I was getting them for, for something like &#8220;Best in Senior Living&#8221;.
<br/><br/>
Like &#8220;Best Entrepreneurial Blog&#8221;, like I hadn&#8217;t started into business, but that was sort of like the sort of the framework of sort of like the mid late 2000s that financial independence could fit into.
<br/><br/>
And so I started out at this very extreme kind of thing, way out of the left field, you know, like, let&#8217;s try not buying anything for a year. So that was completely unusual to do that. And when this has now become sort of like a &#8220;Buy Nothing Year&#8221;. 
<br/><br/>
Back then was David Bach thing where it was like the latte effect, where if you just save $2 a day, you become a millionaire in like 100 years, or whatever, and the idea of retiring was that you would save up a million dollars, it was always a million dollars, so that he was to become a millionaire. Investing, I think, like the 4% rule&#8230;that was the thing.  But it wasn&#8217;t really that wide widespread.  I mean, it came out of the Trinity study but back then the Trinity study was only like 10 years old or something. So it was not the foundation of any way to sort of invest for retirement.  It was more like I want to retire on this day and I have the $700,000 and I want to spend $40,000 a year, and then they would go back way around and then compute like a return of investment of 6% and so given those 6% what should the allocation investment be like.  So that was sort of like pre 4% rule as a as a rule of thumb and a lot of people retired and invested accordingly.
<br/><br/>
Right. And that kind of goes back to that warning about not adapting or sort of like integrating a very simple understanding of how to invest for the next 60 years, because some of these guys, you know, like, who retired in the 90s. And it was sort of like a mental model that sort of crashed and burned, because investing in some something aggressive at 8%, which was perfectly possible in the 90s, did not work very well between 2000 and 2007.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> So, would you be willing to share like sort of what your thinking is, as far as personal investment now, and like, you don&#8217;t have to obviously share any numbers or any actual strategies, but maybe just give a sort of an idea of what you&#8217;re thinking as far as how you invest your own FI portfolio? 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> Having invested for almost 20 years, now, I can definitely say that it changes, I mean, it changes, you change, depending on where I make money, I don&#8217;t make money.  Depends on how big the network has become. I mean, if you are like starting in the beginning, then index funds, for example, makes like great sense. Because you&#8217;re not you don&#8217;t have to think very much think very hard about and you can concentrate on your salary instead, I mean, and sort of like a we agree way to identify that demographic is when they plot you know, your net-worth graphic, and it&#8217;s just a straight line up, right? Because stuff, you know, your dollar cost averaging is completely and utterly dominating the sort of market impact of whatever your net worth is like, maybe you&#8217;re, you probably have sort of like less than 10 to 15 annual spend so that&#8217;s essentially how we calculate net worth these days, like how many years of spending have saved.  So if you&#8217;re below 15, then you know that the net worth curve always tend to be a straight line, because it&#8217;s dominated by salary. But then once you sort of get into get into the 25 Plus, and if you get even higher, I mean, my problem is, essentially, I spend so little that whenever people pay me money, I don&#8217;t know what to use it for. So this like, just keeps going, going up and up and up. I mean, right now, it&#8217;s like 130. And from that perspective, you know, like, volatility, or risk&#8230;risk for me is no longer volatility risk, for me is a permanent loss. Right? Maybe that&#8217;s another sort of like practitioner takeaway. These guys don&#8217;t care about volatility, they care about money that never comes back, right?  Because volatility is only really relevant if you&#8217;re like, if you&#8217;re doing research, then volatility is sort of like, sort of like a very easy way to define risk, because you can calculate, you know, it&#8217;s the standard deviation, essentially. And it&#8217;s useful if you&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re a bank, and you&#8217;re sitting in the middle between a customer and a big pool of money, because I&#8217;m here to sort of like bridge between and you have like slippage losses.  But for practical people, that&#8217;s the risk of permanent loss. So my personal strategy has tended towards becoming like a lot safer, you know, like belt and suspenders kind of stuff.
<br/><br/>
My interest in investing, investing is also kind of going down. So I actually might end up just like, putting everything into a Global Fund, or something 
<br/><br/>
I think I worry most about are the cases where someone comes in and says, I don&#8217;t care anything about investing or finance or anything, I just want sort of like a one stop solution for my post-FIRE life. I don&#8217;t know what what to call that risk&#8230;like an ignorant risk or paradigm risk?
<br/><br/>
Because I mean, paradigms change. I mean, they change every 10 years. I mean, you only have to go back 10 years, look at the real estate bubble, and see how that was sort of like, in many ways in the US, not in Canada, where it didn&#8217;t pop. But here, it was many ways driven by by sort of the same dogmatic slogan based understanding that you tend to see in sort of, like, I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s like the entire FIRE movement, but there are many, many in the, in the fire movement that have had sort of like the same thing like, well, they&#8217;re not making any more land, just by the biggest house, you can, because  you&#8217;ll never get this chance again.  They&#8217;re not making any more often. Just paint the walls essentially.
<br/><br/>
And you can, you can go back and see these kinds of ideas like fail over and over and over again.  Because people change their mind.  I think it&#8217;s like a twofold I mean, you can sort of feel the two ways you can have the paradigm shift under you, and then essentially like miss the terrain. Or worse, you can keep insisting that that one strategy you learned when you&#8217;re 25 is still valid when you&#8217;re 50, right?
<br/><br/>
So like, so the dominant paradigms are essentially been index investing since the 2010s is like when that exploded, and part of the reason it exploded was, of course, because interest rates were both dropped and then you had all these quantitative easing things, both in the US and in Europe. And you could actually plot like the stock market index with bands when when you have quantitative easing, the market goes up, when the easing stops, it goes flat. When it started again, it goes up again, you know, that&#8217;s not that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s not really a booming economy. That&#8217;s like, an economy, on heroin or something. I mean, that&#8217;s just bad. And then you can&#8217;t keep doing that forever. What I mean, so far, so good, right? 
<br/><br/>
And if you if you sort of, if you said like this is what&#8217;s actually happening in, in sort of, like the practical world, and on Wall Street, I mean, I knew a bunch of like, value investors. That&#8217;s not what I was doing, but people doing value investing, and sort of like getting depressed. Because everything was like completely overvalued. There was like nothing to buy that made some sense, right? So they&#8217;re just sitting on piles of cash waiting and waiting and waiting. And if you&#8217;ve been waiting for 10 years, right?
<br/><br/>
You can&#8217;t keep insisting that you are right and the market is wrong. I mean, you can only do that so long.  So that&#8217;s the tricky part.
<br/><br/>
Going back, so you had like real estate in the 2000s. And a little bit again after it recovered, people got into it again, and now it&#8217;s called house hacking.  It&#8217;s always a new new word.
<br/><br/>
You had .coms in the 90s but obviously, not anymore, right? 
<br/><br/>
A little bit again&#8230;the five biggest companies in the s&#038;p 500, that&#8217;s 20% of the index, right? They call the giants like Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and I totally forgot one. And they&#8217;re like, 40% of the NASDAQ. How&#8217;s that for diversification? 
<br/><br/>
Anyway, go back again&#8230;So in the 80s, it was commodities and CDs, like bank CDs, because the interest rates were so high.  You can&#8217;t get anything out of that anymore. So like a safe CD investment from the 80s would completely bomb, right. 
<br/><br/>
70s, gold.  My uncle collected stamps. Essentially because the market flatlined, and bonds were not doing anything so people were just buying collectibles, thinking that that would sort of be the thing. 
<br/><br/>
In the 60s, it was like blue chips. I just want to buy the big companies, and you&#8217;ll be safe forever. And as a result of that the multiple expansion was immense. So similar to what you see today, in internet stocks, you know, we had like PE ratios above 50. So like, that would take decades for these people to actually like return a decent amount of sort of like economic profit, as opposed to just like greater-fool profit of people like buying higher and so on. 
<br/><br/>
So I mean, the thing is, the biggest mistake one can make is to believe that you, you know everything there is to know about investing. But sort of like you have this kind of like dogmatic mind. I&#8217;m not kind of like super insist that everybody become an expert on this. But I do think that I think the least people can do or should do is sort of like pay attention from time to time, like is index investing still a thing? And if it is, cool&#8230;just keep doing that. But if everybody around you have sort of like moved on to something else, whatever that is, maybe it&#8217;s time to start questioning whether you are still the genius you think you are right. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> I think that&#8217;s great advice. And it seems like right now is potentially a paradigm shifting event COVID and then all the money being pumped into the economy. What are your thoughts on that? Have you have you spent any time thinking about what this means for the next decade? And what&#8217;s going to be the big thing for that? Because it does seem like this is a turning point, potentially, in how people think of investments and what the government&#8217;s ability to get involved is.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> Oh, well, investment wise, I haven&#8217;t really done much.  I was already like a belt and suspenders. 
<br/><br/>
I mean, it was kind of shocking to see things dip that fast, right? That was crazy fast compared to say 2008.  2008 was sort of more like a slow grind. I lost 1% today, tomorrow I lost another percent. And after 30 days, you know, you&#8217;re just sort of getting punished every every day until you&#8217;re sick of it. And then when when the maximum number of people were sufficiently sick, it flipped, because there were no more that were willing to sell and it went up again.
<br/><br/>
Here, it was more like slam slam, and then suddenly way up again&#8230;it was crazy volatile.
<br/><br/>
So there was like a lot of people in the futures market that just had like a field day with that. So for them it was good but for buy-and-holders, it must have been very interesting.
<br/><br/>
But of course, the government immediately practically guaranteed all their corporate bonds, right. So they were dropping.  So you have like AA rated bonds, that should normally be almost like treasuries losing, I don&#8217;t know, 20-30% like over a week. I mean, that&#8217;s insane. And then they gain it just as fast, as the government comes in and backstops the whole thing.  What&#8217;s more interesting to report on COVID from the ERE perspective, because ERE was originally not intended to be some FIRE thing. It was certainly more intended to be be sort of like a resilient lifestyle, like a low resource intensive lifestyle.  So if we were to run into limits to growth in the environment, would it still be possible to live live well.  And so for me, it has always been about, highly efficient living, and how to make it resilient and not become financially independent, as much as becoming like economically dependent, like independent of the economy. And so that, essentially is like ERE at the higher level.  And if you do that, then FIRE just become a nice side effect. You know, if you have a job, people pay you money, but you don&#8217;t have anything to use it for so you just park it in a savings account, which is actually what I did myself for, like the first five years until I found that there was something called investing and the crazy idea, like using money to make more money. I mean, that was just bizarre to me. I mean, I&#8217;m an immigrant.  I&#8217;m from Denmark, where like, stock investing was not a thing, and really wasn&#8217;t.  Put money in bricks in housing, but owning stocks and bonds, that was just weird. So with COVID, you know, being independent of the economy already, there was like practically no change in the way we live here. And on the forum, we had sort of like a slight tension between what you would call like the traditional FIRE people sort of like high incomes and total belief and like comparative advantage&#8230;it&#8217;s kind of like the, I&#8217;m not gonna spend my time fixing a flat on my bicycle for $15 when I&#8217;m making like $50 an hour. So you see that attitude a lot, especially the more people earned, the less they are willing to deal with the little things.
<br/><br/>
And they suddenly realize, it doesn&#8217;t really matter I have all this money when everything is on lockdown and I can&#8217;t do anything. Whereas for sort of like the resilient system I build up and then some of the other guys that build up instead it was like wow, this is what we&#8217;ve been prepared for practically. And so there was actually a lot of shifts in sort of like the one dimensional money only consumer/producer kind of thing, towards the sort of like more systems theoretical way of integrating your production and your consumption in your personal life so you&#8217;re no longer just having money coming from this side, so you earn it here and then you buy stuff here to solve the problem.  It was more like the total solution.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> That&#8217;s one of my favorite parts of the actual book.  And ERE is one of my favorite finance books and it&#8217;s not even really a finance book, as you said.  It&#8217;s more a philosophy book about overall life strategy and systems and yeah, the the financial independence part is a byproduct of that life but it&#8217;s the systems approach to lifestyle lifestyle design that I really enjoyed and I still think about it a lot.
<br/><br/>
Like when Mr. Money Mustache bought that piece of property on Main Street and had this like community thing. I thought, that&#8217;s a such an amazing idea because I&#8217;m an introverted guy but I do enjoy meeting people in my community and socializing. I was like, that&#8217;s a great idea. And now he has this place that just sort of, like promotes that. 
<br/><br/>
And at the time somebody was talking about maybe starting a brewery. And I thought, oh, that would be ideal because you get the forced socialization, you&#8217;re building something, you&#8217;re building a business, which is always fun and challenging. But on the health side of things, which in your book, you talk about how the second order effects of some decisions and how it could be negative positive. And for something like a brewery, it&#8217;d be great for the community, the socialization, the challenge, the creation/creativity, things like that. But it&#8217;d be terrible for the health side of things, because I would find myself drinking more beer. 
<br/><br/>
So it&#8217;s definitely something that I&#8217;ve kept in mind over the years. And it really does help me make decisions. And it&#8217;s like, okay, this seems good at first but what&#8217;s the knock-on effect? So yeah, I was wondering if you could maybe talk about how you&#8217;ve used that thinking in designing your life and how that has made you really resilient for a pandemic? 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> Yeah, I mean, so like, I almost feel like sort of like, describing the whole thing. Like, the book is very much about like, contrasting and comparing what we grew up with taking for granted, which is essentially the idea that you specialize in a job, you get an education, you specialize in a job that gives you earning power, and then you potentially measure how successful you are in terms of how high your earning power is. I mean, in the English language, we even have like expression, how much are you worth? I mean, when, when we ask that question, we want to know, like, you know, it&#8217;s the money question, practically.
<br/><br/>
It&#8217;s not like how nice a person are you or what did you do for your community.  I mean, it&#8217;s really, are you making lots of money. And along the same dimension, happiness equals spending. And I mean, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m, like, projecting too much, but you can see how, how FIRE kind of developed into lean FIRE and fat FIRE.  I&#8217;m obviously somewhat even more extreme than lean FIRE, but fat FIRE often sort of accuses us on the other side of like living a life without happiness because we are sacrificing so much, because spending is happiness. So I mean, it&#8217;s not surprising, from even like, from you&#8217;re like 10 years old, from the time you&#8217;re old enough to watch ads, right? I wonder when that when that happens by age three?  You do get sort of like continually reinforced that if you buy something, that increases your happiness, you get a shot of dopamine. Or if you had a problem, you pay someone, so all you need to do is earn and then you buy.  So you&#8217;re in this kind of cycle.
<br/><br/>
Personal Finance when when I started with it sort of tried to step out a little bit of that. I mean, if you&#8217;re sort of into the spending equals happiness, it&#8217;s no surprise that like half of Americans end up not having any more than $400 for one emergency. Right? Which is tragic, crazy. I mean, it shouldn&#8217;t be that way, right? 
<br/><br/>
So like, initial personal finance then becomes about like prioritizing your spending and not just like blowing your money left and right and then trying to keep everything together with credit cards. 
<br/><br/>
And people started learning how to budget you know, that&#8217;s a basic skill.  I don&#8217;t know if they teach this in schools today. They didn&#8217;t when I was young.  To a large degree, people are not taught sort of like the fundamentals of the society they live in it&#8217;s kind of like fish swimming in water, right? I mean, they&#8217;ve not discussed the water ever. So to them the water does not exist. And to a similar degree, the whole idea of earning and buying as a lifestyle is not something people see from the outside.  It&#8217;s something that they can&#8217;t see because they&#8217;re inside of it.
<br/><br/>
So, in the blogging world, it&#8217;s almost like getting an education, when you get into this, from sort of being blind to the water and then getting out.
<br/><br/>
So you learn to budget and prioritize. And then if you&#8217;re a little bit more advanced, you start optimizing your budgets.  Where is my money spent best or how do I get the best deal out of this. But it&#8217;s still sort looked at in isolation. Like, what is the best car here? Does this car make me happy? You know, are we getting the maximum return of my money in terms of like, my choice of driving, how do I make the best food. 
<br/><br/>
So it&#8217;s all sort of like seen as individual things to optimize. You want to spend money well so you have all these like Consumer Reports review. And the underpinning of all this is of course, specialization and comparative advantage, people are distinctly sort of like pushed back towards, you just got to earn more money, because you&#8217;re wasting your time if you try to learn other things.
<br/><br/>
You can suspect that half of the economy is just in the, in the business of like creating problems for the other half of the economy to solve. 
<br/><br/>
I mean, this kind of like with the brewery.  So you drink beer to become happy, but then you also become unhealthy. And then you have to take some other drug that makes you healthy again, but that drug has side effects. And now you have to take a drug to remove those side effects and perhaps pay someone to administrate that whole business. 
<br/><br/>
So this is kind of where the ERE book, where that philosophy comes in, because first of all, it kind of describes this screwed up system we&#8217;re living in. So it kind of like takes the fish out of the water. Look fish, you&#8217;re swimming in this pool of water.
<br/><br/>
So I introduced the concept of the Renaissance man or Renaissance person, which was sort of like an early idea of the Enlightenment.  Today, it&#8217;s more like a general polymath, I think would be the right word.
<br/><br/>
But essentially, the idea that humans have potential to become many different things, and you should strive to develop in that way. You can kind of contrast it with today where any kind of education development practically stops after college. But you should also development in many other directions, like you should be healthy, should to be able to sing, dance, play an instrument, create art, all kinds of things. 
<br/><br/>
So essentially, in the Renaissance idea was the view that a person should be skilled in many things, which is like completely different than the industrial idea that you should be like skilled, very skilled but in only one thing. 
<br/><br/>
So once you&#8217;re skilled in many things, then that essentially implies that now you can start doing many things, you can do different things, instead of paying someone else to do for you. 
<br/><br/>
That&#8217;s kind of what you described with MMM&#8217;s mainstreet operation or the brewery.
<br/><br/>
Everything you do has some outcomes, and it always has more than one outcome. There&#8217;s always a side effect, some where you got to sort of ask yourself, is that a productive thing or a bad thing. I refer to those as goals. So like, for instance, like if you had a brewery and you make beer, drink beer, then that has the goal of like making you drunk or whatever. But it also has the goal of making you unhealthy. So goal does not imply anything positive&#8230;it is simply an outcome.
<br/><br/>
And so the systems theory comes in when you start connecting these goals. So instead of just optimizing single points, like which is the best electric car, you begin to consider which side effects does this have. Are there side effects to the side effects? And do I do something that&#8217;s productive, but also counterproductive.
<br/><br/>
And so everything is then arranged and it&#8217;s almost kind of like&#8230;so a system is essentially like a network.  That&#8217;s probably the best way to describe that.  So in a network you have like nodes and connections.  You have computers and cables between them. So it&#8217;s like a network and systems thinking essentially means looking beyond the given node or the given action to see what impact does this have on the system itself?
<br/><br/>
And so systems it&#8217;s not no longer the money flowing around like it would be on sort of like the one dimensional linear earn-spend thing.  It&#8217;s also like happiness, health, meaning, skills.  So I call it the web of goals, essentially, but could also call it the net of goals but the reason I call it a web is that if you look at it almost like if a fisherman&#8217;s net or web for catching something. Actually a spider&#8217;s web is probably a better example. If it breaks in some part, like you fail to reach a goal, like seeing back when I was trying to become like a quant in 2007. And I was reading all these like high finance, like complicated finance, how to price options and all that kind of stuff.  But I failed at doing that. So that goal was essentially eliminated. But because it was aligned up with other productive goals, it meant that I could still use that knowledge to invest for myself and not like, you know, do harm to my own financial well being. 
<br/><br/>
So in that sense, the web of goals is extremely resilient. You can cut parts out of it, and it still works. 
<br/><br/>
Whereas if you&#8217;re sort of like a specialist, who consumes&#8230;if you lose your ability to consume, then suddenly you have nothing, right? That was like the COVID experience, right? Oh, my God, suddenly, I have to learn how to cook my own food, because I can no longer go out seven days a week. That happened to a lot of people, right? I mean, there are people who eat out every single day, they literally cannot fry an egg. I&#8217;m not exaggerating.
<br/><br/>
And the other completely different perspective in the book is, of course, going back to the idea where spending equals happiness&#8230;to me spending money is bad in that sense because that implies a poorly designed system.  For me, spending money is resolving friction in the system. It&#8217;s because something is not moving naturally. It&#8217;s not well thought out. So I mean, I&#8217;m not impressed when people say, &#8220;Well, I spend $100,000 a year.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, wow, you must have a lot of problems with your system!
<br/><br/>
And that&#8217;s essentially the book in a nutshell. And then there&#8217;s like, maybe 20 pages on the math in case you want to declare financial independence. And that&#8217;s mainly because I got a lot of pushback, &#8220;You can&#8217;t become financially independent in five years if you don&#8217;t have a million dollars.&#8221; 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> So to go back to the system, the web of goals, and the systems you have in place&#8230;your systems must have been so dialed in, even back in 2011, just because of the amount that you guys were able to spend per year means that you had removed all the inefficiencies and were able to really just not spend that much. Because I think back in the day, I think it was when you were in San Francisco, which is thought of as a very expensive city. And yet you guys were only spending something like $7,000 a year. 
<br/><br/>
Have you felt like your system has improved even since then? And I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a constant thing that you&#8217;re working on and adjusting.  And has your spending increased at all over the years or it has it actually decreased since 2011?
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> It has changed.  Compared to like a normal consumer, our budget looks completely different. And, like we spent like 60% of our money on unavoidable stuff like real estate or health insurance.  We cannot we cannot eliminate it. 
<br/><br/>
So if we move like west of the Mississippi, where real estate taxes are a lot lower, we will be spending even less than $7,000 per person. So like two adults $14,000.
<br/><br/>
The problem also when you go back for 25 years, inflation becomes a factor.  If I spent like $6,000 in 2000, I would not be spending $6,000 today.  I&#8217;m getting old enough where this seems to become a factor. 
<br/><br/>
But on an absolute level, yeah, about $7,000. We were not in San Francisco, we were on on the other side of the bay.  We were on the East Bay.
<br/><br/>
But we had to rent a house there, until we got the RV, and that exceeded $7,000. But otherwise, since I moved away from home, it&#8217;s always been about that low. So I&#8217;d essentially kept my student stipend budget ever since then, which is, which is a lot easier than if you got used to living at $50,000 a year, $100,000 a year, then going the other way is a lot harder than not going up in the first place.
<br/><br/>
What has changed is the system. So the web of goals changed as well. I mean, we&#8217;ve tried many different ways to live on $7,000 at this point.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> So what does life look like since you stopped working as a quant? What have been some of the things that you&#8217;ve been interested in learning? Like you mentioned, the Renaissance man idea where you&#8217;re constantly learning new things and developing new skills&#8230;What&#8217;s been keeping you busy since the quant days finished?
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> Yeah, so we bought a light fixer upper. So I mean, that&#8217;s another thing where sort of like growing up with a wide assortment of skills.  Can they take down a wall and put it up again? And in my case, I came in with absolutely nothing. I mean, I can just about like, drill a hole in the wall.  That&#8217;s my childhood education. So there was a lot of figuring this stuff out.  I renovated our bathroom, I built new cabinets. So I&#8217;ve been into furniture making for quite a while. So we fixed up the entire bathroom for 50 bucks, I think. So it&#8217;s a learning all these little things. And then recently, I&#8217;ve started like building clocks out of plywood.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Rereading the book recently, to prepare for this interview&#8230;I read it way back when it got released and then I read it again, when I was gonna ask you to be on the podcast five years ago, and then I wimped out and didn&#8217;t ask you. So then I read it again, in anticipation for this.  And you predict a lot of things and they seem to have been coming true in lots of different ways. So my two questions&#8230;is there anything that&#8217;s changed that you wish you had written in the book? Has your thinking changed in any ways that you think, &#8220;I actually should have changed that&#8221;? And also, where do you think these ideas go in the future? 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> Yeah, so it kind of goes back to that thing about working in finance, becoming sort of more neutral in attitude or seeing more perspectives..Definitely when I wrote it, I had one perspective, which was my perspective. And if I wrote it today, it would be less edgy, it would be more understanding of other perspectives. So it&#8217;s not just like, these guys are crazy.  I think there was there&#8217;s definitely been some growing up in that sense.  Also, from interacting with different people, I&#8217;ve become lot more cognizant of different perspectives and limits and more understanding in terms of&#8230;I mean, back then I was like, &#8220;Well, here&#8217;s the book, you just read it, and then you change your life&#8221;.
<br/><br/>
Now I realize it&#8217;s a long process. And it&#8217;s not from here to here&#8230;it&#8217;s more like sort of like a step. 
<br/><br/>
And sometimes people might be sitting on the same level for a long time and be fine with it and then suddenly have some kind of epiphany. But that is not necessarily an epiphany that goes all the way to sort of like what I consider the full ERE.  It might just be a next step.  So we&#8217;ve sort of like mapped out the pedagogical challenges of this stuff. 
<br/><br/>
In terms of the technical stuff, I&#8217;m sometimes amazed at how smart that book was. I don&#8217;t know if I can write it again like that. Since you go back and you read some things like oh, this is really good.
<br/><br/>
So it&#8217;s kind of sounds a little stupid because I think I should be able to write a better book now but I really doubt myself that I can do that. 
<br/><br/>
I think being more understanding of different perspective kind of tends to clutter the mind. Instead of just presenting one perspective, there&#8217;s a lot more, &#8220;But what if?&#8221; and &#8220;What about this case?&#8221; and &#8220;What about that case?&#8221; sort of like taking up my mind space these days.
<br/><br/>
I wouldn&#8217;t say I have particularly more I experience and sort of like the pure technical sense but I have talked to a lot more people since then. So I have their perspective. And of course, one of the huge problems back then was that there will not be many examples to draw on. So it all fell on me, right? I kind of realized that I&#8217;m a somewhat unusual or weird person compared to&#8230;if you pick some someone at random, right? I mean, for example, we don&#8217;t have children. So a lot of people will say, &#8220;Well, I mean, that&#8217;s easy for him, because he doesn&#8217;t have children&#8221;. But that&#8217;s not the best way to learn&#8230;to just try to copy someone and try to be like them. I mean, it&#8217;s better to understand why they&#8217;re doing what they&#8217;re doing, rather than who they are, what they&#8217;re doing, and then try to do the exact same thing. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Exactly. And that&#8217;s why that&#8217;s why the book is so good. And I think maybe why it&#8217;s so timeless, and why it was just as enjoyable reading over the past few months as it was, you know, way back in the in the day, in 2011, because it&#8217;s more like&#8230;I think even mentioned in the book, it&#8217;s not a to-do list or a guide, or even a map, it&#8217;s more a philosophy that you can use to make better decisions, to make your own map and figure out your own to-do lists based on that.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> I was I was very deliberate, trying to make it as timeless as possible.  Or as non-timely as possible. This is also why there&#8217;s no sort of deep investment &#8211; deep is a very terrible word, it is actually quite deep in terms of investment insights &#8211; But there&#8217;s no details.  So there&#8217;s no 10 step to it, just buy this fund and that fund and that fund, and then then you&#8217;re good to go.
<br/><br/>
One of one of my quirky hobbies is to go into a thrift store and then like pick out popular investment books from like the 90s. And the 80s. And the 70s, if I can find them.
<br/><br/>
Something like from the 80s&#8230; how to get rich with CDs.  And I didn&#8217;t want to have written a book like that. Give someone some advice, and then turns out to be terrible like 10-20 years later. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Well, we&#8217;re coming up to over an hour already, which is crazy. So I don&#8217;t want to take up too much of your time, but if people want to get in touch for any reason, is the forum, still probably the best way to post questions and get answers? 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> Yeah, the forum is where the action is. I mean, it&#8217;s, at least some people have figured out the blog has been on like, auto rotation for like, eight, nine years now. I don&#8217;t really write anything, but it&#8217;s still presenting new stuff.
<br/><br/>
But I mean, the forum is kind of like the grad school of financial independence, if you want to put it that way. It&#8217;s not really a place where you go and ask, How do I how do I set up a brokerage account or something like that?
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Well, this has been fantastic, Jacob. Like I said at the beginning, you&#8217;ve you&#8217;ve impacted my life in more ways than I would have even imagined it would have impacted me when I read that article way back in the day. So, thanks for taking the time to do this. Thanks for writing. And writing the book. 
<br/><br/>
I usually ask all my guests this final question&#8230;what&#8217;s one piece of advice you&#8217;d give to somebody who wants to achieve financial independence? And it could be about anything. So I&#8217;d be interested to hear what you say. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> I&#8217;m the worst person to ask that question. I would say just find someone who motivates you. You can only learn from someone who&#8217;s slightly ahead of you and not someone who&#8217;s far ahead of you. But once you&#8217;re no longer learning anything from a given teacher, then it&#8217;s time to move on to the next teacher. I think the best advice is to find the right teacher.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> And it&#8217;s a good time for that. That&#8217;s one big benefit of this explosion in people writing and talking about FIRE&#8230;you can find that next step. 
<br/><br/>
Well, thank you so much, Jacob. This has been an absolute honor to speak to you after all these years. So thanks again for coming on the show. And yeah, hopefully meet up with you in real life one day and we can chat about more stuff 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Jacob:</strong> Once the pandemic is over.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Absolutely.  Thanks again, I&#8217;ll talk to you soon. Take care.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are probably a lot of reasons your New Year&#8217;s resolutions aren&#8217;t going to plan this year.</p>



<p>But do they ever?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s funny how we make them even though they rarely stick.</p>



<p>Setting normal &#8220;goals&#8221; throughout the year isn&#8217;t much more effective&#8230;</p>



<h2>Problems with Goals</h2>



<p>Previous podcast guest, <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/james-clear-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Clear</a>, wrote a great post highlighting the <a href="https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems with goals</a> but here are a few that I&#8217;ve experienced myself:</p>



<h3>Reduce Current Happiness</h3>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll be happy when I hit FI!  I&#8217;ll do all the things I&#8217;ve been planning to do after I reach FI!&#8221;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/best-and-worst-about-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I found out</a>, happiness doesn&#8217;t just appear when you cross some arbitrary number on a screen.</p>



<p>When you reach the finish line but don&#8217;t experience the happiness you were expecting, you tend to just move the goalposts or create a new goal, thus further delaying your happiness even more.</p>



<h3>Reduce Motivation</h3>



<p>When you only focus on the big, intimidating finish line, it can be hard to stay motivated to get there.</p>



<p>&#8220;How am I going to run 26.2 miles when I can&#8217;t even run one mile without feeling awful?! Might as well quit now, I guess.&#8221;</p>



<h3>Bad for Long-Term Progress</h3>



<p>What happens after you acheive your goal?</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s my friend throwing away her running shoes in NYC after completing the New York City marathon:</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/no-more-running.jpg"><img src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/no-more-running.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6932" width="600" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/no-more-running.jpg 800w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/no-more-running-300x246.jpg 300w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/no-more-running-768x631.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure></div>
		


<p>Meeting the big goal of running a marathon felt like the miserable end of a long journey and she said she was never running again (I&#8217;m not sure she has).</p>



<h2>A Personal Tale of Two Approaches</h2>



<p>Back in 2017, I wanted to make progress on two different things…songwriting and fitness.</p>



<p>I approached each of those things differently though.</p>



<p>For songwriting, I declared at the 2017 Chautauqua that I was going to finish a song by March 31, 2017.</p>



<p>For fitness, I decided I just wanted to go to the gym 2-4 days a week for the rest of my life. I didn&#8217;t really care about benching a certain weight or putting on a certain amount of muscle mass…I just wanted to get healthy and stay healthy.</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s what happened with those two things…</p>



<h3>Songwriting</h3>



<p>I suffered through a few months of trying to write a song.  I eventually wrote something that could be considered a song and then I finished that sort-of-song on March 31st, 2017…meeting my target and achieving my goal.</p>



<p>Immediately after though, I stopped writing music. I lost all motivation, since I no longer had the goal driving me, and I wasn&#8217;t enthusiastic about doing it again because the song I wrote wasn&#8217;t any good.</p>



<p>Since I was so focused on the finished product, I didn&#8217;t develop any good habits in the process so I had nothing to fall back on when the goal was finished.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t until late 2019 that I&#8217;d start <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/ultralearning-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to write music again</a> (with <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/ultralearning-experiment-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more success this time</a>, thankfully).</p>



<h3>Fitness</h3>



<p>Contrast that with my fitness journey and it&#8217;s the complete opposite.</p>



<p>I continued going to the gym through 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 (until COVID shut them down) and I likely exceeded any goals or weight targets I would have set at the beginning, thanks to my consistency.</p>



<h2>So What to Focus on Instead?</h2>



<p>The best way I&#8217;ve found to make progress on the things that are important to me is to focus on mastery instead.</p>



<p>Mastery is simply making sure you can answer yes to the question, “Are you better today than you were yesterday?”</p>



<p>You&#8217;re not concerned with outcomes…you only care about putting the time in and making sure that time is spent effectively.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/ultralearning-experiment-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultralearning Experiment was so beneficial</a> &#8211; it made me determine the most important things to focus on and it forced me to spend time doing those things.</p>



<h3>Doesn&#8217;t Delay Happiness</h3>



<p>Unlike goals, mastery encourages you to enjoy the process.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re not delaying happiness until you accomplish something. You&#8217;re not putting all your hopes on some unpredictable future.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re just building a life around something important to you and you enjoy the benefits of making progress on that thing.</p>



<h3>Especially Important for Early Retirees</h3>



<p>Mastery is particularly important for people who achieve financial independence early in life.</p>



<p>If you leave your job in your 30s or 40s, you potentially have 60+ years of freedom in front of you so it makes sense to do things that you enjoy for a long time, rather than constantly achieving and replacing short-term goals.</p>



<h3>Can Replace the Best Aspects of Your Job</h3>



<p>In Daniel Pink&#8217;s book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3niaaed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Drive</a>, he states that autonomy, mastery, and purpose are the three components of an enjoyable and fulfilling career/life.</p>



<p>Although early retirees gain a huge amount of autonomy after leaving work, sometimes they find that mastery and purpose are lacking from their post-employment life.  And lacking in these two areas can often leads to unhappiness.</p>



<p>Focusing on mastery after early retirement can help you find those missing components and allow you to enjoy your autonomy even more.</p>



<p>As psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi states in his book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3n7A1VN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Flow</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Contrary to what we usually believe…the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times—although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.</p></blockquote>



<p>And here he is describing why early retirees could find themselves less happy after leaving their job:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>On the job people feel skillful and challenged, and therefore feel more happy, strong, creative, and satisfied. In their free time people feel that there is generally not much to do and their skills are not being used, and therefore they tend to feel more sad, weak, dull, and dissatisfied.</p></blockquote>



<p>So if you&#8217;re rushing to retire early because you think all your problems will be solved and happiness will instantly materialize, you may be disappointed.</p>



<h3>Hugely Beneficial Shift in Mindset</h3>



<p>I can attest to the positive impact the change of mindset from goals to mastery has had.</p>



<p>As I was finishing <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/album" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my album</a>, I decided I wanted to write one more song for the album.</p>



<p>A goal like that would have crippled me in the past, especially considering I only had a month to get the song finished. But thanks to my experience over the previous months of just focusing on putting in the hours and letting the songs come as they may, I simply continued with my normal routine.</p>



<p>I put in as many hours as I could during that month and thankfully, a new song did emerge (for those who <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/album" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordered the album</a>, the last song on the album is the one I wrote during that final month).</p>



<p>I knew that the only thing I could control was the amount of time I worked and I also knew that a song would eventually come out of that work so I just trusted the process.</p>



<p>Although the goal of finishing a song helped focus my effort, keeping my attention on the habits of mastery (and allowing the song to be a by-product of the process) was maybe the biggest mental breakthrough I had during the whole project.</p>



<h2>Five-Year Blocks</h2>



<p>A few years ago, I filled in a <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Life Weeks</a> spreadsheet from Wait But Why.</p>



<p>I found it again recently and I noticed something&#8230;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s amazing what you can accomplish in 5 years with slow but persistent progress.</p>



<p>Looking at my life, here&#8217;s what I focused on during those 5-year blocks and what I was able accomplish during that time&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><td>Age</td><td>Focus</td><td>Result</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>15-20</td><td>Education (or more honestly, Beer/Girls)</td><td>Got into great school and got a degree in Computer Science</td></tr><tr><td>20-25</td><td>Career</td><td>Built a successful career in software that allowed me to eventually achieve FI</td></tr><tr><td>25-30</td><td>Grad School</td><td><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/free-ivy-league-degree" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Ivy League Degree</a></td></tr><tr><td>30-35</td><td>Mad Fientist</td><td>Built a successful and profitable blog/podcast/business</td></tr><tr><td>35-40</td><td>Music</td><td>Wrote <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/album" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an album</a>!

<h3>Playing Long Game Gives Better Chance of Success</h3>



<p>Just like investing, it seems like you have a higher chance of success if you play the long game because you outlast the people looking for a quick win.</p>



<p>Here is the income/traffic graph for the Mad Fientist over the years:</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mad-fientist-income-traffic.png"><img src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mad-fientist-income-traffic.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6942" width="500" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mad-fientist-income-traffic.png 682w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mad-fientist-income-traffic-300x227.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></figure></div>
		


<p>People playing the short game would have quit in 2012, 2013, 2014, or 2015 and wouldn&#8217;t have been around to reap the benefits in years 2017-2019.</p>



<p>You can see that my focus shifted in 2019 to my new 5-year topic to master (i.e. music) but&#8230;</p>



<p></p>



<h3>You Don&#8217;t Have to Stop After Five Years</h3>



<p>That&#8217;s not to say you should stop and move on completely after five years.</p>



<p>After doing something for that long, you&#8217;ve no doubt developed habits that will allow you to easily continue, even while you start something new and more difficult.</p>



<p>The skills I picked up in college allowed me to continue learning throughout my life.  </p>



<p>The computer-programming skills I learned during my career allowed me to build useful tools like the <a href="https://cards.madfientist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travel Card Tool</a> and the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/fi-laboratory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FI Laboratory</a> for the Mad Fientist.  </p>



<p>The writing skills I developed during grad school helped me present information more effectively here and elsewhere.  </p>



<p>And everything I learned about online business/marketing with the Mad Fientist will now hopefully help me promote my new album more successfully.</p>



<h2>Forget about FI</h2>



<p>After saying that, what do I now think about the goal of FIRE?</p>



<p>I say you forget about it completely.</p>



<p>Instead, focus on mastering the relationship between Time, Money, and Happiness.</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/money-time-happiness.png"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/money-time-happiness.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6949" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/money-time-happiness.png 500w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/money-time-happiness-300x300.png 300w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/money-time-happiness-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></figure></div>
		


<p>I put off my happiness until I hit FI and that was the wrong way to do it.  Here&#8217;s how I was skewed in those pre-FI years:</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skewed-fi-priorities.png"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skewed-fi-priorities.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6950" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skewed-fi-priorities.png 500w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skewed-fi-priorities-300x300.png 300w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skewed-fi-priorities-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></figure></div>
		


<p>I devoted most of my time to earning more money and I sacrificed my happiness so that I could save more money to hit FI quicker.</p>



<p>As I chatted to <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/ramit-sethi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ramit Sethi</a> about recently, I think I&#8217;m still slightly skewed in the same way so I&#8217;m trying to find ways to use the money I accumulated to buy more time and increase our happiness.</p>



<p>Just like mastering other things, I feel like mastering this equation is going to be a lifelong pursuit so I plan to continue experimenting/tweaking/assessing indefinitely.</p>



<h2>Not Going to Be Easy</h2>



<p>Although focusing on mastery will likely yield better longterm results than focusing on goals, that&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s easy.</p>



<h3>Self Doubt</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ll still have to push through crippling self doubt, as I&#8217;ve experienced many times over the past year.  </p>



<p>Here are ways I found to make that easier&#8230;</p>



<h3>Find Your Most-Productive Time of Day</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve found that evenings are awful for me so I don&#8217;t try to do anything creative or difficult in the evenings.</p>



<p>It seems like my confidence slowly drains away during the day so by the time the evening rolls around, I hate everything I produce.</p>



<p>Rather than fight that, I make sure to do my creative stuff early in the day and then I just relax in the evenings (or do easier tasks that don&#8217;t take willpower/confidence).</p>



<h3>Understand Your Biases</h3>



<p>I realize that I&#8217;m too harsh on myself so I now try to assume everything I make is 25-50% better than I think it is.</p>



<p>This became apparent when I heard one of my articles on the <a href="https://oldpodcast.com/optimal-finance-daily-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optimal Finance Daily podcast</a>.</p>



<p>The Optimal Finance Daily podcast takes popular blog posts and reads them out as a podcast episode.</p>



<p>When I first heard one of my blog posts being read by someone else, I enjoyed that post so much more (since it wasn&#8217;t my internal voice reading it).</p>



<p>It was a post I wasn&#8217;t that happy with when I posted it but when a guy with a British accent read it, I thought it was great!</p>



<p>That showed me I&#8217;m overly critical of my internal voice (which I&#8217;m sure is true for 98% of the population).</p>



<p>That realization now helps me publish things when I&#8217;m not feeling as confident.</p>



<h3>Recognize Your Creative Cycle</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve realized that any time I create something, I go through the same cycle:</p>



<ul><li>Initially really excited about an idea</li><li>Quickly become overwhelmed by what needs to be done to make the idea a reality</li><li>Make some progress and get really excited about idea again</li><li>Work feverishly&nbsp;and get close to being able to publish</li><li>Start obsessing about a million small details and eventually hate what I made (probably because I&#8217;m spending so much time obsessing about the minutia)</li><li>Get fed up and just publish it to be done with it</li><li>Feel initial relief at finally getting it out into the world</li><li>Get into a funk the next day, no matter what kind of feedback I receive (maybe because I&#8217;ve been working so hard and have been so focused, so the rubber band pings back in the opposite direction)</li><li>Weeks or months later, I look at what I produced and I&#8217;m surprised how good it is and how much I like it (despite hating it when I released it)</li></ul>



<p>Knowing this about myself has made it a lot easier to publish things and it&#8217;s also made it easier getting through the post-publishing funk because I know it&#8217;ll pass and it&#8217;s just part of the process.</p>



<h3>Realize You&#8217;ll Never Be Satified</h3>



<p>Former US Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich, said this about mastery&#8230;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Figure out for yourself what you want to be really good at, know that you&#8217;ll never really satisfy yourself that you&#8217;ve made it, and accept that that&#8217;s okay</p></blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;d take it a step further though&#8230; </p>



<p>You shouldn&#8217;t just accept that it&#8217;s okay&#8230;you should be thankful it&#8217;s that way because that means it will provide you a lifetime of challenge and enjoyment!</p>



<p>At first, I was overwhelmed by everything I had to learn to make the kind of music I wanted to make. </p>



<p>After I starting looking at that as a blessing rather than an obstacle, I wasn&#8217;t as overwhelmed and intimidated and that allowed me to get to work and make progress.</p>



<p>If you reach financial independence in your 30s or 40s, you have a lot of years to fill up so embrace the challenges and be thankful you have something interesting and challenging to keep you occupied for the rest of your life. </p>



<h3>Only Your Emotions Stand In Your Way</h3>



<p>In the book, <a href="https://amzn.to/38yMbmM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Mastery</a>, by Robert Greene, he states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The only real impediment to this is yourself and your emotions &#8211; boredom, panic, frustration, insecurity.”</p></blockquote>



<p>He continues&#8230;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>You cannot suppress such emotions &#8211; they are normal to the process and are experienced by everyone, including Masters. What you can do is have faith in the process. The boredom will go away once you enter the cycle. The panic disappears after repeated exposure. The frustration is a sign of progress &#8211; a signal that your mind is processing complexity and requires more practice. The insecurities will transform into their opposites when you gain mastery. Trusting this will all happen, you will allow the natural learning process to move forward, and everything else will fall into place.</p></blockquote>



<p>As I&#8217;ve experienced, you just have to get to work, try to work on the most-impactful thing you can, and do it for as long as you can.</p>



<p>It really is effective.</p>



<h2>The Alternative is Much Harder</h2>



<p>And although pursuing mastery isn&#8217;t easy, the alternative is much more difficult.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/best-and-worst-about-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I experienced</a>, not pursuing my music project during my career was the biggest source of my unhappiness during that time.</p>



<p>In his book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3oB1X6g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Finish</a>, Jon Acuff says this about not pursuing the things that are important to you: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Goals you refuse to chase don&#8217;t disappear, they become ghosts that haunt you. Do you know why strangers rage at each other online and are so quick to be angry and offended these days? Because their passion has no other outlet&#8230;Many a troll was born from the heartache of a goal he dared not finish. Maybe a troll is just someone who lost to perfectionism so many times he gave up on his own goals and decided to tear down someone else&#8217;s.</p></blockquote>



<p>Don&#8217;t let that happen to you.</p>



<p>As hard as it was writing my album last year, the year before <em>not writing</em> my album was much worse. </p>



<h2>Two Worlds</h2>



<p>Finally, I&#8217;ll leave you with the thing that&#8217;s been most helpful to me with pushing through these issues&#8230;</p>



<p>I first said this to myself a few years ago but I&#8217;ve used it many more times since then.  </p>



<p>The first time was when my brother was staying with us in Edinburgh and I thought to myself, what&#8217;s the point of this music project?</p>



<p>I realized the reason I wanted to make music was so that I could have fun playing live music (preferably with my little brother).</p>



<p>Since he was staying with us, I figured there was no reason to wait!</p>



<p>So I programmed a music set into Ableton (complete with backing instruments, real-time vocal effects/manipulations, etc.) and we decided to head out to the park and become the first synth-pop buskers ever.</p>



<p>We painted our faces with black-light paint, loaded up a battery-powered synthesizer, midi controller, microphone, boombox, and a bookshelf to put it all on and we went out into the park on a Monday evening and played weird synth-pop songs to people walking home from work.</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/park-show.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="567" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/park-show.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6955" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/park-show.jpg 700w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/park-show-300x243.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></figure></div>
		


<p>It was ridiculous and as we were getting ready to do it, I thought to myself, &#8220;What the hell are we doing?  This is crazy.  We can&#8217;t do this.&#8221;</p>



<p>But then I thought, <em>there are two possible worlds&#8230;one where we do this and one where we don&#8217;t.  Which world would I rather live in?</em></p>



<p>Well, I knew what the world was like where we didn&#8217;t do it because that was the world I&#8217;ve always lived in.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know what the world is like where we did it but I really want to find out.</p>



<p>So we did it, it was a lot of fun, and we actually got an offer to play a Scottish music festival because of it!</p>



<p>During the show, someone slipped me a piece of paper with his email address on it and when I emailed him, he asked if we wanted to play the 2018 <a href="https://www.kelburngardenparty.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kelburn Garden Party</a>.</p>



<p>Sadly my brother had to go back to the States before the festival, so we couldn&#8217;t do it, but hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to once COVID gets taken care of.</p>



<p>Just shows what can happen when you put yourself out there!</p>



<p>So now, whenever I&#8217;m apprehensive about publishing or doing something new, I always think about those two worlds and I always choose the world where I do it.  And so far, I&#8217;ve never regretted it.</p>



<h2>How About You?</h2>



<p>Theodore Roosevelt once said, &#8220;Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.&#8221;</p>



<p>I agree.</p>



<p>So what are you going to work on? What are you going to try to master?  What do you plan to focus on over the next 5+ years?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Today, I&#8217;m happy to feature a guest post from Spencer of <a href="https://militarymoneymanual.com/">MilitaryMoneyManual.com</a>.  For members of the military who want to achieve FI, this post is for you!  Take it away, Spencer&#8230;</em></p>



<p>If you serve in the US military, you live in a unique financial ecosystem that enables you to rapidly achieve financial independence. As a Mad Fientist reader, you are probably interested in <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/category/tax-avoidance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax minimization</a>, <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/category/travel-hacking/">travel card maximizing</a>, and <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/category/investing/">investing for early financial independence</a>.</p>



<p>You can do all of these things in the military and usually quicker than your civilian peers. Here are three unique techniques for military FIRE:</p>



<ul><li>Combat zone tax hacking</li><li>Maximizing your military investment opportunities while you serve</li><li>Annual fee waived travel reward credit cards</li></ul>



<p>Military service provides a structure to achieve financial freedom. Military life can naturally promote frugality, independence, and self-motivation. Health care is not a concern and the amenities on base like a gym, grocery store, and gas station keep costs low. Whether deployed to the Middle East or on a submarine, it can be hard to spend any money for months at a time.</p>



<p>Many troops make the mistake of spending all of their money as quickly as they can when they return from deployment. The stereotype of the young soldier with the Dodge Charger with a 27% APR loan is based on real experience. However, if you make FI a priority, you will find military life conducive to achieving your financial freedom.</p>



<p>By using the techniques the Mad Fientist talks about on this site, you can achieve FI well before your military pension at 20 years. The principles of FI are the same whether you are a civilian or a servicemember: spend less than you earn and invest the difference.</p>



<p>The fastest option initially is to lower your expenses. Then you can focus on increasing your income over time, while continuing to keep your expenses low. The more you increase your savings rate, the faster you will reach FI.</p>



<p>Commissioning as a military officer definitely helps, but enlisted troops can achieve FI as well. If you happen to find a partner in the military, dual military couples are well compensated. For instance, a dual military officer couple stationed in Hawaii after 10 years of service would make a household income $250,000 per year in 2020 if they lived off base.</p>



<h2>Tax Hacking on Combat Deployments</h2>



<p>By far one of the best ways to accelerate your journey to FIRE is to volunteer for an overseas tour or a combat zone deployment.</p>



<p>You can drop your expenses to zero and increase your income substantially. Deployed troops get free health care, food, gym, lodging, internet, and just about everything else. You can store your vehicle and reduce your insurance, freeze your cell phone plan, and cancel your subscription services.</p>



<p>On a few of my deployments my wife moved to be closer with her family and we rented out our apartment on AirBnB. This paid the mortgage while I was gone. Get creative and see how frugal you can live on a deployment. Save your deployment income to spend when you are reunited with your loved ones.</p>



<p>On a combat deployment, you receive the advantage of tax-free income. This is known as CZTE or Combat Zone Tax Exclusion. Combat zones are designated by the President and IRS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s an <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/combat-zones" rel="nofollow">updated list from the IRS</a>. Notice that you don’t need to be shooting it out in the streets of Baghdad to earn tax free pay. For instance, I lived for 2 years in the United Arab Emirates, one of the richest and safest countries in the world. While there I received 24 months of tax free pay. Even Kosovo, Albania, and the Adriatic Sea are still listed as combat zones, an anachronism from 1999.</p>



<p>Combat zone tax free pay can take the Mad Fientist’s <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/category/tax-avoidance/">tax avoidance strategies</a> to the extreme. Optimally you should stuff your and your spouse’s Roth IRA and Roth TSP full of untaxed income. Tax free income provides a triple whammy: the contributions go in untaxed, grow untaxed, and withdraw untaxed after age 59.5.</p>



<p>After you have maxed out your tax advantaged retirement space, put the tax free income into a taxable brokerage account. Now you will only pay long term capital gains tax on the money if you sell the assets after 1 year.</p>



<p>The TSP or Thrift Savings Plan is the military’s 401k plan. It has a Roth and Traditional option. When your tax rate is 0% on deployment, it makes sense to get that money into your Roth accounts!</p>



<p>An even more advanced strategy while on a longer deployment is to convert some or all of your Traditional IRA money to Roth IRA. While this is normally a taxable event, your taxable income for a year with a deployment in it may be $0 or close to it.</p>



<p>That leaves over $24,000 of deduction space that you could use to <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/">convert your Traditional IRA to Roth IRA</a> and pay no taxes on the conversion. Now you successfully locked that money away tax free for life. I use <a href="http://www.moneychimp.com/features/tax_calculator.htm" rel="nofollow">MoneyChimp’s Tax Calculator</a> to help me with my tax plan.</p>



<p>One other deployed investment you need to use is the SDP or Savings Deposit Program. This is a US government savings account that pays 10% interest on all money deposited up to $10,000. If you fill it up early in your deployment, you can grow it to $11,000 after a year.</p>



<p>This is a great place to park your emergency fund, as the money can be withdrawn in less than a week and it gets an interest rate 100x better than what most banks offer.</p>



<h2>Investing While Serving in the Military</h2>



<p>The number one place to start investing when in the military is the Thrift Savings Plan or TSP. The TSP offers only five index fund investments covering the S&amp;P 500, small cap US stocks, stocks from the largest markets outside the US, and a corporate and government bond fund. The expense ratios are as low or lower than comparable Vanguard funds.</p>



<p>By combining C Fund (S&amp;P 500) with the S Fund (the other 2500 US stocks not in the S&amp;P 500) you can build your own Total US Stock Market Fund, like VTSAX. If you are not sure how to <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/my-portfolio/">build your own asset allocation</a>, the TSP Lifecycle Funds are the way to go.</p>



<p>The L 2065 fund is 99% stocks in 2020 and will slowly move to more bonds over your lifetime. That’s plenty of time for you to read and understand more about constructing your own asset allocation plan. You might even decide that just setting it and forgetting it in a target date fund is the right way to go. Plenty of investors become millionaires that way.</p>



<p>Even when you are not deployed, military tax rates are incredibly low since much of your income is paid in the form of untaxed allowances. For instance, if you live off base you receive Basic Allowance for Housing, or BAH. In Hawaii, a married officer with 10 years of service can make nearly $4000 per month just from BAH.</p>



<p>Since military tax rates are so low, it usually makes sense to contribute to your Roth TSP and Roth IRA early in your career. As you promote up the ranks, make more money and deploy less often, switching to Traditional contributions can make sense when your income trips over the 24% bracket.</p>



<h2>Fee Waived Travel Rewards Credit Cards</h2>



<p>Military travel hackers have a cheat code that civilians do not: they do not need to pay annual fees on their travel cards. This is thanks to 2 laws: SCRA and MLA.</p>



<p>Because of these 2 laws, military servicemembers, and their civilian spouses, can get all personal Chase and American Express cards without an annual fee. A few other banks also waive fees but these two are the big ones with the best travel rewards credit cards.</p>



<p>SCRA stands for Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and is applied to credit accounts opened before active duty service. MLA is Military Lending Act and applies to accounts opened after active duty service started.</p>



<p>SCRA caps your maximum interest rate at 6%. MLA caps your interest rate at 36% but this is inclusive of annual fees.</p>



<p>For example, if a card has a $550 annual fee, and you only put $1000 of spending on it in a year, that is calculated as a 55% interest rate under MLA. The banks are not interested in getting slapped with huge fines and fees from government enforcement agencies, so they just waive annual fees on their cards for military troops and their spouses.</p>



<p>Thanks to the MLA, military families can open <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/to-travel-cards/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">travel reward credit cards</a> on active duty and pay no annual fees. They can get the best premium travel rewards credit cards with airport lounge access, free annual hotel nights, upgrades to Diamond status, travel credits, restaurant credits, etc. This is the best military discount I ever saw!</p>



<p>The <a href="https://militarymoneymanual.com/american-express-waives-all-card-holder-fees-for-active-duty-military/">Amex Platinum military</a> benefits have been well known in the military community for several years, but the <a href="https://cards.madfientist.com/cards/74" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Chase Sapphire Reserve</a> is arguably an even better deal for servicemembers. The CSR offers a $300 annual travel credit and much wider global acceptance because it is a Visa card. Amex is not as widely as accepted outside the US and Japan.</p>



<p>Let’s assume a military couple each opened a Chase Sapphire Reserve, Amex Platinum, and Amex Hilton Honors Aspire card. The welcome bonuses alone are worth thousands on these three cards. And you can double the bonuses because you and your spouse can both open an account with the fees waived.</p>



<p>Better yet, you can refer your spouse for his or her own card and earn a referral bonus. Annually, you receive the following benefits from your and your spouses six cards (as of December 11, 2020):</p>



<ul><li>$400 Uber or Uber Eats credit ($30 per month, $70 in December)</li><li>$900 annual airline fee credit</li><li>$500 credit at Hilton hotels and resorts</li><li>$600 travel credit</li><li>2 free weekend nights at Hilton</li></ul>

<p>Last year, I conducted an <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.madfientist.com/scott-young-interview/" target="_blank">experiment in Ultralearning</a> that I hoped would help me achieve a lifelong dream of mine of writing and releasing an album.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m happy to say it was far more successful than I ever imagined it would be!</p>



<p><em>If you don&#8217;t know what the Ultralearning Experiment is, check out the experiment&#8217;s <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/ultralearning-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homepage</a> to learn all about it.</em></p>



<p>As I mentioned in the initial <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.madfientist.com/scott-young-interview/" target="_blank">Ultralearning podcast episode</a>, the hope for the 3-month experiment was that it would accelerate my progress towards my goal and make the process more enjoyable.</p>



<p>Well, it did all that and more&#8230;</p>



<p>I ended up finishing a song during that 3-month experiment and I can&#8217;t believe it but I just <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/album/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released that single</a> today!</p>



<p>Not only did I write a song during the experiment, I continued writing music since then and I now have enough material for an album!</p>

<p>Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought this experiment would help me make so much progress but it has!</p>



<p>In today&#8217;s podcast episode, I go through everything I learned and explain why the Ultralearning Experiment helped me push past the self-doubt and self-destructive habits that have plagued me in the past.  </p>



<p>I also describe the new routines the experiment helped me develop and why those new habits have allowed me accomplish more than I ever have before:</p>

<h2>Full Transcript</h2>



<div class="transcript"><strong>Mad Fientist: </strong>Hey, what&#8217;s up, everybody? Welcome to the Financial Independence Podcast. <br><br>Today&#8217;s episode is the single most terrifying and exciting episode I&#8217;ve ever released. And I will get to why in a second, but if you remember back in September, I shared with you my lifelong goal of releasing an album and really that&#8217;s the whole reason I wanted to achieve financial independence, because I thought that work was the one thing that was holding me back, which it wasn&#8217;t. <br><br>And I&#8217;ve talked about that in that article, The Best and Worst Thing About FI, which I&#8217;ll link to in the show notes, if you haven&#8217;t read that yet. <br><br>So I shared that goal with you back in September. And then in October, I released an episode with Scott Young, who is the author of Ultralearning and I sat down with him and sort of put together an ultralearning experiment for my music project. And I thought that would be a really good way to kick off the project in a way that&#8217;s a lot more focused than I had been in previous years.<br><br>So even though I left my job back in 2016, I wasn&#8217;t really making as much progress as I had hoped. And I&#8217;ll talk about why that was today and how I overcame those things that were blocking me. But I figured if I could sit and do a ultralearning experiment over three months and really focus then I had hoped that that would sort of make me progress more than I had in the past.<br><br>In the episode I talked about, you know, I felt like I was going five miles per hour and I wasn&#8217;t even sure if I was pointing in the right direction, I felt like I was in the dark and yeah, I was moving around, but I didn&#8217;t know if I was actually making progress. And I thought that if I spend three months on this ultralearning experiment, hopefully by the end of it, I&#8217;ll be going 15 miles per hour, so I can feel the breeze in my face and enjoy the journey a little bit more and I&#8217;ll know that I&#8217;m pointing in the right direction. <br><br>So that was the whole goal of it. And I have to say it exceeded all expectations. And that&#8217;s why today is the most terrifying and exciting day. I have just released my first single and I am planning to release an album on January 22nd, 2021.<br><br>I honestly can&#8217;t really believe it. And I&#8217;m so excited to share with you how it came about and what worked and how the ultralearning experiment allowed me to get over some of the hurdles I wasn&#8217;t able to get over before and all the things I learned along the way, because it&#8217;s been probably the most difficult thing I&#8217;ve done in my life, but it&#8217;s also been one of the most rewarding as well.<br><br>And now here I am. in this place where I feel like I&#8217;m really doing what I wanted to do and it&#8217;s been fantastic. So before we get into the episode, if you want to go listen to the first single I released, which is actually the song that I wrote during the actual ultralearning experiment, you can go to  madfientist.com/album and from there you can preorder the album. <br><br>And once you do that, you&#8217;ll be sent an email immediately with links to the single and everything. I&#8217;m not going to be sharing any of the music project on Mad Fientist itself, because I want to keep those two things separate because I feel like the music project is going to just keep getting weirder and weirder from here on out so, you know, keeping that away from my respectable, Mad Fientist persona is probably a good idea. <br><br>So that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m just going to keep it separate so if you go to that page, there&#8217;s a buy button. It&#8217;s five bucks for the album and you can preorder it and it will be released in January, but that&#8217;ll put you on a special email list where I&#8217;ll send you this single and then a bunch of future stuff I have planned for everybody that downloaded the album. <br><br>So if you do do that, thank you so much. You are literally making my dream come true, which is amazing. So I appreciate it in advance.<br><br>Before I get into what I learned from the ultralearning experiment, I&#8217;ll give you a quick recap on what that actually was. So if you haven&#8217;t listened to that episode yet, I definitely recommended it. It is episode 55. So if you go to  madfientist.com/episode55 it&#8217;ll take you right to the show notes for that page. And in that episode I talked to Scott Young about his concept of ultralearning.<br><br>In his book, he states that your deepest moments of happiness don&#8217;t come from doing easy things. They come from realizing your potential and overcoming your own limiting beliefs about yourself. And he says that ultralearning offers a path to master the things that will bring you deep satisfaction and self confidence.<br><br>So I definitely recommend you check out the book and that episode, and especially the episode, just because we went through and sort of developed my ultralearning plan. <br><br>And I&#8217;ll give you a quick summary of it so that you don&#8217;t have to go and listen to it right away. But I definitely suggest you listen to it after if you haven&#8217;t already.<br><br>So we went through and decided that last September, 2019, I would spend September, October and November focused solely on this ultralearning experiment. And like I said before, I wanted to sort of just make sure I was going in the right direction and pick up a little speed so that I&#8217;d actually enjoy the journey because prior to the ultralearning experiment, it was like pulling teeth, actually sitting down to do music.<br><br>And I think that was a lot of, it was psychological. I felt like I couldn&#8217;t do it. And I was worried that trying would make me realize that I couldn&#8217;t do it. So I would procrastinate a lot. I would always find something else to do. And it was just pretty awful. I didn&#8217;t enjoy the process. I didn&#8217;t enjoy any of it.<br><br>And it was just a constant reminder that the thing that I wanted to do most is something that I wasn&#8217;t able to do. So I hoped the ultralearning experiment would help me get over that. And thankfully it has, which is definitely one of the biggest benefits of it because now it&#8217;s a whole different world.<br><br>I enjoy the process. And actually today, I had to not do any music because I&#8217;d been planning to record this episode but each morning I start with music and then I&#8217;ve been getting so sucked into the whole music thing that I don&#8217;t have time to record this episode. So today I had to not do music so that I could actually record this episode.<br><br>And that&#8217;s just 180 degrees from where I was back in August of last year, where you know, I would do anything else, but music, because that was the hardest thing I had to do all day. So that&#8217;s really the gist of my ultralearning project. And I had hoped, as I said, to just feel like I was moving in the right direction and enjoying the journey more.<br><br>And in the back of my mind, I&#8217;d secretly hoped that I could write a song that I&#8217;d be proud of during that time. But I didn&#8217;t believe that I would, because I had never been able to do that in the past. So the fact that I was able to do that and now I&#8217;m releasing that to you today is just mind blowing to me.<br><br>And I can&#8217;t believe that I&#8217;ve written many songs after that. So, this really was a turning point in my journey. <br><br>Anyway, that&#8217;s enough introduction so let&#8217;s dive into some of the most impactful changes that I made, how they impacted my progress, and what I learned from this whole thing.<br><br>The first big change I made was that I removed all distractions. That&#8217;s something that I always had trouble with before is that I would always find something else to do that wasn&#8217;t writing music and it would feel productive because whatever I would do would be a productive thing. It would be another task, something other than music. But it would be productive procrastination. So it was easier to justify. And with the ultralearning experiment, I blocked off three months and I said, I&#8217;m not doing anything else. And that was big because that meant I didn&#8217;t work on Mad Fientists. There wasn&#8217;t a Mad Fientist thing that I could work on that would make me feel productive, even though it wasn&#8217;t what I was meant to be doing.<br><br>So focusing solely on this ultralearning project was really important. And I also used this as an opportunity to follow Cal Newport&#8217;s advice. If you remember, I interviewed Cal back in episode 52, and he talked about the importance of deep work and also removing your digital distractions from your life.<br><br>So in that episode, he talked about his digital decluttering, where you just sort of remove all of your digital inputs and then only add back in the ones that are really important to you. So I did that and I realized how frazzled my mind was all the time. I was always looking for that dopamine hit of Twitter or news or anything online that I would normally just browse mindlessly and take up a huge chunk of my day.<br><br>And I cut all that stuff out. And that was important because it let my brain get back into a normal state where it wasn&#8217;t like a junkie looking for a hit all the time. It was calmer and more focused and that made a big difference too. <br><br>So in the morning when I was about to do music, I would shut my email down.<br><br>And that way, if I got into a good flow state, when I was doing the music stuff, I wouldn&#8217;t get taken out of that by some random email that came in and I would limit my social media and news reading and Twitter and all that sort of stuff until in the evening time, when I had already exhausted all of my willpower on the music stuff.<br><br>So I&#8217;m starting with this tip because that was just a way to get your brain into a state where you can actually do better things. So if you haven&#8217;t checked out Cal&#8217;s episode yet definitely recommend it. It is at madfientist.com/episode52. And this digital decluttering is something that you should really revisit a lot because I, myself find that I fall back into the same bad habits.<br><br>One thing that&#8217;s been helpful recently is I have a Mac and there&#8217;s something called Screen Time where you can go in and you can limit the amount of hours or minutes that you spend on certain sites, using certain apps, things like that. And recently I&#8217;ve had to go in there and actually limit the amount of Twitter I can access, or news and things like that because I found myself just slowly slipping back into these bad habits where you&#8217;re, I just felt my brain getting to that state again, where I couldn&#8217;t actually focus because I was just always looking for the next story to read or the next article to read.<br><br>This is something I&#8217;m still struggling with, but keep revisiting, because I have seen the benefits of, you know, getting a handle on the mindless internet browsing all the time.<br><br>The next biggest thing that worked for me is a concept I picked up from another past podcast guest, James Clear. I interviewed James back in episode 48. So if you want to listen to that episode, just go to madfientist.com/episode48. And in that episode, we talked about his book Atomic Habits, which if you haven&#8217;t read it yet, and you are interested in developing better habits, I can&#8217;t recommend it more highly.<br><br>It is one of the most actionable books I&#8217;ve ever read. It&#8217;s really engaging. It all makes sense and is very effective. So one of the topics that he discusses in that book is called habit stacking. So, you know, we&#8217;re all human. We all have habits that we already have. So it&#8217;s much easier to stack a different habit on top of a existing habit than it is to just try to create a new habit from scratch.<br><br>So to give you an example of how important this was for me, like I said before, I would procrastinate all day and I knew I needed to write music, but I would always find something else to do. So my whole day would be feeling guilty that I wasn&#8217;t doing my main task for the day. And I would put it off until the end of the day.<br><br>And by the end of the day, I had lost all of my willpower, all of my motivation, all of my confidence. And by then I would just be like, Oh, I&#8217;ll just do it tomorrow. And that&#8217;s why I never got anything done because I would constantly just be putting it off. And yeah, I&#8217;ve listened to podcasts and I&#8217;ve read books and everybody says, do your most important thing first, but when your most important thing is your hardest thing, it&#8217;s very difficult to roll out of bed and be like, okay, I&#8217;m going to tackle my hardest thing of the day. <br><br>So here&#8217;s how habit stacking came into play for me. One of my most enjoyable things in the morning is making my cup of coffee. I have a pour over coffee and it&#8217;s sorta just like a relaxing ritual where I make coffee and it smells great.<br><br>And then I get to enjoy this amazing cup of coffee afterwards. So that was already an established habit and one that I was not going to break because it&#8217;s such an enjoyable habit. And it was the first thing I did in the morning. So, what I did for this ultralearning experiment is I said, okay, that&#8217;s my established habit and I&#8217;m gonna stack music on top of that. <br><br>So I did not allow myself to drink coffee anywhere else in the house. I had to sit at my synthesizers and keyboards and all my musical instruments. At the desk. And I had to do music when I was drinking my coffee and that changed everything that meant that no matter what I was going to get some music.  And even if I only did five or 10 minutes, I would get it in because I was drinking my coffee and I would be doing music during that coffee drinking. And it just made my whole day so much better because it wasn&#8217;t the day of like frustration and guilt instead. It was like, Oh, I already did my most important thing today.<br><br>And now I can do whatever I want after it. And it was a lot easier to do that since I stacked it on top of the coffee habit, because then I just got so preprogrammed. I was just like a robot. As soon as I would finish making the coffee, I would just go and sit at this desk that I would never have normally sat at when I was drinking my coffee.<br><br>Another thing that&#8217;s been very helpful is the idea of immersion. So I realized that one of my big issues is that my identity is tied to math and science so much that that&#8217;s what makes me feel like I can&#8217;t do anything artistic. Like I&#8217;ve always been a math and science guy. I&#8217;ve always been good at math growing up.<br><br>I was a computer science major and I was a computer software developer for my career. And I&#8217;ve always just been that side of the brain. And I&#8217;ve always told myself that artists are different. So for this ultralearning experiment, I decided to completely immerse myself in music and that meant cutting out everything else.<br><br>So I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve noticed, but you know, I haven&#8217;t really been active in the FI space very much. <br><br>I haven&#8217;t been going to FIRE conferences. I haven&#8217;t been speaking anywhere as the Mad Fientist. I haven&#8217;t been doing much of that at all. And the reason for that is because I was like, I&#8217;m going to try to just change my perception of myself and change my identity by fully immersing myself in the music world. So instead of going to FinCon like I had in years past, I went to  MoogFest, which is a synthesizer conference, and I went to a lot more concerts. I started hanging out with more musicians.<br><br>I started following the musicians on Twitter instead of financial writers. I spent my free time reading articles about synthesizers instead of financial topics. And, it actually worked. It&#8217;s very surprising to me that it worked, but it sort of made me feel like I was in that world. And the more I felt like I belonged in that world, the more confidence I had to do, what people in that world do, which is write music and perform music. <br><br>And that&#8217;s something the ultralearning experiment gave me because I&#8217;d dedicated three months to it. And I cleared my schedule. I cleared my non-musical tasks and I was able to really just focus and immerse myself in the world of music.<br><br>And it was the same with books. Like all the books I got out of the library at that time were all music books. And I feel like it did trick my brain into thinking, Hey, actually, this guy&#8217;s a musician. That&#8217;s all he does all he does his music. So he&#8217;s a musician.  He&#8217;s in this world, so sure he can do it.<br><br>And that was actually a really big deal.<br><br>Once I got into the ultralearning experiment. One of the main things that kept driving me forward was the time tracking. So before I started, I created a spreadsheet where each of the columns had a task at the top of it. And then each row was a day. And all I would do is just fill in the number of minutes I spent doing those tasks and I would just keep track of how many minutes a day I was doing on each of those tasks. And at the end of the month, I could tell it up and see how many hours I was putting in for the month. <br><br>And like I said before, I was trying to aim for 25 hours a week. And the way I ordered the columns is I put the most direct activities, like writing songs is what I wanted to do so that was the most impactful, direct activity I could do. And then I just put it&#8217;s less direct activities to the right of that. So the goal was first to just put the hours. And so that was the primary target was just to hit my hours for the month.<br><br>But also I wanted to make as many of those hours to be on the left side of the spreadsheet. So in the show notes for this episode, which is episode 59, I&#8217;ll put a screenshot of my spreadsheet that I used, but that was actually really important because after a few hours of working hard, I would lose motivation and I could have easily found something nonproductive to do at that time.<br><br>But the fact that I was trying to hit these certain number of hours would mean that, I would bring up my spreadsheet and be like, okay, I can&#8217;t write any more songs today just cause I just can&#8217;t take it anymore. It&#8217;s too hard. But what else could I do? So I could maybe do this software that, you know, teaching me how to better design sounds, or I could actually just watch a few YouTube videos, which even though that&#8217;s passive learning it&#8217;s that was like my last resort. If I had lost all willpower and I needed to do something, I would watch a video about mixing. And even though that was very passive, I would still learn something and still be immersed in the music and be forcing myself to put those hours in. And at first, a lot of my time was spent doing indirect stuff because I just couldn&#8217;t face the direct stuff.<br><br>And it was really tough, but I just kept putting the hours in kept trying to do the direct stuff. And I&#8217;ll put a graph in the show notes for this episode too. And you can sort of see, see how my activity not only increased as time went on and my confidence increased, but also the directness of the activities I was doing increased as well.<br><br>I had started on lots of videos, lots of software, lots of tutorials and learning, but I gradually started funneling most of my time into the actual important thing, which is the writing of the music. So, if you want to take a project seriously, and you are stressed out about it, then focusing on putting in the hours, I think is a very good place to put your focus because it is something that you can control.<br><br>No matter how you feel, how creative you are, how much good stuff&#8217;s coming out or not. And it&#8217;s a great thing to focus on.<br><br>Another reason the ultralearning project was so beneficial is because it forced me to push through when times got tough and times got tough a lot during this process. As I mentioned before, this has been a lifelong struggle and it&#8217;s just something I felt like I couldn&#8217;t do. And I felt like I was in the dark and not really knowing where I was going so early on, obviously all of those same things were affecting me.<br><br>But since I committed to this project, I just kept putting in the hours and slowly but surely it got easier. And I started breaking through some of those mental barriers that I had. And actually this is a good time to talk about that. It is insane how the ego tries to protect itself. If you read my Best and Worst Thing About FI article, you know that the reason that I never really pursued music in my adult life is because I believe my ego was too fragile and it was trying to protect me because I&#8217;ve had this lifelong dream of releasing an album and rather than try and fail, I was just, just not doing anything because that just kept the dream alive and it kept my brain happy.<br><br>But that obviously would guarantee failure because I&#8217;m not working towards the goal. So even though it was guaranteeing failure, it was keeping the dream and the hope alive. So when I actually started working hard on this during the ultralearning experiment, it was amazing all the ways my brain tried to protect me and stop me from, you know, risking this thing of losing my dream.<br><br>Once, I guess my brain realized that I was not gonna stop doing what I was doing, then I would fall asleep at night and as I was drifting off, like my self doubt had switched from, &#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t do this&#8221; to &#8220;You&#8217;re doing this, but you&#8217;re too old to do this.&#8221; And I would just have these evenings where I was like, what am I doing?<br><br>I&#8217;m writing music. I&#8217;m in my late thirties. What, am I going to go on tour? And like live in a van and, you know, drink beer like I&#8217;m in my twenties? And then looking back on it, it seems like it was a way for my brain to like talk me out of the ultralearning experiment. Thoughts started creeping in like, do you actually want to do this?  You don&#8217;t really want to do this, this isn&#8217;t your real dream. You don&#8217;t want to be doing this and spending all your time doing this right now. <br><br>And it was just amazing that those were the things that would keep me up at night and make me struggle to fall asleep. But again, I just think it was maybe the ego trying to protect me from trying and failing.  Trying to talk myself out of actually giving it a shot.<br><br>And I know I seem like a crazy person talking about my brain like it&#8217;s not part of me, but. It, it, it did feel like it was just like somebody else in my head was trying to like, say, Oh, you don&#8217;t want to do this. You&#8217;re too old to do this. You can&#8217;t do this and all these things, but the ultralearning experiment, made me just push through all that.<br><br>And I&#8217;d wake up the next morning and do what I was meant to do. Even though you have the night before I was doubting everything about what I was doing. So, not only did it help me push through some of the mental blocks that I had, but it also forced me to push through some of the actual activities that I was struggling with.<br><br>So about halfway through the experiment, I came up with a song idea, which ended up being the first single that I released today. And it was great. I was so excited. I was like, wow, I can&#8217;t believe this. This is actually maybe something that could turn into a song I&#8217;d be happy to release.<br><br>And then came lyric writing and I thought, Hey, I&#8217;m a writer. I write all the time. I&#8217;m sure I can write lyrics. <br><br>And I went up to one of the local bars to have a beer while I was writing my lyrics. And it was so hard. It was just this whole other world of writing that I just said never practiced. And I would have definitely quit because it was like, so soul destroying, trying to do it.<br><br>And I struggled so much and I tried to do it another day and just completely struggled. And I would have definitely just scrapped it and either made it an instrumental or just given up completelt. <br><br>But again, because I had to put in the hours I pushed through and wrote some lyrics and I got it done and it was the same with vocals.  So I had the lyrics. And then I started thinking about singing them, which I don&#8217;t want to be a singer, but I am doing this on my own over here. So I was like, well, I guess I&#8217;m gonna have to sing it. So I tried singing it. I absolutely hated the sound of it. And again, I would have quit. I would have had this been five years ago.  I would have scrapped it, scrapped the whole idea of the song and quit. But again, since I was forced to put in the hours and I wanted to get this done, I just pushed through. And my temporary solution was to just use a vocoder so that I sounded more like a robot and less like me. And, the final mix that I&#8217;ll put on the album is actually less vocoded than some of the earlier mixes.<br><br>But again, I just had to find solutions to the problems and the ultralearning experiment was great for that because I had to fill a lot of hours and you might as well find solutions when you&#8217;re putting in that many hours. So that was really beneficial. <br><br>This is the lesson about creativity that didn&#8217;t come out of ultralearning itself, but it came out of the months I spent trying to produce something from scratch and it is actually a Mad Fientist reader named Barb who put me onto this podcast. <br><br>When I mentioned that this was my goal, she reached out to me in a comment on one of my posts and said, Hey, if you&#8217;re trying to write music, then maybe the Creative Pep Talk podcast will be helpful to you. And one episode in particular was extremely helpful. So I&#8217;ll link to this in the show notes, but it was an episode on how to find your style. <br><br>So when I started trying to write music, I thought that I had to be the most unique, original thing in the world. Like. I&#8217;m not going to use your normal scales.  I&#8217;ll just create my own notes and scales and chords, and it&#8217;s just going to blow your mind. But the more I&#8217;ve learned about writing music, that would be awful to write a song like that because our ears are so used to hearing certain things, chord progressions, and certain notes with certain chords.  To think that I had to come up with like all original stuff is just insane because that would just result in terrible music that nobody would like, including myself.<br><br>So that&#8217;s always been a struggle, like, I need to be really unique and interesting. And that&#8217;s what creativity is. It&#8217;s like reinventing the wheel and it&#8217;s really not that. So this podcast was incredibly helpful because what he talks about in it is that, we&#8217;re unique people and our influences are unique.<br><br>So we&#8217;re unique, so are our influences. So if you just follow your instincts and follow what you like, it&#8217;s going to come out unique because you&#8217;re going to take some things from this genre or some things from this band, and you&#8217;re going to combine it in this way that nobody else has combined it in that way before, because you know, they haven&#8217;t had the same influences you have.<br><br>So that freed me up mentally to be less stressed for sitting down and coming up with something really unique. And instead it just allowed me to experiment more and be like, Oh, I like that sound. I&#8217;ll use that. And then combine that with something else. And as long as I&#8217;m liking it, as I&#8217;m going along, then hopefully at the end of it, it&#8217;s going to be something good that I like, which is what the whole goal is because I can&#8217;t control what other people like. So it&#8217;s just, if I like it, and if it&#8217;s good enough for me to release, then that&#8217;s success to me. And that was huge. <br><br>So I definitely recommend you checking out that podcast episode. <br><br>And in that actual episode, he talks about something that Ira Glass said, which was also a really helpful in making me less stressed about not being where I want to be at this stage.<br><br>And that was that, people who create stuff get into it because they&#8217;re big fans of that medium. So for him, it&#8217;s, you know, creating radio broadcasts and telling stories. And for me, it&#8217;s writing songs and listening to songs. And the reason we get into these things is because we love, for me music or for him storytelling.<br><br>So we have good tastes and we know what sounds good and we know what looks good. And then we can tell good from bad. And it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re such big fans that we just know what we like, we know what&#8217;s interesting to us. So. You get into something because you want to create something as good as the stuff that you love so much, but the problem is your skills aren&#8217;t there yet.<br><br>So there&#8217;s a gap. There&#8217;s a gap between what you&#8217;re creating and what you know to be good. And he says that, you know, a lot of people never cross that gap because it&#8217;s it&#8217;s soul destroying. Like I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve been in the other side of that gap for all of my life and anything that I tried to create, wasn&#8217;t up to the standards that I was used to because I was comparing it to, you know, the finished works of some amazing artists that have been working at their craft for 30 years or so.<br><br>So I was always comparing my stuff to that and was obviously never even close. And what he says is, is that. If you can just keep working eventually you&#8217;re going to cross that gap and yeah, you&#8217;ll never maybe feel like you&#8217;re totally in the same league as some of your heroes, but you&#8217;re going to get closer and closer over time.<br><br>The more you work at it, and it&#8217;s a natural process to feel like you&#8217;re, there&#8217;s a huge gaping chasm between you and what you want to be. And that&#8217;s because you have good taste and that&#8217;s because you know what you like, and, to go back to the Creative Pep Talk podcast that I was mentioning, you can embrace those influences.<br><br>And yet you realize that you&#8217;re not there yet, but embrace it and draw from it and take inspiration from this band and take other inspiration from this other artist. And you can use that to create your own style. And again, maybe realize that you&#8217;re never going to be where you want to be because you just hold your idols up to a standard that you may never feel like your reach, but striving for that, and using those influences is going to hopefully get you over the gap that Ira Glass talks about.  And on the other side of the gap, also helps you develop your own style and your own uniqueness that will then maybe make somebody else look up to you and what you&#8217;ve done over the years.<br><br>So I will link to that Creative Pep Talk podcast and also the Ira Glass video, where he talks about the gap, because both are worth listening to or watching. <br><br>The next thing I learned from all of this is the importance of making it real. And this is actually a weird one, but it has been way more helpful than I expected.<br><br>So I already talked a little bit about sort of changing your identity and. One good way of making that identity shift is to make the project that you&#8217;re working on even more real. <br><br>So years ago, I got a logo designed for my band and big thanks to Jason out there for working with me on that. And this seemed at the time to be an insane thing to do because I had never written a song.<br><br>And yet here I was getting a logo designed for a band that doesn&#8217;t exist. And, I did the same thing with a website. I, I registered a domain. Actually, hold on, I&#8217;m going to go check and see when I registered it and come back. <br><br>Wow, so I just found out I registered the domain way back in 2010. So 10 years ago, I registered a domain for a band that I had not yet started and had never written a song before.<br><br>It is a four-character .com domain, so I&#8217;m definitely glad I got it when I did, but still 10 years is a long time. And so when I was doing these things, they seemed crazy at the time, but I realized they were really beneficial because they made the project real and I could see it was something to grab onto, even though I was struggling with the actual process of writing the songs that would then be on the album that would then be promoted on the website. <br><br>It made the project real and having a logo to look at and having social media accounts for this fake band that didn&#8217;t exist actually made it real and sort of helped change my mindset about it. From, I can&#8217;t do this to, Oh, actually I am doing this.  <br><br>And I did the same thing with songs I&#8217;ve over the last year or so. I was just collecting song title ideas in an Evernote. And that also seemed crazy at the time too, because I&#8217;d never written a song that I actually liked enough that I would think about releasing. So what&#8217;s the point of having all these song names when I can&#8217;t write music, but that became so useful over the last few months, because I have written a bunch of songs. And now I have all these song names which have then inspired a bunch of lyrics. So all of these crazy things that I did over the years to make this project more real are now coming in handy and are making these other tasks that I need to do much easier. <br><br>So this list of song names is now inspiring lyrics and making the lyric writing a lot easier. And now that I actually do have music to release, I already have a website. I already have a logo. And all of these things that I put together in the years past helped lead to this.<br><br>This one is actually money related and I have to thank Ramit Sethi for inspiring this one. And Ramit was also on the podcast. He was episode number 53, and he inspired me to be less cheap when it comes to things that are really important to me, which, it turned out to be a huge blessing for this project.<br><br>So like I said before, anything could have stopped me. I always had an excuse. There was always something better to do. There was always some reason that I couldn&#8217;t sit down and write music and had I not invested in some really good gear. I think that could have stopped me from progressing as fast as I did.<br><br>So, for example, this microphone that I&#8217;m talking to you on is a Shure SM7b, and it&#8217;s pretty expensive. It&#8217;s like 400 bucks, but I&#8217;ve been using it for this podcast for awhile and it&#8217;s been great. But the reason I bought it is because it&#8217;s also a great vocal microphone. So when I was trying to record vocals for some of these songs that I&#8217;ve written and was not happy with how it sounded had I not had this microphone and instead had a cheap microphone, I would have blamed the microphone and then would have just moved on to something else rather than try to actually make the vocal sound good using the microphone that I had. <br><br>And this SM7b is based on the SM7 microphone, which is what Michael Jackson used to record Thriller.<br><br>So it&#8217;s like, if I can&#8217;t make my vocal sound good, then it&#8217;s obviously something with how I&#8217;m processing them or how I&#8217;m singing them and it&#8217;s not the microphone because obviously that record sounded amazing. So Ramit inspired me to not be so cheap with everything which came at a great time because I&#8217;ve since had to buy some gear to set up my home recording studio and rather than go for the cheapest option, I&#8217;ve gone for the cheapest, really high quality option.<br><br>Having good gear to rely on has taken away all my excuses of why this doesn&#8217;t sound the way I needed to. And instead put it on myself to get better at what I&#8217;m doing. And I haven&#8217;t had an easy scapegoat to blame for things, not sounding the way I want them to. <br><br>So my advice to you is to follow a Ramit&#8217;s advice.  If this is something that&#8217;s really important to you, like music is to me and, you know, you have money saved up, you&#8217;re not going to break the bank, then investing in high quality gear to support that hobby is well worth it, in my opinion. <br><br>And I get so much joy from using this microphone that I&#8217;m talking to now, and it is definitely worth the investment, even though it did cost a little more upfront.<br><br>So those were the main takeaways from my ultralearning experiment. And hopefully it helps you on your creative journey, whatever it is you&#8217;re trying to accomplish. Before I finish up, though, I just want to address one other thing. And that was the S curve of progress. The way he sort of described it as that, you know, when you start out, imagine yourself on a beach and you&#8217;re trying to swim out to sea.<br><br>At first it&#8217;s great. You just wade into the water and you know, it feels good having water on your feet and your ankles. And it&#8217;s nice and you think, Hey, this is great. This is going to be fun. And then, you know, you start getting a little bit deeper and then the waves start crashing into you. And it&#8217;s a struggle just to stay afloat, let alone, get out to sea.<br><br>So it&#8217;d be really easy to give up at that stage and just go back onto the sand. But, once you get past those initial breakers, then things smooth out and it gets a lot easier. And he said, that&#8217;s the same with anything creative. You know, at first you&#8217;re excited and you&#8217;re making a lot of progress and it&#8217;s fun.<br><br>And then you just hit like a brick wall and you feel like you&#8217;re not making any progress and you don&#8217;t really know how to make progress, but then all of a sudden you break through the other side and you resume your upward march and it gets a lot easier. <br><br>So he said that and I&#8217;d hoped that he was right, but I didn&#8217;t know if that would happen to me or if I was just unable to swim and I would just sink to the bottom.<br><br>I&#8217;m happy to say that, just a few weeks ago, I feel like I leveled up and it came out of nowhere. It was, you know, after lots of months of putting in the hours. And I felt like I was sort of slowly progressing during that time, but nothing big. And then just a few weeks ago, it was just like a switch flipped in my mind. And I was able to do things that I wasn&#8217;t able to do before.<br><br>And I was able to see things a lot clearer. That was incredibly exciting. So if you are out there and you are trying and you feel like you&#8217;re just not making any progress, realize that lots of connections are being formed in your brain. And lots of things are being connected and joined together. And even if you don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re making progress, things are happening, that will then hopefully level you up to a whole other place when you least expect it.<br><br>Because experiencing it for myself just a few weeks ago has really made me excited for the future, because I know that even if I feel stuck and if I feel like I&#8217;m not really doing any better than I was a month ago, I know things are happening and hopefully I&#8217;ll get another jump up in abilities that I wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise had I not put in the hours.<br><br>So again, it&#8217;s been one of the most difficult things I&#8217;ve ever done, but it&#8217;s also been one of the most rewarding and to have this big of a project to work on during these weird COVID times has been a real big blessing because I&#8217;ve just been able to focus and sort of try to block everything else out in the world.<br><br>And it&#8217;s been a great distraction and a great thing to focus on. So if you&#8217;re in the position where you have a lot more free time on your hands, because of COVID (I know the parents out there have no seconds to spare these days), but if you are in the position where COVID is opened up a lot of free time, then I would definitely recommend starting your own ultralearning experiment and seeing what happens.<br><br>Because even though this was an extremely difficult year, I can tell you that it&#8217;s more difficult not doing it because that was what I spent the rest of my adult life doing was just putting it off and procrastinating. And even though that seemed easier at the time, it really wore on me and ended up being a lot more difficult than just sitting down and getting to work.<br><br>So I highly recommend you starting your own ultralearning project and making progress on the things that are important to you. <br><br>And if you want to hear the song that came out of this ultralearning experiment for me then head to madfientist.com/album and you can preorder the album there and you&#8217;ll immediately get a link to the single.<br><br>And it&#8217;s crazy releasing this now because the lyrics talk about viruses, germs, and outbreaks and things like that. And it sounds like I wrote it for COVID, but I definitely did not. I wrote this back in 2019.<br><br>If you do preorder the album soon after this episode airs, you&#8217;ll be able to hear a synthy, electronic cover of a Sonic Youth song that I did.<br><br>Since it&#8217;s a song that I mixed and mastered myself, I&#8217;ll probably take it down and remix it for the album but it&#8217;s currently up on Spotify now so you can check that out too. <br><br>Anyway, thanks so much for listening. <br><br>I hope this was helpful and if you do buy the album and get the single, I hope you it.  This is a terrifying day for me but it&#8217;s also really exciting because it&#8217;s the start of making this project real real, instead of pretend real like I&#8217;ve been pretending for, I guess, 10 years now.<br><br>So thanks to everyone who helped along the way and big thanks to you for letting me share it with you. <br><br>Take care and I&#8217;ll speak to you again soon.</div>

<div class="transcript"><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	Hey, what’s up, everybody? Welcome to the Financial Independence Podcast, the podcast where I get inside the brains of some of the best and brightest in personal finance to find out how they achieved financial independence.<br/><br/>Today’s episode is actually a bit of a surprise. I just realized I was going to publish this a few days ago. And I’ll tell you a bit of the back story behind it.<br/><br/>Way back in 2015, I met a guy named Gouri at Camp Mustache in the Pacific Northwest. We’ve kept in touch over the years because he’s been kind enough to send me interesting articles when he comes across them. And we’ve talked about finances and things like that. And we’ve actually met up in Edinburgh when he was here visiting.<br/><br/>Anyway, I’ve got an email from a few days ago. And he had mentioned that he had interviewed Morgan Housel for a Bogleheads meeting. And I have been a big fan of Morgan for at least a couple of years now. I think Mr. 1500 from 1500days.com introduced me to him and said, “You have to read this guy because he’s one of the best Finance Redditors that I know of.” And I followed him ever since. And Mr. 1500 was right! He’s an incredible writer. He has a lot of great insights into financial topics, and even more importantly, human behavior topics and how they relate to finances.<br/><br/>So, Gouri had interviewed him for a meeting of the New York City Bogleheads Group. And he shared it with me and said that he’d be happy to introduce me if I wanted to get him on the podcast. And I listened to that interview that Gouri did… and it was fantastic! And I, of course, wanted to get Morgan on the show because I’ve been a big fan as I said. But when I listen to Gouri’s interview, I thought that his questions were exactly what I would want to ask him.<br/><br/>So, rather than just take another hour of Morgan’s time, I just asked if it would be okay to publish that interview on my podcast because it wasn’t going to be widely distributed anyway. And I think it’s really a valuable conversation that I want all of you to hear.<br/><br/>So thankfully, both Morgan and Gouri agreed. So that’s what I’m sharing with you today. <br/><br/>So, since the recording just kicks off with a question from Gouri, I’ll give you a bit of an introduction to everyone you’re going to be hearing today. Like I already mentioned, Gouri is a member of the New York City Bogleheads Group. And if you’re not familiar with Bogleheads, it’s a group of investors who adhere to Jack Bogle’s investing style of index funds and most of the things that we talk about on Mad Fientist actually. <br/><br/>Bogleheads has a forum. And if you’re interested in checking that out, I highly recommend it. It’s Bogleheads.org. And I’ll put a link in the show notes.<br/><br/>But Gouri is a member of the New York City Bogleheads. And he had reached out to Morgan to bring him to one of their virtual meetings.<br/><br/>And if you’re not familiar with Morgan Housel… he’s a writer that currently writes over at CollaborativeFund.com. And I will link to his blog in the show notes. But like I said before, he’s one of my favorite financial writers. And he just released a book called “The Psychology of Money,” which I’m extremely excited to read—I haven’t yet. And the reason for that is because I haven’t got it early. It just got released.<br/><br/>So usually, when I interview authors around a book release, the publisher will get in touch and send me an advanced copy. But since I didn’t actually interview Morgan, that didn’t happen. So I’m excited to read it just along with everybody else in the general public. But since it was just released, I haven’t done it yet. So I can’t really speak about the book, but it sounds excellent. And just like all of Morgan’s writing on finances, I am really looking forward to reading it. <br/><br/>So, I will put a link in the show notes to that as well, if you want to check that out.<br/><br/>Anyway, as for me, I am excited to introduce these two guys. And apologies for the audio quality. It sounds like Morgan was just calling in from his cell phone or something. And obviously, I wasn’t anticipating this to end up as a podcast. So apologies for not having the normal audio quality that you’re used to. But the discussion is interesting enough that I definitely think it’s worth it.<br/><br/>So, big thanks again to Morgan and Gouri for letting me do this and to the Bogleheads for letting me share their meeting presentation. And I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong>	How has CoVID challenged, affirmed and changed your beliefs, and are there new realizations and practices for you?<br/><br/><strong>Morgan Housel:</strong> 	So, two things come to mind here: one is, something I’ve always believed, it just gets so driven home this year, is that the biggest risk in any year, in any era, and I think in almost any field, the biggest risk is always what no one is talking about. <br/><br/>So, we always, as investors, as people thinking about money, think about what is the biggest risk over the next year, the next ten years. And there are events that we can think about. There’s the coming election, there’s trade wars, there’s stimulus deals, CoVID-19, when are we going to get a vaccine… all these different things that we know and we can talk about. But in any given year, it’s always the case. And I truly mean it’s always the case. In any given year, the most important story in finance is something that no one could have possibly been talking about before it happened—whether that was CoVID-19 this year. <br/><br/>You know, people have been talking about pandemics for a long time—Bill Gates gave a TED Talk in 2015 warning about basically this exact event. But the timing and the magnitude of COVID-19 is not something that anyone could have known before it happened.<br/><br/>The same is, of course, true for September 11th, Pearl Harbor, the Great Depression, JFK being assassinated… all these big, huge, monumental events that really moved the needle, when you look back, you could say, “That event is all that matters.” So to speak, those events are always the one that you could not see coming. <br/><br/>And that fact that you couldn’t see them coming is what makes them different. It’s what makes them dangerous.<br/><br/>People are very good at preparing for known risks, preparing both financially and psychologically. People care financially, getting their cash flow in order, so to speak, but they prepare psychologically, so that when it comes, even if it’s a big event, it’s not shocking. It’s not jarring to them.<br/><br/>It’s very different for something like CoVID where, for the United States at least, it seems like there was about a three- or four-day period in early March where everyone doubt it. And very quickly, what seems like virtually overnight, businesses shut down, schools shut down, airports ground to a halt. It was such a shocking event that you can really distinguish—you know, pre-March and post-March were very different worlds. <br/><br/>That was the case for September 11th. We refer to it by the date because everything changed in one day. The world, September 10th, was very different from September 12th. Everything changed that day. <br/><br/>So, that’s always the case. And that’s been re-affirmed this year. And of course, it’s going to be the case going forward. People are more attuned to financial and economic risk right now than they have been in a very long time. So, more people than ever are looking ahead saying, “What’s going to happen next? What are the biggest economic risks for the rest of the year? What are the biggest CoVID risks?” without realizing that we learned this year is that the world is surprising. And the biggest event, the most monumental stuff that moves the needle is always going to be surprising.<br/><br/>So, the biggest risk for the next year, it’s something you and I and everyone else cannot be talking about right now because, by definition, we don’t know about it.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	So, building on that, to what extent, broadly speaking, not necessarily limited to this year and this election, but including this election, to what extent do you think politics matter? And any comment on this upcoming election?<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	I think this was about 2010. I was at a conference, and I was listening to a banking lobbyist give a talk. And it was a really good talk. And he had been involved in presidential elections for, I think, 30 years at that point. And he made this quip that every single election that he had ever been involved with over those 30 years, every single election, people said, “This is the most important election of our lifetime.” And he made a joke that like, look at some point, it’s not.  At some point, it’s not the most important election of our lives. It’s just this normal path of history.<br/><br/>Of course, in 2016, I used that example prior to the election of saying, “Look, this truly is the most important election of our lifetime.” That’s what it felt like in 2016. And now, I would say it again in 2020… this is the most important election of our lifetime. It always feels that way even if you say it every single time.<br/><br/>On one hand, the long history of one party saying, “If the other party wins, the whole country is going to collapse,” is really wrong. We can see—of course, not universally—Franklin Roosevelt is, by and large, by historians, viewed as one of the great presidents of our time. I know it’s a controversial statement. But in general, among historians, it tends to be true. He was so incredibly controversial at the time, particularly in 1932 when he was elected. The number of people who really thought that this was going to usher in an era of communism or fascism that was sweeping over Europe at the time was very, very high.<br/><br/>So, there’s a long history of people saying, “If this guy wins, then all bets are off! The country’s going to collapse.” There’s a long tradition of that.<br/><br/>There’s also a long tradition of investors saying, “If this party wins on either side, then buy these stocks. Well, here’s what the stock market is going to do next.” And those series of predictions that they tend to have, the worst track record of any group of economic predictions.<br/><br/>I mean, just the recent examples… when George W. Bush won in 2000, a very common narrative that made a lot of sense was Bush was going to deregulate the banks—so buy the bank stocks, and he’s going to have a tax cut, which is going to be good for travel, so buy the airline stocks. And I’m not making fun of that narrative because it made sense at the time. That’s a reasonable narrative to make.<br/><br/>Of course, by 2008, most of the airlines were bankrupt. And most of the banks were bankrupt as well. It turned out to be the worst investing situations you could have. <br/><br/>In 2008, when Barack Obama was elected, a common narrative was buy the solar companies because there’s going to be a big push for green energy. And of course, within years, most of the solar companies themselves were bankrupt. It turned out to be one of the worst trades that you can make.<br/><br/>A lot of people in 2016, there was this general idea that if Donald Trump wins, then terrible for the economy, terrible for Trump, for whatever reason that will be, terrible for the stock market. And the stock market […] since then.<br/><br/>It’s so easy to look back at these reasonable narratives that makes sense that turned out being the exact opposite, which I think is just the case that people tend to give the president on either side, on either party, more credit and more blame than they generally deserve. <br/><br/>Now, it’s not to say that the president is not powerful. But in the list of variables that matter in the stock market and in the economy, they’re lower down on that list than most people would think.<br/><br/>So there are other variables that matter a lot more.<br/><br/>Of course, I have my political beliefs—strong, political beliefs. I have my views about where I really want this election to go. But none of those affect how I manage money… yet, at least, I would say.<br/><br/>I think one of those dangerous things that investors can do is when they have very strong political beliefs—like a lot of us do—but they let those political beliefs guide how they invest particularly in the short term. That’s when things get really dangerous. I think there are few poisons to the investing process more potent than really strong political beliefs that you mix with your investing decisions.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	So we might consider doing the opposite of whatever the pundit say.<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	If you have to make a bet, historically, that would be the better bet. The mind for most people is, if you are happy with your investing portfolio right now in September, you should be happy with it in the middle of November regardless of who wins. And if on November 4th, whatever the day after the election is, if you are trying to make huge changes to your portfolios, and you consider yourself to be a long-term investor, and you still want to make big changes to your portfolio on November 4—not to me, not for everyone, but in general—it’s increasing the odds that you’re going to make a regrettable decision down the road.<br/><br/>There’s so much history that goes against doing that and so much reason to believe that strong, political beliefs that influence your investing decisions just so often turn out wrong and regrettable. And to me, if you are a long-term investor, that means you are a long-term optimist. Now, I want to be investing for the next 20, or 30, or 40, or even 50 years. And therefore, what’s going to happen in the politics in the next four or eight years, by and large, is not going to have a tremendous impact on that. <br/><br/>Of course, you can think of situations where, because of any single president or congress or whatever it is, there is some sort of political catastrophe. There’s history of that—not just in the United States, but across the world. So it’s not black and white. But to me, the odds that I just want to let things compound in the next 30 years and not make short-term decisions based off who wins the elections are pretty overwhelming.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	Excellent! So you’re known for reading a ton of both current events and commentary as well as history. How do you separate signal from noise? And how do you, not just for reliable, existing sources, but signal from noise for new sources and opinions that differ?<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	The first thing I would say is I don’t pretend like I’m any good at it or any better than anyone else. Everyone wants to separate the signal from the noise, but we are creatures of looking up confirmation bias, and looking for things particularly when we’re talking about history examples and little nuggets that concern what we want to believe, the view of the world that we want to have.<br/><br/>So, I won’t pretend like I or anyone can do well at that. But to me, the biggest thing with history is, there’s so much to learn from history, but most of what we want to learn are not the specific event. What we want to learn about, by and large, are the really broad events that teach you how to people think about behavior. And the really big, recurring events that tend to show up at multiple different parts of history, that’s what you should pay the most attention to.<br/><br/>Jason Zweig of the Wall Street Journal had this great idea. Why do people keep making so many financial blunders? Why do we go from bubble to bubble? Why can’t people learn their lesson, so to speak? And his idea is it’s not that people don’t learn their lesson, it’s that people learn too precise a lesson.<br/><br/>So, in 2000/2001, the lesson that people learned was “don’t buy expensive [TEX] stocks.” They learned a really precise lesson. They didn’t necessarily learn about boom and bust. They just learned this very precise lesson about dot-com [TEX] box. So a lot of those people moved towards Miami condos. And then when that blew up, the precise lesson that they learned was don’t buy Miami condos. And then, they moved on to bitcoin or gold or whatever it was.<br/><br/>So, they learn these very precise lessons without the really broad takeaway that has to do with human behavior. <br/><br/>So, when I look at history, it’s not poring over data and looking for correlation about when GDP does X, the stock market does Y. That’s one version of looking at history. But for me, I’m much more interested in the really broad takeaways about how people deal with greed and fear and what-not. <br/><br/>And to me, like some of the takeaways that are important to me are a) this idea that the world breaks every five to ten years. And if you go back historically, there’s almost no exceptions to that. But every five or ten years, not exactly on that time scale, but roughly about that on average, something happens in the world where everything grinds to a halt and a lot of the assumptions that people had about how the world works break.<br/><br/>So, we’re dealing with one right now with CoVID-19, but there is also the financial crisis of 2008, September 11th, the dot-com explosion, the fall of the Soviet Union, the inflation of the 1970s and ‘80s, JFK being assassinated, the racial tensions in the 1960s, the Great Depression, World War II. It goes on and on and on.<br/><br/>There is never a period where you can go five or ten years of calm. The world is constantly breaking. And that’s really important as an investor because, once you expect that to happen as just the normal course of events, even during a period where things do really well— <br/><br/>The stock market has done extraordinarily well over the past 60 years. So you’re betting on long-term optimism. But if you spend much time in history, you have to be a short-term pessimist because there is no period in history that avoids short-term pessimism. Pessimism is that constant, never-ending chain of bad news.<br/><br/>So, if you have that as a mindset, that long-term optimism is possible even if there’s constant, never-ending chain of short-term pessimism, then it helps you get through the short-term problem, the short-term breakages. And if something like CoVID-19 occurs, to me, it is shocking, I didn’t expect it, it’s brutal, it was scary, it still is scary, but I think it’s a little bit easier to deal with particularly as an investor if you realize that, over the long course of history, this is the kind of thing that happens even in the mid- to backdrop of a really extraordinary long-term growth.<br/><br/>It’s not intuitive to think that the world can break every five or ten years. Even during a period where, the last 50 years, the stock market has increased 200-fold, it’s not intuitive… to think. We either have those many problems, those many setbacks, deep, really, structural problems during a period where you have extraordinary growth that you can take advantage of. It’s not intuitive, but that’s how history works over time.<br/><br/>So, I think those kinds of really broad behaviors, those broad takeaways about behaviors, are what people should take away from history, rather than the specific events and learning too precise a lesson from what’s happened in the past.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong>	So switching to you personally for a few minutes, you’ve mentioned that you’re working towards financial independence. I’m curious… I know you clearly love your work. You’re really good at it. You chose it. You honed your skills. How do you envision financial independence? What would you do more of or less of? And what would you give up and what would you really take on?<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	I think there’s a spectrum of financial independence, obviously. It’s not necessarily black and white. There’s that one level where if you just have a little bit of savings, you’re a little bit more independent than you were versus someone who is just solely relying on the kindness of strangers. If you are good at your job, that’s a level of independence. So there’s a big spectrum of it.<br/><br/>To me, the level that really matters is when you can, for various reasons, just wake up and virtually, any day, say, “I can do whatever I want today.” You can work really hard at a work that you’re really passionate about if you want to do that. But if you wanted to take time off, you can do that too. You want to hang out with your family, you can do that too. It’s just maintaining control over your schedule.<br/><br/>And there’s a lot of different ways to do that. That roughly falls into the FIRE framework—financial independence retire early—which is something that I like in the sense of financial independence. But “retire early” is almost this idea that you are committing yourself to not working again, which is where it gets a little rough for me because, most people, even if they have full control over what they do, most able-bodied, smart people who are underage 65 would say are going to wake up most days and say, “I want to do good work today. I want to go to work. I want to put my brain to work, put my muscles to work and be productive in society.” That’s what most people want to do. <br/><br/>But I think just as long as you can do that on your own terms, doing the projects that you like, when you want to do them, who you want to do them with, for as long as you want to do them with, and then you can stop whenever you want, that to me is the highest dividend that money paid. <br/><br/>And it’s really important because a lot of financial material stuff, which is not—this is where people get accustomed to it over time. It’s not that a fancy car or a nice house is not going to make you happy, but you tend to get accustomed to it, whereas controlling your time is something that gives most people an enduring level of happiness. And every day that you can wake up every morning and say, “I can do whatever I want today. I can go to work, but I could quit. I can retire. I can do something else,” every day that you have that is going to give you a lasting level of happiness that it’s hard to get used to over time. It tends to be enduring over time.<br/><br/>And the opposite of that—waking up every morning and realizing that you are on someone else’s schedule, that someone is going to tell you when to go to work, where to go to work, what to do at work, when you can eat lunch, when you can go home, that tends to be just a level of dependence on other people that brings a lasting level of angst and unhappiness and stress.<br/><br/>So, that’s all I care about with financial independence, is that my career moves more towards this idea where I can do whatever I want. And what I want to do is write—which is what I’ve always done for work. As long as I can move and move toward this idea of “Look, I’m going to write when I want to. I’m going to write about whenever I want to. I’m going to do it for as long as I want to. I’m going to publish it where I want to,” that to me is what really matters in terms of financial independence. But I’m always going to keep writing because it’s what I love to do and what I’m passionate about.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	Excellent, excellent! How did your childhood and your parents influence your current work?<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	So, I wrote about this in the book. My father started his career later. He started his undergraduate college when he was 30 and had three kids. I’m the youngest of three. So, he started his undergraduate college a few months after I was born. And he became a doctor. He became an MD when I was in fourth grade or something like that.<br/><br/>So, he started really late. And that was important because, in my early childhood, the time I was born through, let’s call it fourth grade, we were very, very poor. So my parents were students. We were living off of grants and student loans and we had no money. We had nothing. So I got to see that side.<br/><br/>Of course, when you’re young and you haven’t experienced anything else, you don’t know that you’re poor. I had a great childhood. I liked playing with my parents and playing in the backyard. And we went camping. But you don’t know what you’re missing.<br/><br/>But then my father became a doctor when I was in fourth grade. And we moved on to a much more comfortable way of living. He had a doctor’s salary and that was what we had. We bought a nicer house. We went on vacations. There was a very stark change that happened when he became a doctor, as you can imagine.<br/><br/>But what was really important for them is that the forced frugality that my parents had when they were students, trying to raise three kids off of grants and student loans, that forced frugality stuck with them even after their incomes rose, after my father became a doctor.<br/><br/>So, even as a doctor, we lived a more comfortable life, but they were very frugal, and their savings rate was very high. And what that led them to after 25 years of working was my dad basically woke up one day and said, “I don’t want to work anymore. I’m ready to retire. I’m ready to move on.” And he just did. <br/><br/>And he was able to do that. He had that level of independence because he had a high savings rate from his old career that let him do that.<br/><br/>So, that had a big influence on me just like in the last five or ten years. It didn’t really hit me until that event occurred in the last decade that, wow, that was something really important, that this frugality that’s stuck with them for his whole life gave him this decision, led him to make this decision on his own terms whenever he wanted to in a way that was so meaningful and important in life that I wanted to do that.<br/><br/>So, growing up with that level of frugality just as the base case for me stuck with me. And I don’t necessarily consider myself frugal because I buy whatever I want, but my wants and desires aren’t that great. They’re not that high.<br/><br/>I think one of the most important financial skills for anyone is getting the goalpost to stop moving. It’s the most important. It’s probably the hardest financial skill. It’s when you get more income, either from your work or from investing returns or inheritance, whatever it is, that your material aspirations either don’t grow or they grow slower than whatever that income jump is. That’s the only way to build wealth over time. That’s the only way to get any sort of satisfaction over a growing money that you have, is to get the goalpost to stop moving.<br/><br/>So, I don’t consider myself necessarily frugal, but I think my wife and I have done an okay job at getting the goalpost to not move that much, so that as incomes rise, we feel like we’re actually getting something out of it. <br/><br/>And this is important because so many people don’t do that or they do the opposite. The goalpost is moving faster than their incomes. Their aspirations and their expectations are moving faster than their incomes. So even if their incomes are rising, and they become a doctor or a dentist or an investment banker or a lawyer, whatever it is, their income may have gone up 5x, but if their expectations jump 6x, it’s a really simple equation at that point.<br/><br/>So, keeping your expectations low in a way that gives you control over your life, control over your time, control over your freedom, it’s something that I took away from my parents that was really meaningful for me.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	So, frugality is obviously was a huge thing to Jack Bogle. It’s obviously important to a lot of Bogleheads. And like you said, it doesn’t mean scrounging on everything or denying yourself of basic things. I think it’s a misunderstood term. <br/><br/>But can you comment more broadly—you’ve used this phrase, “Wealth is what you don’t see.” Can you elaborate on that?<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	So, wealth is what you don’t see because what wealth is money that you haven’t spent. It’s money that you’ve saved and you have invested. It’s the stuff that you haven’t spent. It’s the stuff that we don’t see because no one sees other people’s bank accounts or their brokerage statement. All we see in the world is what people have spent—which is really the opposite of their wealth. We see the cars that they’re driving, and the homes that they’ve purchased. That’s what we see. That’s what’s visible.<br/><br/>But no one’s get to see what your brokerage account statement is. It’s invisible. And that’s a really big deal because it really impacts how and who we learn from.<br/><br/>I’ve used this example of, in health, in fitness. You can see someone who is in really good shape, someone who is very physically fit. And maybe it’s subconscious, but you tend to think, “Wow, it would be great if I could look like that too. I want to look like that.” So that’s my inspiration, my motivation, to go to the gym because I want to look like that person. Even if it’s subconscious, that tends to be what people think. <br/><br/>But with wealth, we can’t really do that same thing because the people who are very wealthy, we don’t see their wealth in the same way that you can see someone’s biceps.<br/><br/>Since wealth is invisible, we tend to look at the people who have spent money, and they tend to be who we admire. Those tend to be the people who say, “Oh well, that person is driving a Lamborghini. They must be really successful. So I should aspire to be them.” But a lot of people who are driving Lamborghinis and living in big homes are not wealthy because they have spent the money that they have. That’s why they have so many nice toys.<br/><br/>Think someone like Warren Buffet. His net worth is public. We know what his net worth is. It’s reported everywhere. He’s worth about $80 or $90 billion. It’s very public. There’s no secret. But if we did not know that, if we were just looking at Buffet the man, he would be no one’s financial role model because he wears cheap clothes, and he drives a mid-level Cadillac and lived in the same house that he bought when he was 25. <br/><br/>So, what is visible from Buffet is nothing. You don’t see the wealth at all unless you have this inside information about him that is now public about what his net worth is.<br/><br/>So that’s where it gets really difficult just in terms of who we admire, who we look up to, who we seek inspiration from when wealth is invisible.<br/><br/>I write about some people in the book who have extremely humble backgrounds and were secretaries and janitors who went on to achieve tremendous financial success. But people didn’t learn about it until they died because there was nothing visible for you to see. The only way that you’re going to learn about their financial success is when they died and their estate was opened up, they left a lot of money to charity. That’s the only time that it was visible.<br/><br/>So, all these people who are no one’s financial role model when they were living become people’s financial role models after they die and things open up. So it’s just this irony. <br/><br/>I’ve always said, particularly, for young men, when a lot of people say that want to be a millionaire, what they actually mean is, “I want to spend a million dollars.” And that’s literally the opposite of being a millionaire. There are lot of ironies like that in finance that are just hard to wrap your head around. The idea that wealth is what you don’t see just changes your perspective on what you see in the world and who we look up to.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	So going back to Bogleheads, a lot of even Bogleheads or stay the course hands-off investors are asking, “My portfolio is in all-time high right now. I understand timing the market is unlikely to be executed well,” they want to take some cash out… what do you say to those folks who are familiar with the fundamentals?<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	I think there are two things to think about here. One is that if you’re just taking a re-balancing approach, and it’s an annual re-balance or quarterly, or even if you’re talking about re-balancing once in every five years, that is I think not just okay, but a smart thing to do. And as markets have done really well, if you were to re-balance right now, you would almost certainly be selling stocks and putting more in the cash and bonds. So, that from that perspective, it makes a lot of sense. <br/><br/>If it is not a re-balancing, if it just this one-off, “Hey, the market’s gone up a lot during this pandemic. It makes me nervous, and so I want to sell,” I think that’s a slightly different thing. But it’s a really important distinction. If you are a long-term investor, even just for the next ten years, which to me is the shortest long-term time period, we know with a certainty that the market at some point in the next ten years is going to decline 20% or 30%. We don’t know when it’s going to occur. We don’t know from what levels, but that level of volatility occurs in every ten-year period looking historically.<br/><br/>So, we know it’s going to happen over the next 10-year period. So, if you know that it’s going to happen, and that it doesn’t necessarily preclude long-term growth, that a decline of 20% or 30% or even 50% is normal during a period when the market does very well over a longer period of time, then my question would be, “Why are you trying to avoid it? Why are you trying to avoid something that might not happen? You don’t know when it’s going to happen. There might be serious tax consequences for doing it. Why would you try to avoid it rather than just setting up your mindset to endure it over time?” <br/><br/>It’s not fun to deal with watching a third of your money disappear like we all did in March. Not that it’s fun, it’s not that it’s enjoyable. But I think if you have a deeper understanding of market history, those kinds of things are actually pretty normal. Even if it’s in the backdrop of long-term growth, then it gets easier to just say, “I’m just going to accept it.”<br/><br/>So look, I’m a hands-off investor. But I’m really interested in economic cycles and valuation cycles, et cetera. I’m really interested in that. So if you would ask me today, “Is the market expensive? Are we due for a pullback?”, I would say, yeah, probably. Both of those things are true. So what am I doing about it with my money? Nothing. I’m not doing anything about it with my money. I understand that both of those things should probably temper my expectations over the next ten years of what’s possible. It should increase the idea of a major sell-off at some point in the next couple of years. But I don’t know when it’s going to occur. I don’t know why it’s going to occur or from what level. And I’m confident that, whenever it occurs, it will eventually recover in due time.<br/><br/>And this year, in 2020, the recovery happened in 60 days. Much of the decline, 35% in March, and we’re back at all-time high now. <br/><br/>So that’s the other thing about it is that if you sell, if you make this decision to get out now because things are crazy, you better be damn sure that you have a plan to get back in on time. <br/><br/>And when is that “on time” going to be? No one in their right mind, if you go back to March, when the economy was falling apart and tens of millions of people were losing their jobs with $3 trillion stimulus package and truly looks by reasonable statistics that we are heading into the second great depression, no one back then would have said, “The S&#038;P 500 is going to be at all-time high’s by August. And by the way, Tesla is going to be at 800% during this period” No one would have thought that.<br/><br/>So, when the rebound is just as unknown as the decline, it should give you a little bit of humility about thinking ahead of, “Okay, if I sell now, when am I going to get back in? Am I ever going to get back in? Do I want to get back in?” because obviously the behavior that you want to avoid is the classic selling during fearful periods and buying during doom periods.<br/><br/>So, if your idea is you’re going to sell now after the collapse, and then when the market rebounds, again, you’re going to get back in… well, that’s almost certainly going to do traction in the long-term returns versus just enduring it over time that would’ve left you off in a better situation.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	A lot of folks in this crowd understand that it’s a few huge companies that are pulling up the market. So I think the broader public sees the market is doing really well. Can you talk about the seeming disconnect between economic chaos, societal uncertainty, market doing well, but a lot of other companies aren’t?<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	I think it really comes down to two things. One is that is if you look at the S&#038;P 500 companies, just five companies—Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft—just those five are more than a quarter of the index right now. And those five companies are doing extraordinarily well from the business sense. Revenue profits were doing—they’re not just holding up, they’re doing phenomenal right now.<br/><br/>So, since they are a disproportionate of the market, and those five companies have driven a huge share of overall game this year, that’s where you get the disconnect. <br/><br/>Whereas if you are looking at small-cap value index, a lot of those companies are doing very, very poorly as you would expect to happen during a recession or depression that we’re dealing with right now. That’s one of the disconnects of why so many small business, particularly, just mom-and-pop restaurants and drycleaners on Main Street are just absolutely struggling right now when the NASDAQ is surging to all-time high’s. That’s part of the disconnect.	<br/><br/>Another part of the disconnect is Federal Reserve policy. There’s definitely trillions of dollars in liquidity into the economy with the sole express intention of driving up asset prices. That’s not a side effect. That is the intention of what they are doing. So, whenever you have someone with literally—not virtually, but really, an unlimited supply of money that is willing to do anything to prop up asset prices, those in bond and equity markets, of course, that’s what’s going to occur.<br/><br/>I say that in hindsight. If you go back to March, I wouldn’t have expected it this quickly. But it does make a lot of sense when the Federal Reserve has been as aggressive as it has that you’ll see something like this. <br/><br/>And the Federal Reserve, their orders of operation, what they’re willing to do, has dramatically changed in the last ten years. If you go back to 2008, Ben Bernake was viciously criticized for cutting interest rates from, at the time, 4% to 2%, if you go back to 2007 or 2008. People thought he was being reckless, that this was going to lead to hyper-inflation, just for cutting interest rates versus today, in 2020, the Federal Reserve is literally buying corporate bond […] It’s a completely different degree in what the Fed is willing to do just in the last 10 or 12 years.<br/><br/>So, of course… are there going to be consequences, risks of that? Of course, absolutely. But we also shouldn’t be surprised necessarily that what is happening in asset markets, both in stocks and in bond markets across the world is happening amidst this backdrop of what the Fed is doing.<br/><br/>Those to me probably explain the majority of what’s going on in the stock market. But there’s also these unknown situations. Retail investing has surged as a share of stock market activity. Robin Hood and other brokerages has absolutely exploded in the last four or five months. Some people attribute that to be there’s no more sports betting. There’s no more sports to watch, so people are now day trading Netflix […] Is that at least part of what’s going on? I’m sure that is part of it.<br/><br/>There’s always other variables that go into it. So it’s never black and white where we can say “the market is [thriving] because of X.” <br/><br/>But those are the explanations that I think make most sense to me about trying to make some sense of the disconnect between 40-million people losing their jobs and stocks are at an all-time high this summer.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	Going back to the behavioral side of things, you’ve mentioned that 10% of people are born savers and investors (they have this inherent discipline), and that at the other end of the spectrum, there’s 10% of people who have stronger tendencies to trade or just be the opposite of those natural savers and investors with 80% roughly in between those two. <br/><br/>What have you seen helped people transition into that saver and investor group?<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	I don’t know. And first of all, the numbers where I say where 10% of people don’t need help, 10% of people can’t be helped, 80% of people want and need good advice, I’m making those numbers up, but it feels like its directionally accurate for me. <br/><br/>I’m actually not sure that a lot of people move from one group to another. I think that the 10% or so of people that I’m guessing who can never be helped are always going to be compulsive gamblers, always spending more than they have, always driving themselves into debt. I think there’s a group of people for whom you just can’t do anything for. And that’s just the way it is. <br/><br/>We’re never going to get to a point where everyone in society is good with money no matter how much information or how much education we have out there. There’s always going to be a pretty good subset of people that are just running themselves off a cliff, so to speak.<br/><br/>And to me, the target for financial advisers should be the 80% in the middle who want and need good advice. And I think for those people, it really comes down to good communication about talking about market—well, two things: the history of markets, particularly, market vitality, and how common vitality is, and understanding what causes it and how it passes, and again, how it does not conclude long-term returns, long-term growth—that’s important—and becoming introspective with yourself or working with your clients to understand your own risk tolerances, your own goals, what you want out of investing, what is important to you, and also, your flaws—what you are not good at, where you tend to have a poor relation with greed and fear, those kinds of things.<br/><br/>Everyone, no matter who they are, is susceptible to the force of greed and fear. It’s not that you can control that. But to the extent that you can remove that from your decision-making process, the better.<br/><br/>And look, […] index funds. I don’t do anything else. I don’t sell. I don’t make any larger purchases. I just stick to a clean strategy. But I am not, in anyway, immune to greed or fear.<br/><br/>I was really worried in March. I didn’t make any changes to my investments, but I was worried. I was worried about the economy. And on the flipside of that, when stocks were in all-time high, it feels great. And I’m probably subject to the wealth effect. So, I’m not saying that myself or anyone is immune to that. And I think people who are thinking they are immune to that are probably kidding themselves. But if you can just make sure—it’s fine to be greedy and fearful as long as you don’t mix that with the decisions that you make.<br/><br/>So, as soon as you start saying, “Oh, I’m greedy, so I’m going to buy more. I’m fearful, so I’m going to sell everything,” that’s when things start to blow up. <br/><br/>And that’s really important because a lot of people, when they’re thinking about behavioral finance, will ask a broad question more or less like, “How can I stop being so greedy or fearful?” My answer is you can’t. You cannot learn about something, reading a book or learning a new formula, that is going to counter cortisol and dopamine in your brain. It’s never going to happen. It’s just an integral part of who you are.<br/><br/>So, rather than thinking that you can fix it and get around it, I think you would have to situate your finances in a way that embraces it and just make sure that even if those emotions are there, that emotionalism that is making you change your decisions or leading to new decisions is what you’re actually trying to manage rather than trying to get rid of those feelings altogether.<br/><br/>If you get those two things down—understanding market history and understanding yourself and your own goals, that to me is 80% or 90% of what matters in terms of managing money. That’s what’s really important for people.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	So, building on that, you’ve mentioned there’s a thin line between bold and reckless. So obviously, investors have a mantra that higher return requires higher risks. So boldness is often rewarded. Can you elaborate on that thin line between the two?<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	In both business and investing, it gets dangerous when we admire and look up to people who have been very successful because, lots of times, the behaviors and the decisions that were necessary for extremely good returns or be of high success are the same behaviors that would have led to a disaster in terms of a huge decline. So it’s both swinging from the fences. <br/><br/>And risk and luck, I think, are more or less the same thing. There’s just opposite sides of the same coin. They are both the idea that there are things that can happen in the world that are outside of our control, but have a big impact, a big influence on outcomes.<br/><br/>So, risk and investing, we understand what that is. There are things that can happen that are outside of our control in the stock market, in the economy, where we can try to make a good decision, where the odds are in our favor, but we just end up on the unfortunate side of the odds. We know that’s the case.<br/><br/>Luck is the exact same thing. Whereas luck is things that happen in business, in the economy that are outside of our control that have a bigger impact on outcomes and anything we intentionally did.<br/><br/>The disconnect where it gets dangerous is that people are keenly aware of risk in investing, they adjust the returns for risk, they hire risk managers. But luck is very different. Even though we know luck is out there, we know it’s virtually the same thing as risk, it’s just the opposite, but we don’t tend to talk about luck like we talk about risk. It is rude to accuse another investor or a successful businessperson of being lucky. You just look like a jerk if you’re doing that. If you say, “Oh, this hedge fund manager is a billionaire, but they’ve just been lucky,” it just makes you look cynical or bitter.<br/><br/>And for yourself, it hurts to look yourself in the mirror and say, “All of the success that I had, or at least the big portion of it, is just due to luck. I didn’t really do anything.” That’s a hard thing to accept.<br/><br/>So, even though we know luck is a powerful force in the world in business investing, it’s much more difficult to talk about it and think about it than risk is. <br/><br/>And that’s why it gets dangerous to look at really successful businesspeople and say, for example, what did Jeff Bezos do and what can I do that he did that that’s going to leave me as an entrepreneur with the kind of success he has? Well, there are so many different areas of luck that led to Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk or Bill Gates that led to their success. And that does not mean that they were not skilled or hardworking. It doesn’t mean of those things. Of course, they are skilled, and smart, and hardworking. But there’s a level of luck in there that is impossible to emulate on any consistent basis.<br/><br/>I talk about, in the book, one example of this. Bill Gates went to the only high school in America that had a computer. So if you think about the ark of Bill Gates’ life… is he smart? Is he hardworking? Oh, my gosh, yes, He’s one of the smartest, hardest working, insightful, forward-looking business leaders that we’ve had in a century.<br/><br/>But is he lucky? Is at least a major part of his success due to luck? Of course, due to being in only the high school in America with a computer that set him on this path to where he got to now. And that was the decision that he didn’t put any thought into. I don’t even think his parents put a lot of thought into, that they were going to send Bill to this private school because they have a computer. It was a serendipity luck that led to that.<br/><br/>And the more we acknowledge and accept that that is a major part of how business and investing works, the more humility that you have in terms of learning from other people and back towards learning from history. It pushes you away from really precise lessons from other investors or other businesses and more toward the big, broad patterns that tend to show up in lots of areas in business and investing.<br/><br/>So, it’s just a push towards more humble way of learning about the world.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	Excellent! So, the next question I want to ask, I’ll call it a loophole question so folks know many of the short-term, enjoyable things, that things with immediate gratification, have a long-term negative cost versus the opposite things with long-term reward have this upfront unenjoyable cost… but there are things that are enjoyable near-term that are also good for you long-term. So, I jokingly say, for me, that’s guacamole. I love it and it’s good for you. <br/><br/>And for a lot of people, it’s exercise or saving and investing. What have you found marries the two, enjoy it now, and it’s also good for you long-term? <br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	The one that comes to mind the most for me is writing. I always joke like, please don’t my bosses, but no one needs to pay me to do this. I really enjoy doing it. I love the process of learning about how the world works and trying to find a story and trying to tie it back to finance. I love doing that. That’s what comes to mind most for me. And I’ve built a career out of doing it. So that’s a long-term payoff. But that to me is what comes to mind. <br/><br/>And that actually goes back to what we’re just talking about luck. How I got into writing and how I became a writer was not planned at all. It was truly just dumb luck of just stumbling across an opportunity that I had never planned for, and it just happened to work out.<br/><br/>But I think that’s true for a lot of people. I think the main driver of what’s going to make most people happy is the combination of their marriages, their mates, their spouses and their career. Those two things are the overlying majority of what you’re going to be dealing with on a day-to-day basis. So, if you get those two things right, then not a lot of other things can really get in the way that’s going to tear you off track. If you get those two things wrong, there’s not a lot you can do that’s going to set you on the right track.<br/><br/>And a lot of that for myself, I’d say, my marriage too is another thing where I feel like it was just dumb luck on how it came together. <br/><br/>So to me, it’s those two things—it’s work that I love and happy relationship, happy friends—that leads to the most amount of instant gratification and also has a long-term payoff for me.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	Excellent, excellent. You’ve mentioned the importance of learning subjects outside of personal finance or investing. In closing, are there a few high-level categories that you’d suggest pointing people in the direction of? You mentioned history. Are there others?<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	So, there are lessons that we can take away from history, in biology, in politics, in military history, all these other fields, sociology that having nothing to do with investing, but they all fall into this umbrella of how do people behave, how do people make decisions around risk, and greed, and fear and uncertainty and scarcity. <br/><br/>So, what I try to do in this book is use a lot of stories that have nothing to do with investing, nothing to do with finance, nothing to do with economics. But they open up a window, so to speak, in terms of how people make decisions, how people decide what they’re going to do, what people’s preferences are that have a clear investing takeaway that we can learn from.<br/><br/>One that’s always stuck out to me is the period in U.S. in world history was from about 1920 to 1945 which holds the boom of the 1920s, the incredible bust of the Great Depression, and then the tragedy, trauma and uncertainty of World War II. I think that learning about that period, there is no greater period in modern history where there’s a lot of historical recording in terms of just books and documentaries written about that period that you can learn how people deal with greed, fear, uncertainty, tragedy, trauma, than that period. I think it is such a window into the human condition and just how people deal with the ups and downs in life. <br/><br/>I’ve always been fascinated with that period just for that reason. There’s no other period in modern history where you can learn more about how humans think and behave under pressure than that time period.<br/><br/>So, I’m always fascinated with the Great Depression and World War II. The Great Depression, obviously, has direct investing takeaways. You wouldn’t think there would be in World War II, but there was so much—<br/><br/>Just think about something like innovation. World War II started on horseback and finished with nuclear fission just six years later. So much scientific innovation took place during that period that you can learn a lot about human progress and ingenuity and innovation through the lens of World War II—which is not obvious but I think if you dig into it, it’s just a really fascinating period.<br/><br/><strong>Gouri:</strong> 	Excellent! Well, thank you again so much… really powerful, insightful, practical. We loved having you.<br/><br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> 	Thank you so much for having me. This has been fun. I really appreciate it. Thank you.</div>

<h2>Full Transcript</h2>



<div class="transcript"><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Hey, what&#8217;s up everybody. It&#8217;s the Mad Fientist. Welcome to the Financial Independence Podcast. <br><br>It&#8217;s been a while since I released my last episode and wow has a lot of stuff happened since then. So my last episode with Jim was released on March 16th. And if you remember what March was like, it was pretty crazy.<br><br>We recorded that episode on Sunday, March 15th and the markets were down 21% from the February 19th highs. <br><br>I released the episode early Monday morning and Monday just happened to be the biggest drop of this entire crisis and actually the third biggest drop of all time, behind black Monday back in 1987 and one day during the great depression.<br><br>So I&#8217;m glad I rushed that episode out, even though I didn&#8217;t have my proper microphone and just threw it together the day before I released it. But hopefully it stopped you from selling because now here we are on August 6th when I&#8217;m recording this and the markets aren&#8217;t open yet, but we&#8217;re currently sitting just under 2% lower than the all time highs we hit on February 19th, which is just insane.<br><br>I mean, I would have never predicted that. If someone had told me that we would be here in August, I would say, &#8220;Oh, great&#8230;we have a vaccine and everything&#8217;s back to normal.  Economies are up and running!&#8221; and that&#8217;s not happened either. So this just highlights one that you can&#8217;t predict what&#8217;s going to happen in the world.  And two, you definitely can&#8217;t predict what&#8217;s going to happen in the market. <br><br>So hopefully for all the people out there who think they can predict those things, this has been a humbling experience and hopefully not too costly. <br><br>The good thing about being in the position we are in now in the markets is that it&#8217;s sort of like a reset button.  And if you recall what Jim&#8217;s advice was in that last podcast episode, he said&#8230;During a downturn, during a crash, is not the best time to be rethinking your portfolio strategy and asset allocation because your emotions are high. You&#8217;re scared. You may make decisions that you wouldn&#8217;t normally make.<br><br>So he said to wait until things get back to normal again, and then you can revisit your strategy and you can reflect on that crash and see if you are taking too many risks and if you want to make changes for the future.  Well, here we are back at almost all time highs and this is your opportunity to do that.<br><br>So if you think back to when you listened to my last episode, back in March, and think about how you felt then, and sort of reflect on what your portfolio was and what you had wished it would have been at that point when markets were tanking. And again, like I said, when I released that episode, March 16th, stocks went down 11% in one day, and it was a very scary time and nobody knew what was happening.<br><br>So think back to then and think about, did you wish that you had less money in the market? Did you wish you had a higher bond allocation?  And now you can make those changes because we&#8217;re back at where we were back in February before this whole thing kicked off. <br><br>So today&#8217;s episode, I&#8217;m gonna talk about what I personally learned from this whole thing and my plans for the future and what&#8217;s changed.<br><br>And if you guys have listened to the show before, you may remember that on the anniversary of me leaving work, I&#8217;ve released episodes and articles titled Valuable lessons from My First Year of Freedom, Second Year of Freedom, Third Year of Freedom. And I can&#8217;t believe it, but it&#8217;s actually four years since I left my job.<br><br>It was August 1st, 2016. So just recently had my four-year anniversary. And I definitely learned a lot this past year, but most of what I learned was the result of all this COVID craziness. So that will be a big focus, but I&#8217;ll obviously talk about what else has happened to the past year and what other lessons I learned during this fourth year that can hopefully help you prepare for your own post-FI life.<br><br>So since this is the Financial Independence Podcast, let&#8217;s start with the money side of the equation. And I definitely learned a lot from this recent crash, even though I did survive the global financial crisis back in 2008 and was invested during that time. I still learned quite a few lessons from this particular crash.<br><br>And I wrote about some of that in my last post, where I broke down what&#8217;s in my portfolio and why. So if you haven&#8217;t read that yet, head over to madfientist.com/my-portfolio and you can read about everything that&#8217;s in there, there, but I just want to talk about some of the things that I didn&#8217;t mention in that post.<br><br>So the first thing is I&#8217;m thinking differently about risk than I used to. You may recall in previous episodes, I talked about my &#8220;peak arbitrage&#8221; strategy, where I buy a property in a mountain resort destination in the States. And I buy a property in Edinburgh, Scotland, and since the peak tourist season for those two properties is different, I could live in one of them during the off season and rent the other one out. And the, you know, the higher priced peak place would pay for the lower priced off-peak place. And then I can enjoy two really great houses and two great destinations for potentially a profit. <br><br>That seemed like a great idea, pre-COVID, but never in my wildest dreams, would I expect that the entire travel industry would just go poof overnight and Airbnbs that are normally in hot demand would not be filled for months at a time during a lockdown.<br><br>So, had I bought two expensive properties that I thought would wasn&#8217;t that risky due to the fact that, you know, the peak tourist seasons were different and they&#8217;re both very highly desirable destinations that were always being rented out. Had I done that then I would have been in a position where I had two big mortgages and a lot more financial stress than I&#8217;d want in my life.<br><br>COVID highlighted to me that anything is possible and you&#8217;d never want to overextend yourself in any sort of way that&#8217;s going to cause stress. So before making a purchase or before investing in something, really try to visualize the worst-case scenario and make sure that you&#8217;re comfortable with that.<br><br>And looking back on that plan, I don&#8217;t think I would be comfortable with that. That would cause me a lot of stress to have to empty properties. Obviously we could we&#8217;ll live in one of them, but having an empty property somewhere across the world and just be paying a bunch of bills on that is not exactly what I want to be doing.<br><br>So yeah, it was the first big lesson I took away from this year. <br><br>The other thing this crisis has highlighted is the value of living below your means.<br><br>As I&#8217;ve mentioned in past interviews and posts, there&#8217;s a lot of post-FI income that&#8217;s coming that I wasn&#8217;t expecting. So it would have been very easy over the past few years to inflate our lifestyles and start spending more because who would thought that the income would just drop off from a global pandemic?<br><br>I know I wouldn&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s what happened. So the whole stock market&#8217;s collapsing in March and all of the supplemental income that has been coming in over the years just decreases by 90% or something like that. And had we inflated our lifestyles, it could have been a very stressful time.<br><br>So that really highlighted the benefit of not increasing your spending, just because you have income coming in, that you expect to continue to come in. Because as I&#8217;m sure a lot of individuals and businesses are learning over the past few months, you could have a rock solid business and you could have a rock solid job and something like this could happen that causes that income to go away and you would have never expected it or predicted it. And you could be in a very tough spot if you&#8217;re relying on that income to sustain an inflated lifestyle. <br><br>Another big change I&#8217;m making this year is I&#8217;m going to be switching over my retirement contributions to Roth from Traditional.<br><br>As you know, I wrote an article talking about how traditional is better for people who are pursuing early retirement. And if you haven&#8217;t read that yet, I&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes to that article. But since our income has dropped this year and I&#8217;m eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA and Roth Solo 401k, I&#8217;m going to do it because I want to diversify more with my tax advantage accounts. Since I&#8217;m heavy on the traditional sides, I&#8217;m willing to take the tax hit this year to ensure that that money can be withdrawn tax-free in the future. Because obviously governments are spending a lot of money to deal with this COVID crisis. And we don&#8217;t know what taxes are gonna be in the future, but there seems to be a higher probability that taxes would need to increase the pay for all of this so this year I&#8217;m just going to try to diversify by my tax-advantaged accounts a bit more and put some more money into the rough side of things. <br><br>I&#8217;m also thinking a bit differently about travel rewards. So if you&#8217;ve read my past articles, you know that I was building up a big stash of miles and points so that the next time there was a big stock market crash, I could use all of those miles and points to travel while being able to funnel as much cash into the down market as I could. Well, I didn&#8217;t expect that the crash would come with a global pandemic, which means that we can&#8217;t travel anyway. So that&#8217;s been interesting because that sort of foiled my plan to use all those points. <br><br>So, I started getting a little bit worried about having huge balances in those programs, because airlines are struggling at the moment.  Hotels are struggling. Credit card companies are likely struggling. So having a million points scattered across different programs was a bit risky for me at this stage so I&#8217;ve actually started using some of those points to pay for groceries, which I am surprised about myself, but the deal was too good to pass up.<br><br>I recently found out that I can use my Chase points to wipe grocery bills off of my credit card statement. And normally that&#8217;s not really a great redemption, but since I have a Chase Sapphire Reserve card, I was able to get 1.5 cents per point, which is a decent redemption. It&#8217;s not amazing, but it&#8217;s decent.<br><br>And the fact that that same card was giving me 5 points per dollar at grocery stores for the whole pandemic, that means I was able to get 7.5% off of my grocery bill, which was pretty much our only expense during the three months of lockdown. So it turned out to be a great deal. It&#8217;s allowed me to get through some of my points and lower my point balances a bit more.<br><br>And it&#8217;s also saved us some money so that if the market does decrease again, we&#8217;ll have more cash to put into it. <br><br>If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about that card. That has definitely been my go to card for that the last three or four years. Yeah. Ever since it came out, I hopped on and as soon as it came out and it was amazing for travel, but like I said, it&#8217;s been great for groceries and stuff too, during the pandemic.<br><br>So if you&#8217;re interested to learn more about that, just head to madfientist.com/reserve, and you can read all about it there. And I think you&#8217;re able to redeem for groceries at 1.5 cents per point until the end of September. So if you already have that card and are interested in using your points for that, you can look into &#8220;Pay Yourself Back&#8221;&#8230;I think is the name of the program.<br><br>And you should be able to find it in the Ultimate Rewards portal on the Chase website. <br><br>So I think those were the main lessons from a financial standpoint, but this whole crisis has highlighted a bunch of nonfinancial things as well. <br><br>If you remember back in April and may, I think there&#8217;s a lot of mainstream media focus on FIRE and asking whether this means FIRE is dead and things like that.<br><br>And I didn&#8217;t get into the conversation back then because I thought it was crazy that, during our first market pullback and people were thinking that everyone&#8217;s plans are screwed, which is insane because if you don&#8217;t plan for these sorts of drops, or if your plan fails at the first draw down, then you&#8217;re not really FIRE in the first place.<br><br>So it seemed like a crazy argument at the time, but I thought that this whole crisis actually highlighted the benefits of FIRE more than anything, the value of not having to make decisions for financial reasons. And being in a financial position where you don&#8217;t have to say yes to anything that you don&#8217;t want to say yes to and you don&#8217;t have to put yourself in a position where you could potentially hurt yourself or others, just because you need to get that next paycheck. That is a huge benefit during stressful times like this.<br><br>Another thing this experience has done is it&#8217;s sort of highlighted what was good and what wasn&#8217;t as good about pre-COVID life, because everything sort of went away. So if you&#8217;re in a position now where you&#8217;re still sort of under lockdown, like we are here in the UK, think back to your pre-COVID life and think about the things that you really miss. And also try to think about what life was like before and all the things you were doing and think about the things that you haven&#8217;t missed, or you forgot that you even did before, because I&#8217;m sure a lot of people have really busy lives and a lot of that busyness is maybe stuff that&#8217;s just leftover from earlier years, and you&#8217;ve just continued doing it even though it&#8217;s not as important to you anymore. So now&#8217;s a great time to think back to the pre-COVID life. Make changes and make different plans for the future.  <br><br>Based on what I&#8217;ve learned after reflecting on it myself, I learned that after three years of post-FI life, I had pretty much dialed in a great routine and a great balance of fun and work that I&#8217;m really passionate about.  So the life I described in my Valuable Lessons from My Third Year of Freedom podcast, which I&#8217;ll link to in the show notes, actually is yeah, pretty ideal. And obviously this year is quite different because a lot of the fun half of that lifestyle was cut away because not able to travel and see friends and family like I did in the third year, but it was a good balance so I know that I was on the right track. And once we get back to post-COVID normal life, then hopefully we can just pick up where we left off and that&#8217;s going to be a pretty good trajectory to be on. <br><br>Speaking of meaningful work&#8230;since the fun portion of life was put on hold from all of this COVID stuff, I&#8217;ve been doubling down on the meaningful work aspect.  So I&#8217;ve spent lockdown, really working hard on a lot of these projects that I&#8217;ve been wanting to make progress on over the years and have made some really good progress, which is fantastic. And I&#8217;m going to tell you a lot more about that in my next episode. So if you&#8217;re not subscribed, then head to  madfientist.com/advice, and you can sign up to the email list there and you&#8217;ll get a PDF of all the great advice I&#8217;ve got from my Financial Independence Podcast, guests over the years and you&#8217;ll also find out when I publish my next episode, which is definitely the most excited I&#8217;ve ever been to publish an episode before. So hopefully that&#8217;s going to come out in September, but yeah, go to madfientist.com/advice to sign up to the email list and you&#8217;ll get notified as soon as that next episode comes out.<br><br>But one thing I wanted to mention about working on those meaningful projects is that lockdown hopefully maybe showed you that it&#8217;s a bit harder than you expect it to be, to work on all those things that you always say that you&#8217;re going to work on. Yes, I realized that lockdown was probably a lot more stressful and weird than normal life would be after you quit your job but it does take a lot of effort and a lot of learning about yourself too, to do the things that you have always said you wanted to do.<br><br>I guess, a good way to describe it is sort of like new year&#8217;s day when you make all these resolutions and you have all this optimism and you think that future you is going to be healthy and active and will be able to avoid all of the procrastination issues that you&#8217;ve had to deal with so far. And you know, you just have this other picture of yourself that&#8217;s probably not as realistic as you think it is. So that again, this goes back to what I&#8217;ve said before in that anything that you plan to do after you retire, I say you start now and you start to integrate that into your life and you start to work through some of the hard things that you have to work through to be able to get to work on some of these things. <br><br>Because for me, it wasn&#8217;t my job holding me back. It was actually my self-doubt and my procrastination and my inability to get started because I was scared I was going to be bad at it. And it was those things that was holding me back and it wasn&#8217;t my nine-to-five because I had plenty of free time. It was just that I use that free time for other things, because I was too scared to use it for the things that really mattered. So again, if you can start these things now, even before FI, even before you leave your full time job. Then when you get to FI, you&#8217;re going to be in a much better position and you&#8217;re going to be able to just like hit the ground running because you&#8217;re going to have all these hours to use, but you&#8217;re going to know how to use them. <br><br>So think about how you used your time during lockdown. If you had any extra time&#8230;I know the parents out there probably had less time than they did before lockdown.  But if you did have some free time, did you use it how you thought you would? And if you didn&#8217;t then how can you start to live that sort of life now, even if you are back to work and you don&#8217;t have as much free time. <br><br>Well, I think that&#8217;s it for this year. There&#8217;s obviously a lot of stuff that I&#8217;ve learned about myself and about the world that I didn&#8217;t expect to learn this year.<br><br>I&#8217;d be interested to hear any lessons that you&#8217;ve picked up from the last few crazy months so just head over to the show notes for this episode and put them in the comments and I&#8217;ll look forward to reading those. <br><br>Again, if you haven&#8217;t subscribed to the email list or the podcast yet just head over to madfientist.com/advice or subscribe on iTunes, and then you&#8217;ll get to know when the next episode comes out and hopefully that will be sometime in September and I am seriously so excited about it. <br><br>And finally, I hope. Everyone out there is doing okay. I know these are crazy times and a lot of ups and downs and some scary stuff going on so I hope everybody&#8217;s healthy. I hope all of your families have been able to stay healthy.<br><br>So take care, thanks for listening, and I&#8217;ll speak again soon.<br></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A pandemic is affecting the entire world.  Economies have shut down.  Over 36 million people in the United States are newly unemployed.  The price of oil went negative for a bit.  We experienced the fastest 30% drop in stocks <em>ever</em> and then got to enjoy a 30%+ rebound immediately after.  </p>



<p>And all this craziness happened within the last couple of months.</p>



<p>Although this is an uncomfortable time for everyone, it could also be an incredible learning opportunity.  </p>



<p>You know what a crash feels like (i.e. peak &#8220;fear&#8221;), what record highs feel like (i.e. peak &#8220;greed&#8221;), and you can appreciate how difficult it is to predict <em>anything</em> about the world or the markets.</p>



<p>Since being in the middle of market turmoil is a lot different than thinking about a future crash, it&#8217;s worth reflecting on your investment plan.</p>



<p>As Mike Tyson famously said, &#8220;Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.&#8221;  Now that you know how it feels to get punched in the mouth, where has your plan fallen over?  Have your emotions caused you to override the rules you had set for yourself?  Are there systems or automations you can put in place so next time that doesn&#8217;t happen?</p>



<p>While your memories are fresh, think about these extremes and develop a better plan for your portfolio so that the next crash isn&#8217;t as costly or traumatic.</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s In My Portfolio</h2>



<p>To help you develop your investing plan, I&#8217;m going to explain all the mechanics of my portfolio.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;ll dive into the investments I chose, the systems I have in place, and the rules I&#8217;ve set.  I&#8217;ll explain how they trick me into doing the right things at the right times (and keep me from doing the wrong things).</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll also share a new spreadsheet I created to help you implement similar strategies.</p>



<p>None of what I do is special, fancy, or complicated but maybe it&#8217;s the simplicity that allows me to stay the course during uncertain times.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll also describe what I&#8217;ve learned from the current crisis and explain how I&#8217;ve enhanced my rules based on what I&#8217;ve learned.  Even though I experienced a big crash before as an investor, back in 2007, I still found myself struggling with a certain aspect of my investing plan this time.</p>



<p>Before diving into my portfolio, let&#8217;s start with the lesson I thought I had learned from my first crash yet still struggled with this time…</p>



<h2>Learning from My First Crash</h2>



<p>It was 2007.  </p>



<p>We had just sold our house in Scotland for over 50% more than we bought it for 2.5 years earlier and I was going to start investing that money into the markets.</p>



<p>Stocks went down a bit and I was happy that shares were on sale so I bought some.  I can&#8217;t remember the exact percentages but I let&#8217;s say I invested 30% of the money I planned to invest. </p>



<p>It felt great getting a deal!</p>



<p>Then the next day was even worse.  I invested a bit more but I didn&#8217;t have as much left so I decreased the amount I put into the markets.</p>



<p>A few days later, it got much MUCH worse.</p>



<h2>Catching a Falling Knife</h2>



<p>As the financial world collapsed, I kept putting more money in but I invested less and less each time because every time I put money in, I&#8217;d lose more money.</p>



<p>This continued until the market bottomed in March 2009.  </p>



<p>By then though, I was just trickling in $150 every so often.  Not because I was out of money to invest but because I assumed stocks would keep going down and I didn&#8217;t want to make the mistake I made at the beginning by investing such a big percentage of the cash while things were dropping.</p>



<p>I remember the market bottom vividly because I was at my grandparent&#8217;s house in Florida and I was going to do my normal small investment but the market had gone up that day.  &#8220;No big deal&#8221;, I thought.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll just invest tomorrow when it goes down again.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, it didn&#8217;t get any lower the next day.  Or the next.  It kept going up and I kept waiting for the markets to make new lows.  The new lows didn&#8217;t happen so I didn&#8217;t invest.</p>



<p>Stocks were the cheapest they&#8217;ll likely ever be in my lifetime and yet I sat on a chunk of uninvested cash because I was trying to time the bottom.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to see now that I made a mistake but when you&#8217;re in the middle of a big drawdown, it&#8217;s hard to know what to do.</p>



<p>When the markets started to recover in 2009, it didn&#8217;t feel like things were any better.  It felt like everything was going to keep getting worse so the upward moves didn&#8217;t make sense.</p>



<p>The thing is, you never know what&#8217;s going to happen or what bad things are already priced into the market.  The world could get worse but if investors already expect it to get worse, stocks could go up.  Or, if investors think things aren&#8217;t improving as fast a expected, stocks could take a big dive even when things in the economy are getting better.</p>



<p>As I learned, putting money into a falling market is a lot more difficult than it seems.</p>



<p>Ben Carlson from AWealthOfCommonSense.com summed it up perfectly in <a rel="noopener" aria-label="a recent article (opens in a new tab)" href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2020/03/what-happens-to-stocks-after-a-big-down-month/" target="_blank">a recent article</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Every investor is told to buy low and sell high. But most don’t realize that buy low typically works out to buy low, then buy lower, then buy even lower, and once you really hate yourself, buy lower than you thought was possible.</p></blockquote>



<p>I thought I learned from my 2008/2009 mistake so I assumed I&#8217;d be better prepared this time around.</p>



<p>I was wrong.</p>



<p>Although I&#8217;m used to the feeling of buying low, then buying lower, then hating yourself and buying even lower, I started falling into the same trap I fell into in 2007 &#8211; I stopped buying enough because I thought I <em>knew</em> that the markets were going to go lower.</p>



<p>I had the cash, stocks were on sale, and yet I was timidly trickling money in again because I thought things were going to get worse before they got better (my brain and emotions were again trying to sabotage my plan).</p>



<p>That&#8217;s where systems and rules can save you (and me).</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s dive into my portfolio and explore the systems and rules I have in place (including the new rules I&#8217;ve developed to solve this particular problem)…</p>



<h2>Two Baskets</h2>



<p>At the very top level, I&#8217;ve split my money into two baskets:</p>



<ul><li>FI Portfolio</li><li>Cash Buffer/Real-Estate Fund</li></ul>



<p>My FI portfolio is what we&#8217;d live on if all our other income went away.  </p>



<p>As explained in the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/safe-withdrawal-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Safe Withdrawal Rate (opens in a new tab)">Safe Withdrawal Rate</a> post, a 3.5% withdrawal rate is <em>very</em> conservative so I keep enough money in this basket so that 3.5% of the value of the portfolio could sustain our annual spending.</p>



<p>In my other basket, I&#8217;ve started accumulating cash that I may one day use to buy some real estate.  We currently rent and I enjoy renting but I imagine we&#8217;ll want to put down roots somewhere eventually, and buying somewhere will help us do that, so I&#8217;ve been building up a small real-estate fund over the years.</p>



<p>When new money comes in, I either top up the FI portfolio (to maintain a 3.5% withdraw rate) or I add it to the real-estate fund. </p>



<h2>Never Sell</h2>



<p>One rule I have is that I can never sell anything in my FI Portfolio (unless it&#8217;s for rebalancing purposes).</p>



<p>Getting back in after selling is one of the hardest things to do as an investor so I don&#8217;t ever put myself in the position to have to do that.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s very tempting though.  In fact, I thought about it in February before all this stuff kicked off.</p>



<p>On February 7th, I had dinner with my brother-in-law.  He&#8217;s a microbiologist and I asked him what he thought about the new virus that had forced China to shut down.  He said it was extremely concerning and he thought it was already way too big of a problem to contain.</p>



<p>At that time, stocks were hitting record highs and hadn&#8217;t seen a significant pullback in a long time.  If there was any time to move some money to cash, it was that one.</p>



<p>I knew better though and even considering what&#8217;s happened since, I&#8217;m so glad I held my nerve and followed my own rule of never selling.</p>



<p>Had I sold my stocks on February 10th (the first weekday after that dinner with my brother-in-law), here&#8217;s what would have happened…</p>



<p>Stocks would have continued their rise for the next nine days.  Each day would have been more excruciating than the last because I would have been second-guessing my decision and beating myself up for going to cash.</p>



<p>In all honesty, I&#8217;m not sure I would have had the patience to wait and may have bought back in at a higher price before the crash.</p>



<p>Assuming I did stay in cash, I would have felt like a genius a few weeks later when everything dropped 30%+ but then I would have had to figure out when to get back in, which is even more difficult.</p>



<p>The markets inexplicably rebounded 30%+ after the March 23rd lows.  There&#8217;s no way I would have bought back into stocks on March 23rd because, at the time, it felt like stocks could easily drop another 20%+ since people were still freaking out and the virus was looking really bad.  </p>



<p>So after a rebound of 10%, would I have gotten back in then?  Hell no!  I would have assumed it was a dead-cat bounce and stocks would go even lower soon.</p>



<p>How about today, when we&#8217;re 25%+ above those lows?  Nope.  I&#8217;d be really pissed off I missed out on all those gains but I&#8217;d also worry an even bigger pullback is possible.  Unemployment is soaring, the virus is still killing thousands of people, and the full ramifications of the economic shutdowns aren&#8217;t fully apparent yet.  </p>



<p>How could I buy stocks in this environment when things are looking worse than they were in early February?</p>



<p>But what if a new COVID-19 treatment gets approved tomorrow or something else happens that causes markets to keep going up from here?  Could I stand to be in cash and miss out on even more gains and new highs?  </p>



<p>How would I ever get back in?</p>



<p>As you can see, it&#8217;s an extremely difficult situation to be in, even if you get out at the right time. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t do it.</p>



<p>Instead, I alter my asset allocation when my risk tolerance changes.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s dive into that asset allocation…</p>



<h2>Portfolio Asset Allocation</h2>



<p>My FI portfolio is very simple and only consists of three funds:</p>



<ul><li>Total Stock Market Index Fund</li><li>Total International Stock Market Index Fund</li><li>Total Bond Market Index Fund</li></ul>



<p>For these three funds, I&#8217;ve settled on the following allocation:</p>



<ul><li>65%-75% Total Stock Market Index Fund</li><li>25% Total International Stock Market Index Fund</li><li>0-10% Total Bond Market Index Fund</li></ul>



<p><em>Note: Although my FI portfolio can sustain our spending, my <a rel="nofollow noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.madfientist.com/to-travel-cards/" target="_blank">credit-card search tool for travel hackers</a> is still bringing in more income than we spend so my asset choices are more aggressive than they would be if I wasn&#8217;t earning any income.</em></p>



<p>I&#8217;ll explain more later about why my allocations are ranges (and why this has been beneficial recently).</p>



<h2>Buying Low</h2>



<p>I like having three funds because it provides a bit of diversification and it also helps me buy low.  </p>



<p>Since I&#8217;m still earning money, I don&#8217;t sell anything and I just rebalance with new money.</p>



<p>Each month, I plug my numbers into a spreadsheet and it tells me how out of whack my allocation is and what I need to buy to fix it.</p>



<p>Here is a simplified version of that spreadsheet (with dummy numbers) that I created to share with you:</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="253" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/no-sell-rebalancing.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6655" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/no-sell-rebalancing.png 700w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/no-sell-rebalancing-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure></div>
		


<p><em>To download a copy of this spreadsheet, <a href="https://pages.madfientist.com/portfolio-strategies" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">click here</a>!</em></p>



<p><em>Once you&#8217;ve downloaded the spreadsheet, simply update the numbers shaded in green and it will let you know where you should deploy your cash.</em></p>



<p>For example, when the international stock fund wasn&#8217;t doing as well as my total stock market fund (as has been the case for the past few years), I knew that any new money I earned should go into the international fund to bring it back in line with my target allocation.</p>



<h3>How This Tricks Me Into Doing the Right Thing</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s been hard to invest over the last few years because markets have gone straight up for so long and everything felt expensive.</p>



<p>When I switched to this system, it became easier because there was always something that looked cheap (even though the cheapness was only relative).  </p>



<p>So even when all three asset classes were booming (i.e. stocks, international stocks, and bonds), one of them would have lagged behind the rest so it&#8217;d look cheap relative to the other options and I&#8217;d have no trouble buying it.  The desire to bring my portfolio back in line with my target allocation made putting money into an overheated market easier.</p>



<p>And doing that was the right choice because markets kept going up far longer than I imagined they would.</p>



<p>Check out this Mad Fientist reader email from April of 2014 (6 years ago!):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>…given that the dow and the s&amp;P are due for a correction, would you recommend keeping some money on the sidelines until that happens?</p></blockquote>



<p>And here is my response:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>…market timing is a loser&#8217;s game so I always try to get my money into the market as soon as I can.  If you look back to April of last year, I bet you would have thought that a pullback was imminent and as we know, it wasn&#8217;t.  The market has marched upwards since then so if you had waited for a pullback, you&#8217;d still be waiting.  Also, how will you know it&#8217;s an actual pullback and not just a down day/week?  How long would you wait until you put your money in?  What if the market surges upwards before you do?  There&#8217;s no way to know what&#8217;s going to happen so any sort of timing is a suboptimal strategy in the long run.</p></blockquote>



<p>It was difficult sending that reply because I too felt like the bull market had gone on for a long time so I was expecting a pullback.  But I knew that trying to time the market was a bad idea so I kept putting money in anyway and I kept recommending that readers do the same.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m glad I did because the market kept going up until it hit its February 19th high this year, gaining another 80%+!</p>



<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stock-prices.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-6465" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stock-prices.png" alt="Stock Prices Before and After Email" width="700"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stock Prices Before and After Email (Green Arrow)</p></div>



<p>The point is, your emotions are trying to force you to change your actions but systems and rules help you fight against that.</p>



<h2>Why Those Percentages?</h2>



<p>I didn&#8217;t put a lot of thought into the percentages I picked because I&#8217;m more concerned with sticking to the percentages than picking the perfect percentages.</p>



<p>I simply looked at the efficient frontier graphs for the various allocations and picked a blend that had high expected returns and acceptable volatility.</p>



<p><em>For more information on the efficient frontier, check out this post I wrote back in 2013 &#8211; <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/unique-risk-minimum-variance-portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minimum Variance Portfolio</a></em></p>



<h3>US vs. International Stocks</h3>



<p>As you can see on the efficient frontier for US and International stocks, somewhere around 70%/30% seems to be a sweet spot for high expected returns and low volatility.</p>



<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/us-international-efficient-frontier.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-6465" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/us-international-efficient-frontier.png" alt="U.S./International Stock Efficient Frontier Graph" width="700"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Domestic/International</p></div>



<p>I settled on 72%/28% US/International for myself because 2s and 8s are nicer-colored numbers in my mind than the other options (I&#8217;m actually serious&#8230;this is why I try to take my ridiculous brain out of my investing decision-making as much as possible).</p>



<h3>Stocks vs. Bonds</h3>



<p>Here is the efficient frontier for stocks and bonds (for 1960-2004):</p>



<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stocks-bonds-efficient-frontier.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-6465" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stocks-bonds-efficient-frontier.png" alt="Stocks/Bonds Efficient Frontier Graph" width="700" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1005</p></div>



<p>I settled on 90%/10% for my allocation because I want to mainly be in stocks but I wanted to at least have some bonds for a bit of diversification and to have another asset class to rebalance with.</p>



<h3>Personal Efficiency Graph</h3>



<p>These decisions provide me with an aggressive but efficient allocation, as indicated by my own portfolio&#8217;s efficiency graph:</p>



<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mad-fientist-portfolio-efficiency-graph.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-6465" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mad-fientist-portfolio-efficiency-graph.png" alt="Mad Fientist's Portfolio Efficiency Graph" width="700" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Efficiency Graph for My Portfolio</p></div>

<h2>Asset Location</h2>



<p>In addition to deciding what to invest in (and how much), it&#8217;s also important to think about where each of those funds is going to live.</p>



<p>Income from bonds usually gets taxed as ordinary income, so bonds are better off in a tax-deferred account like an IRA or 401(k).</p>



<p>With international stock funds, you can sometimes get a tax credit for foreign taxes paid but only if those funds are in a taxable account.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a great <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Boglehead post (opens in a new tab)">Boglehead post</a> all about asset location, if you want to dive deeper into this important aspect of investing.</p>



<p>This is where I decided to put my different assets:</p>



<ul><li>Bonds &#8211; Tax-Deferred Accounts (e.g. Traditional IRA, 403b, etc.)</li><li>International Stocks &#8211; Taxable Account </li><li>US Stocks &#8211; Everywhere and Anywhere</li></ul>



<h3>How This Tricked Me into Buying Bonds</h3>



<p>These asset location decisions helped me buy into bonds over the last few years and I&#8217;m glad that I did.</p>



<p>I had been sitting on too much cash over the last few years and I wanted to add to my portfolio but stocks were hitting record highs and I was getting uneasy.  </p>



<p>My cash wasn&#8217;t being productive so I wanted to diversify into bonds but they seemed like they were terrible investments at the time too.  Interest rates were at record lows and it seemed they could only go up from there (which would cause the value of the bonds to drop).</p>



<p>I knew that buying bonds was the right decision for my long-term plans but I couldn&#8217;t force myself to use my cash to buy bonds.</p>



<p>Thankfully, my portfolio structure helped trick me into doing it.  Here&#8217;s what I did:</p>



<ul><li>I sold $x of stocks in my IRA and bought $x of bonds in the same account</li><li>I bought $x of stocks in my taxable account using my cash</li></ul>



<p>So in effect, I just bought $x bonds with my cash but it felt way better than that.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how it felt in my mind…</p>



<ul><li>Hell yeah!! I locked in all those juicy stock gains and didn&#8217;t have to pay any tax on them because they&#8217;re in my IRA!</li><li>I bought the bonds that my portfolio needed and I put them in my tax-deferred IRA, which is where they need to be!</li><li>I maintained my appropriate stock allocation but now I have some stocks in my taxable account with a high cost basis, which I can use for <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.madfientist.com/tax-loss-harvesting/" target="_blank">tax-loss harvesting</a> next time the markets go down!</li></ul>



<p>This simple change in thinking helped me do something I had been putting off for months and it worked out great because here&#8217;s what happened to the value of those bonds since then (let me remind you, I was <em>convinced</em> when I bought them that they only had one way to go…down):</p>



<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bond-prices.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-6465" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bond-prices.png" alt="Bond Prices" width="700" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Green arrows indicate where I bought (despite thinking prices would go down)</p></div>



<p><em>Side Note: It is surprising how easy it is to delude yourself into thinking you know where the markets are going, no matter how many times you failed to make accurate predictions in the past!</em></p>



<h2>Ranges</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s return to the ranges I talked about before.</p>



<p>I mentioned that I try to have 0%-10% bonds and 90-100% stocks.</p>



<p>This is great because it allows me to feel like I&#8217;m timing the market (which my brain loves to do) without damaging my long-term investing success.</p>



<p>When stocks felt overvalued last year, I put more money into bonds and it felt better than investing in expensive stocks.  I kept adding to bonds until I got up to 10%. </p>



<p>Now that stocks have gone down and bonds have gone up, I can move back into a heavier stock allocation and feel like I&#8217;m taking advantage of the lower stock prices (by selling bonds to buy stocks).</p>



<h2>Picking a Range</h2>



<p>If you don&#8217;t know what allocation range you&#8217;d be comfortable with, now is a great time to figure it out.</p>



<p>Think about how you felt when markets were at all-time highs in February and compare it to how you felt in March when they were over 30% down.  </p>



<p>In March, did you wish you weren&#8217;t taking as many risks in February?  Did you freak out more than you expected when stocks crashed?  Did you wish you had constructed your portfolio differently to better handle a big drop like that?</p>



<p>Now, assume these recent market gains are the start of a new multi-year bull market.  What would you like to have your portfolio look like at this stage?  </p>



<p>If you can figure out a happy allocation for each of these scenarios, set those numbers as your range.</p>



<h2>Adjust as You Go</h2>



<p>What you come up with doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect and it will likely change as your situation changes.</p>



<p>Before this latest downturn, I was very comfortable being 100% in stocks.  I knew that I had a long time horizon and I still had income coming in so I was happy taking more risks to get higher expected returns.  </p>



<p>But when the markets started tanking in March, I was relieved to have 10% in bonds.  I already hit my FI number so why try to get an outsized return with 100% stocks and deal with the increased risks associated with that allocation when I already have enough?</p>



<p>I also like having three different types of assets to rebalance between so I now realize that 10% bonds should be my <em>minimum</em>.  My new bond range is 10%-20% and I imagine that will continue increasing as the years go by.</p>



<p>If stocks hit new lows before this virus is finished, I can sell bonds until I hit 10% and then, when stocks start increasing again, I can slowly build up my bond balance until I hit 20% (hopefully right when the stock market tops out again next time).</p>



<h2>Catching a Falling Knife (More Intelligently)</h2>



<p>This brings us back to my problem at the beginning of this article &#8211; trying to buy stocks when the markets are tanking.</p>



<p>I thought I&#8217;d be prepared this time but my brain and emotions still got in the way so I needed more rules/systems.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what I came up with…</p>



<p>After the markets had already fallen ~12% from their highs and I felt like much more falling was possible, I created a spreadsheet for my cash-deploying strategy.</p>



<p>I knew that I had $x in cash that I&#8217;d be willing to deploy and I had $y in bonds that I could sell (to buy more stocks) so I determined the max I could add to my stock portfolio as stock prices decreased and I split up my contributions.</p>



<p>I set up buying opportunities at -15%, -20%, -25%, -30%, -35%, and -40%.  And instead of buying fewer shares as the market dropped, as I did in 2007/2008, I planned on increasing my purchases at each stage.</p>



<p>So I determined a value $x where I could invest $x at -15%, $1.5x at -20%, $2x at -25%, $3x at -30%, $3x at -35%, and $3x at -40%.</p>



<p>If the market ends up going below 40% the February highs, that&#8217;s when I start selling even more bonds to buy stocks.  </p>



<p>The good thing about this plan is that I&#8217;m happy anywhere in my range so if markets don&#8217;t revisit the March lows, I at least deployed a big chunk of my cash and will benefit from the recovery.  </p>



<p>If stocks do make new lows and I end up deploying all my cash and selling more bonds, I&#8217;ll still have an appropriate allocation for my risk tolerance and I&#8217;ll be an even better position to take advantage of any recovery that takes place.</p>



<h2>Limit Orders</h2>



<p>Since this plan provides specific prices to target, I can set up limit orders in Vanguard to automatically buy shares. This removes the possibility of my brain sabotaging anything.</p>



<p><em>Note: Limit orders are stock buy/sell orders that specify a price target (e.g. buy x shares of VTI but only if the price is lower than $y).</em></p>



<p>Limit orders are great because often, especially in extremely volatile times like these, your orders can get filled at prices even lower than the limit price you set.  For example, I had set an order to buy VTI at $143.06 and I ended up getting it for $140.00 because markets opened much lower than expected.</p>



<p><em>Side note: I accidentally got a ridiculous deal on some shares during the Flash Crash because I had a limit order set up that got filled at an insanely low price.  That&#8217;s why I now set up limit orders whenever I expect a volatile open.</em></p>



<h2>Spreadsheet</h2>



<p>If you already downloaded the spreadsheet I mentioned at the beginning of this post, you&#8217;ll notice there&#8217;s a tab call &#8220;Bear-Market Buying&#8221;.</p>



<p><em>If you haven&#8217;t yet downloaded the spreadsheet, <a href="https://pages.madfientist.com/portfolio-strategies" rel="noopener noindex" target="_blank">click here to download now</a>!</em></p>



<p>This spreadsheet allows you to easily come up with your own price targets for future market drops.</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="491" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bear-market-buying.png" alt="Bear-Market Buying Strategy" class="wp-image-6660" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bear-market-buying.png 700w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bear-market-buying-300x210.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure></div>
		


<p>All you need to do is fill in the green boxes with your settings and the spreadsheet will automatically calculate the price targets and number of shares to buy at each target.  </p>



<p>Then, you can create limit orders for these prices and completely ignore what the market is doing!</p>



<h2>Why Are These Systems/Rules/Plans Valuable?</h2>



<p>Are these plans and rules perfect?  </p>



<p>Absolutely not.</p>



<p>They don&#8217;t have to be though.  As long as they keep me from sabotaging myself, they&#8217;re worthwhile.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter what&#8217;s going on in the outside world because I know if I follow my rules, I&#8217;ll be doing the right thing for my long-term investing goals.</p>



<p>It allows me to feel good about my actions (or inaction), even in times when my brain is screaming that I&#8217;m doing it wrong. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve accepted that I&#8217;m a fallible human.  I understand that my emotions are influencing me far more often than I like.  </p>



<p>Rather than fight who I am, I instead try to minimize the influence those emotions have on my investing with rules, systems, and automations.</p>



<p>And in highly uncertain times like these, those things can make all the difference.</p>



<h2>What About You?</h2>



<p>Do you have any portfolio rules you follow?  Do you have a better strategy for catching a falling knife?  How has your thinking changed during this latest market turmoil?</p>

<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Hey, what&#8217;s up everybody? It&#8217;s the Mad Fientist. Welcome to the Financial Independence Podcast, the podcast where I get inside the brains of the best and brightest in personal finance to find out how they achieved financial independence. I&#8217;m not doing that today though, because I&#8217;ve already had this guest on twice before. The first time, way back in October of 2012. And then the second time was June of 2016 so this is his four year invite back onto the show. It is none other than JL Collins himself. Welcome.
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Thank you, Brandon. It&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s an honor to be here. I&#8217;m a little sorry that it took a bear market to make it happen, but it&#8217;s always a pleasure to talk to you.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> You know what? We&#8217;ve been doing this for a while, so my blog started way back in early 2012 I think yours was way back in 2011 and to be honest, I&#8217;m surprised it took this long to experience a crash like we&#8217;re experiencing now. Is it the same for you?
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Yeah, I would say exactly. You know, we had obviously the, I started my blog in 2011 as you point out, and few years before that, we had the big meltdown in 07/08 and since then the market&#8217;s done almost nothing but relentlessly go up with a couple of 10% corrections scattered over the years, and in December of 2018, there was a bear market.
<br/><br/>
Bear markets are technically defined as a 20% plus drop. That happened right around Christmas, but it recovered so quickly that I don&#8217;t think most people even remember it. But other than that, this is the one everybody&#8217;s been expecting or should have been expecting.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> But I don&#8217;t think anyone would have predicted how it actually came about with the coronavirus and the global pandemic. And, I just wanted to say thanks for coming on the show. This is a very last-minute podcast. I emailed you and you responded, and now we&#8217;re talking, and I&#8217;m talking on an iPhone headphones microphone. So apologies for the bad sound quality on my end, but this was something I thought would be better to get out as soon as possible. So thanks for not only joining me but doing it so quickly.
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Well, we&#8217;re nomadic these days, you know, so I&#8217;m doing this without any headphone or microphone at all, just sitting in the hotel room, in front of my laptop. But I want to address a comment you made just a moment ago and that nobody would have expected that the coronavirus or, or something like it would be what finally triggered a bear market.
<br/><br/>
But that&#8217;s always true of bear markets. I mean, the things that trigger them are always a surprise. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> And that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s exactly what I wanted to get you on the show for it because every time it happens, it feels like this time is different and that&#8217;s what makes these things so scary for investors. That&#8217;s what makes it hard to do what you had planned to do the next time stocks pulled back and it&#8217;s because it always feels like this time is different. 
<br/><br/>
Do you feel like all the other ones that you&#8217;ve lived through and invested through in the past have always felt like this time is different?
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Well, yes, absolutely. Every time there&#8217;s a bear market, it has the feeling that it&#8217;s something major and it&#8217;s something different and it&#8217;s terrifying. And almost, if you think about it, that&#8217;s by definition, because if it were not those things, there would not be a bear market. 
You know, if people didn&#8217;t feel that way, if people weren&#8217;t scared, they wouldn&#8217;t be panicking.
And if they weren&#8217;t panicking, they wouldn&#8217;t be selling off their stocks. And by the way, creating a great buying opportunity for more level headed people. So by definition, every time there&#8217;s a bear market or a market crash, it&#8217;s something that feels different, feels scary, and feels like it&#8217;s never going to end.
But it will.
<br/><br/>
And by the way&#8230;If someday I&#8217;m wrong about that, then where you&#8217;re invested will be the least of our problems. So let&#8217;s think about the coronavirus in those terms, right? If the coronavirus turns out to be the new black death and it kills 60% of the population, then yeah, it&#8217;s probably going to be a long time before the stock market recovers.
<br/><br/>
Is that likely to happen? I don&#8217;t think so. There&#8217;s nothing we can do about it if it does happen that we being the average person on the street. What&#8217;s more likely, and not the least of for reasons that are, that we now have an understanding of the germ theory of disease as an example.
<br/><br/>
We understand basic hygiene, which they didn&#8217;t the 1300/1400s, so it&#8217;s unlikely to be something like that. And if it&#8217;s something that runs it, it&#8217;s course, as past epidemics have that scared the market and scared people in general. Then it&#8217;ll run its course over whatever period of time that takes and the market will recover.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. I just saw a quote on Twitter, Michael Batnick put it up there and, it was in the analogy. If you own a hotel by the beach and there&#8217;s a big hurricane coming, you&#8217;re probably going to shut down the hotel for a few days, and you&#8217;re going to not obviously profit during those days, but when you open back up again, you still have the same business, you still have the same employees and profitability and all those sorts of things.
<br/><br/>
And this is sorta like this in a way, but obviously, we don&#8217;t know how big the storm is. And I think maybe that&#8217;s where a lot of the fear is coming from. Because if this is a year-long storm, then maybe that hotel doesn&#8217;t have the cash reserves to keep the building and keep servicing the mortgage on that building. Obviously, the employees are going to be laid off for a lot longer than they can handle and things like that. So it seems like that&#8217;s maybe a huge reason that there&#8217;s so much fear in the markets because we don&#8217;t really know how to fix it. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Now there&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty, and again, that&#8217;s the definition of a bear market. That&#8217;s what triggers a bear market. If you didn&#8217;t have that uncertainty, if you didn&#8217;t have some scary thing, then there wouldn&#8217;t be a bear market. My most recent post on the blog there, I have a reader named Gino, and he put up a great line.
<br/><br/>
He said we&#8217;re compensated with higher rates of return in stocks because of ugly times like this.
<br/><br/> 
And he&#8217;s exactly right. If the stocks, if, if the stock market was always smooth sailing, then, we wouldn&#8217;t be compensated with the higher returns that you get over bonds. And I think your analogy of a hurricane and that hotel is a really good one because if you have a hotel in a place where hurricanes happen, then you better be prepared for when they happen, even if they&#8217;re severe so that they don&#8217;t drive you out of business. And if you don&#8217;t do that preparation, then the hurricane can easily drive you out of business. If you do the preparation, then you&#8217;re going to be able to hang on and the time to do that preparation is not in the middle of the hurricane, which is where we are now.
<br/><br/>
I wrote a post in 2018 when everything was going swimmingly and the market seemed like it was never going to have a pullback called, Why You Should Not be in the Stock Market. That&#8217;s the time to think about whether or not you should be in the stock market. Now is not time. And if you live in a place where hurricanes are an annual event, then you need to expect hurricanes.
<br/><br/>
If you invest in the stock market and you want those outsized returns that the market provides, you need to understand that bear markets are, are part of the landscape, and you should never be surprised by them, any more than if you live in northern New England, you should be surprised by blizzards or if you live in Southern Florida, you should be surprised by hurricanes. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s part of the territory.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Absolutely. And to go back to the reader&#8217;s point that yeah, this is like the cost of entry. This is the cost of your admission ticket to those outsize gains is that you have to put up with times like these where it&#8217;s scary and you&#8217;re losing a big percentage of your net worth. I also think it could be potentially, if you&#8217;re paying, you have to pay that admission ticket anyway you might as well try to learn something from the process. Because in 2018, reading that post and thinking, Oh, you know, I&#8217;m going to be able to handle the next thing and it&#8217;s going to be easy because I know that I just keep investing and yeah, maybe my 100% stock portfolio is a bit on the riskier side, but I know that I don&#8217;t need that money for 30 years so I&#8217;ll be sensible when it happens. And for a lot of our readers and listeners, we&#8217;ve been doing this since 2011 /2012, there hasn&#8217;t been a scary time like this, so going through it is quite a lot different than thinking about going through it.
Do you agree? And if so, what? What should people thinking be thinking about now to try to learn from this experience and maybe make adjustments when we get out of the other end of this so that the next one is easier to handle.
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> So, you know, it&#8217;s one of the things that I&#8217;ve wondered over the years, and I&#8217;ve, as you point out, I&#8217;ve been writing my blog since 2011 and this is really the first storm that, we&#8217;ve had in that time. One of the things that I&#8217;ve wondered is whether people could read what I&#8217;ve written about&#8230;needing to expect bear markets, needing to assess their own risk tolerance beforehand, understanding that these are normal events that you have to expect them, that they should never surprise you. I&#8217;ve often wondered if you can absorb that just by reading it or if you have to live through it and make the mistake, maybe by panicking and selling at the bottom to really appreciate it.
<br/><br/>
I know I had to make the mistake in 87 of losing my nerve and selling at the bottom. And it&#8217;s interesting, and this is by no means scientific, but if I look at the comments that I&#8217;ve gotten on my last couple of posts. Since this bear market began, they run about two thirds to one third, two-thirds of my commenters are saying, yes, I knew this was coming and cause I read your stock series, I read your book, I understand that bear markets are normal and, and I&#8217;m sleeping like a baby. It&#8217;s not bothering me. And about one third are panicked and saying, should I sell now and get back in when it goes lower?
<br/><br/>
You know, nobody knows. We&#8217;re recording this on Sunday. Last Friday, the market was up 10%, the Thursday, the day before, was down 10% roughly. Nobody knows what Monday&#8217;s going to bring. And anybody who tells you they know, they&#8217;re just guessing. And. If they&#8217;re right, they just got lucky. You can&#8217;t time the market
So, based on the comments, I&#8217;m getting about two-thirds of the people, really have absorbed the message and understand what to do and, and what the real situation is. And another third, I think, didn&#8217;t really understand themselves as thoroughly as they might have their own risk tolerance.
<br/><br/>
Maybe they didn&#8217;t read my stuff or other stuff on this subject as closely as they should have, but, and maybe they&#8217;ll have to live through it and sell out at the bottom and, and, watch it, recover without them, to learn the lesson. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s what I had to do in 87.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. So let&#8217;s talk about 87, because I was not invested back then. I was five at the time, so I wasn&#8217;t thinking about any of this stuff, but,
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Wait you? You were five years old. You still weren&#8217;t invested?
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> I wasn&#8217;t.
<br/><br/>
I think my dad bought me my first four shares when I was 10, so I was halfway there. But yeah, so talk about that. What was that one like and why did that one feel different and what did you do wrong at that stage.
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Well, so 1987, it&#8217;s testing my memory a little bit, &#8217;cause that is a long time ago. But, what I do remember clearly was black Monday, which&#8230; It&#8217;s still to this day, even given the great depression, even given 07/08, even given the drops that we&#8217;ve had now, was the single biggest percentage drop in market history in a day.
<br/><br/>
And it was 23/24%, as I recall, in one day. And this is in the days, by the way, this is obviously before the internet, before the widespread use of, of computers even then it was in those days I, I had a stockbroker as everybody did and I had a job and I was working and I didn&#8217;t know the market had crashed.
<br/><br/>
And at the end of the day, I forget why, I called Wayne, who was my stockbroker, but it wasn&#8217;t because of anything going on in the market, cause I didn&#8217;t know and I called him at the end of the day and, he and I were kind of friends too, and I says, how&#8217;s it going, man? And there&#8217;s this long pause at the end of the phone.
<br/><br/>
He&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re joking, right? And I could tell from the tone of his voice something bad had happened. I said, no, what? What&#8217;s going on? He said Jim, we just had the biggest meltdown in history, and you know, I&#8217;ve had people calling me in panic all day and that&#8217;s how I first found out.
<br/><br/>
And then after that, that black Monday, that big drop, the market continued to grind down. Slowly, but further and further and further down, and at the time I knew all the principals we&#8217;re talking about. It&#8217;s not like I hadn&#8217;t heard this stuff. I knew what I should do. I knew I should stay the course. I knew that it was temporary. I knew that the market would recover. And a couple of months later along by December, I lost my nerve and I sold and I went to cash. And if I didn&#8217;t sell at the exact bottom, it was close enough not to matter. And of course, then the market, as it always does, began its relentless rise again and I watched it and I couldn&#8217;t believe it, and I kept expecting it to fall back to where I could buy it lower than what I sold it at. And of course, that never happened in by the time I got back in, it recaptured all of its losses and posted gains. I never forgot that lesson. And that lesson is what sustained me in 07/08.
<br/><br/>
Because that was a terrifying time. And I&#8217;m not sure that if I had not had the experience of 87, that I would&#8217;ve been able to stay the course in 08, not to mention the more minor problems that happened between those two events. But, you know, 08 was the big one.
<br/><br/>
I&#8217;m not sure I had the fortitude to stick through it, which is why I hope that my writings provide people what they need so they don&#8217;t have to go through that experience. But I don&#8217;t know that that&#8217;s the case.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah, so I&#8217;m even struggling with something now. So I was invested in, 08. And I saw my net worth get chopped in half. And I luckily didn&#8217;t sell. And I was like, well, this is a good sign. You know, I don&#8217;t have to worry about myself panicking. So, I can handle a high percentage of stocks in my portfolio because I&#8217;ve tested myself in 07/08 and I succeeded and didn&#8217;t do anything silly.
<br/><br/>
One thing that I did do was I had cash at the time that I needed to deploy cause we had sold a house in Scotland. And we had invested half of it in Scotland before we left, but then we had the other half in the States and I was slowly investing it and this was as the market was tanking and I put a big chunk in and then it tanked a little bit more.
<br/><br/>
And then I put a smaller chunk in because I had less money left and it tanked more. Put a little bit less in again and then it really tanked. And anyway, long story short, I didn&#8217;t get all of the cash in because I was trying to time the bottom, so I thought I learned my lesson back then, but then here we are now and I realized that I actually need stricter systems, and I&#8217;m writing a post about this that I hopefully will get out this week as well after this podcast goes out.
<br/><br/>
But, I realized that I need stricter systems because my tendencies come back to haunt me in times when I think I know better, like, oh, I think, I think it&#8217;s going to go down more, so I&#8217;m just going to wait, which was the same trap I fell into back in 2008. So is there anything that you&#8217;ve learned in subsequent crashes that you found useful, to handle future ones?
<br/><br/>
Or is there anything that people can do in a time like this, like diary about their feelings and their emotions and their thoughts about where they think the markets are going, or anything like that that you would recommend to listeners out there that maybe this is their first one they&#8217;re going through.
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Well, I, you know, the very first post in my stock series is titled there&#8217;s a major, major market crash coming. And the gist of that post is you need to toughen up, cupcake and deal with it, ride through it. And then in other parts of the stock series, and in the book, I talk about there&#8217;s two financial phases in your life, broadly speaking. One is when you&#8217;re building your wealth and you&#8217;re working, and you have earned income which provides cash flow, and if you&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re interested in becoming financially independent, you are living on less than you&#8217;re earning and you&#8217;re taking part of those earnings, that cash flow and you&#8217;re investing it, and ideally, you&#8217;re investing it in a total stock market fund or an S&#038;P 500 fund and you&#8217;re holding it forever. Now. The fact that you have that cash flow going in on a regular basis smooths the ride for you and it allows you to take advantage of times like this.
<br/><br/>
And so I would say especially to those people, those younger people who are working on building their wealth, a bear market like this one is a huge gift. In fact, the best thing that can happen to you when you&#8217;re building your wealth and investing is that you get to buy shares on sale, which is what&#8217;s going on now.
<br/><br/>
So certainly those people should keep investing just as they were before. This is a great time to buy stocks on sale. Now the other side of that coin is when you&#8217;re in what I call the wealth preservation stage, which is when you&#8217;re living on the portfolio, and that&#8217;s the time when you introduce bonds because you no longer have that earned income cashflow to smooth the ride so you need something else, and that&#8217;s the role bonds can play and that&#8217;s when you get into your asset allocation. I have a post in the stock series about how to choose your asset allocation and what that allocation is between stocks and bonds is a very personal thing that depends on your own situation and your own tolerance for volatility.
<br/><br/>
But once you have bonds in the mix, then when the market does something, dramatic, either dramatic on the upside or dramatic on the downside like we&#8217;re seeing now, your allocation gets out of whack and you adjust it. Right now, you&#8217;d be adjusting it by selling bonds and buying more stock to bring the stock part of it up.
<br/><br/>
Well, now that allows you to buy stock at a bargain price. And by the same time, when the market goes back up and now the percentage of bonds is lower than you intended it to be, you sell some of the stock and the bonds and, and you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re selling at the high. So that&#8217;s the way you deal with volatility rather than panicking and trying to figure out how to, how to time it.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> It was only, I think, February 19th that we hit all-time highs and then it was Thursday of last week that we were 20% down.
<br/><br/>
I think that gives people a unique viewpoint of their temperament and how they handle risk. Because just a few weeks ago, you&#8217;re at that high greed stage where, you know, nothing could go wrong. I&#8217;m so intelligent. I&#8217;m making so much money in the markets and this is the allocation that I&#8217;m happy with.
<br/><br/>
And then only a few weeks later, now we&#8217;re in panic/fear mode and that&#8217;s sort of the reason why I&#8217;m writing this post that I hope to get out next week is this is a unique opportunity to sort of tap into both of those sides of your brain because they happen so quickly to then maybe make changes to that asset allocation that is so important.
<br/><br/>
Do you see this as an opportunity for that as well?
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Sure. I think this is a great opportunity for self-reflection. I mean, again, I, ideally you would have, you would have read my post on why you should not be in the stock market in 2018, done the reflection then, understood yourself well enough to know what allocation into stocks works for you.
<br/><br/>
But I would make a point that bear markets almost always happen very fast. There&#8217;s a saying on Wall Street that the stock market takes the stairs up and it takes the express elevator down. And so stocks tend to fall very fast and hard in a bear market and they tend to grind slowly up in bull markets.
<br/><br/>
So there is nothing that unique about this one, might be a little faster than some in the past, but, but it&#8217;s still following the same pattern of, of these things happened pretty quickly. And then when they finally do hit bottom, and there&#8217;s no way to predict when that is, then suddenly, you know, a couple of months later, people are noticing, wow, you know, this is, this is going back up again.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> And it&#8217;s hard to predict when that is, obviously because you see rallies like you did on Friday, like 10% up day. Does that mean we&#8217;re out of the, out of the woods? I don&#8217;t think so.
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Right. You can&#8217;t, you can&#8217;t predict it at all. And the last two days of last week are a perfect example of that. Cause you go into Thursday and you&#8217;d say, well, it&#8217;s had a major collapse of almost 10% and the tendency is going to be so, Oh my goodness, Friday is going to be even worse, and then Friday recovers almost all of those losses in a single day.
<br/><br/>
There&#8217;s no predictive value in that at all. I mean, at least not for me. I have no idea what&#8217;s going to happen on Monday. I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;re seasoned enough that you don&#8217;t have any idea that you understand. You didn&#8217;t have any idea. Oh, what we could do, Brandon, is we could sit here and I could say, you know what Brandon, it&#8217;s going up on Monday and you could say, no, J L it&#8217;s going down on Monday. And one of us might be right.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> I stopped predicting when you had your annual series about predicting what the market was going to end that. And I participated I think for two or three years, way back in 2012, 2013. And, I got it terribly wrong both times and then I gave up.
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> That was a lot of fun. For your listeners who might not be familiar, a few years ago, I did a stock-picking contest at the beginning of each year where gave readers an opportunity to weigh in and say what the high for the year was going to be, what the low for the year was going to be, and what the close was going to be. But the irony of that, of course, is I created it to illustrate in real-time how difficult timing the market is, and ironically, the first year I nailed it.
<br/><br/>
It looked like I had great predictive abilities, and it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m not making the point I wanted to make.
<br/><br/>
Subsequent years I proved that that was just a fluke of luck.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Yeah. Well, so going back to that beach analogy, actually, so as we&#8217;ve been talking, I was thinking, the problem with this hurricane is we don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s going to last and whether the hotel is going to have enough cash reserves to last.
<br/><br/>
But that&#8217;s the point of diversifying and betting on all the companies in the market and buying a total stock market index fund because this will cause some of those hotels to not be able to survive but the ones that are left are hopefully the strongest of the bunch that are then going to go on and make even more money in the future potentially.
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> I think it is a good way of summing it up. And you&#8217;re pointing out that bear markets are actually a healthy, necessary part of the process. And this one is no different. The other thing that I would like our listeners to appreciate, and I wrote a post back in 2017, called time machine and the future return of stocks.
<br/><br/>
And basically, it was looking at the performance of the stock market from 1975, which happened to be the year that I started investing, to 2015/2016/2017, about 40 plus years, the market, on average, went up just shy of 12% a year. Which is an incredible performance. I mean, just absolutely incredible, and I would certainly not suggest to anybody listening that you can expect that going forward but the point of that post is I go through all of the traumas and problems that happened in those 40 years. This was not a perfect, smooth, golden period of time to be an investor, and yet the markets still performed. And so obviously we&#8217;re going to look back on, on this moment in time, and as, as there were many moments in time I point out in that post in those 40 years, as a difficult moment. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the market isn&#8217;t going to provide handsome returns over the next couple of decades.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Absolutely. Well, I will link to all those posts that you&#8217;ve mentioned in the show notes so people can go there and link over and check it out. Obviously, the Simple Path to Wealth is a great book to read in times like this, if you haven&#8217;t read it yet, so I&#8217;ll also link to that. Yeah, Jim, I really appreciate it.
I knew you&#8217;d be a calming voice in a chaotic time. which hopefully will make people out there feel better if this is the first time that you&#8217;re going through that. 
<br/><br/>
I usually ask all of my guests, what&#8217;s one piece of advice you give to somebody on the path to financial independence? And you&#8217;ve answered it twice before so if people want to hear your answer, they can go to madfientist.com/advice and I put together a PDF containing all the great answers I&#8217;ve received over the years. But today I&#8217;ll just ask you what, what&#8217;s one piece of advice you&#8217;d give to somebody out there that maybe is freaking out and maybe reading about getting punched in the face is a lot different than getting punched in the face and they&#8217;re struggling.
<br/><br/>
What&#8217;s one piece of advice you&#8217;d give them?
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Well, you know, as, as we talked about earlier, that the time to figure out what your investing strategy is, what your risk tolerance is, what your allocation should be, is not in the middle of the hurricane, which is where we are now. It&#8217;s when the seas are calm. Obviously that&#8217;s hindsight. So I would say to anybody who&#8217;s panicking at the moment, don&#8217;t do anything.
<br/><br/>
Understand how you&#8217;re feeling and learn from the experience. And then when things are calm and the market has begun to turn around and began to go up again, then revisit your allocation and then make adjustments according to what you learned about yourself. Not what you learned about the market because the market&#8217;s doing what the market does.
Bear markets are part of the process, so there&#8217;s nothing unique in market behavior going on here. What you&#8217;re learning about is how you react to that behavior, what your behavior is, and, after the markets calm down and if you were too aggressive, before then, you could make adjustments then, but don&#8217;t do anything now.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Perfect. Thank you so much, Jim. Really appreciate it. And yeah, just hope everyone out there stays safe. Obviously, we don&#8217;t touch on any health stuff here, and that may seem cold and clinical to talk about money when everyone&#8217;s panicking and a lot of people are suffering, but this is what we do and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s still an important part of life even though there&#8217;s other more important things going on.
<br/><br/>
So everybody stay safe out there. Jim, have a great time traveling around and hopefully, you guys can still enjoy your nomadic life when things are getting locked down a little bit for the time being. And again, I really appreciate you coming on the show again.
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Well. So far we&#8217;re enjoying it a lot. And I think that last point you made is critical. I think people should forget about your finances for the time being. Ride it out, take care of your health. Changing certain behaviors like shaking hands and what have you are much more important at this time.
<br/><br/>
Take care of your health and, and, your money will take care of itself.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Absolutely. Thanks, Jim. and I will hopefully speak to you again soon and hopefully I won&#8217;t leave it another four years to get them back on the show.
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> Well, thanks for the invitation. It&#8217;s always a pleasure hanging out with you and talking about this stuff.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> All right, Jim, take care. I&#8217;ll speak to you soon.
<br/><br/>
<strong>JL Collins:</strong> You do the same.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Bye.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, I&#8217;m excited to release version 2.0 of the FI Laboratory!</p>



<p>The FI Laboratory is a web application I developed that contains useful tools to help you on your journey to financial independence and early retirement.</p>



<p>To sign up for a free FI Laboratory account, <a href="https://pages.madfientist.com/fi-laboratory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve read the classic book, <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/go/your-money-or-your-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Your Money or Your Life</a>, you&#8217;ll recall that the authors suggest tracking your progress to financial independence on a wall chart.</p>



<p>While tracking your progress is a great idea, I can&#8217;t imagine anyone would want to sit down with a ruler and a pencil every month so I decided to create a nice web application with sexy graphs that you can use instead.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a short video all about it:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="FI Laboratory" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvYQ6-Ys5LY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>FI Tracker</h2>



<p>The FI Tracker part of the application allows you to enter your monthly financial data and it automatically charts out your progress to FI and estimates how long it will take you to reach financial independence.</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="470" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fi-tracker.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6562" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fi-tracker.png 800w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fi-tracker-300x176.png 300w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fi-tracker-768x451.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>
		


<p>Tracking your progress to FI is beneficial for many reasons. Not only will it help ensure that you stay on target, it should also motivate you to save even more money.</p>



<h3>How to Use</h3>



<p>After you sign up and log in, you&#8217;ll need to enter some of your monthly data.</p>



<p>To enter your numbers, click the Numbers link on the sidebar and then click the New Record button.</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="200" height="260" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/numbers-link.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6563"/></figure></div>
		


<p>Each field on the New Record form contains a help icon that you can hover over to view a description of what information you should enter into the field.</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="375" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/help-icon.png" alt="FI Tracker - Help Icon" class="wp-image-6564" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/help-icon.png 800w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/help-icon-300x141.png 300w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/help-icon-768x360.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>
		


<h3>Personal Capital</h3>



<p>The easiest way to compute your monthly numbers is to sign up for a <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/go/personal-capital/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">free Personal Capital account</a> and let their software calculate everything for you (for more information on Personal Capital, check out <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/personal-capital/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this post</a>).</p>



<p>Most of the information you need for the FI Laboratory is displayed on the initial Personal Capital screen so you can just log in there once a month to get your numbers instead of calculating everything manually (note: the Income value does not contain retirement account contributions so you&#8217;ll need to go to the Transactions page and search for &#8216;Retirement Contributions&#8217; to get those values).</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="656" height="701" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial4-a4f5eff9ada8c6402e1f05d12d3890be.png" alt="Personal Capital" class="wp-image-2684" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial4-a4f5eff9ada8c6402e1f05d12d3890be.png 656w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial4-a4f5eff9ada8c6402e1f05d12d3890be-280x300.png 280w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /></figure></div>
		


<p>If you don&#8217;t have a Personal Capital account yet, <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/go/personal-capital/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">click here</a> to sign up for a free account.</p>



<h3>Graph</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve entered your data, you&#8217;ll be able to view the graph and see how much longer you have until FI.</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="470" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fi-tracker.png" alt="FI Tracker" class="wp-image-6562" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fi-tracker.png 800w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fi-tracker-300x176.png 300w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fi-tracker-768x451.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>
		


<p>The white line shows your monthly expenses, the light green line shows how much monthly income your assets produce (using the withdrawal rate you set on the Assumptions page), and the dashed purple line shows where the light green line needs to reach to achieve financial independence.</p>



<p>The purple FI line is calculated by averaging your previous 12 months of expenses but if you expect your post-FI expenses to be different than your current expenses, you can set the Future Expenses value on the Assumptions page and the graph will use that number instead.</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="459" height="224" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/assumptions.png" alt="FI Tracker - Assumptions" class="wp-image-6565" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/assumptions.png 459w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/assumptions-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /></figure></div>
		


<h3>Additional Instructions</h3>



<p>Hopefully the application is easy to use but for more information on how to use the FI Tracker, you can visit the Help page by clicking the question mark icon at the top of the screen (or watch the video at the top of this post).</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="298" height="106" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/header-bar.png" alt="FI Laboratory - Header Bar" class="wp-image-6566"/></figure></div>
		


<h2>FIRE Calculators</h2>



<p>In addition to the FI Tracker, the application also contains some FIRE calculators I&#8217;ve developed over the years.</p>



<h3>Time to FI Calculator</h3>



<p>The first calculator allows you to quickly compute how many years it will take you to reach FI based on your current net worth, monthly savings rate, and monthly expenses.</p>



<h3>Savings Rate FI Calculator</h3>



<p>The second calculator shows how many years it takes to go from $0 to financial independence for different savings rates (this calculator was inspired by Mr. Money Mustache&#8217;s post on <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement</a>).</p>



<h3>Triple Value of Income Calculator</h3>



<p>The Triple Value of Income calculator was created specifically for the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/triple-income-value/">Triple Value of Income</a> article.</p>



<h3>Safe Withdrawal Rate Calculator</h3>



<p>The Safe Withdrawal Rate calculator was created for the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/safe-withdrawal-rate/">Safe Withdrawal Rate</a> post and utilizes the current Shiller CAPE ratio to compute an estimated safe withdrawal rate.</p>



<h2>Travel Hacking</h2>



<p>The final section of the FI Laboratory contains the travel-hacking tools I&#8217;ve built to help you earn frequent flyer miles/points as cheaply and efficiently as possible.</p>



<h3>My Next Card</h3>



<p>The My Next Card page recommends the best credit card offer currently available to you, based on the cards you currently have or have had in the past (see Manage Cards below).</p>



<h3>Manage Cards</h3>



<p>You can keep track of all your credit cards and application/cancellation dates on the Manage Cards page.</p>



			<div class="wp-block-image">
			<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="267" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/manage-cards.png" alt="FI Laboratory - Manage Cards" class="wp-image-6567" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/manage-cards.png 800w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/manage-cards-300x100.png 300w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/manage-cards-768x256.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>
		


<p>Since past cards influence what cards you are able to get in the future (due to the various rules enforced by the issuers), keeping track of all your cards and applications will help you take advantage of the best card offers.</p>



<h3>Credit Card Search Tool</h3>



<p>This takes you to the custom <a href="https://cards.madfientist.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">credit-card search tool</a> I created specifically for travel hackers.</p>



<h3>Travel Card Email Series</h3>



<p>This page allows you to sign up to the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/go/travel-card-series/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">travel-card email series</a> I created (follow link for more details).</p>



<h2>Future Development</h2>



<p>I plan to add additional functionality to the FI Laboratory so if you have any ideas for new features, please let me know!</p>

<p>On today&#8217;s episode of the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.madfientist.com/podcast/" target="_blank">Financial Independence Podcast</a>, I&#8217;m excited to introduce Scott Young!</p>



<p>I first heard about Scott when he decided to <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="complete MIT's entire computer science curriculum in a year (opens in a new tab)">complete MIT&#8217;s entire computer science curriculum in a year</a>.</p>



<p>Scott has taken on a lot of these types of impressive learning projects and he just wrote a great book about it &#8211; <a rel="nofollow  noopener" href="https://amzn.to/31mSdjH?tag=madfientist-20" target="_blank">Ultralearning</a>.</p>



<p>As you know, I&#8217;m attempting to tackle a <a rel="noopener" aria-label="very intimidating project (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.madfientist.com/best-and-worst-about-fi/" target="_blank">very intimidating project</a> myself so what better way to kick off that effort than with my own 3-month ultralearning project!</p>



<p>In today&#8217;s interview, we dive into the details of ultralearning and we design a new ultralearning project from scratch.</p>



<p>Ultralearning projects seem perfect for anyone who is FI or hopes to achieve financial independence one day so hope you get as much out of this discussion as I did!</p>



<p><em>Note: To follow along with my own ultralearning project, here is the new homepage for this experiment &#8211; <a rel="noopener" aria-label="Ultralearning Experiment (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.madfientist.com/ultralearning-experiment" target="_blank">Ultralearning Experiment</a>.

<h2>Full Transcript</h2>



<div class="transcript">
<p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	Hey, what&#8217;s up everybody? It&#8217;s the Mad Fientist. Welcome to another episode of The Financial Independence Podcast. On today&#8217;s episode, I&#8217;m excited to introduce Scott Young. 
</p><p> 
I first came across Scott many years ago actually. I heard about a guy who was doing the entire MIT computer science curriculum for free online in one year. And it was a really inspiring story to hear about how he went about it and how he ended up completing all the classes, all the assignments, all the tests. 
</p><p> 
Oh, he just released a book called Ultralearning where he documents how he came up with this project, how we structured it, and also how he&#8217;s done other similar projects in language learning and creative arts. 
</p><p> 
So, after I read the book, I knew I had to get him on the show because this ultralearning idea seems perfect for people who are just newly retired or who are planning to retire early and want some sort of big project to sink their teeth into after they leave their job. And since I just recently shared in my latest post what I&#8217;ve been up to for all these years and what I&#8217;m hoping to accomplish, I figured it&#8217;d be really interesting if I tried to build my own ultralearning project and have Scott&#8217;s help and input along the way, and then have an experiment that I could share all my results with you. And so, that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m doing. 
</p><p> 
So, if you have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, and you haven&#8217;t checked out my latest post yet, I suggest you do that first because this episode will make a lot more sense. So head over to MadFientist.com/goal, and you can read about it there. 
</p><p> 
And finally, one more thing to tell you about before we get into the interview, I also created an experiments home page since I got a few experiments currently running at the same time. I&#8217;ve collected them all at MadFientist.com/experiments. And you can go there and check out the new ultralearning experiment that just launched today as well as some old ones like the guinea pig experiment and the mortgage payoff experiment and things like that. 	So, head over to MadFientist.com/experiments. 
</p><p> 
That&#8217;s enough for the announcements. I have so many questions I want to ask Scott. So let&#8217;s dive right into it. 	
</p><p> 
Scott, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong> 	Oh, it&#8217;s great to be here.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	So, before we dive in, there&#8217;s a ton of stuff I want to get into. But I want to just pull out a quote that you had in the book: “Your deepest moments of happiness don&#8217;t come from doing easy things. They come from realizing your potential and overcoming your own limiting beliefs about yourself.” And I really couldn&#8217;t agree more with that quote. 
</p><p> 
And that&#8217;s the beauty of financial independence and early retirement, is that you can start tackling some of these bigger projects. 
</p><p> 
And another quote from your book is: “Ultralearning offers a path to master the things that will bring deep satisfaction and self-confidence.” 
</p><p> 
So, it seems like ultralearning is a great thing to maybe follow up your financial independence with because you&#8217;re about to have all this free time and you have a lot more sleep and bandwidth to deal with a bigger project. So it feels like it&#8217;s a great thing to think about as you&#8217;re preparing for potentially an early retirement. 
</p><p> 
So, saying all that, I&#8217;m really excited to chat to you about it. So before we dive in though, can you just tell the audience what ultralearning is and how this whole project came about for you?
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong> 	Yeah, so ultralearning, I know this is not going to be a familiar term for many people who are listening right now. But it is to describe a sort of phenomenon or sort of a set of people that I&#8217;ve encountered in the world that have done just some incredible things, but there didn&#8217;t seem to be a really good term to describe what they&#8217;re doing. 
</p><p> 
And so, the idea is to describe people who have pursued self-directed learning projects, projects where they want to get good at something, but they&#8217;re not doing it through the normal way of paying a bunch of tuition, taking classes. They&#8217;re just learning things on their own… but then also people who really care about doing it well. 
</p><p> 
So, we all have this kind of sense of, “Oh, you know, I&#8217;m going to learn a language” and you just download DuoLingo and you play around for like six months… and maybe you&#8217;ll learn a sentence or two. But this was people who really wanted to break down what it means to learn something well and how to do it in the most effective and efficient way possible. 
</p><p> 
So, these are people that I&#8217;ve encountered such as Benny Lewis who speaks 10+ languages, people like Tristan de Montebello who went from having near zero experience in public speaking to the world championships in public speaking in about seven months, people like Eric Barone who worked on learning every aspect of video game development, art, music, programming, game design, and went on to create a million dollar-selling game. 
</p><p> 
So, I think there&#8217;s a lot of really interesting ideas here about how you can get better at things that you care about. And certainly for the people listening to this, not only the people who, they still haven&#8217;t retired yet, they still have to earn money in their career, building valuable skills can not only allow you to move up in your career or more money, you hit those goals a bit earlier, but they can also allow you to—you know, like we were just talking about build skills and things in your life that give you joy and passion and you just really live your best life. 
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	All those stories that you mentioned and you detail in the book which just help bring the concepts to life, but you&#8217;re sort of selling yourself short as well because you&#8217;ve used these principles yourself in pretty impressive ways. And that&#8217;s actually the first time that I heard about you, was through the MIT experiment. Could you just tell my listeners what that was all about? And was that your first ultralearning sort of experiment?
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong> 	Yeah, I think you could say that was my first ultralearning project. The MIT challenge was a project that I took on 2011. So now looking back, it&#8217;s like almost eight years ago. But the project was to try to learn MIT’s 4-year computer science curriculum—so learning the material that they cover in a normal undergraduate program—and to try to do this by passing the final exams and doing the programming projects that an MIT student would do. 	
</p><p>	
But instead of going to MIT and taking classes and getting a degree and doing all that at the end, I wanted to use their free resources because MIT puts a lot of these classes and lectures and stuff up online for free. 
</p><p> 
And the kind of little twist of this is that I wanted to try to do it in 12 months. So this is a project I started again in October 2011 and completed the last class in September 2012.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	Wow! And you did it for less than $2,000 total, was that right?
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong> 	Yeah, when I was doing it, I wasn&#8217;t really thinking, “Oh, let&#8217;s try to save as much money as possible.” That was just sort of a side effect of how I did it. I think if you were really trying to be cheap, you could have possibly done it for even cheaper. 
</p><p> 
The only cost that I had to spend was on textbooks. And even then, sometimes, I was spending a little bit more because I was getting the textbooks that they recommended which was like an out of print edition, so sometimes it was like a little bit more money. 
</p><p> 
But you don&#8217;t need it for most classes. And I would say, for a lot of classes, it would also be okay if you used a slightly different textbook. I mean, you&#8217;re learning from one or the other. Or you could even just go to the library and put in a request to get it out. So, if I did it with the library method, it would have been hard to do it in 12 months just because it would have taken too long to request all the books. But I could have done it for free if that had been my absolute priority.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	So, it seems like it was a big success. Do you feel like you possibly even learned the material better than you would’ve had had you been in Boston or Cambridge drinking a bunch of beer with undergrads? 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	Well, it’s hard to say. It&#8217;s hard to say. I think if I had been an MIT student—and I don&#8217;t want to discourage anyone who&#8217;s thinking about going to a school. If you can go to MIT, I think, by all means, go to MIT. But for me, that wasn&#8217;t an option. I certainly didn&#8217;t have the money to go to MIT. And obviously, most people, even if you are very smart, you can&#8217;t get into MIT even if you wanted to do that. 
</p><p> 
And I&#8217;m Canadian (I&#8217;m not American). So, if I were to go to study at MIT, then I also had to move, and I&#8217;d also have to get paperwork and all these stuff to get a green card or whatever it is to study there. 
</p><p> 
And so, for me, this was just a much simpler and easier option. 
</p><p> 
So, I don&#8217;t know what I would be doing differently if I had, in some alternate universe, gone to MIT. But what I can say—and I was joking about this on another podcast—that I did another undergrad before. I did a business school education before that that I took the normal pace and I spent tuition. I did all those things. 
</p><p> 
And although that also had some worthwhile moments as an experience, I would say that, in terms of just strictly the amount of stuff I learned and the amount that impacts my life today, I learned more in that one year of doing the MIT challenge than I did in my normal undergrade  that was spread over multiple years. 
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	That&#8217;s amazing. So, this is your first attempt at this ultralearning idea. So you see that it works, and you see that you&#8217;re successful at it. Where did it lead to next?
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong> 	Yeah, this project, I was not only interested in learning computer science, but the initiation of this idea come about because I had met a guy that I mentioned just a bit earlier in the podcast, Benny Lewis. And so this was actually when I was doing my business school undergrad. I was doing an exchange in France. And I was trying to learn French and I was struggling. And I was introduced to this guy, Benny Lewis, who has a website very modestly called Fluent in 3 Months. And I remember my first reaction when I saw that website title, I was like, “This is bullshit! There&#8217;s no way you can learn a language this quickly.” 	
</p><p>
And so, I decided I had to meet Benny. And I did meet him. And I found that what it was wasn’t just, okay, he’s doing one technique differently, like there&#8217;s some little trick, “Oh, you just do this,” and then, all of a sudden, language learning is just effortless and easy, and you just become fluent instantly. 
</p><p> 
But rather, it was his whole approach to the problem of learning. And so this is what I try to talk about in this ultralearning approach. Most people don&#8217;t go this far. Most people don&#8217;t really think about what is the best way to learn this material. They don&#8217;t really optimize everything to make it the most effective possible. 
</p><p> 
It&#8217;s a little bit like if everyone in your life just jogged occasionally, and then you hear about someone running a marathon, and you&#8217;re like, “There&#8217;s no way that the human body can run that far,” it’s a little bit like that, if you&#8217;ve never heard of someone doing this. But obviously, lots of people do run marathons, and you can train for it and practice. 
</p><p> 
It isn&#8217;t to say that everyone does it or everyone should do it. But it is to say that once you know that the human body is capable of that, it causes you to think differently about your own jogging or the little light exercise that you do. 
</p><p> 
And so, similarly, meeting Benny Lewis, really caused me to reflect. I had been, my whole life, in this school system where you have to take the classes, pass the exams, do what you&#8217;re told. It’s very much following the rules rather than really thinking outside the box of, “Okay, this is the skill I want. What&#8217;s the best way to get it?” 
</p><p> 
And so, Benny Lewis was really just sort of inspiring for me in that way. And so, that was sort of part of my inspiration for doing this MIT challenge, sort of seeing how he approached projects—and not only doing the project and learning things, but also writing about it and sharing it with other people. 
</p><p> 
And then, after I did the MIT challenge, it just so happened that good friend of mine was wanting to go travelling for a while. And so, after my somewhat lackluster approach at learning French, I decided, you know what, let&#8217;s maybe try to approach language the Benny Lewis way. 
</p><p> 
So, we did a project which we called The Year Without English where we went to four different countries—Spain, Brazil, China and South Korea. And the idea was that, when we would land in each of these countries, we wouldn&#8217;t speak English to each other or the languages we learned. We would try to speak only in the language we were learning to each other and to everyone we would meet. 
</p><p> 
And that sounds super difficult when I outline it there. But the reality was that, yes, it is kind of frustrating for the beginning, but you quickly get to a level where, even if you&#8217;re not fluent, at least you&#8217;re comfortable using that language. And your proficiency develops much, much, much faster than the normal approach. 
</p><p> 
In Spain, at the very least, by the time we were about a month or a month and a half in, you know, we had friends, we were going on dates, we were going to parties, we were doing all sorts of things that you would do if you were living there… it just happened to be in Spanish. So that was the second big project that I did. 
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	That&#8217;s fantastic. And yeah, you had a TEDx Talk that goes into some more details about that specific project. So I will link to that in the show notes because it&#8217;s really amazing to see the change. In that TEDx Talk, you shared some videos of you at week 1 versus week 12. And it&#8217;s amazing! It looks like you are fluent. And more importantly, as you said, it looks like you&#8217;re so comfortable with it that your learning is surely going to increase at a higher rate than it would be if you’re still not confident and doing the normal thing that everybody else does. 
</p><p> 
And do you think that&#8217;s a big thing that plays a part in it? Ultralearning is a good way to sort of get past that initial, really tough, uncomfortable phase to get to a stage where you can start to see the gains, and therefore have more motivation to continue and to work harder at it? 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong> 	Yeah. So, just before you mentioned that, before I get into that question, you mentioned the TEDx Talk where we had some short clips. And just because of the constraints of the TED Talk format, those clips are quite short. 
</p><p> 
But if you go to my website, we have very long videos of us talking. So I think that’s a much better representation of what kind of level of ability that we were reaching at each stage because, obviously, anyone can sound good for like 15 seconds. But if you have like an unstructured 30-minute conversation, I mean that&#8217;s pretty hard to pull off if you don&#8217;t know anything. 
</p><p> 
So, to go to your point about confidence, this was something that I thought was very interesting with approaching things in this ultralearning way. 
</p><p> 
And I think it brings up a very, very important point because some people I think have taken the idea of this ultralearning and saying, “Okay! Well, I&#8217;m just going to set some super ambitious goal,” and just setting of the ambitious goal is the process by which they’re going to be really good. And then, they start doing it, and they find it really frustrating. They&#8217;re like, “Well, what happened? Why did this person do it and I couldn&#8217;t?” 
</p><p> 
And so, I think I want to clarify here because it&#8217;s not just “Okay! Well, I&#8217;m going to be fluent in three months. And therefore, I&#8217;m an ultra learner. I&#8217;m going to do this really fast.” Rather, what it is is it’s kind of the opposite approach. It&#8217;s not thinking about the goal, but it&#8217;s thinking about what is the process of learning and how do I look at every moment that I&#8217;m spending learning and making little modifications so that you can make it more effective overall? 
</p><p> 
And when you do that—and some of those are big changes. Like I mentioned with language learning, obviously, if you are spending the entirety of your day only speaking in the language you&#8217;re trying to learn, already, that&#8217;s like a night and day difference between how most people learn a language. Most people, you would be lucky if you got an hour of practice in a day; whereas we were getting 8 or 10 hours a day on the regular… every day. That wasn&#8217;t even an unusual day. And it wasn&#8217;t something forced. It was just, well, you just have to get around and buy groceries and live your life. 
</p><p> 
And so, making adjustments like these to how you structure your learning efforts, whether it&#8217;s learning a new skill for a hobby or work, they can make big strides or big improvements. And then, as you&#8217;re seeing yourself improve more rapidly, I think that does build confidence. 
</p><p> 
So certainly, when we were doing this language learning project, when we went to the second country, it was a little bit like we were missionaries for a new religion. We were converted. We knew that this was the approach that worked. And so, I think that&#8217;s something that can&#8217;t be understated when you&#8217;re going into a learning project or when you’re really tackling anything in your life. If you can approach it in such a way that you do build some early success and you get that confidence loop, now when you go off and you do something new or you face new challenges, you approach it from a different perspective. You approach it from this position of confidence and not, “Oh, I&#8217;m the worst in the class. This is awful! I suck in this!” It’s really demotivating constantly. 
</p><p> 
But I think, at the same time, the right way to approach it is, instead of focusing on the outcome of like trying to learn an MIT degree in one year, or trying to learn a language in a month, or trying to do X in a very short period of time, focus on the process first. And then, as you start doing the process, it&#8217;s very easy to sort of pick a goal. Even when you&#8217;re halfway through, you could say, “Okay, three months down the road, let&#8217;s try to aim for this test or this benchmark or this kind of approach” because that will be a lot more successful than if you just arbitrarily pick something and you don&#8217;t focus on the process.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	Yeah, that&#8217;s great to point out. And that&#8217;s exactly why I was so excited to get you on the show, because not only am I very interested in your book—your book was great, I really enjoyed it. But I just released a post recently talking about the fact that one of my biggest ambitions in life is to just write and record and release music. And it&#8217;s the one thing that I feel like I can&#8217;t do because I just have this fixed mindset of like, “Hey, I&#8217;m a math and science guy.” 
</p><p> 
And even though everything else in my life, I feel like, if I work hard enough, I can do it and accomplish it, it’s this other side of things that I feel like, “Oh, maybe I just don&#8217;t have what it takes to be creative or be an artist” or whatever. 
</p><p> 
And luckily, through the writings of James Clear who is the person that wrote the foreword for your book—and he&#8217;s been on the show before—I&#8217;ve got into at least the habit of trying to read music which has totally revolutionized everything because, now, feel like my identity is changing a bit. And it&#8217;s like, “Well, hey! Actually, I am a musician and I could do this.” 
</p><p> 
And it&#8217;s been great. But I feel like, for the past few years, I&#8217;ve just been bouncing around in the dark and hitting off walls and not really sure what direction I&#8217;m going in and if I&#8217;m making progress; whereas now, I feel like at least I&#8217;m out into the light and I&#8217;m going maybe five miles per hour, and I feel like I&#8217;m moving in the right direction. But five miles per hour doesn&#8217;t really feel like you&#8217;re moving when you&#8217;re in a car or whatever. And it&#8217;s not extremely motivating. And I still feel like maybe I&#8217;m slightly pointed in the wrong direction. So, I thought, this is great, I have three months coming up where I have absolutely nothing scheduled. I have no responsibilities really… which is great. So, it&#8217;s like I can dedicate three months to maybe trying out my own ultralearning project. 
</p><p> 
And I&#8217;m not hoping to create this album that I can then release and everybody will love or anything. But if I could get from like 5 miles per hour to maybe 10 or 15 miles per hour and feel the breeze in my hair and sort of make it feel like I&#8217;m making more progress, then that would be amazing. 
</p><p> 
So, do you think an ultralearning project would be ideal for that sort of…?
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	Oh, absolutely. Absolutely! And I think if I were just thinking about your project, one of the challenges—and I think you kind of bring this up a little bit—is that when we talk about big things like music or art or a new language or programming or whatever it is, it can often feel overwhelming because the scope of what we want to learn is just so broad. You just see all the things that you can&#8217;t do or that you&#8217;re not adequate about, and it just feels impossible. 	
</p><p>	
And so, one of the things that I really recommend doing—and again, it sounds kind of surprising, considering that some of these projects have been kind of large in scope, but this is really the art of it—is to break down big ideas of things that you want to do into smaller, very concrete stages. 
</p><p> 
So, if we&#8217;re talking about learning a language, for instance, a very good sort of starting goal is having your first conversation with the aid of Google Translate and a dictionary. You can type whatever you want and have that back and forth for like maybe five minutes. That’s a very good starting goal. 
</p><p> 
And then, you can move to, “Okay! Well, let&#8217;s try to have a five minute conversation, and I don&#8217;t need to use the dictionary.” And then, try to move that up to 30 minutes. And then, try different situations and different topics. And it can expand and multiply in this way. 
</p><p> 
And I think so many skills, you have to really chunk them down to something concrete because when we say to ourselves, “Well, I want to be good at programming,” well, there is no such thing as being good at programming. Being good at programming is really being good at many, many, many different sub-skills that all kind of, in aggregate, add up to, “Oh, you&#8217;re a good programmer.” It&#8217;s knowing many things as having lots of patterns saved in the brain. 
</p><p> 
So, this is one of the principles I talked about in the book of intuition. And I think it&#8217;s related to what you&#8217;re trying to do here with music, is that for a lot of people who perhaps don&#8217;t have a lot of confidence—so if you&#8217;re approaching something that you&#8217;re trying to learn, and you feel like you&#8217;re not very good at it right now—that’s okay. I think that, for those people, it&#8217;s better to just see it as, “Okay, let&#8217;s focus on some concrete, specific thing that I want to work on,” and then, once you&#8217;ve done that, do another concrete specific thing… and then another one. 
</p><p> 
And then, as you start building them out, you start to become a bit more confident, a bit more flexible. And you can start to handle a bit more ambiguous challenges, things that are a little bit less concrete that are a little bit more flexible.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	Excellent! So, if it&#8217;s okay with you, I obviously want to dive into a bit of more detail about ultralearning. But I think if we structure it in a way that, you know, I&#8217;m coming up with my own plan, then yeah, that could be potentially more useful to people out there just to see what a real ultralearning project could look like. 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	Yeah. 
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	So, the first thing, I guess, is to define the project goals, the timeline and the scope. So for me, I guess the project is songwriting and music production. The timeline is September/October/November this year. And then, the scope is, like I said, this is something I want to do for the rest of my life. And I want it to be more fun. Obviously, the milestones along that path are actually releasing an album. And before that, maybe releasing an EP or a single or things like that. 
</p><p> 
But for this project, I think it is just getting from 5 miles per hour to 15 miles per hour. Is that what you mean by scope? 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	So, scope, I would say has two roles here. So one scope is the scope of the content that you want to learn. So you&#8217;ve already kind of delineated it somewhat, producing an album. One way to kind of further limit the scope is sort of artistic style, “So this is the kind of music I want to make.” And depending on how you&#8217;re recording it too, like are you playing the instruments, is it something you&#8217;re using software, limiting it in that scope so that you know, “Okay, this is what I&#8217;m going to try to learn. And I&#8217;m not going to try to learn some other things.” 
</p><p> 
So, I&#8217;ll use an example of a project that I did which was short in timeframe. It was only one month. And I had to really restrict the scope in order to make it successful. And this was one of the projects I talked about in the book which was learning to draw faces, draw portraits. 
</p><p> 
And for that project, I only spent a month doing it. And I think I did a reasonable job in that month of getting better at drawing faces. But the key was that I had to really restrict what I was trying to do in that timeframe because, if you had just said, “Well, I want to become a great artist in one month,” that is probably going to be not so successful in a one month project. 
</p><p> 
However, I limited it to—wlel, first of all, I&#8217;m only going to do it with graphite pencil (and a little bit of chalk, but graphite pencil basically). So I&#8217;m not trying to do charcoal, which is more difficult because it&#8217;s hard to erase charcoal. I&#8217;m not going to do watercolors. I’m not going to do oil paints, acrylics. I&#8217;m not going to do pastels. I&#8217;m just doing graphite. So, already, we&#8217;ve simplified somewhat. It’s only doing black and white. So again, I don&#8217;t have to deal with skin tones and all the various little—I just have to focus on tonal values. 
</p><p> 
I&#8217;m doing sort of like portraits or drawings from photographs. So I&#8217;m not trying to do a model in the studio (I have to bring people in and try to sketch them while they&#8217;re sniffling and what-not). And finally, I&#8217;m only focusing on what I&#8217;ll call sort of like a reasonably long amount of time to draw a particular portrait, so like in the range of an hour or plus to draw a finished portrait, which is quite different from like street side caricaturists or street side sketch artist who have to do it in about three or four minutes, right? So, it’s somewhat of a different skill. Some of the methods you can use to draw things really well when it takes you five or six hours to draw a very accurate portrait will not work when you&#8217;re trying to do it in three or four minutes. They just take too long. 
</p><p> 
So, these are all examples of scope production, so that I&#8217;m focusing on a very concrete skill. And the result is that I was able to get quite a bit better with a concentrated burst of practice. 
</p><p> 
Now, if I had just been, “I want to get better at drawing,” that&#8217;s too broad of a scope I think. And so, one thing that could be helpful here is thinking about how are you going to put constraints on the albums you want to create, the music you want to create, in that three-month period of time, so that you can get really good at the things that are within those constraints. And you can just leave the things that are outside of those constraints just for the time being. You just put them aside. So that&#8217;s one way of talking about scope. 	
</p><p>	
The other way of talking about scope is simply in terms of your time investment. So, when I did that portrait drawing challenge, for instance, I made a rule that I was going to spend—it was going to be a pseudo-full time project, but it was going to be 25 hours a week. That was how much time I was going to spend. I was going to spend more than that. I was just going to spend five hours, Monday to Friday. That was how long I wanted to spend. I wanted some extra time to work on some other projects for my work and this kind of thing. And so, that was my scope for that project. 
</p><p> 
People listening to this, if you&#8217;re working full time, you maybe only have half an hour a day for a project. That&#8217;s your scope. If you&#8217;re going to be doing this for three months, four months, that&#8217;s also a scope. 
</p><p> 
So, thinking about what constraints you&#8217;re doing the learning in, it’s very important to delineate those in the beginning because, once you get that box of “Okay, this is what I have to work within,” now you can start to really explore, “Okay, what will be the best way to reach that?” Whereas if you don&#8217;t have those constraints, there&#8217;s always this temptation of, “Oh, maybe I should be doing something,” and then it&#8217;s completely different from what you&#8217;re doing right now. And you just kind of flounder.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	Oh, that&#8217;s fantastic feedback actually because I need that. I need to be more focused on things. 
</p><p> 
For the first part of the scope, I&#8217;ve been doing some prep work. We&#8217;re recording this in August, and I wanted to really hit the ground running in September. So, I&#8217;ve been setting up like default projects within my music recording software just so that I have structures in place that I can just start firing ideas into. And so, maybe sticking to those structures—most songs are structured the same. And another musician that I really respect talked to me about that. And he&#8217;s like, “You know what, this formula works so well, and it&#8217;s used so many times. It’s because people are used to hearing it, and that&#8217;s what people like to hear.” So, just sticking to that structure, you may feel like you need to do something really unique. But really, you don&#8217;t. You can just stay within that framework and record and release some really interesting stuff. 
</p><p> 
So, maybe for this three-month project, I have to stick to that. And then, as far as equipment goes, like I obviously have the synthesizers that I own, maybe just focusing on only using those and limiting the amount of instruments that I try to put into the things that I write. That could be really good for scope. 
</p><p> 
And then, as far as time is concerned, do you think five hours per day, five days a week, is a good way to do it? Obviously, like I said, I have all the time in the world. But when you have all the time in the world, sometimes, you don&#8217;t focus as hard as when you only have five hours. 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong> 	Well, full time… yeah, full time, I think that hourly restriction is less important if it&#8217;s like, “Okay, I&#8217;m not doing anything else.” The time restriction I think is particularly important if you are juggling this with other things. 
</p><p> 
The thing that I&#8217;m trying to avoid is, okay, you&#8217;re working a job, you&#8217;re already going to school, you&#8217;re already dealing with x, y, zed in your life. And then, you say to yourself, “I want to do some ultralearning project to learn…” some skill that you care about. And then, you say to yourself, “Well, I&#8217;m just going to do it as much as possible. I&#8217;m just going to study as much as I can… you know, whenever I have time.” “As much as I can” inevitably becomes “not very much.” And so, what I recommend for people is to decide what hours you&#8217;re going to invest in advance. 
</p><p> 
So, five hours is kind of arbitrary. And I think the right way to think about this hourly investment is you do have the opportunity to change it midway. I did a project recently where I was learning quantum mechanics, and I was originally trying to stick to a six hour per day schedule, and then I was finding it more difficult, so I actually went a little bit more than that. There’s a week or so that I was doing much closer to full time or a little bit more full time for that schedule. 
</p><p> 
And so, you can change those constraints depending on your feedback. 
</p><p> 
And I would add as well, you can also change your constraints to your content based on feedback as well. So these are not decisions that need to be set in stone. 
</p><p> 
So, you might decide right now, for instance, that, okay, a limited set of instruments is going to make this project easier. But you might go into the project finding, “You know what? Actually, that doesn&#8217;t matter so much. Maybe the instruments that I&#8217;m restricting myself to is not really helpful, and it&#8217;s actually getting in the way of things. And what I should really be restricting is maybe the genre” or maybe restricting, “I&#8217;m going to try to do this type of song… I&#8217;m going to do like an indie rock song versus synth pop or some kind of deep house. I&#8217;m going to do a very specific genre of song.” 
</p><p> 
So, I don&#8217;t know. As I’ve said, I’m not a music producer. We were talking about this before the call, that I don&#8217;t have that sort of hands-on experience of learning this particular thing. But I would say that playing with constraints is very important. I think that&#8217;s an area where a lot of people stumble in their learning projects, is that they just let things go fuzzy. They just sort of allow themselves to do whatever… and then they try a bit of this, and they try a bit of that. 
</p><p> 
And I&#8217;m not saying that there&#8217;s anything wrong with dabbling as you&#8217;re figuring things out. But I think if you want to really get results that are you&#8217;re very happy with, it&#8217;s often very helpful to be quite clear at what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish. 
</p><p> 
And if the constraints are too broad, particularly for the amount of time you have to invest in it, a good way to get better results is just to tighten the constraints and make it more concrete and specific… and you will start getting faster results in that more concrete and specific thing.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	Excellent! So meta-feedback. This is probably a good time to share what that is and why that&#8217;s important.
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong> 	Yes, I love the word meta. So, meta just basically means something about itself. So feedback, meta feedback, is basically feedback about your learning process (or the feedback you&#8217;re getting). So essentially, there is feedback you can get of “does this song sound good or not?” But then there&#8217;s also the feedback of “is the approach I&#8217;m using to learn songwriting good or not?” And so that kind of feedback is also very useful. 	
</p><p>
And so, a lot of the things that I talk about in this book—and this is sort of hard to convey. I can only give you the impression of it. It’s really something you have to learn through practice. But I want people to kind of start developing a feel for when are things slowing down, when are things getting stuck, when you&#8217;re like, “Well, I&#8217;m not actually getting better right now.” And if you can sort of fine tune your own sensitivity to that process, you&#8217;ll learn a lot better. 
</p><p> 
And so, using my portrait drawing project that we&#8217;re talking about before, this was something that happened to me. So I went in, and like a lot of people, you go into a project, you have some idea of “Okay, this is probably the way I want to approach it.” And so, the idea that I had going into this project is, “Well, I want to get better at drawing faces. And often, I draw faces, and they are clearly wrong, like not just that this is a bad artistic rendition, but the eyes aren&#8217;t in the right spot, the face is too wide, too tall. Even by little bit, if those things are off, the face looks wrong. 
</p><p> 
And so, I was trying to figure out “Okay, how can I get better at drawing faces?” And so, I thought a really good technique would be draw faces fairly quickly, and then take a photo with my iPhone, scan it or just put it on my computer. And then, you can in Photoshop (I was using a different software), you just lower the transparency of the photo to about 50%, and you put it on top of the drawing you had. You have to scale it a little bit, but you just line it up, and you just see how close were you, right? 
</p><p> 
This is the kind of feedback you don&#8217;t usually get when you&#8217;re drawing that you can say, “Oh, no, no… their eyes were supposed to be here. That&#8217;s what you screwed up about it.” 
</p><p> 
And so, this was sort of my little idea that I had of “Oh, this is all I&#8217;m going to need to be able to draw portraits well.” 
</p><p> 
And so, I&#8217;m doing this. And this is a project, by the way, that only just took place over a month. So this isn&#8217;t something where I&#8217;ve been working on it for years. This was just a very short period of time. And after about two weeks of doing this, I started to stall. It was getting better to a point. And then, I noticed, well, all the mistakes I&#8217;m making are now just random. 
</p><p> 
So, it used to be “Okay. Well, I&#8217;m consistently putting the eyes too high up on the head” or “I&#8217;m consistently making this kind of mistake.” Whereas now, it just seems sometimes the head’s too wide and sometimes it&#8217;s too narrow. Sometimes, it&#8217;s too this; sometimes, it’s too that. 
</p><p> 
And so, I kept doing it again and again. And I was seeing, “You know what, I&#8217;m not actually getting that much better with this method anymore.” So this is a kind of meta feedback. And so, what I did then is it was like, “Okay, let&#8217;s do some more research to figure out what other techniques exist for drawing portraits.” And it happened to be that I found this course taught by a place called Vitruvian Studios. And they teach a very specific method for basically plotting out how wide and where things should be on the face. It a little bit of time. So you can&#8217;t sketch with it, but it does work extremely well. 
</p><p> 
And so, that was one sort of step that, once I learned that method, then I went back, and all of a sudden, I was back to improving again. 
</p><p> 
And so, when you&#8217;re working on learning projects, they often proceed like this, where you go with some sort of approach—you get some book, you get some manual, you get some instructions—and you work on it for a while. And then, you keep doing it, you keep doing it… and it sort of plateaus. You stop getting better. And you need to kind of be sensitive to those plateaus to be like, “Hmm… maybe I need to go back and look at some other methods, look at some other techniques, maybe have some different drills, what-have-you, to try to get back up on that  steeper part of the learning curve.” 
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	Right! Okay, okay. That makes sense. So, if we go back to the actual building of the ultralearning plan, we have the scope, “I&#8217;m going to dial down a bit more and make that more focused,” but then you also sort of talk about, in the book, to identify core concepts, facts and procedures—which I&#8217;m not going to go into here because there&#8217;s a lot of other things I&#8217;d rather dive into, but you go into in detail in the book. 
</p><p> 
So, for mine, I identified the things that I know that I&#8217;m going to have to get good at as far as if I want to write and produce a really good song. I’m going to have to get good at melody and harmony and rhythm and lyrics and sound design and mixing and mastering. And all of that started to get overwhelming. 
</p><p> 
But then I got to the part in the book where you talk about the emphasize/exclude method. And that sort of actually made me feel a lot better because I was able to exclude mastering, for example, because that&#8217;s something I could pay somebody else to do who has spent a whole lifetime getting as good as they can at mastering. And that&#8217;s not something essential, especially to this project, but overall to my ultimate goal. 
</p><p> 
And then, it also made me realize like maybe focusing on melody is very important because all the songs that I really enjoy and would love to produce myself have really strong, catchy melodies. 
</p><p> 
So, could you just talk a little bit about the importance of that, emphasize/exclude in developing an ultralearning plan? 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong> 	Yeah. So, the way that I think of emphasize/exclude is to say that, when you start learning anything new, I always try to look at how do other people learn this as the starting point. And that might sound a little funny because isn&#8217;t my whole kind of pitch right now that you should be learning differently and thinking outside the box and doing ultralearning as opposed to what people normally do. But I think it&#8217;s always good to start with how other people have actually learned the skill. So, if you want to learn a language, talk to people who learned the language. 
</p><p> 
And so, sometimes, you&#8217;re going to have a bunch of different suggestions. So, someeon’s going to say, “Well, I spent 10 years doing this” or “I was in art school for 15 years” or whatever. And then, you&#8217;re like, “Wow, I don&#8217;t know whether I can really replicate that.” 
</p><p> 
But the main thing to focus on—and I think particularly for skills like this—is to often look at people who are selling books or courses or tutorials that have an actual curriculum for getting good at this. 
</p><p> 
So, I&#8217;m sure that there&#8217;s books and resources for producing your first album, these kinds of guides. This would be a good starting point to look at like a structuring… okay, how would you approach it. 
</p><p> 
So, I can speak to language learning, this is something that I know fairly well now. If you buy any book on languages, they will kind of give you sort of, “Okay. Well, you&#8217;re going to need to do this, this and this. And this is what people have done in the past to learn it. These are sort of the sequence of topics. These are sort of some words to learn.” 
</p><p> 
And so, the emphasize/exclude method is to recognize that, because learning materials generally are structured to be for everyone, when you are learning something personally, you can often either omit some parts that you&#8217;re like, “You know what? I’m not going to do this right now. I’m going to do this later. I&#8217;m going to do this in a different project,” or you can emphasize some parts that you really want to focus on that maybe get sort of a short shrift in the current curriculum. 	
</p><p>	
So, with the language, for instance, one of the things that I think about—which is a classic example of this emphasize/exclude method—is a lot of people who learn Chinese, if they go through a normal school system, they will be taught to handwrite characters from the beginning. This is a very early process. They are taught to get the little grid of squares and handwrite these calligraphic characters onto the paper. 	And in my opinion, this is a total waste of time. 
</p><p> 
Yes, I think learning to recognize characters does have some utility. But learning to handwrite characters should really only be done once you are already comfortable reading and writing with a keyboard. If you&#8217;re not able to do that, I don&#8217;t really see much point in learning to handwrite the eight things that you can say. 
</p><p> 
So, this is an example of emphasize/exclude. You even say, “You know what? I&#8217;m going to exclude handwriting characters. And I&#8217;m going to emphasize,” let&#8217;s say, “having conversations which may be are not that prevalent in the class or program that I&#8217;m in.” 
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	Yeah, that makes sense. And yeah, just thinking through my own projects while you&#8217;re talking, it&#8217;s like in these courses, I&#8217;m sure recording live instruments is probably going to be a really big section because that&#8217;s a big, important part. But since I&#8217;ve limited my scope to this, to only synthesizer/electronic music, then that&#8217;s one whole thing that I can just exclude completely and not worry about. 
</p><p> 
And yeah, one day, I hopefully will learn that stuff because I would like to record some real life instruments. But at this stage, that&#8217;s something I can just feel happy just completely excluding… which obviously makes me feel better because that&#8217;s one less thing to worry about at this stage. 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	Mm-hmm… and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with going back and learning something later. So, I think the sequencing of how you learn things is very important. 
</p><p> 
So, I think the totally wrong way to approach learning is to say, “Well, I&#8217;m going to have to learn it eventually anyway. So I might as well just learn it right now.” And I think this is the wrong way of doing it because learning is always a bootstrapping process. How do you bootstrap yourself to the next level, and then the next level, and then the next level? 
</p><p> 
And so, if you just learn things in a completely random order, you never get to a level of proficiency, or you need to learn so much more to get to the first level of proficiency that you don&#8217;t get that feedback. You don&#8217;t get that improvement process. 
</p><p> 
And so, yeah, I think it&#8217;s certainly possible for someone to approach music with the opposite scope. They’re going to say, “You know what? I&#8217;m going to start by learning how to play this instrument, and only later worry about composition and producing actual songs. I’m just going to start by playing the piano or the guitar.” That’s also a valid way of approaching it. 
</p><p> 
But I think, “I&#8217;m going to do everything. I&#8217;m going to learn to play the guitar a bit and the trumpet and the drums, and then also produce, and also do these, because I want to be able to do them all eventually anyways,” that&#8217;s the wrong way to approach it. You’re then going to just be totally confused and in a mess, and it&#8217;s going to be very difficult to actually do everything all at once.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	Yeah, absolutely. So, one of the big things that you talk about that seems very important to have a successful ultralearning project is direct practice. And I know you mentioned DuoLingo earlier, and I know that I&#8217;ve come across things that have felt really productive in a very fun and laying back on the couch sort of really easy way. But I&#8217;ve also talked to Cal Newport—and he&#8217;s been on the show, talking about the value of doing the hard thing and focusing and not taking the easy game way out. So can you talk a little bit about direct practice?
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	So, direct practice is this idea that there has been, really, for over a hundred years, an enormous amount of research that shows that people are bad at what we call transfer. 		
</p><p>	
So, transfer is when you learn something in one context (let&#8217;s say in a classroom or from a book), and you want to apply it in a different context (let’s say in real life). This doesn’t mean that books are bad. This doesn’t mean that classrooms are bad. But what it means is that, without a connection to the real world, often, people who learn something in a purely academic setting or purely in a classroom setting are unable to make fairly trivial transfers of that knowledge to a situation that we actually care about. 
</p><p> 
So, when we have students in a classroom, we don&#8217;t really care about how they do on a test. We&#8217;re hoping that they&#8217;re going to learn something that they can apply off of the test. That&#8217;s the whole point of going to school. And it just shows that—you know, there&#8217;s study after study showing that really trivial things that you would expect someone who has spent a bunch of time studying something should be able to do, they often can&#8217;t. 
</p><p> 
And there&#8217;s all sorts of research about people explaining why this might be the case and how you might alleviate it and all these types of things. But for the person listening right here, I think the most valuable lesson here is just to understand that the way that we learn things, at least in the beginning, tends to be quite specific. 
</p><p> 
And this is not just in terms of “Okay, we&#8217;re just…” Like if you&#8217;re learning vocabulary word, and you learn that word, it doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ve learned other words. Yes, there’s that specificity. But also, there’s specificity in how you use it. So, if you learn a word just by using flashcards, you are going to be somewhat less effective in using it in conversations than if you would learn the word in conversations. 
</p><p> 
So, that doesn’t mean that flashcards are always bad. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that you need to be careful if the only way you&#8217;re learning to speak is through flashcards. 
</p><p> 
And so, similarly, in your music example, if you just read a book of theory, about music theory, you&#8217;re going to have to do a lot of practice that is very similar to how you actually want to produce music in order to translate that into actual usable knowledge. Whereas a lot of people would just read book after book after book, and then they start going in there like, “Why can&#8217;t I remember anything? Why can&#8217;t actually use this?” And the problem is this issue of transfer right here. 
Itnx	Right, okay. So, obviously, in my situation then, the thing I need to do for direct practice is to write songs. That&#8217;s exactly what I need to do. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to teach me how to write songs… by writing songs. 
</p><p> 
My question to you is, as I’ve talked about before, it&#8217;s a confidence issue at the moment. I obviously must have this fragile ego that&#8217;s trying to protect itself and doesn&#8217;t want to fail. And the act of writing songs is the hardest part just because it&#8217;s just like, yeah, it&#8217;s combining so much stuff. 
</p><p> 
I recently just finished a cover song. Sonic Youth is like a band that&#8217;s very experimental noise guitar rock. And I decided to write like a synth-y version of one of their songs… which ended up teaching me so much about music production, songwriting, building energy, all these sorts of things that are really important. But my ego was sort of protected in a way because it was like, “Well, I know this is a good song. The structure, everything about this song is great. I love it.” But it allowed me to sort of build those skills without having that dread of sitting in front of a synthesizer and being like, “Okay, I have to create something from nothing.” And then, all this stuff after it of like, “Well, is this really good? Or does it suck?” and all that sort of stuff. 
</p><p> 
So, obviously, that was really helpful to me. But I also don&#8217;t want to rely on that for the next three months and just do that sort of thing. So, is there a balance there? Should I start my morning by really trying to do stuff from scratch, but then have the bulk of my day being something where I am really progressing in certain areas, but I&#8217;m not dreading it, and I&#8217;m not at risk of finding things to procrastinate with? 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	Okay, so this is actually a really good question because, obviously, when you say, “Okay, just go out and do things in the real world,” the challenge with many learning activities is that you&#8217;re not good enough to do them in the real world. 
</p><p> 
So, if I say, right now, I’m imagining that you don&#8217;t speak Hungarian right now, but if I said, “Okay, go out to this person, just deliver this lecture in Hungarian” because you want to be a University lecturer in Budapest, that&#8217;s not necessarily very useful advice because how the heck do you do that if you don&#8217;t know any Hungarian. 
</p><p> 
And so, the key is to recognize that, when I&#8217;m talking about direct practice, what I&#8217;m trying to point out is that you should be trying to learn in ways that are connected with what you&#8217;re trying to do. But very often, you have to start with something simpler. And the simplicity and the simplification is going to omit things. There&#8217;s no doubt about that. 
</p><p> 
So, if you are doing a cover song versus a new song, the new song is harder. And you&#8217;re right about that because there are things that you have to do, mentally speaking, to create a new song that you don&#8217;t have to do in a cover song. And those skills are not necessarily getting practice. 
</p><p> 
Now, that being said, it&#8217;s just a little bit like having a conversation that I recommend, for instance, if we&#8217;re talking about language learning, that what someone should do right off the bat is try to have what I call a Google Translate conversation where they just type what they want to say into Google Translate, they kind of read it out, they make the sounds with their lips, that person says what they want to say. They obviously don&#8217;t understand it, so you get them to type it. They copy it and put it into Google Translate. 
</p><p> 
This is very halting, and it&#8217;s a little artificial because, obviously, you don&#8217;t want to be talking to Google Translate. But the idea is to simulate some of the basic elements of a conversation early on. And then, you can use this as a bootstrapping process. So as you learn more vocabulary, maybe you don&#8217;t have to translate those things. Maybe instead of translating whole sentences, you just translate a word you don&#8217;t know. And it can progress from there. 
</p><p> 
And so, in this way as well, if I were to start with music production because I have no ability here, I definitely wouldn&#8217;t be just like, “Well, I&#8217;m just going to make a new song,” and I don&#8217;t know anything. I would probably simplify the task as well. 
</p><p> 
The idea is that you want to grow into it. I think it is very much the case that, if you do covers, you&#8217;re probably going to miss some of the creative process, but you&#8217;re still working on a lot of the things that are involved in getting better at that skill. And you can grow into making more original works as you get better at those other parts. 	
</p><p>	
So, the directness idea is kind of a nuanced idea. But the right way to think about it—and I&#8217;m going to be a little bit abstract here, so hopefully the listeners will understand what I&#8217;m saying. The right way to think about it is that, really, what&#8217;s going on in your head whenever you&#8217;re doing any skill is that you are having to make many, many, many little different discriminations, little different choices of what to do, different actions to take. There&#8217;s all these very small micro skills that make up the bigger skill that you&#8217;re trying to do. 
</p><p> 
So, as I’ve said, there&#8217;s no such skill as speaking a language. There&#8217;s the skill of producing this sentence, producing this word, pronouncing these phonemes. Those are all little smaller skills. 
</p><p> 
I know this is a very abstract picture, but what I&#8217;m trying to suggest when we&#8217;re talking about directness is that you should, at the very least, be doing some subset of these skills that builds into the total skill that you&#8217;re doing. 
</p><p> 
And also, to recognize that when you are only doing some of the sub-skills, the ones that you aren&#8217;t practicing, you haven&#8217;t gotten to yet. And you&#8217;re going to have to work on those if you actually want to be able to perform it. 
</p><p> 
So, this contrast with how we often learn things in an academic setting where, first of all, there are huge swaths of the skill that you just never practice. If you&#8217;re in a classroom, you just never do those things because they&#8217;re not classroom; they’re real world. 
</p><p> 
And then, there&#8217;s also situations where you get kind of an imbalanced situation where you keep learning new vocabulary, keep learning new vocabulary, new grammar patterns, but you&#8217;ve never had a real conversation with someone outside of the classroom. That&#8217;s kind of a lopsided imbalancing. You&#8217;re not growing into the space that you need to grow into. 
</p><p> 
But then also you get into the situation where you just keep working at it, and you don&#8217;t really get the results you want because you don&#8217;t realize that you&#8217;re actually missing this huge chunk of what you need to learn. 
</p><p> 
So, I think it&#8217;s totally okay to simplify the task in the beginning. And that may even be necessary to learn. You may even necessarily have to simplify quite a bit. But I think the more you can recognize, “Okay, I&#8217;m going to be doing this cover songs right now. And as I&#8217;m getting better with this, I&#8217;m going to gradually move into creating my own original compositions and to go in that direction,” you can slowly expand until you build that confidence.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	Okay, perfect. And then, just as you were talking, that made me think like, maybe in the next one that I do, I’d do something similar. But I’ll also maybe tweak the melody of it and make that a bit more original. 
</p><p> 
Because when I finished this one that I did, I realized if I took the lyrics and the vocal melody out, this could be a completely different song because everything else is so different. And then, it&#8217;s like, “Well, this is great. I designed all these sounds on my synths that I really enjoy. And I could use those in another song. But I could even just use the whole structure.” So yeah, maybe doing that. But then each time, tweaking something else that I didn&#8217;t tweak in the last version to then sort of be like a drill… which I wanted to get to next actually. Then I would drill melody writing in this certain scenario. And I would have the lyrics already, so I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about that, but I could develop certain new melodies for a song that already I know is good. 
</p><p> 
So yeah, maybe this is a good way to talk about drills. And I can maybe list some of the things that I came up with for my project. And you can tell me if I&#8217;m sort of going down the right direction. Does that sound like a plan? 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	Mm-hmmm… 
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	Alright! So, obviously, the direct practice is the main thing. But then you also have to drill on the things that you&#8217;re not as competent in. is that the purpose of drills? 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	So, there&#8217;s two purposes to drills. One is that, sometimes, you have a particular weakness that’s holding you back. So, this particular weakness is just lowering your overall proficiency. 
</p><p> 
I don&#8217;t know what it would be exactly in music, but a good example from language learning would be your pronunciation. So maybe your pronunciation is just not correct, and this is causing a lot of problems. It just hold back everything else you do in your speaking. 
</p><p> 
Or it could be that you do have good pronunciation and grammar, but you just don&#8217;t know enough words. And then, that&#8217;s a bottleneck. 
</p><p> 
So, drills can sometimes be to fix a very specific deficit. It&#8217;s not that your problems are everywhere. You have one particular problem. And then, the second reason to do drills is just because when you are doing complicated skills, like we just said, there are so many different things going on at the same time that you need to simplify it. You need to focus on some particular element of it. 
</p><p> 
So, again, if we&#8217;re talking about music, if you are working on making a new song, you have to think about the instruments, melody, samples, all sorts of things. Maybe you just focus on, “You know what? I&#8217;m just going to focus on lyrics… I&#8217;m just going to focus on melodies… or I&#8217;m just going to focus on making a sick baseline,” or something like that is going to be your starting point. And so, this can be a good activity. 
</p><p> 
The one thing I would say about it is—and this is, again, going back to this getting a feel for things, which again is something that I can&#8217;t give you rules for. You just have to learn by doing it. But I hopefully can point you in the right direction. And one of those things is that, when you&#8217;re doing direct practice, it&#8217;s again noticing, “Okay, I&#8217;m starting to slow down now,” and then you can kind of use that as a trigger point for “Maybe I should do some more drills.” 
</p><p> 
So, I think as you get better in skills, the amount of time you spend doing drills changes. 
</p><p> 
I feel that, in the beginning, you&#8217;re doing something like drills maybe because the direct practice situation is just too hard. So, for instance, if we&#8217;re speaking a language, you may only be doing a little bit of direct practice because you just need to actually master some of the basics on their own, and then build them and put them together to actually have that conversation. But after you&#8217;ve been speaking for a while, it goes the other direction where, once you&#8217;ve been speaking a language for a couple years, now maybe it&#8217;s sort of like, “Okay, I actually need to really work on my writing ability… or my ability to give speeches… or my ability to understand movies” because this specific thing is holding me back.
</p><p>
And so, I think that you can see this pattern in a lot of skills. Now, I don&#8217;t know where exactly you&#8217;re at with the music production and how difficult it is. But again, I think the drills play these kind of roles. And in the beginning, they are sort of necessary simplifications of the actual thing you&#8217;re trying to do because the actual thing you&#8217;re trying to do is just too hard to do most of the time. And then, later, you&#8217;re doing more drills, because the thing that you&#8217;re trying to do most of the time, or the direct practice situation, is in some ways too easy. In some ways, you&#8217;re just kind of, well, you&#8217;re adequate at it, and you need to actually break it apart and break it down and work on those sub-skills in order to get better at the things that you&#8217;re already good at.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	Alright, okay. Yeah, no, that makes a lot more sense actually. And that again makes me a bit less apprehensive about starting this because I was just imagining myself banging my head against the table for five hours or something because I’m just trying to do as much direct practice as I can. 
</p><p> 
But yeah, just change it as I get more confident or recognize that I need some additional work in certain areas. That’s great. 
</p><p> 
So, the other thing that you&#8217;ve been talking about is experimenting which also seems to play a big part, especially in songwriting and things like that. Again, I guess it’s just going to depend on how I feel which is what I&#8217;ve learned from our conversation. One of my questions was going to be like, “How do I balance these things?” So, obviously, there&#8217;s going to be the direct practice, and then eventually my willpower, I’m just going to get fed up or something, and then I won&#8217;t be able to do that anymore. So then maybe go to drills, and then maybe go to just experiment on one of my synths, just making sounds up, which could then lead to, like you said, a baseline or a lead line or things like that. 
</p><p> 
So, I guess what I&#8217;m hearing from you is just I guess play it by ear, see how it goes, and don&#8217;t feel bad about adjusting as I progress in my skills increases. 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong> 	Oh, yeah. Everything is all adjusting. So this is I think the right way to think about it. You want a good plan to give yourself a good push, a good starting point. But most of the things that make this work is having that self-awareness, having what is called in the psychological industry metacognition, of basically just being aware of what your problem is. 
</p><p> 
And this is very hard, I think, for most people because they&#8217;re learning something and they just feel stuck. And they don&#8217;t know what their problem is. And so, this is the sense that you need to develop, this intuition you have. 
</p><p> 
And I think this is something that you do develop over time. So, if it sounds impossible for you to do this, as you do more projects like these, and as you start to have more success, you try more techniques, you&#8217;ve had more, “Well, I tried doing this, and it didn&#8217;t actually help,” you get that sense. You develop it a little bit better. And it crosses over to other projects. 
</p><p> 
But it is this sense of “Hmmm… things are slowing down now. Why are they slowing down?” or “Hmmm… I can&#8217;t seem to do this even though I&#8217;m trying. Why am I not able to do this?” 
</p><p> 
And so, sometimes, it&#8217;s a particular skill. So it could be, as you said if we&#8217;re talking about melodies, sort of like, “Well, maybe the problem is that I&#8217;m just trying random stuff, and I have no structure for thinking about what would make a good melody. So maybe I should learn a little bit of music theory about melodies. And maybe I should buy a book and dig into that.” 
</p><p> 
Or maybe it&#8217;s “Yeah, I&#8217;m doing this. But it&#8217;s just too hard to do with everything else. So maybe let&#8217;s break it off and work on it in isolation.” 
</p><p> 
Maybe the issue is that, “Okay, I&#8217;m doing this, but I&#8217;m not sure quite what the problem is. It sounds okay, but it&#8217;s just not at the level where it really needs to be at.Maybe I need to get an expert or someone to look at a song I produced and give me their feedback about what things they think I ought to try to improve.” 
</p><p> 
So, there&#8217;s all these sorts of little feelings that you have to get about doing it. I know, again, that sounds a little vague and handwavy. But I think it&#8217;s very important to realize that the ultralearning process I&#8217;m trying to describe is not something that&#8217;s “Here’s eight tactics, and you just apply these rigorously.” It’s a very organic thing that you have all these different tools, all these different ways to solve problems, but it&#8217;s sort of up to you to kind of look at what you&#8217;re doing and be like, “Hmmm… this is where I&#8217;m getting stuck.” 
</p><p> 
So, if we&#8217;re talking about a language, for instance, one of the big things that is a very common feeling you&#8217;ll notice is, “Oh, wow! I actually forget most of the words that I&#8217;ve learned.” And so then you start to think, “Okay, I need to get developed some sort of system or some sort of better approach to make sure these things are in my memory.” And so then you start to talk about things like retrieval practice like spaced repetition systems. 
</p><p> 
And so, it starts from this self-diagnosis of “What is the issue here? Why am I getting stuck? Is it that I don&#8217;t understand something? Is that I don&#8217;t remember something? Is that I can&#8217;t perform a particular skill?” These are all sorts of feelings that you kind of start to develop as you go through these projects. 
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	That&#8217;s great. And yeah, it’s just going to make such a difference to what I was planning on doing. I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time developing this plan, and I was just going to execute it, but it sounds like I need to have two separate hats—the execution hat, but then, at the end of the day, thinking about the project overall, and exactly as you said, just adjusting and assessing what&#8217;s working, what&#8217;s not working, and where I need to focus more. 
</p><p> 
Well, we’re already over an hour which is crazy, My list is so much longer than this, but this has been fantastic! It’s really been helpful. 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	Oh, yeah? That’s great. 
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	And hopefully, it&#8217;s been helpful to other people out there who are maybe starting to think about their own ultralearning project. 
</p><p> 
But if people want to learn more about you, where&#8217;s the best place to go? Obviously, I&#8217;ll link to the book on Amazon or anywhere books are sold. But where else can people find you?
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	So, you can go to my website at ScottHYoung.com. And as I mentioned about the book, I&#8217;ve got links to the book there. There&#8217;s also an audible version. I know some people prefer to listen. So, if you&#8217;re not totally sick of listening to my voice by now, then you can also get the audio version of the book where I&#8217;m narrating it. 
</p><p> 
And i would say not only to you with your music project, but also to the listeners who are hearing right now, if any of you take on an ultralearning project, I would love to hear about it. 
</p><p> 
I&#8217;m in sort of my own kind of process of trying to gather and collect up people&#8217;s experiences with ultralearning—not only for me, just to know how the ideas and advice are being received because (you know, even having this conversation, it&#8217;s interesting to see kind of some of the ways that you&#8217;ve been thinking about it and how they differ slightly from how I would think about it), but then also just because I want to gather more stories. And I think that this is really what we need. 
</p><p> 
We have so many examples of people dredging through school, but so few examples of people getting really good at things on their own that they care about. And I would like to change that. 
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	Nice! Well, hopefully, mine will be successful in some way and I will be able to share that with you because I do plan on documenting. I&#8217;m not going to do it in real-time just because I don&#8217;t want to have to juggle two things of like publishing on MadFientist.com at the same time I&#8217;m doing this. But I do plan on recording everything that I&#8217;m doing and how it&#8217;s going. 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	Well, I look forward to listening to the album.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> 	Yeah, that would be amazing. But yeah, I will document and share with you; and hopefully, all the Mad Fientist readers as well. 
</p><p> 
But I usually end all my interviews with “What&#8217;s one piece of advice you&#8217;d give to somebody on the path to FI?” But I am happy to tweak that a little bit. If you had any one piece of advice to pursuing some of these bigger goals…? 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong> 	So, I&#8217;ll say something that I think is less of a tactical. We’ve been talking a lot about tactics. But I think the big thing that I want to leave people with is that the feeling that you get when you are at your best moments in life, I think those moments are going to come from when you are able to do something you weren&#8217;t able to do before, or when you&#8217;re able to see something in the world that you didn&#8217;t know existed. 
</p><p> 
And so, for me, this is the real driving force behind why I&#8217;m interested in doing these projects and why I wrote the book. It’s not just so much so that, “Here’s How you can cut down your learning time,” but rather because I want people to cultivate that feeling. 
</p><p> 
And so, my hope for people when they&#8217;re listening to this right now is that they can see a little bit of that. It’s difficult to sometimes describe it in words, but I&#8217;m hoping that there&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ve been thinking about that you&#8217;d like to learn or explore in your life. And maybe, hopefully, you&#8217;ll just give it a little bit of a shot.
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	That&#8217;s fantastic, Scott! Thank you so much again, . And yeah, congrats again on the book. 
</p><p>
<strong>Scott Young:</strong>	Thank you. 
</p><p>
<strong>Mad Fientist:</strong>	Take care. Bye.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve never had a paragraph smack me in the face before.</p>
<p>This one did and it hit me like a brick&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Here is Maggie, the aspiring writer:</p>
<p>&#8220;I recognized that when it comes to artistic or creative endeavors I had internalized a fixed mindset. I believed that people were inherently artistic or creative and that you could not improve through effort. This directly affected my life because I have always wanted to be a writer, but have been afraid to pursue any writing classes or share my creative writing with others. This is directly related to my mindset because any negative criticism would mean that I’m not a writer inherently. I was too scared to expose myself to the possibility that I might not be a &#8216;natural'&#8221;</p>
<p>Maggies’ internal monologue used to say: Don’t do it. Don’t take a writing class. Don’t share your writing with others. It’s not worth the risk. Your dream could be destroyed. Protect it.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I read that last paragraph, it became clear that I&#8217;ve been sabotaging myself my entire adult life.</p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I&#8217;ve dreamt of creating something (more on that below).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s crazy is, I hadn&#8217;t worked towards achieving that goal.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I read that paragraph in <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZZyryH?tag=madfientist-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow    noopener">Mindset</a> by Carol Dweck that I realized what had been happening.</p>
<p>Like Maggie, I hadn&#8217;t taken any steps towards achieving my goal because I didn&#8217;t want to risk losing the dream completely.</p>
<p>But not working toward the goal would guarantee failure so why would I choose that?!</p>
<h2>My Goal</h2>
<p>Before I discuss why I was sabotaging myself, I first better come clean with this big goal&#8230;</p>
<p><em>I want to write, record, and release an album</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s crazy I&#8217;ve never talked about this before but I&#8217;ve been reluctant to share because then I&#8217;d finally have to try (and possibly fail).</p>
<p>Music has played such a huge role in my life.</p>
<p>From dancing to Michael Jackson as a toddler&#8230;</p>

<p>Music has enhanced my life in so many ways and it&#8217;s been my dream to take my love of music even further by writing and releasing my own.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have grand visions of becoming a star or anything and I have no desire for the fame, money, or other &#8220;benefits&#8221; that mainstream success in the music business would bring.</p>
<p>I simply want to make weird music that I enjoy.</p>

<p>And make sure you click the heart button in Spotify to save the playlist to your library because I plan to add more music for my next article (and will hopefully be including some of my own soon!)</p>
</div>
<p>This goal isn&#8217;t overly-ambitious and it&#8217;s obviously important to me so why wasn&#8217;t I working towards achieving it?</p>
<h2>Fixed vs. Growth Mindset</h2>
<p>Turns out, I had a &#8220;fixed mindset&#8221; when it came to making music.</p>
<p>I had built up this identity of being an analytical &#8220;math and science guy&#8221; but that is the opposite of the creative musician I wanted to become.</p>
<p>I could sit down and study for hours until I learned a programming concept but I didn&#8217;t think hard work would help me be creative.</p>
<p>I thought I either had it in me to write good songs or I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>So rather than throw a bunch of hard work at the problem, as I did in other areas of my life, I was too scared to try because I didn&#8217;t want to find out that I didn&#8217;t have what it took (which would kill the dream).</p>
<p>Do you have anything in your life like that? Are there things you want to do but aren&#8217;t even trying to do?</p>
<p>Thankfully, Dweck&#8217;s book made me realize that songwriting is no different from anything else and I can get better at it with practice, just like I can get stronger by lifting weights or I can learn more about math by studying.</p>
<p>Although my body is a bit too old to achieve my boyhood dreams of becoming an NHL star, my mind is still capable of changing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6468" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mad-fientist-lemieux.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6468" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-6468" src="https://www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mad-fientist-lemieux.jpg" alt="Mad Fientist Lemieux" width="500" height="587" srcset="//www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mad-fientist-lemieux.jpg 500w, //www.madfientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mad-fientist-lemieux-256x300.jpg 256w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6468" class="wp-caption-text">More of my Grandpap&#8217;s handiwork</p></div></p>
<p>Dweck&#8217;s <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZZyryH?tag=madfientist-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow    noopener">Mindset</a> showed me that brains can form new connections and improve existing connections through practice and repetition (a great example she gave is how the brains of blind people start using the visual cortex when reading Braille, even though their eyes aren&#8217;t doing anything).</p>
<p>This helped me believe that it is possible to get better at something creative like songwriting so I&#8217;m finally giving it a shot.</p>
<h2>Unhappiness Before FI</h2>
<p>Looking back, I can now see that not pursuing this dream for all those years was a big source of my unhappiness.</p>
<p>Even though it seemed like my brain was quite content tricking itself into inaction, deep down I must have known what was going on.</p>
<p>Actually, I know for a fact that I knew what was going on.  Check out this quote from <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/emotions-of-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article I wrote in 2013</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After achieving FI, I won’t have full-time employment as an excuse anymore. Will I find other ways to procrastinate or will I finally start pursuing some of my creative goals? If I do start working towards my goals, will I fail? Has my procrastination been a way of keeping my dreams alive even though, deep down, I realize they are probably not attainable?</p></blockquote>
<p>I knew what was going on but I was able to fool myself because I had something to blame for not making any progress &#8211; my job.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be writing music if I didn&#8217;t have to work 40 hours a week!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My commute tires me out so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not working on anything after I get home from work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Watching TV isn&#8217;t getting me closer to releasing an album but can you blame me for needing to unwind after a hard day in the office?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a perfect scapegoat and it allowed me to continue down the path of doing nothing (yet keeping my dream alive).</p>
<p>Then came FI&#8230;</p>
<h2>No More Excuses</h2>
<p>I wanted to achieve FI so that I didn&#8217;t have to have a job and could instead work on music full-time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be great! I&#8217;ll have all the time in the world and then I&#8217;ll finally do it, after all these years of thinking about it!</p>
<p>Sadly, my brain kept ruining that plan too.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t get started. Even though I had all day to work on music, I&#8217;d still find other things to do instead.</p>
<p>The problem is, I didn&#8217;t have a scapegoat to blame for this. I didn&#8217;t have a boss telling me what to do. I didn&#8217;t have anywhere to be or anything I needed to do.</p>
<p>I only had myself to blame.</p>
<p>But brains don&#8217;t like blaming themselves for things.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s when I started trying to put the blame elsewhere&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh, replying to all these emails is taking up my entire day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do anything in this small apartment in Scotland&#8230;I need to move to a house and get a proper studio to work in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If only Jill would stop planning so many events with friends and family, I could finally get something done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once I get a new synthesizer, the songs will start pouring out of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those excuses were obviously bullshit though.</p>
<p>And even though I realized deep down that my job wasn&#8217;t the reason I wasn&#8217;t making progress before, these new excuses were even flimsier so it was more obvious that I was the problem.</p>
<h2>Hazard of FI</h2>
<p>This is a potential hazard of post-FI life.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unhappy when you&#8217;re working and you blame your job for all your problems, you may struggle after FI if you&#8217;re still unhappy.</p>
<p>What do you do when your biggest scapegoat disappears?</p>
<p>Your job doesn&#8217;t have feelings so you can blame it for all your issues and it won&#8217;t care. But when your job is gone and you start blaming your wife, your friends, or your kids instead, it&#8217;s not going to go down as well.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll hopefully realize that those external things aren&#8217;t the reason you&#8217;re unhappy but, as I mentioned before, it&#8217;s very hard to do&#8230;especially when it&#8217;s you that&#8217;s the problem.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I realize now what had caused most of my unhappiness both before and after leaving work &#8211; I wasn&#8217;t making progress on these types of important projects.</p>
<h2>The Best Thing About FI</h2>
<p>This leads us to the best and worst things about financial independence.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re actually the same thing&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Financial independence gives you the freedom to do anything you want with your life.</em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore why this is good first&#8230;</p>
<h3>The Opportunity of a Lifetime</h3>
<p>You don’t have to worry about money and you have the time and freedom to accomplish almost anything you want to.</p>
<p>During last year&#8217;s Winter Olympics, I was at my brother-in-law&#8217;s house and we joked that it&#8217;d be amazing to compete in a future Winter Olympics together in curling.</p>
<p>I thought about this more afterward and realized that this could be achievable now that I&#8217;m FI.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re financially independent and you decide you want to become a world-class curler, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice all day while everyone else is working to pay the bills</li>
<li>Volunteer your time at a local ice rink in exchange for more ice access and more practice time</li>
<li>Use some of your savings to pay for a coach so that you progress even faster</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are persistent and dedicated, there&#8217;s no doubt you could excel.</p>
<h3>Reborn after FI</h3>
<p>Achieving FI is like being reborn.</p>
<p>Who you were before FI doesn&#8217;t matter and who you are after is completely up to you.</p>
<p>I am already quite different than the person I was before I quit my job and I imagine I&#8217;ll change even more in the years to come.</p>
<p>Shifting your identity is difficult and takes time (more on that in future articles/podcasts) but it is achievable.</p>
<h2>The Worst Thing About FI</h2>
<p>These benefits are amazing but the best thing about FI is also the worst thing:</p>
<p><em>Financial independence gives you the freedom to do anything you want with your life.</em></p>
<p>Now, if you aren&#8217;t living the life you want, you only have yourself to blame.</p>
<p>We are all great at making excuses and fooling ourselves.  How many of you are putting off pursuing your big life goals because you &#8220;don&#8217;t have time&#8221; or you are &#8220;waiting until you hit FI to start&#8221;?</p>
<p>Do you say you don&#8217;t have time to go to the gym but somehow, you&#8217;ve been able to watch all the Game of Thrones episodes?</p>
<p>Guess what&#8230;</p>
<p>When you achieve financial independence and you leave your job, you&#8217;re going to have all the time in the world.</p>
<p>That means those convenient little excuses that have kept you from feeling bad about yourself go away.</p>
<p>You finally have to put up or shut up.</p>
<p>You have to become the person you&#8217;ve planned to be (or already thought you were).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how a person&#8217;s image of themselves in their heads differs from the actions they take.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I think this is the cause of a lot of unhappiness. I know it made me unhappy but I&#8217;m only realizing that now.</p>
<h3>What to Choose?</h3>
<p>Another reason that having the freedom to do anything can be problematic is because it&#8217;s hard to choose what to do.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a good use of your time when you don&#8217;t have a normal script to follow? What motivates you now that money doesn&#8217;t matter as much?  What brings you happiness and fulfillment when the normal goalposts and measuring sticks people use no longer apply to you?</p>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>So what should you do?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t wait until FI to start these important things.</p>
<p>Start exercising now.</p>
<p>Eat better now.</p>
<p>Start making progress on the things that matter to you now.</p>
<p>Work on improving your happiness and mental health now.</p>
<p>Start building your ideal life before you hit FI.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;ll be a bit easier to do everything when you don&#8217;t have a full-time job taking up so much of your time but FI is not a magic bullet and it&#8217;s not going to instantly change you into a new person.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re still going to have to do the hard work to change yourself into the person you want to be so you might as well start doing that now while you still have a nice scapegoat to blame when things don&#8217;t go exactly as planned.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re already FI and are struggling with similar challenges, know that the struggle is worthwhile.</p>
<p>There&#8217;ve been many times I wished I could forget about this dream of mine and just enjoy my job-free life to the fullest (instead of struggling so much with completing difficult tasks, battling self-doubt, maintaining motivation, etc.).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I persevered though because <span style="font-size: inherit;">I&#8217;m a lot happier now that I&#8217;m finally doing what I&#8217;ve always known I should be doing.</span></p>
<p>In his book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2O1j1mp?tag=madfientist-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow    noopener">Ultralearning</a>, Scott Young (who is my next <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a> guest!) shares the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your deepest moments of happiness don’t come from doing easy things; they come from realizing your potential and overcoming your own limiting beliefs about yourself.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am in the process of tackling my most-formidable limiting belief and although I still have a long way to go, I&#8217;m thankfully starting to see what he means.</p>
<h2>What do you think?</h2>
<p>Have you struggled with similar issues? Do you have a fixed mindset about certain topics? Do you have any advice for tackling tasks you don&#8217;t feel like you can accomplish?</p>
<p>Please share in the comments below!</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a musician and have any songwriting tips, I&#8217;d love to hear them because I still feel like I need all the help I can get!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also love to hear what you think of all the music I shared on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/13wSoKa6Ua7oLD78y0drhj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow    noopener">Spotify playlist</a>.  Are there any Brainiac fans out there?  Anyone into similar music?</p>

<h2>Full Transcript</h2>
<div class="transcript">
<p><strong>Mad Fientist:</strong> Hey, what&#8217;s up everybody? Welcome to the Financial Independence Podcast, the podcast that usually gets inside the brains of the best and brightest and personal finance to find out how they achieved financial independence but today&#8217;s episode is going to be a bit different.</p>
<p>Exactly three years ago, I left my job for good. And to reflect on the past year, I&#8217;m just going to release a episode about my third year of freedom.</p>
<p>You may remember that in the past couple of years, I released my first year of freedom, my second year of freedom so I figured I might as well keep that going, because I&#8217;ve definitely learned a lot this year and I feel it&#8217;s been my best yet.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll share the reasons why it was better than the first two years and hopefully you can learn from my experiences and not make the same mistakes I did whenever you eventually hit financial independence.</p>
<p>Just like my first year freedom episode and second year freedom episode, this one&#8217;s probably going to be a lot shorter than usual, but I have a lot of really good interviews lined up for the rest of the year so we&#8217;ll be back to normally scheduled programming in the next episode.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t listened to my first year freedom episode or second year freedom episodes, I put the links in the show notes so you can check those out first, because I&#8217;m going to build on a lot of the things I talked about in those episodes but I&#8217;m not going to recount everything because there&#8217;s no use repeating myself.</p>
<p>So I hope this episode is useful to you. And let&#8217;s just get right into it.</p>
<p>So the first thing I have to mention about this year&#8217;s just how quickly it went by. It was actually really scary how fast this year&#8217;s gone, 2019 in particular. I just can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s already August.</p>
<p>I guess it is true that time flies when you&#8217;re having fun, but I would say that this year was actually more progress made on big projects that are important to me rather than simply having fun.</p>
<p>My problem with my first year after leaving my job was that I just said yes to a lot of commitments, for the Mad Fientist in particular, but for other things, I would just say yes to a lot of things because I was like, why not because I have the time. But by the end of the year, I realized I didn&#8217;t make any progress on the projects that are really important to me.</p>
<p>So on the second year, I got better at saying no to, you know, just opportunities and things that maybe could earn money or maybe that would help my site grow and things that really didn&#8217;t matter at the end of the day anymore. And I was able to say no to it. But my second year, I would say yes to a lot of fun stuff. So even though I said less to Mad Fientist commitments, I ended up saying yes to lots and lots of really fun things. But it was the same problem. By the end of the year, I realized that I didn&#8217;t actually do a lot of the things that I really wanted to do.</p>
<p>So this third year was marked by saying no to most things, and even though it&#8217;s hard to do at the time, because you&#8217;re passing up these things that are either an opportunity or that sounds really fun, it&#8217;s actually turned out to be great because I have made a lot of progress on the things that are really important to me. And that definitely gives me more lasting deep happiness than simply you know, just having another fun trip or something.</p>
<p>Another big change on the other side of the coin is that I&#8217;ve been taking a lot more initiative this year. So last year, I had a really good trip with my entire extended family because one of my cousins was getting married. So we went to the beach and just had this fantastic time. And we don&#8217;t all get together like that very often, only maybe once or twice a decade, if we&#8217;re lucky.</p>
<p>And after the fact, I was like, &#8220;Oh, that was so good…I wish we could do that more often.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then I started thinking about it. It&#8217;s like, well, hey, I have all the time in the world and planning is sort of my thing so I can actually just take the initiative, plan something for the following year, and then just see who wants to come.</p>
<p>So for my grandmother&#8217;s birthday, I was like, well, let&#8217;s all just rent a big beach house again, since that was so fun last year, and we can celebrate that for a week. So during the winter, I put that together and we went and had a fantastic week again and got to see all my family and spend some really quality time together.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also done that with my friends because last year I went to a wedding and got to see some high school friends and really spend some quality time with them when I hadn&#8217;t been a few years. And I was like, &#8220;Man, that was so good…wish we would do that more often.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than just wish that would happen, I actually took the initiative. And now I&#8217;m planning a ski trip for this winner and a potential mountain house visit for a lot of my friends.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s been great because I&#8217;m spending a lot more quality time with the people that I care about. And I&#8217;m organizing it and making it happen and things that we wouldn&#8217;t have done otherwise. I&#8217;m using the time and mental bandwidth that FI provides to actually organize these things.</p>
<p>One thing I want to mention about the saying no is I&#8217;ve realized over the past year just how powerful inertia is so things that you just always do you just keep doing them because you don&#8217;t think to even question it. But I&#8217;ve realized over the past year, how important it is to always ask why and think about why you&#8217;re doing something and whether you still want to do it and the reason for doing it. Because it&#8217;s really easy to just keep doing the same thing, and not really do the things that you want to do.</p>
<p>So to give you an example, I&#8217;ve been approached to keynote conferences and give talks and things like that and at first, you know, my first inclination is, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;d be amazing. That&#8217;s an honor. That&#8217;s very kind of you to ask me. I&#8217;m flattered.&#8221;</p>
<p>And of course you want to say yes to these things. But then, after reflecting on it for a bit before answering, I was like, &#8220;All right, well, what what is the point? Okay, so I would go to a talk. And yes, I would maybe become more well known as a blogger or more well known in the financial space. And is that important to me at this stage?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s not actually because the Mad Fientist has grown to a level that I never expected it would anyway. So it&#8217;s like more growth is not going to make me happier. It&#8217;s already exceeded our expectations and is at a great level where it is.</p>
<p>And then it&#8217;s like, well, do I want to get better at presenting? Thinking about it, it&#8217;s like, well, yeah, that would be nice to get a new skill, but the amount of hours that would go into preparing for something like that would just definitely dwarf the benefit of getting slightly better presenting or more comfortable with it. And it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t want to be a public speaker or some sort of financial media person.</p>
<p>So all the reasons I could think of to do it don&#8217;t really apply it to my situation. So I ended up declining and it&#8217;s things like that. It&#8217;s like, it is so easy just to say yes to things. So you need to constantly be asking yourself why and think about why you would do something and what the benefits are and weigh it up against the costs, because it&#8217;s really easy for your whole year to just be taken up with things and then you actually don&#8217;t do the things that you really want to do.</p>
<p>And when you&#8217;re thinking about these things, you have to really think deeply about it. Because sometimes something will seem like a good idea but that&#8217;s just because part of your personality or psyche is like craving something that you don&#8217;t actually want or need. So to go back to the example of, you know, being a keynote speaker at a conference. At first, my ego was like, &#8220;Yes, of course you want to be on stage, you want to be loved by everyone, you want to be well known and liked.&#8221; And that was probably what was driving the initial reaction to say yes to it, but when you take a step back and realize that I don&#8217;t want to be a financial icon that just talks about FI all the time in person and gets on radio shows and TV shows. And it just doesn&#8217;t appeal to me. So it&#8217;s like, okay, even though my ego was like instantly, &#8220;Yes, you want to do this.&#8221; Once you really think about it, you realize that actually, that&#8217;s gonna take up a lot of time when I could be doing something else. And the benefits aren&#8217;t that great, because that&#8217;s not the life I want to live.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s surprising how complicated it&#8217;s been and how you always have to keep that in focus. But I feel like this year has been the year that I&#8217;ve actually got to grips with it and have started making some really good decisions that have resulted in a really fun and productive year.</p>
<p>So you may be wondering why I still do the Mad Fcientist if I said all that, but it really is the most rewarding project and in in the state it is in now, with no further growth or no further expansion, I just feel so lucky to have it. And the main thing that I love about it is just the interaction with all of you out there. I can just put an idea out there and then get lots of feedback on it, lots of interaction, lots of conversation. And it&#8217;s just an amazing thing. And I feel so lucky that I have such interesting, supportive, and intelligent readers and listeners. And I just think that&#8217;s the best thing to have this platform to really dive deep into ideas and subjects that really interests me, and then release it out to the public and get lots of different feedback and interactions.</p>
<p>A big reason I&#8217;m so excited about the future Mad Fcientist content is that I&#8217;m finally going to be able to share with you the secret project that I&#8217;ve been working on for the last three years, which is really the whole point of why I wanted to reach financial independence in the first place. I haven&#8217;t shared it with you yet because it&#8217;s been an incredible struggle and I didn&#8217;t feel like there was anything I could share to help you because I was struggling so much myself.</p>
<p>But this year, I finally made some progress and I&#8217;ve learned some things that have helped me make some progress. So I&#8217;m finally in a position that I could share this background story but also then give some advice if you&#8217;re in a similar situation.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m really looking forward to finally sharing all that stuff because really, there&#8217;s some articles that I have had as drafts for three years that I&#8217;ve really wanted to share, but I just haven&#8217;t been able to. So the rest of this year is hopefully going to be all focused on that and the podcast episodes are going to be built around that the articles are going to be built around that so make sure you subscribe to the podcast just by pressing the subscribe button wherever you&#8217;re listening to this or subscribing to the email list.</p>

<p>So this past year has definitely been the best for productivity and doing things that I really want to do. And it&#8217;s also been the best money-wise as well.</p>
<p>I finally started to relax a bit more with money. If you&#8217;ve listened to my interview with Ramit Sethi, he has tried to help me be a little bit less extreme with money, because it&#8217;s definitely not necessary at this stage to be so hyper focused on very small spending decisions and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m trying to work through.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s trying to deprogram 30 years of programming because this is I&#8217;ve always been frugal, this is something that I don&#8217;t know where it comes from but I&#8217;ve even growing up my family would make fun of me just for being so focused on money and being so frugal.</p>
<p>So this is something I&#8217;m working on, and it has actually been helping. One big change I&#8217;ve made over the past few months, actually since Ramit&#8217;s interview, is I&#8217;ve stopped updating my financial spreadsheet, which is crazy to me, because I have all this beautiful data that goes back like a decade, at least and I have just stopped updating it. And the reason for that is, if I know I&#8217;m going to update it at the end of the month, then I&#8217;m going to make certain spending decisions based solely on the number.</p>
<p>So if I have to buy a flight to the States, and it&#8217;s currently at $550, and I think I could spend 10 hours to get that down to $475, then in the past, that is something I would definitely do, and I would obsess about it. And then I would keep checking after the fact. And recently, I&#8217;ve really tried to stop doing that. And not updating my spreadsheet all the time makes that easier just because I&#8217;m not so then hyper focused on just numbers all the time.</p>
<p>And I do plan on updating my spreadsheet, maybe quarterly, or maybe semi-annually, or hopefully even annually one day, but at least taking the last few months off has sort of made that easier. And I&#8217;m not simply making decisions just based on finding the lowest cost, which I don&#8217;t think is healthy. And it&#8217;s not to say I&#8217;m going to be wasteful with money or things like that, but it&#8217;s just sort of trying to balance the time and money thing and if I can save $10 by spending three hours doing something in the past, I would have just jumped on that. But now it&#8217;s like, well, that&#8217;s not really a good return on invested time. And the time is actually far more important than the $10 is at this stage.</p>
<p>So although I&#8217;ve stopped updating my financial spreadsheet as much, I have created a new spreadsheet, unsurprisingly, and it has been tracking all the things that I am wanting to do and what I&#8217;ve done throughout the year. So after reading James Clear&#8217;s book, Atomic Habits, he talks in there about what type of person you want to be and then building appropriate habits so that then you can&#8217;t help but become that type of person.</p>
<p>So when I read the book, I did that exercise and I thought, okay, I want to be a reader, I want to be healthy, I want to be strong, I want to be creative, things like that. And then I created another page and that spreadsheet to list columns with those things at the top.</p>
<p>Now, throughout the year, I&#8217;ve just been filling in the cells underneath those column headings. So to give you a few examples, when I did that identity exercise, I said, I want to be a reader, I want to be strong, I want to be creative. So in my spreadsheet, I have columns that say, &#8220;Reader&#8221;, &#8220;Strength&#8221;, and &#8220;Creativity&#8221;. And in the reading column, I simply list all the books that I finished throughout the year. And in the strength column, I list how many days during the month that I went to the gym. And in the creative column, I just list all the things that I created and then published out into the world.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s been really, really good because it&#8217;s motivating to keep putting stuff in there. So I tend to read a lot more than I did in years past because I&#8217;m like, oh, I&#8217;ll just add another book to my list. And it also makes me realize that I am accomplishing a lot because one of the problems with having free time and not really having any structure in your day is that you feel like the days just slip away. And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Did I really even do anything last week, like did I get anything done? Did I do anything fun?&#8221; I can&#8217;t even remember. And having this spreadsheet is like well, actually, I&#8217;ve read a lot of books this year, I&#8217;ve gone to the gym a ton, and I&#8217;ve actually published a lot of things into the world that didn&#8217;t exist before. So having it to look back on is really motivating and it makes me feel better about how I&#8217;m spending my time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also added another column to that spreadsheet that has been really useful to me this year and that is just listing all of the highlights of the year. So I&#8217;ve talked about this a lot before, people are really terrible at figuring out what makes them happy, and making decisions that make them happier. So even though I think about this stuff a lot and I really try to focus on it, it&#8217;s still difficult to realize, like, Oh, that was a good decision, that was a bad decision. So what I&#8217;ve started doing is I just have another column and that same spreadsheet that&#8217;s just highlights and I list all the highlights of the year and I tried to list them in order of how fun they were, how rewarding the experience was, etc.. And then hopefully that can help me govern what we do next year.</p>
<p>So it has been really good and although it&#8217;s maybe not as fun as updating my financial spreadsheet, it is really rewarding to do that and try to shift my focus away from money and more on to you know, doing things and creating things and building my new identity and post-FI life.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s not to say that I&#8217;ve completely forgotten about money, I&#8217;ve actually made some recent moves that I&#8217;ve been meaning to do for a long time. And that goes back to that whole inertia thing where it&#8217;s like, okay, here are my accounts and my money or the way they are and they&#8217;ve been like that for years now. And it&#8217;s just hard to shift. But when I was preparing to leave my job, I built up a little bit of a cash cushion, because obviously, I didn&#8217;t expect to have any income coming in after leaving. So I wanted to have more cash on hand.</p>
<p>Then, ironically, that&#8217;s when the Mad Fientist started to make more money so I&#8217;ve never had to tap into that cash reserve. And I&#8217;ve earned more money and yes, I&#8217;ve tried to invest as much as I can over the years to so that I didn&#8217;t build up a huge cash cushion, but it has grown more than it was even then. And like I said, it was already a reasonable cushion because I was expecting to not have any income.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s really embarrassing to admit this, but that has mainly just been sitting in various checking accounts over the years, because I&#8217;m always thinking, &#8220;Okay, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll need this cash anymore, so I should invest it.&#8221; But then I just don&#8217;t do anything because it&#8217;s inertia. And there&#8217;s other stuff to do, and there&#8217;s more interesting things to worry about then trying to figure out how much is too much in your checking account and where you should put the excess cash just sat there for a while doing nothing.</p>
<p>And now, I&#8217;ve just sort of come to the conclusion that I actually like having it there so rather than keep it earning nothing in my checking account, I finally, just this week, opened a savings account.</p>
<p>And the thing that prompted me to do that is Betterment, which is a company that I&#8217;ve written about and talked about before and I met the founder way back at my first FinCon back in 2013, and went to their offices, and visited their team and everything like that and just really liked the company, like what they&#8217;re doing, like the people behind it. They just released a high-yield savings account and it&#8217;s FDIC insured for up to million bucks.</p>
<p>So that was the thing that finally prompted me into action and I got off my ass and actually created a savings account and moved a big chunk of the money that was just sitting and checking doing nothing and now at least I&#8217;m earning something.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like I was and you had a bunch of cash sitting on the sidelines doing nothing and you&#8217;re interested in checking out this high-yield savings account, you can go to madfientist.com/savings, and that&#8217;ll take you to the page and if you sign up, the Mad Fientist could get a little referral fee so thanks in advance if you do that.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more money thing that I did want to talk about as well before I start wrapping up and that is the Equifax data breach. I don&#8217;t know if you guys remember this last year, but Equifax lost like 170 million customers information and the information was just like everything you need to get a loan pretty much because it had social security number, address, all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>It was a huge ordeal I ended up freezing all my credit reports, which really pissed me off because all the credit bureaus were charging me to freeze my own credit and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, hey, that&#8217;s my data. And I&#8217;m at risk here. And you&#8217;re charging me to freeze my data when you&#8217;re making tons of money off of my data.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a huge ordeal and it&#8217;s still a huge ordeal because anytime I want to apply for a new credit card, I have to unfreeze the appropriate credit bureaus report and all this nonsense. So anyway, it took a lot of time and a lot of hassle.</p>
<p>Luckily, Equifax just got in big trouble with the FTC about it all and they have a settlement where you can claim compensation.</p>
<p>So you can claim $125 if you don&#8217;t want to take them up on their offer to give you four or six years of credit monitoring or something like that. But I actually submitted a claim for $345 because I tallied up all the hours that it took me to freeze my credit reports, unfreeze them when I&#8217;m applying for <keyword data-keyword-id="352">credit cards</keyword>, I got my credit reports from all three credit bureaus and I looked through them and made sure that there was no fraudulent actions, etc. I tallied up all those hours and I added up all the costs of freezing and unfreezing my credit reports and end up totaling $345. So hopefully they&#8217;re going to be sending me a check for $345 and that will at least make up for some of the time and hassle of going through all that when it was their fault in the first place.</p>
<p>So even though I just mentioned that time is more important than money these days, I could not help myself from claiming that because I was really angry at the time. So this felt good to do.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in doing that, you can go to madfientist.com/equifax and I will link to the settlement page where you can check to see if you are involved in the breach, and therefore have rights to get some of this money. And then it also has the form on there that you can fill in to make a compensation claim for this whole Equifax data breach.</p>
<p>So I think that&#8217;s everything I wanted to chat to you about today. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been three years. I really cannot believe that much time has gone by and from two years to three years was just so fast so it&#8217;s scary. Hopefully time starts slowing down a little bit.</p>
<p>Hopefully you got something out of that and maybe can prepare better for FI or make your post-FI life even more enjoyable if you&#8217;re already there.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks a lot for listening and I&#8217;ll be back with a normal episode soon!</p>
