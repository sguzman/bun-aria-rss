<title>Self-Similar Gravitational Dynamics, Singularities and Criticality in 2D. (arXiv:2211.01394v1 [hep-th])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01394</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We initiate a systematic study of continuously self-similar (CSS)
gravitational dynamics in two dimensions, motivated by critical phenomena
observed in higher dimensional gravitational theories. We consider CSS
spacetimes admitting a homothetic Killing vector (HKV) field. For a general
two-dimensional gravitational theory coupled to a dilaton field and Maxwell
field, we find that the assumption of continuous self-similarity determines the
form of the dilaton coupling to the curvature. Certain limits produce two
important classes of models, one of which is closely related to two-dimensional
target space string theory and the other being Liouville gravity. The gauge
field is shown to produce a shift in the dilaton potential strength. We
consider static black hole solutions and find spacetimes with uncommon
asymptotic behaviour. We show the vacuum self-similar spacetimes to be special
limits of the static solutions. We add matter fields consistent with
self-similarity (including a certain model of semi-classical gravity) and write
down the autonomous ordinary differential equations governing the gravitational
dynamics. Based on the phenomenon of finite-time blow-up in ODEs, we argue that
spacetime singularities are generic in our models. We present qualitatively
diverse results from analytical and numerical investigations regarding matter
field collapse and singularities. We find interesting hints of a Choptuik-like
scaling law.

<title>Factorization conditions for nonlinear second-order differential equations. (arXiv:2211.01541v1 [nlin.SI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01541</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;For the case of nonlinear second-order differential equations with a constant
coefficient of the first derivative term and polynomial nonlinearities, the
factorization conditions of Rosu and Cornejo-Perez are approached in two ways:
(i) by commuting the subindices of the factorization functions in the two
factorization conditions and (ii) by leaving invariant only the first
factorization condition achieved by using monomials or polynomial sequences.
For the first case the factorization brackets commute and the generated
equations are only equations of Ermakov-Pinney type. The second modification is
non commuting, leading to nonlinear equations with different nonlinear force
terms, but the same first-order part as the initially factored equation. It is
illustrated for monomials with the examples of the generalized Fisher and
FitzHugh-Nagumo initial equations. A polynomial sequence example is also
included.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01586</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In their study of Jack polynomials, Nazarov-Sklyanin introduced a remarkable
new graded linear operator $\mathcal{L}: F[w] \rightarrow F[w]$ where $F$ is
the ring of symmetric functions. In this paper, we (1) establish a cyclic
decomposition $F[w] \cong \bigoplus_{\lambda} Z(j_{\lambda}, \mathcal{L})$ of
the domain of $\mathcal{L}$ into finite-dimensional $\mathcal{L}$-cyclic
subspaces in which Jack polynomials $j_{\lambda}$ may be taken as cyclic
vectors and (2) prove that the restriction of $\mathcal{L}$ to each
$Z(j_{\lambda}, \mathcal{L})$ has simple spectrum given by the anisotropic
contents $[s]$ of the addable corners $s$ of the Young diagram of $\lambda$.
Our proofs of (1) and (2) rely on the commutativity and spectral theorem for
the integrable hierarchy of $\mathcal{L}$, both established by
Nazarov-Sklyanin. Finally, we derive and conjecture several properties of the
$\mathcal{L}$-eigenfunctions $\psi_{\lambda}^s$ which satisfy
$\psi_{\lambda}^s|_{w=0} = j_{\lambda}$.

<title>Scaling up the self-optimization model by means of on-the-fly computation of weights. (arXiv:2211.01698v1 [nlin.AO])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01698</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The Self-Optimization (SO) model is a useful computational model for
investigating self-organization in &quot;soft&quot; Artificial life (ALife) as it has
been shown to be general enough to model various complex adaptive systems. So
far, existing work has been done on relatively small network sizes, precluding
the investigation of novel phenomena that might emerge from the complexity
arising from large numbers of nodes interacting in interconnected networks.
This work introduces a novel implementation of the SO model that scales as
$\mathcal{O}\left(N^{2}\right)$ with respect to the number of nodes $N$, and
demonstrates the applicability of the SO model to networks with system sizes
several orders of magnitude higher than previously was investigated. Removing
the prohibitive computational cost of the naive $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{3}\right)$
algorithm, our on-the-fly computation paves the way for investigating
substantially larger system sizes, allowing for more variety and complexity in
future studies.

<title>Chaos in multiplanetary extrasolar systems. (arXiv:2211.01721v1 [astro-ph.EP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01721</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Here we present an initial look at the dynamics and stability of 178
multiplanetary systems which are already confirmed and listed in the NASA
Exoplanet Archive. To distinguish between the chaotic and regular nature of a
system, the value of the MEGNO indicator for each system was determined. Almost
three-quarters of them could be labelled as long-term stable. Only 45 studied
systems show chaotic behaviour. We consequently investigated the effects of the
number of planets and their parameters on the system stability. A comparison of
results obtained using the MEGNO indicator and machine-learning algorithm SPOCK
suggests that the SPOCK could be used as an effective tool for reviewing the
stability of multiplanetary systems. A similar study was already published by
Laskar and Petit in 2017. We compared their analysis based on the AMD criterion
with our results. The possible discrepancies are discussed.

<title>Photonic Elementary Cellular Automata for Simulation of Complex Phenomena. (arXiv:2211.01811v1 [cs.ET])</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Cellular automata are a class of computational models based on simple rules
and algorithms that can simulate a wide range of complex phenomena. However,
when using conventional computers, these &apos;simple&apos; rules are only encapsulated
at the level of software. This can be taken one step further by simplifying the
underlying physical hardware. Here, we propose and implement a simple photonic
hardware platform for simulating complex phenomena based on cellular automata.
Using this special-purpose computer, we experimentally demonstrate complex
phenomena including fractals, chaos, and solitons, which are typically
associated with much more complex physical systems. The flexibility and
programmability of our photonic computer presents new opportunities to simulate
and harness complexity for efficient, robust, and decentralized information
processing schemes using light.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We extend our earlier work on the compositional structure of cybernetic
systems in order to account for the embodiment of such systems. All their
interactions proceed through their bodies&apos; boundaries: sensations impinge on
their surfaces, and actions correspond to changes in their configurations. We
formalize this morphological perspective using polynomial functors. The
&apos;internal universes&apos; of systems are shown to constitute an indexed category of
statistical games over polynomials; their dynamics form an indexed category of
behaviours. We characterize &apos;active inference doctrines&apos; as indexed functors
between such categories, resolving a number of open problems in our earlier
work, and pointing to a formalization of the &apos;free energy principle&apos; as adjoint
to such doctrines. We illustrate our framework through fundamental examples
from biology, including homeostasis, morphogenesis, and autopoiesis, and
suggest a formal connection between spatial navigation and the process of
proof.

<title>Thermalization of Classical Weakly Nonintegrable Many-Body Systems. (arXiv:2211.01887v1 [nlin.CD])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01887</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We devote our studies to the subject of weakly nonintegrable dynamics of
systems with a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom. Our main points of
interest are the relations between the timescales of thermalization and the
timescales of chaotization; the choice of appropriate observables and the
structure of equations coupling them; identifying the classes of weakly
nonintegrable dynamics and developing tools to diagnose the properties specific
to such classes. We discuss the traditional in the field methods for
thermalization timescale computation and employ them to study the scaling the
timescale with the proximity to the integrable limit. We then elaborate on a
novel framework based on the full Lyapunov spectra computation for large
systems as a powerful tool for the characterization of weak nonintegrability.
In particular, the Lyapunov spectrum scaling offers a quantitative description
allowing us to infer the structure of the underlying network of observables.
Proximity to integrable limit is associated with the rapid growth of
thermalization timescales and, thus, potential numerical challenges. We solve
these challenges by performing numerical tests using computationally efficient
model - unitary maps. The great advantage of unitary maps for numerical
applications is time-discrete error-free evolution. We use these advantages to
perform large timescale and system size computations in extreme proximity to
the integrable limit. To demonstrate the scope of obtained results we report on
the application of the developed framework to Hamiltonian systems.

<title>Quantifying the `end of history&apos; through a Bayesian Markov-chain approach. (arXiv:2211.01955v1 [physics.soc-ph])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01955</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Political regimes have been changing throughout human history. After the
apparent triumph of liberal democracies at the end of the twentieth century,
Francis Fukuyama and others have been arguing that humankind is approaching an
`end of history&apos; (EoH) in the form of a universality of liberal democracies.
This view has been challenged by recent developments that seem to indicate the
rise of defective democracies across the globe. There has been no attempt to
quantify the expected EoH with a statistical approach. In this study, we model
the transition between political regimes as a Markov process and -- using a
Bayesian inference approach -- we estimate the transition probabilities between
political regimes from time-series data describing the evolution of political
regimes from 1800--2018. We then compute the steady state for this Markov
process which represents a mathematical abstraction of the EoH and predicts
that approximately 46 % of countries will be full democracies. Furthermore, we
find that, under our model, the fraction of autocracies in the world is
expected to increase for the next half-century before it declines. Using
random-walk theory, we then estimate survival curves of different types of
regimes and estimate characteristic lifetimes of democracies and autocracies of
244 years and 69 years, respectively. Quantifying the expected EoH allows us to
challenge common beliefs about the nature of political equilibria.
Specifically, we find no statistical evidence that the EoH constitutes a fixed,
complete omnipresence of democratic regimes.

<title>Dynamical quantum ergodicity from energy level statistics. (arXiv:2205.05704v2 [quant-ph] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05704</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Ergodic theory provides a rigorous mathematical description of classical
dynamical systems including a formal definition of the ergodic hierarchy.
Closely related to this hierarchy is a less-known notion of cyclic approximate
periodic transformations [see, e.g., I. Cornfield, S. Fomin, and Y. Sinai,
Ergodic theory (Springer-Verlag New York, 1982)], which maps any &quot;ergodic&quot;
dynamical system to a cyclic permutation on a circle and arguably represents
the most elementary notion of ergodicity. This paper shows that cyclic
ergodicity generalizes to quantum dynamical systems, and this generalization is
proposed here as the basic rigorous definition of quantum ergodicity. It
implies the ability to construct an orthonormal basis, where quantum dynamics
transports an initial basis vector to all other basis vectors one by one, while
maintaining a sufficiently large overlap between the time-evolved initial state
and a given basis state. It is proven that the basis, maximizing the overlap
over all cyclic permutations, is obtained via the discrete Fourier transform of
the energy eigenstates. This relates quantum cyclic ergodicity to level
statistics. We then show that the near-universal Wigner-Dyson level statistics
implies quantum cyclic ergodicity, but the reverse is not necessarily true. For
the latter, we study irrational flows on a 2D torus and prove that both the
classical and quantum flows are cyclic ergodic. However, the corresponding
level statistics is neither Wigner-Dyson nor Poisson. Finally, we use the
cyclic construction to motivate a quantum ergodic hierarchy of operators and
argue that under the additional assumption of Poincare recurrences, cyclic
ergodicity is a necessary condition for such operators to satisfy the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. This work provides a general framework
for transplanting some rigorous concepts of ergodic theory to quantum dynamical
systems.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We present a method for constructing multiphase excitations in the generally

It is based on autoresonant excitation of nonlinear electron plasma waves by
phase locking with small amplitude chirped-frequency ponderomotive drives. We
demonstrate the excitation of these multiphase waves by performing fully
nonlinear numerical simulations of the fluid equations. We develop a simplified
model based on a weakly nonlinear analytical theory by applying Whitham&apos;s
averaged Lagrangian procedure. The simplified model predictions are in good
agreement with the results from the warm fluid simulations. Such autoresonantly
excited multiphase waves form coherent quasicrystalline structures, which can
potentially be used as plasma photonic or accelerating devices. Finally, we
discuss the laser parameters required for the autoresonant excitation of
nonlinear waves in a plasma.
