		<description><![CDATA[<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell received some welcome news in today&#8217;s jobs report: Wage growth is slowing a tad. The gains certainly aren&#8217;t as low as the Fed is hoping for, but the moderation could be a hint that the job market is starting to cool off. Plus, Twitter provides an example of how not to go about layoffs, and YouTube&#8217;s copyright tool sparks frustration for musicians.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the holiday travel season, pilots at two major airlines rejected tentative contracts this week, and a third voted to authorize a strike. Pilots are bargaining for better wages and quality-of-life provisions, all while clocking record-high overtime and grappling with staff shortages. Also in this episode, worker productivity gets a boost, graphite shortages are bad news for EVs, and extreme heat threatens low-income households in Miami.</p>

That&#8217;s the largest annual increase since 1979, and higher energy prices, drought and the war in Ukraine all factor in. Also on today&#8217;s show: mortgage boycotts in China, stagnant household income in the U.S. and the tech that&#8217;s replacing business cards.</p>
