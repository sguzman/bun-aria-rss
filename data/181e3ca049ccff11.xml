   <media:description>In this video we examine the other half of complex calculus: integration. We explain how the idea of a complex line integral arises naturally from real definite integrals via Riemann sums, and we examine some of the properties of this new sort of integral. In particular, we consider some complications that arise when trying to apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to complex functions.

We then bring these ideas to the central focus of this series: the zeta function and the Riemann hypothesis. By the end of the video, we will be able to use complex integrals to approximate the location of the zeroes of the zeta function (or those of any other complex function for that matter)!

   <media:description>Where do complex functions come from? In this video we explore the idea of analytic continuation, a powerful technique which allows us to extend functions such as sin(x) from the real numbers into the complex plane. Using analytic continuation we can finally define the zeta function for complex inputs and make sense of what it is the Riemann Hypothesis is claiming.

   <media:description>In this video, I present Euler's proof that the solution to the Basel problem is pi^2/6. I discuss a surprising connection Euler discovered between a generalization of the Basel problem and the Bernoulli numbers, as well as his invention of the zeta function. I explain Euler's discovery of the connection between the zeta function and the prime numbers, and I discuss how Riemann's continuation of Euler's work led him to state the Riemann hypothesis, one of the most important conjectures in the entire history of mathematics.

   <media:description>This is the first video in a two part series explaining how Euler discovered that the sum of the reciprocals of the square numbers is Ï€^2/6, leading him to define the zeta function, and how Riemann discovered the surprising connection between the zeroes of the zeta function and the distribution of the primes, leading ultimately to his statement of the Riemann Hypothesis.  This video focuses on how Euler developed a method to approximate this sum to 17 decimal places, as well as how the Bernoulli numbers naturally appear as part of this problem.

This mathologer video touches on many of the same topics we do in this video, including Euler-Maclaurin and sums of powers.  It is highly recommended! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw1kRz83Fj0

   <media:description>Today we introduce some of the ideas of analytic number theory, and employ them to help us understand the size of n!.  We use that understanding to discover a surprisingly accurate picture of the distribution of the prime numbers, and explore how this fits into the broader context of one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics, the Riemann Hypothesis.

It is this channel's inaugural video!  Welcome everyone, we hope you enjoy what you see here, and let us know how we did in the comments!
