  <title><![CDATA[#91 - Decoding Your Text Messages with Dr. Mimi Winsberg]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;When it comes to modern relationships, our thumbs do the talking. We swipe right into a stranger’s life, flirt inside text bubbles, spill our hearts onto the screen, and use emojis to convey desire, frustration, and rage. Where once we pored over love letters, now we obsess over response times, or wonder why the three-dot ellipsis came. . . and went.</p><p>Nobody knows this better than our guest this week, Dr. Mimi Winsberg. A Harvard- and Stanford-trained psychiatrist who cofounded a behavioral health startup while serving as resident psychiatrist at Facebook HQ, her work frequently finds her at the intersection of Big Data and Big Dating. Like all of us, Winsberg has been handed many a smartphone accompanied by the urgent plea: “What does this mean?” Unlike all of us, she knows the answer. She is a text whisperer.</p><p>Pick up her new book, Speaking in Thumbs, at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09J7M5X2P/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09J7M5X2P/</a></p><p>Learn more about Dr. WInsberg at <a href="https://www.drwinsberg.com/">https://www.drwinsberg.com/</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;To learn when Maria will open up the next Ask a Matchmaker Hotline, follow her at <a href="http://instagram.com/matchmakermaria">http://instagram.com/matchmakermaria</a></p><p>Follow Agape Match on Instagram at <a href="http://instagram.com/agapematch">http://instagram.com/agapematch</a></p><p>Follow the podcast on Instagram at <a href="http://instagram.com/askamatchmaker">http://instagram.com/askamatchmaker</a>&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[#79 -  Discovering Vulnerability with Atoosa Rubenstein  ]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Maria speaks with Atoosa Rubenstein.</p><p>Atoosa Rubenstein is the author of Atoosa Unedited, an at-times confronting, at-times healing weekly letter on Substack where she models authenticity, self-love and acceptance for her readers. The former Editor-in-Chief of Seventeen Magazine and Founder/Editor-in-Chief of CosmoGIRL! In 1998, Rubenstein created a prototype for CosmoGIRL! within 48 hours and was offered the job on the spot making her, at 26,&nbsp; the youngest Editor in Chief in the over 100 year history of Hearst Magazines. After a successful run at CosmoGIRL!, Hearst acquired Seventeen and tapped Rubenstein to turn the venerable title around. After just one year at the title, Rubenstein reversed a five year decline in Seventeen's newsstand sales and delivered a total newsstand growth of 23% within two years. She also conceived and was an Executive Producer on MTV's Miss Seventeen a series that debuted in the fall of 2005. The following year, Rubenstein left the industry altogether to undergo a grueling 13-year personal excavation and discovery mission that led to three of her own daughters and now, a twice-a-week love letter Atoosa Unedited, written for her beloved readers, now adults in their own right. Columbia University has honored her as one of the top 250 alumni through the ages. She has also been recognized by the Girl Scout Council of Greater New York as a Woman of Distinction. Rubenstein has been featured in Crain's New York Business’ "40 Under 40" and Folio's "30 Under 30." She lives in Manhattan with her three daughters.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Follow Atoosa’s substack at <a href="http://atoosa.substack.com">atoosa.substack.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Attosa on Instagram at <a href="http://instagram.com/atoosarubenstein">http://instagram.com/atoosarubenstein</a> &nbsp;</p><p>Follow Attosa’s TikTok at <a href="http://tiktok.com/@atoosarubenstein ">http://tiktok.com/@atoosarubenstein&nbsp;</a></p><p>Share your name and email and you will be notified first when details for the Agape Intensive Retreat - April 29- May 1, 2022 - are released! <a href="https://agapematch.wufoo.com/forms/z14chqhd03yfh04/">https://agapematch.wufoo.com/forms/z14chqhd03yfh04/</a></p><p></p><p>Follow Maria on Instagram to find out when the Matchmaker Hotline will be open to talk! <a href="http://instagram.com/matchmakermaria">http://instagram.com/matchmakermaria</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Agape Match on Instagram at <a href="http://instagram.com/agapematch">http://instagram.com/agapematch</a></p><p></p><p>Follow the podcast on Instagram at <a href="http://instagram.com/askamatchmaker">http://instagram.com/askamatchmaker</a></p>]]></description>

Why don’t I have that in my life?</p><p> </p><p>When it comes to dating, it’s easy to not make a decision or commitment when there are so many options available. It’s the fear of better options, or FOBO.</p><p> </p><p>But how do we live in the moment? How do we make the decision? How do we appreciate what we already have?</p><p> </p><p>This week Maria discusses this and more with the man that created the term FOMO, Patrick McGinnis!</p><p> </p><p>Patrick J.

Patrick coined the term FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), as well as the related term FOBO (Fear of a Better Option) in a 2004 article in the student newspaper of Harvard Business School. Since that time, FOMO has since been added to the dictionary and FOBO has become an increasingly popular framework to describe choice paralysis.</p><p> </p><p>Patrick is also the host of the hit podcast, FOMO Sapiens (<a href="http://www.fomosapiens.com">www.fomosapiens.com</a>), where entrepreneurial thinkers unpack how they make decisions.

She is the #1 Amazon bestselling author of the books Heal From Your Narcissist Ex and I Left My Toxic Relationship – Now What? Much of her professional practice is focused on helping clients through the process of recovering from the trauma and PTSD of abusive relationships. Having survived her own experience in an abusive relationship, Heather soon came to realize that many other women (and men) find themselves in the same situation, which leaves them feeling broken, ashamed, and paralyzed by fear. Heather combines her experience from her previous teaching career with her integrative therapeutic approach to counselling. Through her virtual programs, speaking engagements, workshops, and retreats, Heather is able to serve a larger population of clients who want interactive guided support from a licensed professional, as they navigate their way through trauma recovery from an abusive relationship and begin the next phase of their lives with safety and confidence.

  <description><![CDATA[<p><br></p><p>This week, you’re getting not one, but TWO matchmakers!</p><p> </p><p>Joining Maria on this week’s episode&nbsp; is her work husband, the Chief Operating Officer and Matchmaker at Agape Match, Louie Felix!&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>Louie Felix is matchmaking industry leader. His corporate startup and acquisition background brought him to the forefront of the relationship industry when he was contracted for the acquisition for a high end Beverly Hills-based matchmaking company. From there, he went on to serve as the CEO of two of the country’s largest matchmaking companies, as well as simultaneously acquiring and running the largest dating company in California.

Champion and Author of the new book, “Get Ready: A Champion’s Guide to Preparing for the Moments That Matter,” Buzzy Cohen!</p><p> </p><p>Buzzy Cohen took America by storm during his ten-game run on Jeopardy! in 2016.

Winning the 2017 Tournament of Champions only bolstered his position as a fan favorite - his gutsy bets and playful attitude with Alex Trebek and other contestants made his competition an all-time favorite for many viewers including yours truly. Cohen returned as one of the six captains for the Season 35 "All-Star Games" where his charm and personality took center stage among such luminaries as Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. He is often cited, by no-less than the NY Times, as a possible replacement host for Alex Trebek.</p><p> </p><p>In hs new book “Get Ready- A Champion’s Guide to Preparing for the Moments That Matter”, Buzzy draws on his own experience as well as interviews with other top performers (from musicians and federal prosecutors to glassblowers and competitive coffee brewers) to teach listeners how the unique preparation method he developed can help them train for high-pressure performance situations in their own lives: interviews, exams, speeches, and even dating!&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>Things discussed in this episode include…</p><p> </p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Get-Ready-Champions-Preparing-Moments/dp/B082MRR4LZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Buzzy’s book, “Get Ready: A Champion’s Guide to Preparing for the Moments That Matter,” on Audible.</span></a></p><p> </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/buzztronics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find Buzzy on Twitter.</span></a></p><p> </p><p><a href="http://instagram.com/matchmakermaria" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow Maria on Instagram</span></a></p><p> </p><p>Have a question for Maria?
