      <title>Debating Queer History in Bros and at the Library of Congress</title>
      <description>Bryan Lowder is still out on book leave, but hosts Christina Cauterucci and Jules Gill-Peterson summon him back to discuss Bros, the gay rom-com of the moment. The film lingers on questions of queer history, shows what happens when a nerdy podcast guy dates a beefy gay bro, and is a fascinating meditation on what it means to be a cis gay man in a time of both progress and prosecution. (This segment lasts around 31 minutes if you want to skip ahead to avoid Bros spoilers.) Then they are joined by Meg Metcalf, an LGBTQ collections specialist at the Library of Congress, to discuss how the world’s biggest library is surfacing the plentiful LGBTQ resources that can be found in its building and in cyberspace. Finally, they add some new items to the gay agenda.

Items discussed in the show:
The Problem With Jon Stewart, “The Problem With Gender”
 “Why Jon Stewart’s Humiliation of an Anti-Trans Official Is So Important,” by Evan Urquhart in Slate
A new report from the Human Rights Campaign and Bowling Green State University
“Billy Eichner’s Curious Claims About Bros,” by J. Bryan Lowder in Slate
“Was Eleanor Roosevelt a Lesbian?” by Heather Schwedel, in Slate
The Library of Congress’ Collections Policy Statement for LGBTQIA+ studies
If you have a question for Meg, or other Library of Congress librarians, go to ask.loc.gov
Chronicling America, the Library of Congress’ database of historic newspapers
 
Gay Agenda
Christina: The episode of NPR’s Code Switch in which Kumari Devarajan profiled comedian and playwright D’Lo, who has a role in Bros
Jules: Faltas: Letters to Everyone in My Hometown Who Isn’t My Rapist, by Cecilia Gentili

      <description>This month, Bryan Lowder is away, so hosts Christina Cauterucci and Jules Gill-Peterson are joined by the podcast’s founding co-host Brandon Tensley to talk about some new representations of LGBTQ people involved in the wide world of sports.

Then they discuss the making of Stay on Board: The Leo Baker Story, the new Netflix documentary about a transgender pro skateboarder, with Nicola Marsh, who directed the movie, along with Giovanni Reda, and executive producer Alex Schmider. Finally, they add some new items to the gay agenda.

Items discussed in the show:
Race Deconstructed, Brandon’s newsletter at CNN
A League of Their Own, on Amazon Prime
Stay on Board: The Leo Baker Story, on Netflix
Slate’s coverage of the Yummers debacle
The 2022 NLGJA Convention in Chicago
The Transgender Issue, by Shon Faye
Gay Agenda
Brandon: Listen to Rina Sawayama’s new album Hold the Girl
Jules: Follow actor, writer, model Hari Nef on Instagram
Christina: Listen to Lauren Ober’s new podcast The Loudest Girl in the World

      <title>Demystifying Monkeypox</title>
      <description>This month, Christina Cauterucci, Jules Gill-Peterson, and Bryan Lowder talk about two very different health stories. First, in the Thots &amp; Queries segment, they respond to a listener who has questions about the ethics of moving to another country in an age of Supreme uncertainty. Then they talk with Harun Tulunay, a London-based sexual-health advocate, about his experience with monkeypox. He has been sharing his experiences with the disease, including the challenges of receiving a correct diagnosis. In New York City, the rollout of the monkeypox vaccine program was a disaster. Then they are joined by journalist Io Dodds to discuss her recent piece for the Independent: “ ‘Never Ask Permission’: How Two Trans Women Ran a Legendary Underground Surgical Clinic in a Rural Tractor Barn.” (Note, Jules was interviewed for the piece.)
Items discussed in the show:
Conjuring Kesha, on Discovery +
“ ‘Never Ask Permission’: How Two Trans Women Ran a Legendary Underground Surgical Clinic in a Rural Tractor Barn,” by Io Dodds, in the Independent

Gay Agenda
Bryan: “What Should a Queer Children’s Book Do?” by Jessica Winter in the New Yorker

Then they are joined by journalist Io Dodds to discuss her recent piece for the Independent: “ ‘Never Ask Permission’: How Two Trans Women Ran a Legendary Underground Surgical Clinic in a Rural Tractor Barn.” (Note, Jules was interviewed for the piece.)

      <title>Is Marriage Equality in Jeopardy?</title>
      <description>In the final Pride month special episode, Bryan and Christina talk with Slate senior writer Mark Joseph Stern. They assess what the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, the case that swept away Roe v. Wade, might mean for LGBTQ rights. Should we be worried about marriage equality? Given Americans’ purported love of privacy, is there any way that the right to same-sex intimacy, protected in Lawrence v. Texas, might now come under attack? Mark helps the hosts find hope, slim though it might be, amid the cruelty of the Dobbs decision.
Items discussed in the show:
The episode of Amicus in which Dahlia Lithwick and guests discussed Dobbs (and Bruen).
Season 7 of Slow Burn, about Roe v. Wade and the history of abortion rights in America.
A special post-Dobbs episode of The Waves, with Christina and Cheyna Roth.
“The Supreme Court’s Next Target Is Marriage Equality. It Won’t Be the Last,” by Mark Joseph Stern
“The Lawlessness of the Dobbs Decision,” by Dahlia Lithwick and Neil S. Siegel.

      <title>Is Fire Island the Gay Rom-Com We've Been Waiting For?</title>
      <description>This month, in honor of Pride, we’re bringing you extra episodes of Outward.
This week, hosts Christina Cauterucci, Jules Gill-Peterson, and Bryan Lowder dig into the big gay movie of summer 2022: Fire Island. Directed by Andrew Ahn and written by Joel Kim Booster, who also appears in the film, Fire Island explores the magic of queer spaces like the titular enclave—along with the class and race disparities that so often beset them. The film, which also stars Bowen Yang, Margaret Cho, and Conrad Ricamora, is a gay resetting of Pride and Prejudice. Does it succeed? The hosts discuss this, and much more, in spoiler-filled detail.

      <title>Pride Month Special: Supporting Trans Youth</title>
      <description>This month, in honor of Pride, we’re going to be bringing you an Outward episode every week. You’ll still get the biggie on June 22, with Pride and Provocations, the Gay Agenda, and all the usual fun, but we’re also going to supply some shorter snacks of gay goodness every Wednesday.
We’ve got some great things lined up--interviews, coverage of the big queer summer movie, and of course reflections on Pride--but we also want to share some great LGBTQ content from around the Slate podcast network.
Today, it’s a segment from a recent episode of Mom and Dad Are Fighting, Slate’s parenting podcast. In light of the attacks on trans youth around the country, hosts Jamilah Lemieux, Zak Rosen, and Elizabeth Newcamp invited Outward’s own Jules Gill-Peterson onto the show to provide some historical context and offer advise on what people can do to support trans kids and their parents.
The Mom and Dad Are Fighting episode was produced by Rosemary Belson and Jasmine Ellis.

      <title>Prisons in Queer History and Pop Culture</title>
      <description>This month Bryan, Christina, and Jules explore the intersection of queer life and incarceration. How has America’s prison-loving penal system shaped our history and present, and how does that experience get channeled—or not—into the culture we make and consume? The hosts are joined by Hugh Ryan, author of the new book The Women’s House of Detention: A Queer History of a Forgotten Prison, which uses one infamous mid-century institution in New York’s Greenwich Village to return the overlooked lives of incarcerated women and transmasculine folks to our collective story, and to make a stirring case for prison abolition as a queer issue. Then they discuss how prison shows up in pop culture—and whether they’re entirely comfortable with those fantasies.

      <itunes:subtitle>How America’s penal system shaped LGBTQ culture.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>This month Bryan, Christina, and Jules explore the intersection of queer life and incarceration. How has America’s prison-loving penal system shaped our history and present, and how does that experience get channeled—or not—into the culture we make and consume? The hosts are joined by Hugh Ryan, author of the new book The Women’s House of Detention: A Queer History of a Forgotten Prison, which uses one infamous mid-century institution in New York’s Greenwich Village to return the overlooked lives of incarcerated women and transmasculine folks to our collective story, and to make a stirring case for prison abolition as a queer issue. Then they discuss how prison shows up in pop culture—and whether they’re entirely comfortable with those fantasies.
Items discussed in the show:

Two recent articles on phalloplasty: “How Ben Got His Penis,” by Jamie Lauren Keiles in the New York Times, and “My Penis Myself,” by Gabriel Mac in New York

      <title>Queer Families in Kindergarten and the Multiverse</title>
      <description>This month Bryan, Christina, and Jules take a break from talking about the hostile legislation queer and trans people are fighting against to talk about what they’re fighting for. Brooklyn kindergarten teacher Eliza Cutler joins the hosts to share what it looks like when teachers are free to speak about LGBTQ lives in the classroom. Then they discuss the queer family drama at the heart of the new genre-bending, multiverse-hopping film Everything Everywhere All at Once. (NOTE: If you don't want to hear spoilers for Everything Everywhere All at Once, you can jump from the 33-minute mark to the 59-minute point, but come back after you've seen the movie. You don't want to miss this conversation.)
Items discussed in the show:
Robbie Pierce’s Twitter thread about the homophobic harassment his family endured while riding Amtrak
Queers responding to homophobic legislation with … merch
The long life and sad demise of Bitch Media.
They She He Me: Free to Be, by Maya Christina Gonzalez and Matthew SG
Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress, by Christine Baldacchino and Isabelle Malenfant
Jacob’s New Dress, by Sarah and Ian Hoffman and Chris Cage
Introducing Teddy, by Jessica Walton and Dougal MacPherson
Pugdog, by Andrea U’Ren
“Everything Everywhere All at Once Is a Queer Masterpiece of Colossa Sincerity,” by Drew Gregory, in Autostraddle 
“Everything Everywhere All at Once Is an Emotional Gut Punch About Queer Erasure, Acceptance,” by Patrick Ryan, in USA Today
“This One Stale Joke Won’t Let Everything Everywhere All at Once Be Great,” by Kyle Turner, in W
“On Being Trans and Watching Everything Everywhere All at Once,” by Linda Codega, in Gizmodo

Gay Agenda
Christina: “Sex, Love, and Art in the Suburbs,” by Garth Greenwell, in Esquire
Bryan: “This Beach in Mexico Is an L.G.B.T.Q. Haven. But Can It Last?” by Oscar Lopez and Lisette Poole, in the New York Times

      <title>The Trans Past, Present, and Future</title>
      <description>Bryan, Christina, and Jules respond to the anti-trans attacks coming out of state legislatures across the country, particularly in Texas, where the governor and attorney general have tried to make caring for trans kids into a form of child abuse. Jules sketches out what a trans child’s life would look and feel like over the coming years as a result of these draconian bills and administrative attacks. Then they are joined by Michael Waters to discuss his recent piece for Slate about trans pioneer Barbara Ann Richards, who went to court in 1941 to legally change her name—and succeeded.
Items discussed in the show:
Lauren Groff discusses the writing of her novel Matrix on the podcast Women Who Travel
 “The GOP’s All-Out Assault on Trans People,” The Waves, March 3, 2022, featuring Jules Gill-Peterson and Evan Urquhart
“Barbara Ann Richards Designed—and Then Demanded—the Life She Deserved,” by Michael Waters
True Sex: The Lives of Trans Men at the Turn of the Twentieth Century, by Emily Skidmore
Gay Agenda
Christina: Start your own Dyke Night!
Bryan: QueerSpace, a podcast from the National Air and Space Museum
Jules: The 2022 Lambda Literary Award nominations

      <description>Christina and Bryan discuss the finer points of new queer Christmas movies—like, how realistic is Netflix’s Single All The Way?—and why that harness joke in Lifetime’s Under The Christmas Tree was so jarring. We’re also joined by some special guests who share Prides and Provocations from the past year and explore Premonitions for 2022. We close the year with bell hooks and trans triumphs in the Gay Agenda.

      <title>Hot Queer Summer, Hot Queer Strippers</title>
      <description>It’s August, and Outward is leaning into the heat. First, Christina, Bryan, and Rumaan gab about the beach. Why, exactly, are queer beaches so delightful? Is there a secret geography of finding the gay beach? They then talk to GirlFlexx, a female dom stripper who performs largely for straight women in a traditionally male style -- and kills it in adoration and tips.
Items discussed on the show:
An ice cream cake you can make "in the back of your car."
The upcoming Chromatica remix album, confirmed by Lady Gaga.
Outsports.com's coverage of the Olympics.
Provincetown's citizen scientist effort to contact trace a Delta variant outbreak.
A lawyer who fought for marriage equality helped disgraced Governor Andrew Cuomo discredit abuse victims.
A primer on lesbian dom strippers.
Gay Agenda
Bryan: Lindsay Morris and Ruth Padawar's photo essay about Camp I Am.
Rumaan: Colm Toibin's The Master.
Christina: The L Word: Generation Q.

      <title>Milestones Mourned and Celebrated</title>
      <description>A year-and-a-half into the pandemic, Christina, Bryan, and Rumaan look back at all the times we did not get to share our milestones -- good, bad, or just big -- with other queers. If a queer comes out in the forest where no one can hear them are they still queer? Yes, but perhaps less joyfully than if they had been in community. The hosts then speak with Lucia Lucas, the first female baritone to perform a principal opera role on the American stage as Don Giovanni.
Items discussed on the show:
A recent assault at Nellie's gay bar in DC draws protests.
Richard Branson wore a rainbow ribbon during his space flight.
Breakthrough COVID infections strike Provincetown.
The Sound of Identity, a documentary about Lucia Lucas's appearance as Don Giovanni.
Gay Agenda
Bryan: director's cut of Studio 54
Christina: How Twitter Can Ruin a Life by Emily VanDerWerff
Rumaan: two wistful and sexy short stories read by author Douglas Stuart on The Writer's Voice podcast.

      <title>Barrett, Biden, and Backwards Bryan</title>
      <description>This month, Christina, Bryan, and Rumaan speak with Ria Tabacco Mar, the ACLU’s director of the Women’s Rights Project, about what the future for LGBTQ people looks like with president-elect Biden and an even more conservative Supreme Court. Then they discuss Uncle Frank, a film from Alan Ball about a gay man and his partner on a road trip with his niece from Manhattan to South Carolina in the 1970’s. They talk about how this differs from last month’s Boys In the Band, and the importance of remembering past queer struggles.

      <title>Caught in Gay Amber</title>
      <description>This month, Christina, Bryan, and Rumaan look at fact and fiction in gay history. First, they examine Netflix’s recent version of The Boys in the Band in the context of the original, and how it captures a specific moment of gay life. Then they discuss the new HBO series EQUAL, which seeks to tell the stories of important figures from the history of the LGBTQ movement. They discuss how the utter modernity of interpretation and style leave the series lacking, but how useful it could be as a teaching tool and reminder of pre-Stonewall activism. Producer Daniel pops in for a short segment about the Ryan Murphy of it all.

      <title>Being Horny Is Thorny</title>
      <description>This month, Christina, Bryan, and Rumaan interview journalist Angela Chen about her new book, Ace: What Asexuality Reveals About Desire, Society, and the Meaning of Sex. They talk about asexuality’s rise in visibility, where ace people fit in the queer community, and how asexuality can lead us to question so many of our assumptions about social constructions that depend on who your sexual partners are. Then they unpack the story of gay politician Alex Morse, whose recent congressional campaign was plagued with accusations of sexual impropriety, and what a politician’s queer sex life is allowed to look like.

      <title>The Queerness of Quarantine Bubbles</title>
      <description>This month, Christina admits to creating a quarantine bubble, and she talks with Bryan and Rumaan about why she felt comfortable joining her friends in this way and why our community seems better-equipped than others to figure out how to make such micro-communities work.

      <title>Special Episode: The Inheritance</title>
      <description>In this special bonus episode of Outward, Bryan and a guest panel of multigenerational gay men devote a whole hour to The Inheritance, a seven-hour, two-part play by Matthew Lopez that won many awards for its recent run in London and is currently dominating discussions on Broadway. There will be spoilers!
While it’s length, ambition, and engagement with the AIDS crisis have invited comparisons to Tony Kushner’s “gay fantasia on national themes” Angels in America, The Inheritance’s driving concern is a bit more personal: If gay men think of ourselves as a community spanning generations, what happens when a huge swath of that community is lost to plague, the survivors deeply traumatized, and younger cohorts must therefore come of age and figure out what it means to be gay in the wake of a tragedy that shapes everything around us? Borrowing a line from E.M. Forester’s Howard’s End, on which the play is based, The Inheritance desperately wants gay men to “connect” across age and loss — but is that kind of connection really possible?

First, the team invites Slate executive editor Allison Benedikt to talk about the ways children learn about queerness and sexuality, what we can do to teach and be an example, and how kids often pick up this stuff without us. Then they interview clinical psychologist Dr. Laura Edwards-Leeper about a recent case in Texas involving a trans child, the best routes for handling pre-adolescent trans care, and how affirming a child’s gender identity can really only help. And, of course, we’ve got our usual rounds of gay agenda and prides and provocations.

      <title>Fights</title>
      <description>This month, Christina, Bryan, and Brandon look at the debates that can sometimes divide the queer family. After the usual Pride and Provocations, they dig into three fights happening in our community, including how critical we should be of queer art, authenticity of queer artists, and what we should all think about Marianne Williamson. Then we hear an interview with the late gay and lesbian rights activist Jean O’Leary, thanks to our friends at the Making Gay History podcast. We close it out with the gay agenda before saying farewell to Brandon, who is heading off to a new job at CNN.

      <title>Icons</title>
      <description>This month, Christina, Bryan, and Brandon immerse themselves in iconography. After a round of Pride and Provocations, we hear from a collection of queer Slate folks about who their icons are. Then the hosts explore major figures in their lives and what exactly makes an icon for different parts of the queer community. That is followed by an interview with Washington, D.C. drag king Pretty Rik E about the experience of drag and the influences straight male performers have on drag kings. And, as always, they wrap it up with a quick rundown of the gay agenda.
