      <title>6. “The Human Condition” | Gene and Roger</title>
      <description>For Siskel and Ebert, the '90s were a revolutionary era—both for the movies and for their careers. A new generation of filmmakers was taking over Hollywood, and Gene and Roger became cheerleaders for the bold next wave of writers and directors. But the industry was also plagued by problems and controversies, many of which Siskel and Ebert faced head on. By the time the '90s ended, Gene and Roger would become more than just the country's best-known film critics. They'd also become advocates.

      <title>5. Attack of the Clones | Gene and Roger</title>
      <description>As Gene and Roger jumped from one program to another, they left behind shows that were desperate to replicate the duo’s groundbreaking success. These reiterations, along with other imitations of the format, paved the way for a television market saturated with Siskel and Ebert wannabes. But what they all failed to realize was that what made Gene and Roger special was Gene and Roger themselves.

      <title>4. Top Guns | Gene and Roger</title>
      <description>The '80s were the blockbuster era—and Siskel and Ebert were its blockbuster film critics. It was the decade in which Gene and Roger would realize the full extent of their powers, as well as their limitations. And it would find them making yet another high-profile business decision, one that would have big consequences for Gene.

But it also united them as they made one of the riskiest moves of their careers—a move that would change the way films were talked about, and that made Gene and Roger bigger than ever.

      <title>The ‘Tenet’ Commentary : yratnemmoC ‘teneT’ ehT</title>
      <description>This is a special episode of 'The Big Picture': a watch-along commentary track for Christopher Nolan’s 11th feature film. In March, we teamed up with Chris Ryan for our first commentary, a four-hour journey through 'Zack Snyder’s Justice League,' a.k.a the Snyder Cut. We barely survived. This time, we’re diving into a more complex movie, but fortunately one we have seen before. This is our collective third viewing of Nolan’s controversial, confusing, and, we will argue, wrongly overlooked 'Tenet.' We will be together for all 150 minutes of this movie, and we want you to watch along with us. Let’s go!

      <title>Introducing the 2021 Movie Auction</title>
      <description>Welcome to the first 'Big Picture' Movie Auction. What’s that? Well, as we anticipate our return to movie theaters, we thought we’d find a way to measure the movies we’re most excited to see in 2021. The return of James Bond? ‘Top Gun: Maverick’? Three MCU movies? This could be a fun year for Hollywood after all. And what better way to express our excitement than to wager cold, hard (imaginary) cash? Chris Ryan joins Sean and Amanda for a good old-fashioned auction, movie-style.

      <description>Sean and Amanda welcome author Chuck Klosterman to dive deep into two fascinating topics.

      <description>Last year, Sean and Amanda bravely and controversially ranked the 35 best movie stars under 35.

Earlier this week, we celebrated the decade anniversary of 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' with a special episode. What else happened in movies that year? How could we have a fun conversation that didn’t just rehash the release schedule? We got an idea for a kind of movie draft: six categories, six picks each, snake-style. Chris Ryan joins Sean and Amanda to determine who has the best 2010 movie roster. Listen and decide for yourselves.

      <description>Here's the case as it stands: We put the vote to you, the jurors, and you wanted to hear our closing arguments on the best courtroom dramas in movie history.

They talk through picks from the 1940s all the way through the 1990s, and explore why the courtroom drama has vanished from the movie landscape.

      <title>Movie Apocalypse: 'Trolls World Tour' Is the Most Important Film of 2020 | The Big Picture</title>
      <description>The 'Trolls' sequel wouldn't normally be a topic of serious interrogation on the show, but with new theatrical releases on hold, 'Trolls World Tour' has become a fascinating test case for the future of movies. After what appears to be a successful rollout straight to streaming video on demand, Sean and Amanda break down the industry implications of the film's release (0:57). Then, Rob Harvilla joins to talk about parenting with movies during quarantine, the particular frustrations of the 'Trolls' universe, and why this is one of the most important films ever made about rock criticism (14:29).

      <title>Criterion Channel Is a Streaming Miracle. Here are 25 Movies You Should Watch Now | The Big Picture</title>
      <description>The Criterion Channel streaming service is celebrating its one-year anniversary this week and it has been a shelter in a storm for movie lovers during quarantine. To celebrate, we've asked 15 friends of The Big Picture—writers, filmmakers, and critics—to explain why the Channel is so crucial and suggest one must-watch from its massive and essential library. (And maybe a few runners-up, too.) Then, Sean is joined by Criterion programmer Penelope Bartlett to break down how the movies find their way to the service.

Hosts: Sean Fennessey
Guests: Ari Aster, Penelope Bartlett, Erin Lee Carr, Amanda Dobbins (and Amanda's dad), Sam Esmail, Liz Hannah, Barry Jenkins, Miranda July, Adam Nayman, Amy Nicholson, Alex Ross Perry, Peyton Reed, Chris Ryan, Benny Safdie, Josh Safdie

      <title>Movie Swap: 'Aliens' vs. 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' | The Big Picture</title>
      <description>Hollywood has officially canceled summer movie season, so we're going back to old favorites and exposing each other to new experiences. For their latest movie swap, Sean chooses James Cameron's epic sci-fi actioner 'Aliens,' while Amanda selects Richard Curtis's aggressively charming rom-com 'Four Weddings and a Funeral.' Will they love the picks? Hate them? Will they come to understand each other more deeply as humans?

Sean and Amanda have scanned the results and decided to hand out some premature Academy Awards to spotlight the very best we've seen so far. Then, they do a little guesswork, peruse the year ahead, and make some blind guesses on the 2021 winners for the big six Oscar categories.

      <title>Movie Theaters Are Closed. When They Reopen, Will the Movies Follow? | The Big Picture</title>
      <description>With virtually every major new release pushed back and the box office recording a record low over the weekend, movie theaters have shuttered around the country to battle the coronavirus. And some studios are starting to make their movies widely available on streaming services and VOD platforms. Sean and Amanda talk about the brave new world of movies, what these radical changes could portend for releases both big and small, and whether the industry will ever be able to turn back to the old way of doing things. They also make some streaming recommendations for the self-quarantined and pick the one 2020 release they'd like to have in their homes right now.

      <title>Ben Affleck and Life After Batman in 2020; Plus: Bill Simmons on 'The Invisible Man' | The Big Picture</title>
      <description>As his new drama, 'The Way Back,' nears release, Ben Affleck is back in the spotlight and opening up about his struggles with substance misuse. It's the latest in a career that has collided the personal with the artistic in a way few writer-director-actors can claim. Sean and Amanda talk through Affleck's series of comebacks, his utterly unique brand of stardom, and the last decade of self-reflexive roles in movies both mega-successful and widely reviled (1:08). Then, Bill Simmons swings by to pick some nits in the weekend's box office champ, 'The Invisible Man’ (48:51).

      <title>Predicting the 2020 Oscars | The Big Picture</title>
      <description>In our final show before the 92nd Oscars, we run down every category and predict what we think will win each award. Will it be a historic night for 'Parasite' and Bong Joon-ho, a sweep for '1917' and Sam Mendes, or a night full of curveballs we don't see coming? We also discuss whether the feeling of inevitability surrounding the acting categories has decreased excitement for the show overall.

Then, they make the case for 'Parasite' as the right pick for the prize, celebrating its writing, production design, performances, direction, and so much more (37:02).

      <title>Has '1917' Already Locked Up Best Picture? And Is That Bad for the Academy Awards? | The Oscars Show</title>
      <description>After a victory at the Directors Guild of America Awards, Sam Mendes's '1917' seems poised for dominance on Oscar night. How did the most exciting race in years become so predictable so quickly? And if there are surprises on February 9, what will they be? Sean, Amanda, and Chris Ryan debate whether a '1917' Best Picture win would signal a return to unimaginative Academy tradition (1:17). Then they break down the weekend's box office winners and losers, including Guy Ritchie's tasteless but entertaining crime romp 'The Gentlemen' (22:32).

      <title>The 15 Most Anticipated Movies at Sundance. Plus: Randy Newman! | The Big Picture</title>
      <description>We've touched down in Park City, Utah, for the Sundance Film Festival and we're ready to watch some movies. Sean and Amanda break down what it means to be a Sundance movie, the evolving state of the festival, and a few of the films they've already seen, including a Taylor Swift documentary and a hair-centric horror movie from the director of 'Dear White People' (1:00). Then, they share their lists of the movies they're most excited to see, from documentaries with grave international consequences to a drama based on a "stripper saga" Twitter thread (19:12). Finally, Sean is joined by Randy Newman to discuss his Oscar-nominated work in 'Marriage Story' and 'Toy Story 4,' his showdown at the Academy Awards with his cousin Thomas Newman, and his long career as a songwriter, composer, and bastion of wit and wisdom (41:55).

      <description>Sean and Amanda recap a night in which '1917' won big, taking home both Best Motion Picture—Drama and Best Director.

Plus: Does Joaquin Phoenix's win for Best Actor—Drama for 'Joker' hurt Adam Driver's chances to win Best Actor for 'Marriage Story' at the Academy Awards?

      <title>Why 'Little Women' Matters. Plus: Greta Gerwig! | The Big Picture</title>
      <description>It's been 25 years since the last Hollywood adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel about the March sisters. Why did Greta Gerwig want to tackle this piece of classic literature for her 'Lady Bird' follow-up (14:15)? We look at how she refashioned and reimagined certain aspects of the book, how it fits in with previous iterations of the story, and why there's something uniquely urgent about it. Then, Gerwig joins the show to talk about how she conceived the film and executed her vision (1:00:00).

Then actor Antonio Banderas joins Sean to discuss making the transition from Spain to America; his decades-long collaboration with director Pedro Almodóvar; and their latest film, 'Pain and Glory' (62:20).

Then, Sean is joined by screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski to talk about their new, Eddie Murphy–starring film, 'Dolemite Is My Name,' and their long history capturing what they call "the fringe history of America" in their screenplays (52:21).

      <description>Political subtext is everywhere, even at the movies.

Amanda and Sean look closely at each movie and the circumstances that led to their messages (2:00). Then, Sean is joined by 'Zombieland: Double Tap' director Ruben Fleischer to discuss the sequel to his 2009 hit, his work on 'Venom,' and more (53:00).

      <title>Oscar Bait Reborn: 'Hustlers' Cashes In, 'The Goldfinch' Flops Hard, and 'Jojo Rabbit' Hops into the Best Picture Race | The Oscars Show</title>
      <description>After winning the Audience Award at TIFF, 'Jojo Rabbit' is likely to follow in the footsteps of past winners like 'Green Book' and 'Three Billboards,' straight to the Oscars. Sean and Amanda break down its chances and the post-festival discourse (0:51) before examining the box office success of 'Hustlers' and the failure of 'The Goldfinch' to reassess what we talk about when we talk about "Oscar Bait" (9:55). Then, documentary filmmaker Matt Tyrnauer joins to discuss his latest, 'Where's My Roy Cohn?,' a close look at the controversial lawyer and political operator who brokered power for everyone from Joseph McCarthy to Donald Trump (62:31).

      <title>The WTF Movies of 2019 So Far | The Big Picture</title>
      <description>You asked and we answered—sort of. In a year dominated by superheroes, it's been hard to find a common theme at the movies for just about anything else. So we share some of the weirdest movies of the year so far, like 'Serenity,' 'Under the Silver Lake,' and 'Wine Country.' Then we break down some of our favorites, including Olivier Assayas's 'Non-Fiction' and Claire Denis's 'High Life.'

      <title>‘Avengers: Endgame’ Has Overwhelmed Hollywood. Is That OK? | The Big Picture</title>
      <description>We discuss the high-wire act that ‘Avengers: Endgame’ was trying to pull off—stitching together over a decade of films into one neat, fan-serviceable, creative ending—and if it ultimately worked (1:00). Then, we take a step back and look at some of the numbers ‘Endgame’ put up at the box office, and whether it spells total domination for the mid-budget movie (23:40). Finally, we look ahead to a summer full of non-Marvel movies and share which ones we’re most excited for (40:30).

      <title>‘Avengers: Endgame’: Emergency Deep Dive (SPOILERS) | Exit Survey</title>
      <description>‘Avengers: Endgame,’ the culmination of more than a decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe films, is finally here. We discuss how the long-running arcs of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and many others have been strung together and resolved in ‘Endgame.’ Plus, we break down the movie’s complex ideas about time travel, character deaths, and, ultimately, its stakes. Finally, we take stock of where this leaves the MCU, and what could be in store for Phase 4 and beyond.

      <description>‘Avengers: Endgame’ is just days away, and with that comes the final installment in our Marvel Month series: ‘Spider-Man: Homecoming.’ We discuss our relationships with Spider-Man as a cinematic figure, Tom Holland’s portrayal of a character who hadn’t been quite nailed down by other talented actors like Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, and where the character is headed as the Marvel story drifts further into space—decidedly different than the high school setting of this film.

      <title>The Oscars Are Removing Four Categories From the Telecast. Why? Plus a Conversation With Nominee Nicholas Britell | The Oscars Show (Ep. 126)</title>
      <description>We sift through what’s real and what’s just British after the BAFTAs this weekend, and whether or not the ‘A Star Is Born’ media blitz is helping or hurting its stock at the Oscars. Then we wonder what might happen if the Oscars telecast is as much of a disaster as it’s shaping up to be. Finally, Sean sits down with Nicholas Britell—the composer of the ‘If Beale Street Could Talk,’ ‘Moonlight,’ and ‘Succession’ soundtracks—to talk about the process of conceiving a score and working with a director to execute their vision.

      <itunes:subtitle>We sift through what’s real and what’s just British after the BAFTAs this weekend, and whether or not the ‘A Star Is Born’ media blitz is helping or hurting its stock at the Oscars. Then we wonder what might happen if the Oscars telecast is as much of a disaster as it’s shaping up to be. Finally, Sean sits down with Nicholas Britell—the composer of the ‘If Beale Street Could Talk,’ ‘Moonlight,’ and ‘Succession’ soundtracks—to talk about the process of conceiving a score and working with a director to execute their vision.

Night Shyamalan’s final installation in an almost-two-decade-long trilogy that includes ‘Unbreakable’ and ‘Split.’ Where does the movie, which stars a cast of James McAvoy, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Willis, fit into a catalogue that includes home runs like ‘The Sixth Sense’ and lows like ‘The Happening?’
