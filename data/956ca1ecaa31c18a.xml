      <title>“70 Sounds Young to Me” with Dr. Diane Meier </title>
      <link>https://pineapple.fm/</link>
      <description>Paul Price shares what he has learned about how to make the most of the time we have left. Then Max talks with Dr. Diane Meier, a geriatrician and founder of Mount Sinai’s Center to Advance Palliative Care, about what she has learned from helping so many people make meaning of their lives, how to have hard conversations with people we care about, and why 70 feels exciting and unknown.

Special thanks to Agnes Frith and The Golden Wattle Cafe, “a regular cafe event for people living with dementia, their carers, and others who would like to join us.”

      <title>“Be. Do. Have.” with Judith Light</title>
      <link>https://pineapple.fm/</link>
      <description>Greg O’Brien shares how a terminal diagnosis revealed his purpose in life. Then Max talks with Judith Light about how her career opened up when she started to focus on what she could give rather than what she could get, and how that transformation has helped her think about death in a “real, conscious and alive way.”

      <title>Revisiting Our First Episode with Sister Helen Prejean</title>
      <link>https://pineapple.fm/</link>
      <description>This week we’re going back to our first interview of 70 Over 70 with Sister Helen Prejean, who has dedicated her life to ending the death penalty in America. Sister Helen’s interview helped set the tone for our show, and as 70 Over 70 comes to an end—yup, we’ve only got a few episodes left—we wanted to revisit this first conversation and share Sister Helen’s thoughts on what it really means to be present, how to show up for others, and why gratitude is so important at any stage of life.

      <title>Introducing: 9/12</title>
      <description>How did 9/11 the day become 9/11 the idea? That question drives award-winning host Dan Taberski (Missing Richard Simmons, Running From COPS, The Line) to shift his focus to what happened on 9/12, and every day after that. 9/12 is a poignant, surprising, and surprisingly funny seven episode series about people who wake up on 9/12 having to navigate a new, radically altered world. A teenager gets caught up in an out-of-control conspiracy theory that he helped start. A Pakistani business owner finds hundreds of his Brooklyn neighbors are disappearing. Joke-writers at The Onion must figure out just how soon is “too soon”? 9/12 asks what it all means. We know what happened on 9/11. But what happened on 9/12 to alter our memory and our perspective forever? 
Listen to 9/12: wondery.fm/9_12_70Over70 All seven episodes of 9/12 are available to stream now on Amazon Music or Wondery+. Episodes will release weekly everywhere starting September 8th.
