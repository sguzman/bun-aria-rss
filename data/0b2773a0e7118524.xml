      <title>Emmanuel Acho: &quot;As Long As I Get Up, I Win.&quot;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hoda sits down with former NFL linebacker Emmanuel Acho, creator of Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man. Emmanuel shares how he found his calling – not in his strength on the football field – but with the power of listening and sharing the stories of others, first online and then with a best-selling book. Released by five pro teams in five years, Emmanuel learned the true meaning of perseverance. And just like all of us, he’s faced rejection, criticism, and moments of uncertainty. But as Emmanuel puts it, having a setback isn’t failing, it’s falling: and if you can get back up, you win.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You probably know Jenna Bush Hager as Hoda’s co-host on TODAY with Hoda & Jenna. As you’ll hear, they’re so friendly on air because they’re real friends off-air — and their friendship has only grown and deepened over the years. And because this podcast has been about friendship and wisdom, there’s no better way to bring it all home than with a girlfriend. For our last episode of Season One, we invite you into an intimate conversation, touching on everything from lessons learned by example during childhood to what it means for Jenna to turn 40. Together, Hoda and Jenna talk about birth, love, loss and the importance of work ethic. Plus, a special look back at the highlights and moments that touch on what Hoda is finally making space for.</p>

They also share a deep joy in simple things like the honor of motherhood later in life and the fulfillment that comes with reaching this stage in the game. Sheryl shares what she’s learned – perspective she’s gained from her own mother, her sons and thirty years in the music industry.</p>

      <title>Mitch Albom: “What We Choose to Carry is Actually What Ends Up Defining Us”</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When sportswriter Mitch Albom started meeting with his former professor Morrie Schwartz toward the end of Morrie’s life, Mitch had no idea the impact those meetings would have — not only on him, but around the world. Mitch compiled those lessons into a book, and, nearly twenty-five years and 17 million copies of <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> later, Mitch Albom continues to apply the lessons learned from Morrie to live a richer and more purposeful life. Throughout this conversation, Hoda and Mitch connect on love, loss and legacy. As Mitch so beautifully details in this emotional conversation, “what we choose to fill our arms with, and what we choose to carry is actually what ends up defining us.”</p>
