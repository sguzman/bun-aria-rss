<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It's the weekend, and that means it's time to round up the week's best deals. As we anticipate, each weekend (and every day, really) in November brings with it a new round of discounts on popular, big-ticket items, typically at their lowest prices of the year. Today that includes headphones from Sony, Beats, Jabra, and a deal on refurbished AirPods Max.</p>
<p>Sony has two great offers on its latest- and last-generation noise-canceling headphones. The frustratingly-named but high-quality WH-1000XM5 (<strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3ysb540" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$348</a></strong>, <del>$400</del>) and WH-1000XM4 (<a href="https://amzn.to/3U85ZTm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>$228</strong></a>, <del>$348</del>) are discounted to match the lowest prices we've tracked for either. Since Sony released the latest WH-1000XM5, it continues to sell the previous generation WH-1000XM4 alongside it. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/sonys-wh-1000xm5-headphones-come-with-a-new-design-50-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When we tested</a> the 5 versus the 4, we found it to improve slightly on just about every aspect of the previous gen headphones. They're better for phone calls, a bit lighter, and can charge more quickly. They also cant fold up for storage like the 4. These aren't what we'd call paradigm-shifting leaps, but rather moderate improvements, for the most part. Selling for over $100 less at its current price, the WH-1000XM4 remains a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sony+wh-1000xm4+review&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS924US924&amp;oq=sony+wh-1000xm4+review&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i20i263i512j0i512l5j69i61.4493j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very well-reviewed</a>, capable set of noise-canceling headphones that we couldn't fault you for picking up instead of the newer WH-1000XM5.</p>
<p>Apple's AirPods Max are our favorite noise-canceling headphones, though. And if you're comfortable buying refurbished, they're currently on discount for <a href="https://fave.co/3fzUogG" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>$355</strong></a> (<del>$475</del>) from Woot, shaving off a couple of hundred dollars from the MSRP. Woot's website states that these headphones have no visual scratches or blemishes and come with a 90-day warranty from Woot.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895592#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895592&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today, <i>FTL: Faster than Light</i> is recognized as one of the most influential games in the indie sector. Alongside <i>The Binding of Isaac</i> and <i>Spelunky</i>, it was part of a holy trinity of games that popularized the roguelite genre in the early '10s.</p>
<p>But before it was a hit, <i>FTL </i>was just a humble idea shared by Matthew Davis and Justin Ma, two developers working at 2K’s Shanghai office. The studio wasn’t a bad place to work, by their accounts, but they just weren’t making the kinds of games they were interested in. So Davis and Ma departed the big-budget firm and started a hobby project to keep them busy while they were looking for new jobs.</p>
<p>“The original intention, at least from my perspective, was that [<i>FTL</i>] was only intended as a hobby project or a prototype,” Davis tells Ars. “It was something in between jobs to build up a resume that we could use to get a job at a studio working on projects that we were more excited about. But we stumbled into something that became a lot bigger than what we set out to do.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895421#p3">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895421&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s been 25 years since a small studio in Dallas recast the ancient world through the prism of a real-time strategy game. <em>Age of Empires</em> has echoed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RouQqawdB-0&amp;ab_channel=Moorhuhn19">Monk wololos</a> about our homes ever since: Parents believed that their kids were learning history; kids believed that they were gaming surreptitiously. And veteran players know that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/age-of-empires-iv/">both were right</a>.</p>
<p>Yet <em>Age of Empires</em> did not always receive the love it does today. The rise of the Xbox saw PC gaming take a back seat for Microsoft: Communities like <em>AoE</em>’s were left to fend for themselves. In a very real way, it was the passion of these obsessives that led to Microsoft's renewed attention and the release of the franchise's <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/age-of-empires-iv-4/">latest entry</a>, 2021’s <em>Age of Empires IV</em>.</p>

<p>Ever since French physicist Pierre Auger proposed <a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.11.288">in 1939</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray">cosmic rays</a> must carry incredible amounts of energy, scientists have puzzled over what could be producing these powerful clusters of protons and neutrons raining down onto Earth's atmosphere. One possible means for identifying such sources is to backtrack the paths that high-energy cosmic neutrinos traveled on their way to Earth, since they are created by cosmic rays colliding with matter or radiation, producing particles that then decay into neutrinos and gamma rays.</p>
<p>Scientists with the <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/science/icecube" data-uri="d256c7e86f20de45faa85fe5a6bbdf79">IceCube</a> neutrino observatory at the South Pole have now analyzed a decade's worth of such neutrino detections and discovered evidence that an active galaxy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_77">Messier 77</a> (aka the Squid Galaxy) is a strong candidate for one such high-energy neutrino emitter, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg3395">new paper</a> published in the journal Science. It brings astrophysicists one step closer to resolving the mystery of the origin of high-energy cosmic rays.</p>
<p>"This observation marks the dawn of being able to really do neutrino astronomy," IceCube member Janet Conrad of MIT <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v15/171">told APS Physics</a>. "We've struggled for so long to see potential cosmic neutrino sources at very high significance and now we've seen one. We've broken a barrier."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1894039#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1894039&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>This week, an Italian artist and programmer named Giacomo Miceli debuted <a href="https://infiniteconversation.com/">The Infinite Conversation</a> website, an AI-powered nonstop chat between artificial versions of German director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Herzog">Werner Herzog</a> and Slovenian philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek">Slavoj Žižek</a>, complete with realistic voices.</p>

<p>Upon visiting the site—which is unaffiliated with either person—you'll see AI-generated charcoal portraits of the two men in profile. Between them, a transcript of AI-generated text is highlighted in yellow as AI-generated voices simulating those of Herzog or Žižek read through it. The conversation goes back and forth between them, complete with distinct accents, and you can skip between each segment by clicking the arrows beneath the portraits.</p>
<p>Its creator positions the site as social commentary on audio <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/bruce-willis-sells-deepfake-rights-to-his-likeness-for-commercial-use/">deepfakes</a> and upcoming technologies that may undermine trust in media in the near future. "This project aims to raise awareness about the ease of using tools for synthesizing a real voice," Miceli writes on the site. "Right now, any motivated fool can do this with a laptop in their bedroom."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895474#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895474&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>HBO surprised its subscribers and the TV industry on Friday by announcing that it has canceled the big-budget science-fiction series <em>Westworld</em> just a few months after its fourth season concluded, <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/westworld-canceled-hbo-1235328276/">Variety</a> reports.</p>
<p>The series, which has received 54 Emmy nominations during its run, was intended to end with its fifth season, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/10/westworld-jonathan-fifth-and-final-season-jonathan-nolan-addresses-nycc-1235139135/">recent statements</a> from its two showrunners, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. The husband-and-wife creative couple had a specific ending in mind that now won't make it to the screen, though many viewers felt that the ending of the fourth season also worked as a conclusion.</p>
<p>Several reasons contributed to HBO's decision, including high production costs, declining viewership, and sliding critical response amid an overall effort to cut costs at the newly formed parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. <em>Westworld</em> set records when it first premiered, but its viewership declined with each season, with the recently aired season four experiencing an especially sharp drop.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895497#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895497&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The new bivalent COVID-19 booster spurred neutralizing antibody levels that were fourfold higher against the omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5 in older adults than those seen after the original booster, <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-updated-clinical-data-omicron">Pfizer reported Friday</a>.</p>
<p>The new data may help calm concerns about whether the updated booster is an improvement over the previous booster. But the fall booster campaign—aimed at preventing another devastating winter wave—still faces considerable challenges. For one thing, a shockingly low number of Americans are rolling up their sleeves to get the shot.</p>
<h2>Better boost</h2>
<p>Experts all agree that the new booster shot, like the old one, will revive waning immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and provide strong protection from severe COVID-19. But some experts have expressed skepticism about whether the updated bivalent booster—which in part targets omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5—will offer a clinically meaningful advantage over the previous booster in preventing mild infections against the subvariant.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895502#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895502&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Update, 7:35 pm ET: </strong>Intel told Ars Technica that it is possible for both Intel and AMD-based platforms to update Arc GPU firmware, and that Intel's Management Engine wasn't actually required for firmware updates.</p>
<p>"Intel Arc products do not require the host CSME to update Arc firmware," an Intel spokesperson told Ars. "Firmware updates will work on both AMD and Intel platforms. Arc products have their own Graphics Security Control for firmware updates and leverage existing Intel technology like the HECI interface protocol to implement the firmware update flow."</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hughsient/status/1588650112045428738">A follow-up from Richard Hughes</a>, the developer who originally discovered the limitation, said that another user had told him that an "HECI-using GSC device shows up in Windows" when an Arc GPU is installed, which ought to allow updates on x86 devices. We confirmed this ourselves on a Windows PC with an Arc GPU installed and saw Intel's GSC firmware interface listed in the device manager, which ought to work the same way on both Intel and AMD platforms since it's a part of the GPU itself. (How and whether it will work in x86 Linux is something we can't confirm at this point.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895391#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895391&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Elon Musk’s strategy to make Twitter profitable as quickly as possible seems to be to turn Twitter into everything the platform is not, seemingly ignoring much of what made the platform profitable in the first place.</p>
<p>Instead of creating the town square where important public discourse is freely debated (which Musk claimed was his Twitter vision), he’s now making moves to potentially skew discussions by ranking unauthenticated accounts with freshly granted blue checks above others in feeds, not because they're users who have more informed or more popular points of view, but because they are just about anyone who paid $8 that month. His other big ideas to drive profits reportedly include charges to direct-message celebrity users and charges to see OnlyFans-like videos posted by paid, verified users. In weighing these ideas, Musk is seemingly ready to charge fees wherever he can and unafraid to throw up paywalls between users and the content that arguably initially drew them to Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/technology/elon-musk-twitter-money-finances.html">According to The New York Times</a>’ interviews with two people familiar with the matter and reviews of internal documents, Musk and his advisers have discussed all these strategies to monetize Twitter and dig the platform out of debt.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895335#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895335&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Cherry, the original mechanical switch maker, is continuing to tap the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/the-ars-technica-guide-to-mechanical-keyboards/">mechanical keyboard</a> community for new product ideas. Its new mechanical switch, the <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-special/mx-black-clear-top.html">Cherry MX Black Clear-Top</a>, is a nod to enthusiasts who would love to turn in their modern-day clacker for an old-school terminal keyboard with extra-smooth typing.</p>
<h2>’80s roots</h2>
<p>Before Cherry's Thursday announcement of plans to release the MX Black Clear-Top, the switch was known to hobbyists as the Nixie switch. Cherry made the switch in the 1980s for German office machine-maker Nixdorf Computer AG. The German switch maker was tasked with creating a version of its linear <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-original/mx-black.html">MX Black</a> switch with "milky" upper housing, a 63.5 g actuation force rather than 60 g, and "the relatively rare solution at the time of having a diode integrated into the switch for n-key rollover," Cherry's announcement explained.</p>
<p>The linear switch ended up being used primarily in Nixdorf's CT06-CT07/2 M Softkeys keyboards targeted at terminals, servers, and minicomputers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895257#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895257&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In late October, a Swedish software engineer named Linus Åkesson unveiled a playable accordion—called "<a href="https://linusakesson.net/commodordion/index.ph">The Commodordion</a>"—he crafted out of two vintage <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/three-decades-of-the-commodore-64/">Commodore 64</a> computers connected with a bellows made of floppy disks taped together. A demo of the hack debuted in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBCYvoC4muc&amp;t=3s">11-minute YouTube video</a> where Åkesson plays a Scott Joplin ragtime song and details the instrument's creation.</p>

<p>Åkesson—a versatile musician himself—can actually play the Commodordion in real time like a real accordion. He plays a melody with his right hand on one C64 keyboard and controls the chord of a rhythm and bass line loop (that he can pre-record using the flip of a switch) using his left hand on the other keyboard.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper" style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EBCYvoC4muc?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">The Commodordion. </p></div>
<p>A fair amount of custom software engineering and hardware hackery went into making the Commodordion possible, as Åkesson <a href="https://linusakesson.net/commodordion/index.php">lays out</a> in a post on his website. It builds off of earlier projects (that he says were intentionally leading up to this one), such as the <a href="https://linusakesson.net/sixtyforgan/index.php">Sixtyforgan</a> (a C64 with spring reverb and a chromatic accordion key layout) and <a href="https://linusakesson.net/software/qwertuoso/index.php">Qwertuoso</a>, a program that allows live playing of the C64's famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6581">SID sound chip</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1894944#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1894944&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Netflix's newest offering, a $7-per-month "Basic with Ads" plan, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/netflix-rolls-out-its-basic-with-ads-plan-in-the-us-and-beyond/">comes with inherent compromises</a>: five minutes of ads per hour, one device at a time, no downloads, 720p resolution, and some unavailable content. But there are also several device compatibility issues, including new devices.</p>
<p>On Netflix's help center page for people encountering the error "Basic with Ads is not supported," Netflix notes that "Basic with Ads isn't supported on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/new-apple-tv-4k-powered-by-a15-chip-adds-dolby-vision-and-hdr10/">Apple TV</a>." "You'll need to upgrade your Netflix plan to the Basic, Standard, or Premium plan," Netflix advises, or else "use a different device." That last bit links to <a href="https://devices.netflix.com/en/">Netflix's list of officially supported devices</a>, which unhelpfully shows an Apple TV logo with no footnotes or other details about its limitations. Netflix <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/11/03/netflix-with-ads-apple-tv/">told 9to5 Mac in a statement</a> that Apple TV support is "coming soon."</p>
<p>The same is true for any Chromecast except the newest model, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/the-new-chromecast-is-official-its-30-runs-google-tv-and-has-a-remote/">Chromecast with Google TV</a>. "Basic with Ads is supported only on Chromecast with Google TV," Netflix states, meaning that any model bought before September 2022—like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/google-merges-chromecast-and-android-tv-with-the-chromecast-with-google-tv/">the 4K version</a> Google sold until then— is out of luck.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895159#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895159&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With Twitter losing $3 million per day, Elon Musk has ordered whatever Twitter staff he has left to start making up the difference by cutting Twitter infrastructure costs by $1.5 to $3 million per day. Musk is hoping to save $1 billion in annual costs in what <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-orders-twitter-cut-infrastructure-costs-by-1-bln-sources-2022-11-03/">Reuters reported</a> has been dubbed Twitter’s “Deep Cuts Plan,” part of Musk’s ongoing scramble to turn Twitter profits around, seemingly even if it risks platform outages during high-traffic times.</p>
<p>Twitter is not commenting publicly yet on the Deep Cuts Plan, but <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588538640401018880">Musk tweeted</a> Friday morning to express how “extremely messed up” he thinks Twitter’s ad revenue loss is. Many major brands, including Cheerios and Audi, have paused advertising on Twitter, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/cheerios-maker-general-mills-pauses-advertising-twitter-2022-11-03/">Reuters reported</a>. Both brands told Reuters they would continue to evaluate the situation at Twitter before resuming.</p>
<p>“Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation, and we did everything we could to appease the activists,” Musk tweeted. “Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895227#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895227&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Destiny 2</em> developer Bungie says a "notable" number of PS5 owners are still playing the worse-looking PS4 version of the game on their high-end console hardware.</p>
<p>Bungie first offered a free PS5 update for the PS4 version of <em>Destiny 2</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/8/22163607/destiny-2-upgrade-download-ps5-xbox-series-x">in late 2020</a>, shortly after the console's release. To take advantage of that update, though, PS5 owners need to go through a few steps to find and manually download the PS5-specific files, as outlined in <a href="https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360054874091-PlayStation-5-Enhanced-Patch">a Bungie support page</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/upgrade-ps4-game-to-ps5-version/">a PlayStation Support page</a>.</p>
<p>Without that download, the PS5 simply plays the PS4 version of the game in the system's backward-compatibility mode. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-destiny-2-ps5-xbox-series-a-huge-performance-boost">Digital Foundry's write-up</a> goes into detail on the "true 4K resolution" and 60 to 120 fps gameplay offered by the upgraded PS5 version of the game. Bungie's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/explore/detail/news/51901">latest "This Week at Bungie" update</a> also explicitly notes that players on the PS4 version are missing out on improvements in frame rates and graphics.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895218#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895218&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Some staff <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-start-layoffs-friday-morning-internal-email-2022-11-04/">told Reuters</a> that hundreds of employees who got this news yesterday immediately logged into Slack to say goodbyes before access was removed.

<p>Space tourism company Virgin Galactic released its <a href="https://s29.q4cdn.com/417755062/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2022/q3/SPCE-3Q22-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf">third-quarter financial results</a> on Thursday. As one might imagine of a spaceflight company that has not flown since June 2021, the financials are pretty disastrous. The company reported revenue of less than $1 million against losses of more than $146 million.</p>
<p>After a long period of downtime, Virgin Galactic officials said the company is close to completing "modifications" of its VMS<em> Eve</em> carrier aircraft and VSS<em> Unity</em> spacecraft. The company expects to complete a glide flight of <em>Unity</em>, which is released from <em>Eve</em> at altitude, in early 2023. After that point, the company will conduct a powered test flight, likely with its own employees on board, before a research flight for the Italian Air Force.</p>

<p>And after that, Virgin Galactic CEO Michael Colglazier said, the company remains on track to begin flying commercial passengers—people who bought their seats, some more than a decade ago—in the second quarter of 2023. As with most schedules in spaceflight, that timeline seems pretty optimistic.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895146#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895146&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas—Five years ago, when ExxonMobil came calling, city officials eagerly <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13FYYsvgvbu7-zMfImnNFYPKs42QZ_72o/view?usp=sharing">signed over</a> a large portion of their water supply so the oil giant could build a $10 billion plant to make plastics out of methane gas.</p>
<p>A year later, they did <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-H5fSJydznLHqHbI0j4U4BS1rYXnQzhS/view?usp=share_link">the same</a> for Steel Dynamics to build a rolled-steel factory.</p>
<p>Never mind that Corpus Christi, a mid-sized city on the semi-arid South Texas coast, had just <a href="https://www.cctexas.com/departments/water-department/mary-rhodes-pipeline-i-ii">raced</a> through its <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oAdL5nyb5G-uOzWZYVqWgqVHcQyQBEOR/view?usp=sharing">50-year water plan</a> 13 years ahead of schedule. Planners believed they had a solution: large-scale seawater desalination.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895162#p3">Read 70 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895162&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 5.16 of the Rocket Report! If you're counting, there are now fewer than 60 days until the end of 2022. How many more US rockets will make their debut before the end of the year? SLS? Terran 1? Super Heavy? RS1? None of the above? You didn't ask, but my over/under would be 1.5 of the above, and that may be a tad optimistic.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

<p><strong>Rocket Lab to attempt booster recovery again</strong>. The US-based rocket company says it will make a second mid-air recovery attempt of an Electron booster during the Friday launch of a Swedish scientific satellite, <a href="https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-to-attempt-booster-recovery-on-upcoming-electron-launch/">Space News reports</a>. This "Catch Me If You Can" mission is scheduled to launch November 4 at 1:15 pm ET (17:15 UTC) from the company’s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. The launch will be Rocket Lab's second attempt to recover the Electron’s first stage, descending under a parachute, using a helicopter.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1894795#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1894795&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A repurposed Type 2 diabetes drug helped teens with obesity lose a significant amount of body weight, lowered their risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and improved their weight-related quality of life over a 68-week clinical trial, researchers <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2208601?query=featured_home">reported</a> this week in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>The drug is semaglutide (brand name Wegovy), which was first approved to treat Type 2 diabetes in 2017 but has since also <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-drug-treatment-chronic-weight-management-first-2014">proven useful for weight loss in adults who are obese or overweight</a>. The drug works by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that targets areas of the brain that regulate appetite and food intake, the Food and Drug Administration explained while approving its use for weight loss in adults.</p>
<p>The new data suggests that it may also substantially help teens struggling with obesity and overweight issues improve their health and outlook as they head into adulthood. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/childhood.html">One in five children and teens</a> in the US has obesity, which can set children up for serious health conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, breathing problems, and joint problems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895135#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895135&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Musicians and music aficionados alike have long savored the rich sound quality of the violins created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Stradivari">Antonio Stradivari</a>, particularly at the dawn of the 18th century (the so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Stradivarius_instruments#Golden_period:_1700%E2%80%931725">golden period</a>"). Scientists have been equally fascinated by why Stradivari violins seem to sound so much better than modern instruments; it has been an active area of research for decades.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c02965">recent paper</a> published in the journal Analytical Chemistry reported that nanoscale imaging of two such instruments revealed a protein-based layer at the interface of the wood and the varnish, which may influence the wood's natural resonance, and hence the resulting sound. Meanwhile, another <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/10.0014600">paper published</a> in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America showed that the better resonance of older violins produces stronger combination tones, which can also affect the perception of musical tones.</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://cocktailpartyphysics.com/stradivaris-sec/" data-uri="48d0482b2df4328b1ba6a7a951ef8364">written extensively about this topic</a> in the past, and you can read a handy summary of some of the research in this area to date <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/study-confirms-superior-sound-of-a-stradivari-is-due-to-the-varnish/">here</a>. Per <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/study-confirms-superior-sound-of-a-stradivari-is-due-to-the-varnish/">my 2021 article</a>, the (perceived) unique sound can't just be due to the instrument's geometry, although Stradivari's geometrical approach gave us the violin's signature shape. One hypothesis is that Stradivari may have used Alpine spruce that grew during a period of uncommonly cold weather, which caused the annual growth rings to be closer together, making the wood abnormally dense. Another popular theory has to do with the varnish: namely, that Stradivari used an ingenious cocktail of honey, egg whites, and gum arabic from sub-Saharan trees—or perhaps salts or other chemicals. </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1894732#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1894732&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
