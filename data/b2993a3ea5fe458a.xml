		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Welcome to The Self Love Fix Podcast. I’m your host, Beatrice -an embodiment coach, teacher, and mentor, and founder of The Self Love Over Codependency Program.

Are you ready to finally step into your worthiness and magnetism? Are you tired of your limiting beliefs and self-doubt affecting every aspect of your life? You deserve to live an abundant life, you deserve to desire and achieve all of your dreams, and most importantly, you deserve to embody unshakable self-confidence.

Believe it or not, I didn’t always embody self-trust. Most of my life, I lived at the mercy of what other people thought of me. It was only during a very low point I experienced during grad school where I asked myself, “Where does your need for perfectionism come from?”

This was a game-changing moment for me. For the first time in my life, I asked myself about the origins of my behavior instead of blaming myself for them. 

From then on, I promised to live out my passion and mission for embodying my true essence and to teach others to do the same.

That’s exactly why I created this podcast. This podcast is all about helping you shift from shame, people-pleasing, codependency, low self-esteem, and self-doubt and into alignment, expansion, and unapologetic self-trust through spirituality and healing the inner-child.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most of us love is (or at least was) an elusive mystery we could only dream of. That’s why today I’m so excited to welcome my guest Crystal Irom, a Love Coach specifically for successful women. As if women didn’t have it hard enough these days, amiright?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is it that especially women who are successful in every other aspect of their lives struggle to find someone to love? Is it because men are intimidated? Are these women (possibly you) doomed to roam the world biding your time in between horrible dates and dead-end relationships?

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today we’re going to talk about something that most people would deny- the fact that we all get jealous. But what if instead of shoving it down in a well of shame, we instead took a moment to process it?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are when you feel jealousy rear its ugly head, it’s not even really about whatever you’re envious of. You probably grew up in a household where you were constantly compared to others: a sibling, a classmate, whoever it might have been. This taught you never to truly see yourself or focus on your own needs, but only to view yourself as you related to others. Your path was defined by theirs, or at least, you thought it should have been.  In this episode we’ll talk more about:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How comparison culture causes jealousy</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What our jealousy might be trying to tell us</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How to embrace our own personal journey</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jealousy isn’t even really about what the other person has or is doing; I’d argue it’s actually a signal that you’re searching for love and acceptance. It’s a warning sign flagging you down that maybe just maybe you’re not on a path that will lead you to the happy life you deserve. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you liked this episode of the podcast, take a screenshot, head on over to my Instagram and share it on your IG stories, and tag me, @theselflovefix.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love what you learned, be sure to hit that follow button so you never miss a future episode, and make sure to leave a review to help me reach more listeners just like you looking to follow their inner truth and live a life of abundance & authentic self-love.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CONNECT WITH BEATRICE:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram:</span> <a href= "http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website:</span> <a href= "http://www.beatricekamau.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.beatricekamau.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are you’ve likely heard about the new trend in parenting- gentle parenting.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today we’re going to talk about burnout; you probably know the feeling. There you are, trucking along in your business when suddenly, seemingly out of the blue, you go from boundless enthusiasm to fatigue and cynicism. How? Why? And what the heck do you do? I’m glad you asked. Burnout is essentially stress, but it’s the stress we feel after we have consistently taken on too much responsibility at work. In the latest episode of the podcast I talk more about:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Warning signs of burnout</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What to look for to suggest you are close to burnout</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Ways to improve your quality of life</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to feel guilty because you want to take a break now and then. Nor do you have to be ashamed to admit that sometimes you need help. Doing it all is a myth, and you’re allowed to do what you need to do in order to feel fulfilled, happy and carefree.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you liked this episode of the podcast, take a screenshot, head on over to my Instagram and share it on your IG stories, and tag me, @theselflovefix.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love what you learned, be sure to hit that follow button so you never miss a future episode, and make sure to leave a review to help me reach more listeners just like you looking to follow their inner truth and live a life of abundance & authentic self-love.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CONNECT WITH BEATRICE:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram:</span> <a href= "http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website:</span> <a href= "http://www.beatricekamau.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.beatricekamau.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPISODE RESOURCES:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Escape the situationship cycle and become available for an actual relationship.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am so excited for this empowering episode!

I’m so glad that their lives have been enhanced by the program, and I can’t wait for you to hear their accounts.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a rundown of the episode:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Ashley M.’s SLOC Journey </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Samantha’s SLOC Journey </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Ashley S.’s SLOC Journey </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From changes in how they perceive themselves to the way they interact with others to changes in their physical beings, SLOC has touched their lives in irreversible ways!

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you ever feel like people don’t value what you have to offer or like things are SO easy for other people but so difficult for you, particularly in regards to your career? Then this is the episode for you. Today, I’m talking about how you can navigate feeling undervalued, unappreciated, and unseen - at work or in your love life. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We frequently take setbacks and assume they mean something about ourselves, but what if a little shift in energy could really change the way that you feel AND how you show up for your work? It’s possible, and I want to help you get there and ensure that you are questioning whether you’re doing things out of obligation or desire.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what I talk about in this episode:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Is It About Obligation or Desire?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Finding the Right Work Environment</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Acting from a Place of Unworthiness</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The Right Relationship Environment </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been in the place of feeling unworthy, lacking confidence, and completely numbing myself to the day-to-day of my job just to tolerate it. I know how demoralizing that is, so it’s important to me that you escape that place if that’s where you find yourself. Tuning into this episode is step one in that process. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you liked this episode of the podcast, take a screenshot, head on over to my Instagram and share it on your IG stories, and tag me, @theselflovefix.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love what you learned, be sure to hit that follow button so you never miss a future episode, and make sure to leave a review to help me reach more listeners just like you looking to follow their inner truth and live a life of abundance & authentic self-love.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CONNECT WITH BEATRICE:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram:</span> <a href= "http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website:</span> <a href= "http://www.beatricekamau.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.beatricekamau.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPISODE RESOURCES:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grab your FREE meditation on self-trust for the inner child:</span> <a href= "http://www.beatricekamau.com/freemeditation"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.beatricekamau.com/freemeditation</span></a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, I want to talk about something that plagues many people, especially in the context of their careers. Anxiousness, self-doubt, and a fear of being seen may come up a lot, and these feelings prevent people from showing up authentically as themselves. I don’t want you to experience this, so I dive fully into the topic on this episode.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many different facets that come into play when you experience self-doubt within your career specifically. You may question your skills and start feeling like an imposter, not knowing how to showcase your soft skills, or may really struggle to show up for yourself authentically as a business owner. Does this sound like something you suffer with</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what I discuss in detail on this episode:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The Deal with Imposter Syndrome</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Showcasing Your Soft Skills</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Experiencing Self-Doubt as a Business Owner</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Intuition vs. Trauma </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really hope that this episode makes it easier for you to tune out your self-doubt and shift into both self-trust and your desires. Once you do that, you’ll be able to show up authentically as you and it will feel so much better - believe me, I’ve been there, too!</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you liked this episode of the podcast, take a screenshot, head on over to my Instagram and share it on your IG stories, and tag me, @theselflovefix.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love what you learned, be sure to hit that follow button so you never miss a future episode, and make sure to leave a review to help me reach more listeners just like you looking to follow their inner truth and live a life of abundance & authentic self-love.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CONNECT WITH BEATRICE:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram:</span> <a href= "http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website:</span> <a href= "http://www.beatricekamau.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.beatricekamau.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPISODE RESOURCES:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grab your FREE meditation on self-trust for the inner child:</span> <a href= "http://www.beatricekamau.com/freemeditation"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.beatricekamau.com/freemeditation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stemming from the episode last week about codependency, this week I wanted to talk about a related topic. Especially for those concerned with codependency, it can be really easy to go to the other side of the spectrum and become hyper-independent. So, that’s what I’m discussing in this episode.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s really important to me that I communicate that it’s okay to lean on your loved ones for support and help. Doing so doesn’t equate to codependency, and I know that sometimes it can be confusing to navigate that. It’s really easy to demonize dependency in general when you’re in this position, but it doesn’t have to be that way.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what I dig into on this episode:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Codependency vs. Interdependence</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Accepting Support from Loved Ones </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s my hope that this episode reframes the way that you look at independence, dependence on others, and how they relate to codependency. Striking the right balance can feel impossible, but I promise you that there’s a nice in-between where you can settle in and get amazing support at the same time.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you liked this episode of the podcast, take a screenshot, head on over to my Instagram and share it on your IG stories, and tag me, @theselflovefix.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love what you learned, be sure to hit that follow button so you never miss a future episode, and make sure to leave a review to help me reach more listeners just like you looking to follow their inner truth and live a life of abundance & authentic self-love.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CONNECT WITH BEATRICE:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram:</span> <a href= "http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website:</span> <a href= "http://www.beatricekamau.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.beatricekamau.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPISODE RESOURCES:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grab your FREE meditation on self-trust for the inner child:</span> <a href= "http://www.beatricekamau.com/freemeditation"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.beatricekamau.com/freemeditation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Codependency is a big topic, but I want to clue you in on something about the topic that people tend not to talk about. That’s what this episode centers around, and once you gain this understanding, there’s no going back! </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a lot to unpack when it comes to codependency, and it completely takes away your ability to make decisions for yourself. The reason I’m ready to uncover this topic and break down the codependency barriers is because I’ve been there! So please know that I feel your pain if you’re currently working through your own struggles with codependency. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s exactly what I discuss in this episode:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What is Codependency?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Is It a Self-Love Issue?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Your Intuition is Always Guiding You</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope that this episode allows you to think about codependency in a new light.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boundaries are one of those concepts that get a lot of air time, but do you actually know how to effectively set them for yourself? That’s the topic of this informative episode! Boundaries can really help you align your relationships to what you want to get out of them. Furthermore, setting healthy boundaries allows you to create better energy in your life rather than being plagued by bad energy.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that you have the power to take ownership over the energy in your life. That’s an exciting prospect, right?  Being proactive rather than reactive and setting those boundaries is the best way to step into that power and to be happier with the energy you surround yourself with. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the topics surrounding boundaries that I bring up in this episode:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Proactivity vs. Reactivity</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Boundaries with Family Members</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Boundaries at Work</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope that this post has given you a blueprint of how to think about instilling boundaries in your own life so that you can begin taking control of the energy you surround yourself with.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of being fully healed is something I’ve heard referenced time and time again, and it’s what I want to talk about on today’s episode. It’s about time the mere notion of being “fully healed” is debunked, and I’m not only doing that today, but I’m also sharing three mini myths around the topic that I want to help you shy away from.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a common misconception that people need to resolve things within themselves and be “perfect enough” to be worthy of love. This is a subconscious thing that people tend to think, so today I’m going to address the mini myths that exist under the larger myth around being fully healed. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the mini myths I discuss:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Mini Myth #1: Going Back to Old Behaviors Cancels Out the Work You’ve Done</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Mini Myth #2: There are Endless Problems We Need to Solve Internally</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Mini Myth #3: You Have to Get Rid of Parts of Yourself in Order to Grow</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s my hope that talking about these will help shift your perspective on this topic, as I want you to stop focusing on being fully healed and start focusing on radical self-acceptance.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you liked this episode of the podcast, take a screenshot, head on over to my Instagram and share it on your IG stories, and tag me, @theselflovefix.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love what you learned, be sure to hit that follow button so you never miss a future episode, and make sure to leave a review to help me reach more listeners just like you looking to follow their inner truth and live a life of abundance & authentic self-love.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CONNECT WITH BEATRICE:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram:</span> <a href= "http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website:</span> <a href= "http://www.beatricekamau.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">http://www.beatricekamau.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPISODE RESOURCES:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grab your FREE meditation on self-trust for the inner child: <a href= "http://www.beatricekamau.com/freemeditation">http://www.beatricekamau.com/freemeditation</a> </span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting ghosted by a man is all too common in today’s world. And I’m going to be honest: when this happens, it hurts. But it doesn’t have to cause an emotional spiral! Because I’ve been there before and I understand the range of emotions you’re feeling, I’m using this episode to talk about how to handle being ghosted.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all have a tendency to psycho-analyze a situation when we’re ghosted and to really attach meaning to why it happened. To make it mean something about us. But that’s not the way to look at the situation, and that certainly won’t help you learn anything!</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the specifics that I cover on this episode:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What to Do When They’re Not Interested</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Examining Your Motivation and Receptiveness </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Being Ghosted Doesn’t Mean Anything About You</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Tips On Communication in Dating</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use this episode to aid you in navigating the emotions that come along with getting ghosted.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something that makes all relationships better is an element of trust.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode of The Self Love Fix Podcast, I’m talking about how jealousy and comparison relate to codependency.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode of The Self Love Fix Podcast, I’m addressing the entire concept behind setting boundaries. This can be a tricky topic when it comes to actually setting them in place. Hopefully with my strategies and tips in this episode, you can start to approach boundary setting with ease. After all, you deserve to make your needs and wants known! </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few points I cover: </span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>The one question to ask the next time you find yourself struggling to set a boundary.</strong></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>What happens when we don’t set boundaries. </strong></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>How to deal with the negative reactions. </strong></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope that hearing more about boundary setting and the importance of it for your own well being and those around you has been valuable. Remember, you deserve to make your needs heard and your boundaries are worth being vocalized. The ones with the negative reactions simply may not know how to set their own boundaries and consequently, don’t know how to handle yours.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you liked this episode of the podcast, take a screenshot, head on over to my Instagram and share it on your IG stories and tag me, @theselflovefix</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love what you learned, be sure to hit that follow button so you never miss a future episode, and make sure to leave a review to help me reach more listeners just like you looking to follow their inner truth and live a life of abundance & authentic self-love.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you pre-enroll for the Self Love Fix Collective membership <a href= "https://beatricekamau.mykajabi.com/theselflovefixcollectivemembership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>!</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CONNECT WITH BEATRICE:</span></p> <p><a href="http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.beatricekamau.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Website</span></a></p>]]></description>
