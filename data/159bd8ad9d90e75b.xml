		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The Partially Examined Life is a podcast by some guys who were at one point set on doing philosophy for a living but then thought better of it. Each episode, we pick a short text and chat about it with some balance between insight and flippancy. You don't have to know any philosophy, or even to have read the text we're talking about to (mostly) follow and (hopefully) enjoy the discussion. For links to the texts we discuss and other info, check out www.partiallyexaminedlife.com.

We also feature episodes from other podcasts by our hosts to round out your partially examined life, including Pretty Much Pop (prettymuchpop.com, covering all media), Nakedly Examined Music (nakedlyexaminedmusic.com, deconstructing songs), Philosophy vs. Improv (philosophyimprov.com, fun with performance skills and philosophical ideas), and (sub)Text (subtextpodcast.com, looking deeply at lit and film).

Nietzsche uses this concept of asceticism to analyze both geniuses and the masses. It is a chief tool of the will to power, highly dangerous to human flourishing but also unleashing many new capabilities beyond our animal nature.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>These notes from 335 BCE are still used in screenwriting classes. Aristotle presents a formula for what will move us, derived from Sophocles's tragedies.</p> <p>What is art?

Yet Block claims that there could be zombies: for example, a functional duplicate of you whose components are actually citizens of China obeying algorithmic rules. Even if the resulting system acts like you, it obviously isn't conscious. Chalmers argues that you'd then need to explain the experiences of a creature half way between you and the zombie, but you can't, so Block's argument doesn't work and functionalism is left standing.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On Darren Aronofsky's philosophical 2017 film about humanity's relationship to nature. We discuss the philosophical content of the film (Gnosticism, anyone?) and explore the relation between meaning and the sensuous aspects of an artwork. Can a work be both allegorical and yet have fully fleshed out characters and the other elements that make a film feel real? This was a very polarizing film; how do the circumstances of viewing affect reception?

They can't be true or false, but they can be "unhappy" if social conventions aren't fulfilled (e.g., you try to marry a pig).

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On <em>Anger and Forgiveness: Resentment, Generosity, Justice</em> (2016). What role should we allow anger to play in our public life? Should systems of punishment be utilitarian, or should they be retributive? Nussbaum thinks that anger necessarily involves the desire for payback, which is unhelpful. We should instead use anger to prevent future harm. Mark, Wes, and Dylan interview Martha and then discuss issues raised in the interview and the book.</p> <p>End song: "Forgive the Disco," a Nussbaum-inspired Mark vocal on an instrumental by <a href="http://www.seanbeeson.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">Sean Beeson</a>, interviewed on <a href= "http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Nakedly Examined Music #23</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Socrates hangs out in the country flirting with his buddy Phaedrus. And what is this "Platonic" love? Using the enticement of desire not to rush toward fulfillment, but to get you all excited about talking philosophy. Socrates critiques a speech by renowned orator Lysias, who claimed that love is bad because it's a form of madness, where people do things they then regret after love fades. Socrates instead delivers a myth that shows the spiritual benefits of loving and being loved.

Lacan read Edgar Allen Poe's story about a sleuth who outthinks a devious Minister as an illustration of his model of the psyche, and why we persist in self-destructive patterns.

What is the self? Is that the same as the experiencing subject? Lacan says no: while the self (the ego) is an imaginative creation, cemented by language, the subject is something else, something split (at least initially) between consciousness and the unconscious. Lacan mixes this Freudian picture with semiotics--an emphasis on systems of linguistic symbols--using this to both create his picture of the psyche and explain how psychological disorders arise. <a href= "http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/04/03/ep74-lacan-citizen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get the full discussion at partiallyexaminedlife.com.</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On <em>Candide: or, Optimism</em>, the novel by Voltaire (1759). Is life good? Popular Enlightenment philosopher Leibniz argued that it's good by definition. God is perfectly good and all-powerful, so whatever he created must have been as good as it can be; we live in the best of all possible worlds. Voltaire loads this satirical adventure story up with horrific violence to demonstrate that Leibniz's position is just silly. Life is filled with suffering, and human nature is such that even in peace and prosperity, we're basically miserable. Yet we still love life despite this.

We see facts and values as fundamentally different: the things science discovers vs. these weird things that have nothing to do with science. In Aristotle's teleological view, everything comes with built-in goals, so just as a plant will aim grow green and healthy, people have a definite kind of virtue towards which we do and should naturally strive. <a href= "http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/07/05/ep59-macintyre-citizen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get the full discussion at partiallyexaminedlife.com.</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Continuing our discussion of Owen Flanagan's <em>The Bodhisattva's Brain: Buddhism Naturalized</em> (2011). Are the basic tenets of Buddhism compatible with a respect for science? We talk (eventually) about talk about karma, nirvana, emptiness, no-self, and the four noble truths. <a href= "http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/04/06/ep-54-buddhism-citizen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get the full discussion at partiallyexaminedlife.com.</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Discussing <em>The Bodhisattva's Brain: Buddhism Naturalized</em> (2011) with Owen Flanagan. What philosophical insights can we modern folks with our science and naturalism (i.e. inclination against super-natural explanations) glean from Buddhisim? Flanagan says plenty: We can profitably put Buddhist ethics in dialogue with familiar types of virtue ethics. However, we need to be skeptical of any claims to scientific support the superior happiness of Buddhists. <a href= "http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/03/26/ep53-buddhism-flanagan-citizen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get the full discussion at partiallyexaminedlife.com.</a></p>]]></description>

Pirsig thinks that modern rationality, by insisting on the fundamental distinction between objects (matter) and subjects (people), labels value judgments as irrational.
