   <media:description>All the engineering behind the Endeavour Shuttle's 26th and final mission.
🪒 Use code PracticalEngineering to get a precision razor from Henson and 100 blades free: https://bit.ly/3CWiWJP

Endeavour’s 26th mission was a lot slower and a lot shorter than the previous 25, but it was still full of fascinating engineering challenges. This October marks the 10-year anniversary of the nearly 3-day trip, so let’s reminisce on this incredible feat and dive into what it took to get the orbiter safely to its final home.

   <media:description>-An overview of the drama unfolding over the ship channel in Corpus Christi, Texas.
-Preorder my new book before the holiday rush: https://practical.engineering/book

Errata:
At 3:08, the old Harbor Bridge actually does have narrow pedestrian walkways, but they lack connectivity with pedestrian infrastructure on either side of the bridge.
At 3:21, a clarification: The ships can't enter the port empty (because they would have too much air draft). That means they can't be fully loaded in the inner harbor because they are already carrying some weight when they enter.
At 12:40, I meant to say &quot;20% above their capacity&quot;

In July of 2022, the Texas Department of Transportation issued an emergency suspension of work on the half-finished Harbor Bridge project in Corpus Christi, citing serious design flaws that could cause the main span to collapse if construction continues. Since then, they have continued a very public feud with the contractor that is far from resolved. This video explores some of the alleged design flaws and discusses potential next steps on the bridge project.

   <media:description>An overview of cathodic protection, including a rust prevention shootout in my garage.
📺  Get a year of CuriosityStream AND Nebula for just $15/yr! http://www.curiositystream.com/practicalengineering

Making a structure last as long as possible before it needs to be replaced isn’t just good stewardship of resources. It’s a way to keep the public safe and prevent environmental disasters too. Corrosion is one of the number one ways that infrastructure deteriorates over time, so cathodic protection systems are an essential tool for keeping the constructed environment safe and sound.

Errata: At 8:53, the bridge shown in the photo is the Gardner River Bridge, not the Yellowstone River Bridge slated for replacement.

In June of 2022, many tourists and residents of the Yellowstone National Park area found themselves at ground zero of a natural disaster. Torrential rainfall in Wyoming and Montana brought widespread flooding to the streams and rivers that flow through this treasured landscape and beyond. How will the National Park Service Rebuild? Hasty engineering of large infrastructure can be extremely damaging to natural systems like those in Yellowstone, and you don’t want to invest millions of dollars into repairs that might be subject to similar flooding in the future. After all, we build parks (and roads to parks) to get closer to the natural environment and all its wildness, and there’s almost nothing more natural or wild than a flood.

Metals are so necessary and important to modern society that we’ll never escape the problem of corrosion, but the field of corrosion engineering continues to advance so that we can learn more about how to manage it and mitigate its incredible cost.

Errata: Stainless steels have a minimum of 10.5% chromium.

   <media:description>Reservoirs are a solution to the tremendous variability in natural water supply, but what happens when they stop filling up?

People use water at more or less a constant rate and yet, mother nature supplies it in unpredictable sloshes of rain or snow that can change with the seasons and often have considerable dry periods between them. If the sloshes get too far apart, we call it a drought. And at least one study has estimated that the past two decades have been the driest period in more than a thousand years for the southwestern United States, leading to a so-called “mega-drought.” (Source: https://www.npr.org/2022/02/14/1080302434/study-finds-western-megadrought-is-the-worst-in-1-200-years)
