Lyrics: 
Conden iro sa muadniey a fel daden
Veshan daine dyu ir mamen
Al'dhol daes dalae vid daishar
Laada culieb, laada culieb

Denanen al'Manetheren
Ghueth ni al'shar al'Aemon
Soutak ni Manetheren
Laada culieb, laada culieb

Sa dhol sorbe ko'shar
Gaen al'Tarendrelle
Rafane al Caldazar
Ti lendha maral

Inde dhol nolvae
No disain isharane
Dyu rahien al'tarmon'nag
Shar sain duadhe, shar sain duadhe

Denanen al'Manetheren
Ghueth ni al'shar al'Aemon
Soutak ni Manetheren
Laada culieb, laada culieb
-----
English:
We walk the footsteps of our fathers
The trails blazed by our mothers
They bought the land with their blood
Long ago, long ago

Sing of Manetheren
Weep for the blood of Aemon
Cry for Manetheren
Long ago, long ago

In the land where the first blood runs
Across the Tarendrelle
Flew the Red Eagle
Destined to fall

No ground was given
But they were betrayed
By dawn on the last day
The waters were blood

Sing of Manetheren
Weep for the blood of Aemon
Cry for Manetheren
Long ago, long ago
