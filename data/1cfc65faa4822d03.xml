You put all those things together and there could not be a better time to accelerate in healthcare.”  He explains how the use of digital twins, and being able to be predictive sooner, can help.</description>

      <description>In clinical settings, we often suppress our emotions, ignoring what is now considered a valuable professional dataset – yet harnessing the power of our emotional life helps improve so many aspects of our work from job satisfaction to patient outcomes. It’s only a matter of time until the industry pivots away from this seemingly learned habit. Dr. Marc Brackett, Director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and author of 'Permission to Feel,' explains how to tap into the crucial ability to use our emotions wisely.  And the very real price we pay when we don’t.</description>

      <description>According to Dr. Bruce Culleton, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Kidney Care at CVS Health, 93% of Americans who have kidney disease don't know they have it. And he tells Daniel some of the ways physicians and nurses can address this health literacy issue. Dr. Culleton also explains some of the health equity and disparity challenges that exist in this space. For instance, African Americans are three-to-four times more likely to develop kidney failure than white Americans.</description>

      <description>There might not be a specific moment when we can hit the reset button and start to tackle systemic healthcare challenges with a clean slate, but smaller resets are already underway. Join us as we examine what a COVID-19 Reset looks like for doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals.

In this episode, we spoke with Dr. Rushika Fernandopulle, founder and CEO of Iora Health, about how physicians have addressed the pandemic in their own practices and the changing perceptions around value based care. We also spoke to Dr. Dan Knecht and Angie Meoli, for insight into how CVS is changing its own systems.

One of the most eye-opening impacts of COVID-19 has been the dramatic disparities highlighted in our healthcare system. Dr. Dela Taghipour and Dr. Nadia Abuelezam will discuss how we can collectively reimagine community healthcare to address those disparities.</description>
