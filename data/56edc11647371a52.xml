      <title>112: Dirty Coms</title>
      <link>https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/112</link>
      <description>This episode we talk with a guy named “Drew” who gives us a rare peek into what some of the young hackers are up to today. From listening to Drew, we can see that times are changing for the motive behind hacking. In the ’90s and ’00s it was done for fun and curiosity. In the ’10s Anonymous showed us what Hacktivism is. And now, in the ’20s, the young hackers seem to be profit driven.

And now, in the ’20s, the young hackers seem to be profit driven.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Sponsors</p><p><br></p><p>Support for this show comes from Linode.

      <title>106: @Tennessee</title>
      <link>https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/106</link>
      <description>How much online abuse are you willing to take before you decide to let your abuser have what they want? Unfortunately, this is a decision that many people have to ask themselves. If someone can threaten you physically, it bypasses whatever digital security you have in place.

      <title>92: The Pirate Bay</title>
      <link>https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/92</link>
      <description>The Pirate Bay is a website, a search engine, which has an index of torrent files. A lot of copyrighted material is listed on the site, but the site doesn’t store any of the copyrighted material. It just points the user to where you can download it from. So for a while The Pirate Bay has been the largest places you can find pirated movies, music, games, and apps. But this site first came up 2003. And is still up and operation now, 18 years later! You would think someone would shut this place down by now. How does the biggest source for copyrighted material stay up and online for that long? Listen to this episode to find out.

      <title>82: Master of Pwn</title>
      <link>https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/82</link>
      <description>The Zero Day Initiative runs a hacker contest called Pwn2Own. The contest calls the best hackers in the world to demonstrate they can hack into software that should be secure. Like browsers, phones, and even cars. A lot of vulnerabilities are discovered from this event which means vendors must fix them. Whoever can demonstrate the most vulnerabilities will be crowned the “Master of Pwn”.
Thanks to Dustin Childs and Brian Gorenc from ZDI to hear all about Pwn2Own.
Thanks to Radek and Pedro for sharing their experiences of becoming the Masters of Pwn.

      <title>77: Olympic Destroyer</title>
      <link>https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/77</link>
      <description>In February 2018, during the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang South Korea, a cyber attack struck, wiping out a lot of the Olympic’s digital infrastructure. Teams rushed to get things back up, but it was bad. Malware had repeatedly wiped the domain controllers rendering a lot of the network unusable. Who would do such a thing?
We will talk with Andy Greenberg to discuss Olympic Destroyer, a chapter from his book Sandworm (affiliate link).

      <link>https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/74</link>
      <description>Poker is a competitive game. Unlike other casino games, poker is player vs player. Criminal hackers have understood this for a while and sometimes hack the other players to get an edge. And that small edge can result in millions of dollars in winnings.
This episode contains a story from Mikko Hypponen of F-Secure. We also interview Mikko to know more about him and the history of malware.

      <title>69: Human Hacker</title>
      <link>https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/69</link>
      <description>We all know that computers and networks are vulnerable to hacking and malicious actors, but what about us, the humans who interface with these devices? Con games, scams, and strategic deception are far older than computers, and in the modern era, these techniques can make humans the weakest link in even the most secure system. This episode, security consultant and master social engineer, Christopher Hadnagy, joins us to share his stories and wisdom. He describes what it was like to be a social engineer before the world knew what social engineering was and tells some of his amazing stories from his long career in penetration testing.

      <title>68: Triton</title>
      <link>https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/68</link>
      <description>A mysterious mechanical failure one fateful night in a Saudi Arabian chemical plant leads a cast of operational technology researchers down a strange path towards an uncommon, but grave, threat. In this episode, we hear how these researchers discovered this threat and tried to identify who was responsible for the malware behind it. We also consider how this kind of attack may pose a threat to human life wherever there are manufacturing or public infrastructure facilities around the world.

      <itunes:summary>A mysterious mechanical failure one fateful night in a Saudi Arabian chemical plant leads a cast of operational technology researchers down a strange path towards an uncommon, but grave, threat. In this episode, we hear how these researchers discovered this threat and tried to identify who was responsible for the malware behind it. We also consider how this kind of attack may pose a threat to human life wherever there are manufacturing or public infrastructure facilities around the world.

      <title>62: Cam</title>
      <link>https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/62</link>
      <description>Cam’s story is both a cautionary tale and inspirational at the same time. He’s been both an attacker and defender. And not the legal kind of attacker. He has caused half a million dollars in damages with his attacks. Attacks that arose from a feeling of seeing injustices in the world. Listen to his story.

      <link>https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/51</link>

For the last 70 years Pakistan and India have fought over this region of the world, both wanting to take control of it. Tensions sometimes heat up which can result in people being killed. When tensions get high in the real world, some people take to the internet and hack their rivals as a form of protest. In this episode we’ll explore some of the hacking that goes on between India and Pakistan.

      <title>Ep 38: Dark Caracal</title>
      <description>A journalist wrote articles critical of the Kazakhstan government. The government did not like this and attempted to silence her. But they may have done more than just silence her. Perhaps they tried to spy on her too. The EFF investigated this case and went down a very interesting rabbit hole.
Thanks to Cooper Q from EFF's new Threat Lab. Also big thanks to Eva from EFF, Andrew Blaich and Michael Flossman from Lookout.
For another story about the EFF listen to episode 12 "Crypto Wars".

      <itunes:summary>A journalist wrote articles critical of the Kazakhstan government. The government did not like this and attempted to silence her. But they may have done more than just silence her. Perhaps they tried to spy on her too. The EFF investigated this case and went down a very interesting rabbit hole.
Thanks to Cooper Q from EFF's new Threat Lab. Also big thanks to Eva from EFF, Andrew Blaich and Michael Flossman from Lookout.
For another story about the EFF listen to episode 12 "Crypto Wars".

      <description>ATM hacking. Hollywood has been fantasizing about this since the 1980's. But is this a thing now? A security researcher named Barnaby Jack investigated ATMs and found them to be vulnerable. Once he published his data the ATM hacking scene rose in popularity and is is a very serious business today.
One of the first big ATM robberies was done with the malware called Carbanak. Jornt v.d. Wiel joins us to discuss what this malware is.

      <title>Ep 19: Operation Aurora</title>
      <description>In 2009, around Christmas time, something terrible was lurking in the network at Google. Google is the most popular website on the Internet. It’s so popular many people just think Google is the Internet. Google hires many of the most talented minds and has been online since the 90s. Hacking into Google is no easy task. There’s a team of security engineers who test and check all the configurations on the site before they go live. And Google has teams of security analysts and technicians watching the network 24/7 for attacks, intrusions, and suspicious activity. Security plays a very vital role at Google, and everything has to have the best protections. But this attack slipped past all that. Hackers had found their way into the network. They compromised numerous systems, burrowed their way into Google’s servers, and were trying to get to data they shouldn’t be allowed to have. Google detected this activity. And realized pretty quickly they were dealing with an attack more sophisticated than anything they’ve ever seen.
