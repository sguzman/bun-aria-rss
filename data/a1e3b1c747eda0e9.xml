Along the way, we note the accelerating pace of decades, revisit Marshall McLuhan’s 1967 mass-media glow-up, log a veritable dictionary of neologisms, consider whether the art market as we know is a historically bound concept, and ask if we’ve possibly reached the end of clear-cut, market-ready “generations.” Also: mid-ification, zentrism, eNFT portals, and adult drainers.

      <itunes:summary>NM speaks with Kevin Driscoll, author of The Modem World: A Pre-history of Social Media (Yale Univ. Press, 2022), which examines the physical — and social — technology that underpinned the DIY side of networked technology’s evolution in the ‘80s and ‘90s.

Parallel to institutional network culture were the proto-dark-forest communities of BBS networks and other pre-www systems. From FidoNet to De Digitale Stad (DDS) Netherlands, Kevin maps out this early territory, with a brief history of the French Minitel system along the way.

Through his work, Kevin asks us to consider what it really means to be “autonomous” online and what alternate conceptions of “the internet” might be possible when we consider the broader origin story of the digital social sphere.

      <itunes:summary>Writer and researcher Sam Moore speaks about his new book, with Alex Roberts, THE RISE of ECOFASCISM: CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE FAR RIGHT (Polity, 2022), which finds, in the dissolution of pre-millennial frameworks for climate, capital, and governance, conditions that are ripe for the re-emergence of fascist formulations of power.

We talk to Sam about the interface between humans and the natural world; the return of trad values; and strategies for climate change mitigation that short-circuit the instrumentalization of nature as a tool for capitalist expansion and/or a race-based ordering of the world.

      <itunes:summary>Over the past year, speculation has surged beyond business media to emerge as a broad-spectrum cultural theme — think Gamestop, Robinhood, tokenized communities, the rise of NFT art. Reflecting on this phenomenon, NM speaks with the gonzo art world/ art market reporter behind @jerrygogosian, artist HILDE LYNN HELPHENSTEIN as well as MATTHEW CAPASSO, formerly of Christies and now director of Fairchain, a company working to secure artists’ rights to secondary sale residuals. On this ep, Hilde and Matthew pull back the veil on 2021’s art market mechanics, from the clout battles of WhatsApp collector circles to the newly NFT-centric OG auction houses. Along the way, we discuss the what and why of art valuation today; new models for gallery/artist relations, the new “now” vs “contemporary” split; and the vicissitudes of love, lust, taste, and power that propel life in this realm.

      <description>Over the past year, speculation has surged beyond business media to emerge as a broad-spectrum cultural theme — think Gamestop, Robinhood, tokenized communities, the rise of NFT art. Reflecting on this phenomenon, NM speaks with the gonzo art world/ art market reporter behind @jerrygogosian, artist HILDE LYNN HELPHENSTEIN as well as MATTHEW CAPASSO, formerly of Christies and now director of Fairchain, a company working to secure artists’ rights to secondary sale residuals. On this ep, Hilde and Matthew pull back the veil on 2021’s art market mechanics, from the clout battles of WhatsApp collector circles to the newly NFT-centric OG auction houses. Along the way, we discuss the what and why of art valuation today; new models for gallery/artist relations, the new “now” vs “contemporary” split; and the vicissitudes of love, lust, taste, and power that propel life in this realm.

A New York based artist, Josh also has a podcast, a Twitch stream, and a Discord community (Josh’s Super Secret Sleeper Cell). He’s been a guest on the New Models podcast twice and joined us last year for a public lecture on Gen-Z’s political identity formation online.

We’re sharing this conversation to let you see behind the scenes of how we are thinking about our respective platforms — and the ecosystem we hope to seed in the coming months.

Relatedly, the conversation comes out of discussions we’ve had with Seth Stolbun, who, this month, is soft-launching STOLBUN.INSTITUTE, a new project from the Stolbun Collection aimed at coordinating cultural content across outlets in the face of an increasingly atomized media landscape.

      <itunes:summary>Nearly a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, RICHARD BECK, author of &quot;We Believe the Children: a Moral Panic in the 1980s &quot;(Public Affairs, 2015) and a senior writer at N+1, spoke to New Models about social contagion—from the wild, child abuse allegations of Q and the satanic panics of recent history to the witch trials and blood libels of times before. Deepening the conversation is Richard’s current work on the War on Terror and its remaking of the American worldview.

      <itunes:summary>We speak with ARTHUR JONES &amp; GIORGIO ANGELINI, filmmakers of &quot;FEELS GOOD MAN,&quot; which tells the story of comic artist Matt Furie and the wild journey of his character Pepe the Frog. Yet this set up is also a lens for telling an even broader and deeper story of the past two decades: one that spans intergenerational communication, magic and media, anti-authoritarian rebellion, and the volatility of signs. The documentary comes out August 28 to select audiences (and Sept. 4 everywhere). We nominate it Political Film of the Year.

      <itunes:summary>We are joined by UC Davis professor of literature and critical theory, JOSHUA CLOVER, who is also a communist and the author of several books including RIOT STRIKE RIOT: THE NEW ERA OF UPRISINGS (Verso, 2016). 

This conversation begins with the street protests that have erupted across the US in response to the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and so many other black Americans at the hands of the police. It then expands to encompass digital platforms, definitions of violence and property, the promise of communes, and the caveats of UBI, giving a trans-historical view of revolutionary resistance at the hinge points of political transformation.

Clarification: At 21:55, Clover refers to the Civil Rights Act (re the 1968 MLK Jr. riots). This is technically accurate, and it was officially known as the Civil Rights Act of 1968. But that risks confusing it with the far more well-known Civil Rights Act of 1964, which is why the 1968 act is more popularly know as the Fair Housing Act.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>When Spotify was founded in 2006, it aimed to solve the problem of online music distribution, remunerating artists for plays. 13 years on, it is a massive data node  that is having a profound effect on how artists and audiences connect. In this cast, New Models speaks with music journalist Liz Pelly, who has written extensively on Spotify, particularly its impact on independent music. She talks to us, here, about Spotify's structure, how it nudges artists to optimize their acts through metrics, and what it understands &quot;music&quot; (let alone &quot;independent&quot;) culture to be. Liz also gives an update on community organizing in NYC's IRL music/nightlife sphere. For more, check: http://lizpelly.com/</itunes:summary>

      <description>When Spotify was founded in 2006, it aimed to solve the problem of online music distribution, remunerating artists for plays. 13 years on, it is a massive data node  that is having a profound effect on how artists and audiences connect. In this cast, New Models speaks with music journalist Liz Pelly, who has written extensively on Spotify, particularly its impact on independent music. She talks to us, here, about Spotify's structure, how it nudges artists to optimize their acts through metrics, and what it understands &quot;music&quot; (let alone &quot;independent&quot;) culture to be. Liz also gives an update on community organizing in NYC's IRL music/nightlife sphere. For more, check: http://lizpelly.com/</description>
