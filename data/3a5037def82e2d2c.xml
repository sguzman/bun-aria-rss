https://youtube.com/c/FuseSchoolUkraine


Hi! We are the FuseSchool Team, who work alongside talented teachers, translators, designers and volunteers from Ukraine, South Africa and Europe.
FuseSchool has more than 800 educational videos on Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics, but they are in English.

We want to support Ukrainians and help students in their war damaged studies, so we decided to translate our videos to Ukrainian. It‚Äôs BIG TASK AND WE HAVE USED  AI  TECHNOLOGY to translate our videos. Sometimes AI technology is pretty stubborn, and refuse to say certain words the right way and sounds just like a robot, still it makes surprisingly correct emphasis on words, problematic for some Ukrainian native speakers. 

WE HOPE TO SERVE THE UKRAINIAN STUDENTS ALL OVER THER WORLD BY HELPING THEM EDUCATIONALLY DURING THIS TIME. 

There must be more and more Ukrainian content! The world stands with Ukraine</media:description>

   <media:description>Feedback by students and their teacher in a UK school about using our OER videos in the flipped classroom model. Hear for yourself what they have to say!

If you are free to test this approach and our free resources at your school, please get in touch via info@fuseschool.org

fuseSchool has the intention of not only revolutionising access to good quality education free for everyone. We feel we also have an opportunity in those countries where access is provided, where good teaching does happen already. In these types of scenarios, we want to give teachers and students the chance to liberate there time in the science classroom - by applying fuseSchool videos in the flipped classroom model. 

Perhaps the experience made with this is best told by the users themselves - hence we recorded a set of interviews with students and teachers, and here you can see the result, in a concise video about the flipped classroom experience with fuseSchool so far.</media:description>

You may never have heard of the electromagnetic spectrum, but you would have heard of many parts of it and use them daily. 

They are all electromagnetic transverse waves that travel at the speed of light. This speed is hard to imagine, but think of it this way: light can travel 8 complete circuits of the earth in one second.

Let's take a quick trip along the spectrum‚Ä¶

   <media:description>Alternating and Direct Current | Electricity | Physics | FuseSchool

In this video we are going to describe what is meant by an alternating and direct current, look at the difference between them and how they can be used.

Remember, an electrical current is the flow of electrons. Watch our video about current here: https://youtu.be/enuNdK426Wo

With direct current or DC, we have a cell or a battery in a circuit. The current in a cell only flows in one direction. So the electrons only flow in one direction around the circuit.

But if instead of a cell or battery we have a mains power supply, it is an alternating current or AC, which means the current constantly changes direction.

   <media:description>Series and Parallel Circuits | Electricity | Physics | FuseSchool

There are two main types of electrical circuit: series and parallel.

In a series circuit the components are connected end-to-end, one after the other.They make a simple loop for the current to flow round.

In a parallel circuit the components are connected side by side, so the current divides, some going one way and the rest the other way.

Watch this video to see the examples.

   <media:description>Medical Imaging | Waves | Physics | FuseSchool

If only we were all given a window so a doctor could look inside us when we were ill.Think of the operations that would save! Luckily there are now many ways we can see what is happening deep inside our bodies by using electromagnetic waves and sound waves.

Let‚Äôs look at example techniques used in medical imaging in this video!

Infra red. X-Rays. Gamma rays. Radio waves. Ultrasound.

   <media:description>Wave Equation | Waves | Physics | FuseSchool

Waves have a frequency (the number of complete waves passing a point every second and measured in Hertz), wavelength (the distance between two consecutive points on a wave) and amplitude - the distance of maximum displacement (both can range from a thousandth of a mm to hundreds of metres).

Which we looked at in this video.
