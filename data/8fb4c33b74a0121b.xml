										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By William H. Frey</p><p>While both political parties have long coveted the women’s vote, for the most part in recent decades, it has helped Democrats. And in Tuesday’s midterm elections, this group will again be closely watched, as it will be especially affected by the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, which effectively allows states to enact restrictive abortion provisions.</p>
<p>The fear among many pro-choice voters, particularly women, is that a Republican-dominated Congress could use this ruling as a premise to enact a nationwide abortion ban. A recent survey by the <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-october-2022/">Kaiser Family Foundation</a> shows that half or more of respondents are more motivated to vote in this year’s midterms because of abortion concerns, especially among women. And according to an <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/2a0eir3enp/econTabReport.pdf">Economist/YouGov poll</a> conducted October 29 through November 1, 60% of women said that views on abortion mattered a lot in their voting, compared to 40% of men.</p>
<p>While polls indicate that <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.aei.org/politics-and-public-opinion/elections-and-demography-a-final-look-at-the-polls/">women are more likely than men to favor Democrats</a> in a national generic ballot for House of Representatives candidates, these do not reflect actual votes. They also do not show how those polling results apply to eligible voters. This analysis looks at both, using the most recent eligible voter populations compiled by the Census Bureau’s <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-basic.html">September 2022 Current Population Survey</a> and applying to them voter turnout rates from the 2018 midterm and assumptions about 2022 voting. Through simulations, it shows how increased women’s turnout and voter preferences could impact national election results and specific battleground states. These simulations make clear that more pronounced turnout and Democratic voting preferences among women would benefit Democrats considerably.</p>
<h2><strong>Women lean toward Democratic candidates, and turn out to vote at higher rates</strong></h2>
<p>In order to assess the role that women have in determining the midterm election results, it is important to view gender differences in both voting preferences and turnout. When examining national numbers, women overall have voted for Democrats over Republicans in every presidential and midterm election since 1982.<a id="_ednref1" href="#_edn1">[i]</a></p>

<p>This is evident in Figure 1, which shows the D-R (Democratic minus Republican) vote margins by gender for national cumulative House of Representatives votes in 2014 and 2018 and for the 2020 presidential election. In each case, the D-R margins are positive for women and negative for men. The 2018 midterm election was a particularly <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.brookings.edu/research/a-vast-majority-of-counties-showed-increased-democratic-support-in-2018-house-election/">strong year for Democrats</a>, with women’s D-R margin far exceeding that for the 2014 midterms, while men’s negative D-R margin was noticeably smaller.</p>
<p>Gender differences also pervade demographic groups. This is evident for the 2020 presidential election as shown in Figure 2, although it was also pervasive in <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://cawp.rutgers.edu/gender-gap-voting-choices-presidential-elections">earlier elections</a>. D-R margins are higher for women than for men in groups where women vote strongly Democratic: Black voters, Latino or Hispanic voters, and voters aged 18 to 29. Even for white, non-college graduate women voters—who favored Republicans—the negative D-R margins are not as large as those of men. Only among Asian American voters were men’s D-R margins higher than women’s.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more important in examining women’s power in the coming election is their continued higher turnout rate. There is a long history of higher turnout levels for women than men, dating back to 1980. While the pattern is more pronounced for presidential elections, <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout">it is also the case</a> for midterm elections. Figure 3 depicts gender differences in turnout for midterm elections from 2006 to 2018 and the 2020 presidential election. The 2018 midterm showed the <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.brookings.edu/research/2018-voter-turnout-rose-dramatically-for-groups-favoring-democrats-census-confirms/">highest turnout in decades</a>, as was the case for the <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.brookings.edu/research/turnout-in-2020-spiked-among-both-democratic-and-republican-voting-groups-new-census-data-shows/">2020 presidential election</a>. In both of these elections, the rise in turnout among women was greater than that of men. Because of this and the fact that women live longer than men, the 2018 election had 8.4 million more female voters than male voters; in the 2020 election, there were 9.7 million more female voters.</p>

<p>In addition to the overall numeric advantage, women have higher turnout rates across most demographic groups. This is noteworthy among Black women—a strong Democratic voting bloc that in 2018 turned out at 55.2%, compared with 46.7% for Black men. Both white women and white men with college degrees turned out at similar high rates: 71.1% and 72.1%, respectively. Among age groups, women show turnout advantages for all except the 65 and older group, even though women make up 55% of all eligible voters among that group.</p>
<p>Overall, women’s numeric vote advantage in most groups coupled with their broad Democratic leanings make any issues that motivate them to vote Democratic—such as abortion—important to monitor in an election.</p>
<h2><strong>The female electorate is changing</strong></h2>
<p>While the size of the female electorate is increasing, its demographic makeup is changing.<strong>   </strong>Figure 5 shows the shifts in women’s eligible voter profile between 2014 and 2022 by race and education. Notably, there are gains in women’s groups that tend to vote Democratic (white college graduates and people of color), and a decline in the group that tends to vote Republican (white non-college graduates). For the first time in a midterm election, the latter group makes up less than two-fifths of the women’s electorate.</p>

<p>Compared to women, male eligible voters have slightly higher shares of white non-college graduates and smaller shares of white college graduates (<a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Table-A.xlsx">downloadable Table A</a>). With respect to age, both female and male eligible voters show older age profiles over time. In 2022, women age 65 and over make up one-quarter of the eligible voter population, while men in that age group make up 22.3%.</p>
<h2><strong>Simulating the 2022 generic congressional ballot</strong></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, recent polls provide some indication of what the midterm election results will be, but they do not take into account the relative size of the voter population, relative turnout rates, and possible last-minute changes in voter preference. This section presents three simulations based on female and male eligible voter populations, turnout rate assumptions, and gender differences in voter preferences based on the polling numbers in the recent <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/2a0eir3enp/econTabReport.pdf">Economist/YouGov poll</a>.</p>
<p>In that poll, 51% of women choose a Democratic candidate for a generic 2022 congressional ballot, 46% choose a Republican candidate, and 3% choose other, are not sure, or will/did not vote. Among men, 45% choose a Democratic candidate, 51% choose a Republican candidate, and 4% choose the other categories.</p>
<p>The simulations below show what would happen if, because of concern about abortion, women’s turnout increased by 10 points and women’s Democratic preference increased by 3 points (converting the residual category to Democratic support).</p>
<p><strong><em>Simulation 1: Assumes 2022 eligible voters by gender, 2018 turnout rates by gender, and 2022 Democratic-Republican congressional preferences by gender</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Democratic vote share: 48.2%</li>
<li>Republican vote share:  48.4%</li>
<li>D-R vote margin: -0.2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Simulation 2: Same as Simulation 1, with women’s turnout increased by 10 points</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Democratic vote share: 48.4%</li>
<li>Republican vote share: 48.1%</li>
<li>D-R vote margin +0.3</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Simulation 3: Same as Simulation 2, with women’s Democratic preference increased by 3 points</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Democratic vote share: 50.1%</li>
<li>Republican vote share: 48.1%</li>
<li>D-R vote margin +2.0</li>
</ul>
<p>The results show that when applied to current female and male eligible voter populations, recent polling would result in a close election outcome with a small Republican advantage. But if the abortion issue motivates greater female turnout and Democratic voting preference, the advantage turns to Democrats.</p>
<h2><strong>Simulating 2022 election results in battleground states</strong></h2>
<p>While the national simulations are instructive, great attention will be paid to battleground states with key Senate and gubernatorial elections. This section continues our analysis with simulations for nine of these battleground states: in the North, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin; in the South, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, and Texas; and in the West, Nevada and Arizona. Each of these has a Senate election except Texas, which has a gubernatorial election.</p>
<p>In place of new polling data, which is not uniformly available for these states, our simulations rely on Democratic and Republican votes by gender from the 2020 presidential election as a baseline (with the exception of Georgia, where votes for the 2020 Senate runoff election were used). These are depicted as women’s and men’s D-R vote margins for each state in Figure 6.</p>

<p>In each state, women overall voted Democratic and men overall voted Republican. Yet the strength of each gender’s support differs, with highest female Democratic support occurring in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Georgia and strongest male Republican support in Texas.</p>
<p>In terms of gender differences in turnout rates, each state also showed higher female voter turnout in the 2018 midterm election, with especially strong gender disparities in Ohio and Georgia (<a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Table-B.xlsx">downloadable Table B</a>). In the former, women turned out at 55.9% while men turned out at 48.9%; in the latter, the respective rates were 58.3% and 53.1%</p>
<p>It is also worth noting the differences in the race and education profiles of each state’s 2022 eligible voter populations (<a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Table-B.xlsx">downloadable Table B</a>). The states with the highest number of Latino or Hispanic eligible voters among both women and men are Texas, Arizona, Nevada, and Florida. Those with the highest number of Black eligible voters are Georgia and North Carolina. Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania have the largest number of white eligible voters. It is notable that in Ohio and Wisconsin, over half of all eligible male and female voters are white non-college graduates. In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, more than 30% of female eligible voters are white college graduates, and in all states, a higher share of men are white non-college graduates than women.</p>
<p>The three state simulations shown in Table 1 follow a similar methodology as used in the national simulations. The base simulation employs 2022 eligible voter populations by gender, to which are applied 2018 turnout rates and Democratic and Republican voter preference—in this case based on the 2020 election. The second simulation assumes that women’s turnout rates are increased by 10 points. The third simulation further assumes that each state’s D-R vote margin for women increases by 5 points.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2017" height="1908" class="aligncenter lazyload wp-image-1646667 size-article-inline" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Bill-Frey-Tables-v2.png?fit=400%2C9999px&amp;quality=1#038;ssl=1" alt="Table" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Bill-Frey-Tables-v2.png?w=768&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Bill-Frey-Tables-v2.png?w=768&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 768w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Bill-Frey-Tables-v2.png?fit=600%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 600w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Bill-Frey-Tables-v2.png?fit=400%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 400w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Bill-Frey-Tables-v2.png?fit=512%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 512w" /></p>
<p>The base simulation shows an overall Democratic win in five of the nine states. The D-R margins are largest in Nevada, Wisconsin, and Georgia, followed by Arizona and Pennsylvania. Four states—North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, and Texas—show Republican wins, with the largest in Texas, at a -6.6 D-R margin.</p>
<p>The second simulation—which assumes increased women’s turnout—increases the D-R margin in all states but only flips one formerly Republican win to a Democratic one (North Carolina). In contrast, the third simulation, which also assumes increased female support for Democrats, flips all of the states except one (Texas) to a Democratic victory.</p>
<p>In short, these simulations demonstrate that when assuming actual eligible voter populations as a base, increased women’s turnout and Democratic voting can move several battleground states from a Republican to Democratic advantage.</p>
<h2><strong>What the women’s vote means for 2022 and the future</strong></h2>
<p>The simulations conducted here make plain that women’s enthusiasm for an issue like abortion can lead to consequential shifts in election outcomes through increases in their voter turnout and support for candidates. This can especially benefit Democrats, given the recent history of women’s support for that party’s candidates in national and congressional elections. Unlike looking at polls alone, simulations such as these show how taking into account the actual eligible voter base and turnout rates can affect election results.</p>
<p>These simulations should not be viewed as predictions, as the actual voting behavior will only be known after Election Day. But they do show how, when translated into voter turnout and voting preferences, an energized voting bloc can impact the final election result. They also show that the women’s vote can have a powerful impact on elections not just in 2022 but also in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Pedro Conceição</p>
<p>New dimensions of uncertainty are emerging. Lives are being unsettled around the world. To turn new uncertainties into opportunities, we must unleash people’s creative and cooperative potential. We must double down on human development. That is the conclusion of the recently launched <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://hdr.undp.org/content/human-development-report-2021-22">2021-22 Human Development Report</a> titled &#8220;Uncertain Times, Unsettled Lives: Shaping Our Future in a Transforming World.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lives are being unsettled in many ways. For the first time ever, the global <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI">human development index</a> (HDI) went in reverse—for two years straight. Nearly nine out of ten countries saw a drop in their HDI values in the 2020-2021 period, far exceeding the declines in the wake of the global financial crisis (Figure 1)—or at any time since the HDI was first released.</p>
<h3><strong>Figure 1. Share of countries with a drop in Human Development Index Value</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/figure-1.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="lazyautosizes aligncenter wp-image-1646620 lazyload" src="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/figure-1.png?w=1000&amp;h=750&amp;crop=1" sizes="1417px" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/figure-1.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1 1000w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/figure-1.png?fit=500%2C375px&amp;ssl=1 500w" alt="figure 1" width="700" height="281" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/figure-1.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/figure-1.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1 1000w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/figure-1.png?fit=500%2C375px&amp;ssl=1 500w" /></a></p>
<p>While most high-income countries were able to recover in 2021, a majority of countries with low and medium HDI values experienced ongoing declines last year.</p>
<p>Data at the individual level tells us that the forces at work are deeper than COVID-19 or shifts in the HDI, which, however powerful an indicator it is, measures only a subset of human development. <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://hdr.undp.org/content/2022-special-report-human-security">UNDP’s 2022 Special Report on Human Security</a> found that more than six in seven people worldwide felt insecure. Feelings of insecurity are on the rise even in countries with the highest levels of HDI. At least a decade in the making, it is a trend that paralleled improvements in the HDI and other conventional measures of wellbeing. Likewise, reported stress levels—the feeling of being overwhelmed by what the world is throwing at us—have been increasing across all education levels.</p>
<p>What is going on? How does the wide-angle lens of human development help us understand and respond to this apparent paradox of progress with insecurity?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://hdr.undp.org/content/human-development-report-2021-22">2021-22 Human Development Report</a> argues that a new “uncertainty complex” is emerging (Figure 2.), never seen before in human history. Uncertainty is not new, but its dimensions today are taking ominous new forms. Constituting it are three volatile and interacting strands:</p>
<ul>
<li>the destabilizing planetary pressures of the Anthropocene (e.g., climate change, biodiversity loss, new diseases like COVID-19), which amplify—and are amplified by—inequalities between those contributing to planetary pressures and those suffering the consequences (see the <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://hdr.undp.org/content/human-development-report-2019">2019 Human Development Report</a> on inequalities and the <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://hdr.undp.org/content/human-development-report-2020">2020 Human Development Report</a> on the Anthropocene);</li>
<li>the pursuit of sweeping societal transformations to ease those pressures while technological innovation is racing ahead; and</li>
<li>widespread and intensifying political polarization among and within countries.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Figure 2. A new uncertainty complex is emerging</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HDR22-fig2.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="lazyautosizes alignnone wp-image-1646616 lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HDR22-fig2.png?fit=500%2C375px&amp;quality=1#038;ssl=1" sizes="1417px" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HDR22-fig2.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1 1000w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HDR22-fig2.png?fit=500%2C375px&amp;ssl=1 500w" alt="fig 2" width="700" height="398" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HDR22-fig2.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HDR22-fig2.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1 1000w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HDR22-fig2.png?fit=500%2C375px&amp;ssl=1 500w" /></a></p>
<p>Together, uncertainty and insecurity are corroding social fabrics. More insecure people tend to trust others less. With insecurity increasing, it is not surprising that globally less than 30 percent of people think that most people can be trusted—the lowest recorded value. More insecure people are also more likely to hold more extreme political views (Figure 3). This can account, partially at least, for the increase in political polarization seen across many countries over the last 10 years (Figure 4).</p>
<h3><strong>Figure 3. Political polarization on the rise</strong></h3>

Even before the war in the Ukraine, <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://hdr.undp.org/content/2022-special-report-human-security">as many as 1.2 billion people</a> were being affected by violent conflicts, about half of which lived outside fragile contexts.</p>
<p>The conjunction of uncertainty and polarization may be paralyzing, delaying action to curb human pressures on the planet. The great frustration of our time may be our inability to act. So, what to do in this context?</p>
<p>We must shift our perspective on uncertainty. The damages wrought by superstorms or drought, from interconnected financial crises and pandemics can be profound, as we all know. They may very well get worse in ways that we cannot now anticipate. But if we only see uncertainty as a threat, then we have already given up the game. We cannot afford to be either fatalistic or glib.</p>
<p>Consider the COVID-19 pandemic in all its deep, impossible contradictions. It opened new reference points for what is possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>technologically, despite unconscionable inequalities in access, revolutionary <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext">vaccines saved more than 20 million lives</a> last year alone and hold promise for preventing and treating many other diseases;</li>
<li>economically, unprecedented monetary interventions and dramatic fiscal expansion, especially in social protection, have dwarfed actions taken during the global financial crisis;</li>
<li>socially, fundamental shifts in behaviors, including voluntary social distancing and self-isolation, are evidence that social norms can change quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is as much a disruptive opportunity as it is a threat. <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/151/2/272/110622/The-Turing-Trap-The-Promise-amp-Peril-of-Human">Its potential for enhancing labor demand is bigger</a> than its potential for automating it. New tasks, new jobs, and new industries are all possible. Recall that most jobs came into being in part through the task-creating effects of new technologies: <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.nber.org/papers/w30389">Around 60 percent of people in the United States are now employed in occupations that did not exist in 1940</a>.</p>
<p>We do not, however, have the luxury to wait around for the long run. The negative displacement impacts of AI are too big, too likely, and too fast, especially if labor-replacing incentives dominate its development. Policies should provide incentives for AI to augment what people can do rather than seek to replace them. That would unlock and frontload its potential for positive transformation.</p>
<p>We thus need to put policies in place that help people feel safe and more in control over their lives. Without this, people will fear the context of novel uncertainty rather than embrace it. In essence, we must strive to weaken the links that run from uncertainty to insecurity.</p>
<h2><strong>How do we do this?</strong></h2>
<p>Policies that focus on the three “I”s—investment, insurance, and innovation—will go a long way:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Investment</em>, ranging from renewable energy to preparedness for pandemics and extreme natural hazards, will ease planetary pressures and pre­pare societies to better cope with global shocks.</li>
<li><em>Insurance</em> helps protect everyone from the contingencies of an uncertain world. The global surge in social protection in the wake of the pandemic did just that, while underscoring how little social insurance coverage there was before and how much more remains to be done. Investments in universal basic services such as health and education also afford an insurance function. Adequately regulated market insurance is also central.</li>
<li><em>Innovation</em> in its many forms—technological, economic, cultural—will be vital in responding to unknown and unknowable challenges. While innovation is a whole-of-society affair, government is crucial: not just in creating incentives for inclusive innovation but also in being an active partner throughout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Social norms must shift too, as the social context is the crucible in which policies are made and implemented. Education can open new perspectives, not just through curricula but also by envisaging schools as spaces of inclusion. Social recognition of everyone is an important mechanism for social change. Media in its many forms plays a big role here.</p>
<p>The issue is not just about recipients of programs or target audiences but also about who is deciding. For example, women’s representation in political bodies shifts policy priorities and expands aspirations for other women and girls. Social movements have important roles as well in advancing human rights and changing social norms and narratives that are important determinants of people’s behavior, from consumption choices to which political leaders are supported.</p>
<p>Together, these amount to expanding human development writ large, going beyond a focus on well-being achievements, as embodied by the HDI, and toward Amartya Sen’s articulations of expanding agency and freedoms. Human development then becomes not just an end but also the means to navigating uncertainty. Where we head from here is up to us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Elaine Kamarck, John Hudak</p><p>As we come to the end of 2022 midterm election cycle, candidates are scrambling to engage in last minute messaging and message changes that can push them over the finish line. In some cases, candidates try to change or at least soften positions which served them well in the primaries in hopes of attracting just enough voters to put them over the top. This was especially so for two hot-button issues that emerged in the Republican primaries—abortion and denying the results of the 2020 election. In other cases, candidates work to ‘flip the script’ on their opponent. Here a candidate seizes on an issue typically used against their party and uses that issue against their opponent. We have seen several examples of this playing out in the 2022 midterms.</p>
<p>During the primaries, Republican candidates almost always included anti-abortion positions on their websites, and once the Supreme Court decided the Dobbs case, some candidates went so far as to adopt a “no exceptions” stance in an effort to woo Republican primary voters. Since then, however, at least more than a dozen—13—have backed off from their earlier abortion statements or had given ambiguous answers once the general election had begun and it became clear that most voters preferred some legal abortions. Candidates, such as the Arizona Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters and North Carolina candidate for Congress Cristian Castelli, <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/30/republican-abortion-positions-midterm-elections-00054128">either changed what their website said or erased the abortion issue from their website altogether</a>.</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, in an interview with the Catholic station ETN, Masters compared abortion to child sacrifice. But lately he said that the Democrats were lying about his abortion stance <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/12/republicans-soften-staunch-anti-abortion-stance">saying</a>— “Look I support a ban on very late-term and partial birth abortion. And most Americans agree with that.”</p>
<p>Of course, after the now-overturned <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>most states barred third-trimester abortions, and current precedent, <em>Dobbs</em>, empowers states to pass even harsher restrictions.</p>
<p>In the post-<em>Dobbs</em> general election, many candidates have been confronted with the medical reality that abortion is sometimes necessary to save the life of the mother. They’ve also been faced with the possibility of pregnancy as a result of rape and/or incest. Not surprisingly, candidates began “clarifying” their primary election positions. The Republican gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota, Scott Jensen, has <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/politics/republicans-shift-abortion-positions-general-election">tried to make it clear</a> that he would support abortion in the case of rape, incest or if the life of the woman is in danger.</p>
<p>In Iowa, Republican House candidate Zach Nunn <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/12/republicans-soften-staunch-anti-abortion-stance">repeats</a> the rape, incest, and life of the mother exceptions and adds “fetal abnormalities” to the list of situations where abortion should be legal. In Colorado, the Republican Senate candidate Joe O’Dea once supported a ballot measure to ban abortion that did not include exceptions for rape or incest. <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/after-roes-demise-democrats-hit-republicans-who-profess-to-back-abortion-rights">He now says</a> that those exceptions are essential and that he “didn’t look at all the nuances.”</p>
<p>To the extent that Republicans are drawn into discussing abortion—they are lashing out at Democrats, <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/us/politics/abortion-republicans.html">accusing them</a>, as Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake of Arizona did, of advocating “abortion right up until birth.”</p>
<p>A similar dynamic is at work among the Republican candidates who ran on a platform denying that Biden was legitimately elected. From what we can tell fewer Republican candidates have backed off their position on the 2020 election than have softened their position on abortion—an indication that Republicans feel the abortion issue could hurt them more. But of those who did, some are running in blue states like Maryland where they need to find some independent and/or Democratic votes to have even a chance. Hence Dan Cox, the Republican nominee for Governor of Maryland <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.foxnews.com/video/6314410746112">recently affirmed</a>, on Fox News, that “Joe Biden is the president of the United States.”</p>
<p>But others in more hotly contested states have disavowed the election deniers’ positions as well. Herschel Walker, the Republican nominee for Senate in Georgia, <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.foxnews.com/video/6314410746112">told the public in a debate</a> “President Biden won, and Senator Warnock won and that’s why I decided to run.”</p>
<p>Beyond softening or changing positions on hot-button issues, another tactic employed by a handful of candidates involves using a potentially vulnerable position against an opponent. For example, in this election cycle, Republicans are slamming Democrats on issues like inflation, immigration, and crime rates/’defund the police’. Democrats are hitting Republicans on issues like abortion, the differences in job creation between President Trump and President Biden, and election denialism. In these midterms, these have become standard, widespread, and entrenched attack lines.</p>
<p>However, not every Democrat or Republican are equally vulnerable to these attacks, and in some cases, candidates are vulnerable to attack on the issues their party generally looks “strong” on. It takes some creative messaging and advertising, but a number of candidates have cut some effective ads that ‘flip the script.’</p>
<p>Take the incumbent Democratic governor of Nevada, Steve Sisolak. In another setting he might have been attacked for crime rates in the state’s most populated county Clark, which houses Las Vegas, and for cuts that happened to some divisions of law enforcement in that county. However, Sisolak’s Republican opponent is the Clark County Sheriff, Joe Lombardo, who serves as the head of law enforcement for Clark County as well as the head of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. As a result, Sisolak has <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=318434987095537">run ads arguing that crime rose under Lombardo’s watch and that he supports ‘defunding the police.’</a> While fact checks have noted that the positions that were eliminated under Lombardo’s watch were civilian and that reductions in officers have come because of difficulties in recruiting, the ad uses a traditional Democratic vulnerability and works to make the Republican vulnerable on the issue.</p>
<p>Those efforts do not stop with Nevada’s gubernatorial race. Democrats have painted their Republican opponents as wanting to defund the police in the New Mexico governor’s race and the Ohio Senate race. Democrats have attacked their GOP rivals on being soft on crime in the Ohio governor’s race and the congressional race for Ohio’s 9<sup>th</sup> district.</p>
<p>In the race for Congress in California’s 39<sup>th</sup> district, incumbent Republican Young Kim’s anti-abortion stance is being used by her Democratic opponent, Asif Mahmood, to <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgWpwHwNqKk">claim she supports government overreach</a>. That argument flips the script, as Republicans usually market themselves as the party that supports individual freedoms and small government.</p>
<p>However, script flipping is not simply the domain of Democrats this cycle. Also, in the race for Congress in OH-09, Republican challenger J.R. Majewski is attacking Democratic incumbent Marcy Kaptur over inflation, which fits nicely into the traditional 2022 Republican attack line. However, Majewski’s framing flips the script, <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=601253908298707">highlighting his own role as a union representative</a> who has negotiated pay raises for union members, suggesting that Kaptur’s record on the economy specifically hurts unions. As the historically, pro-union party, Democrats are typically buffered from such attacks, and Majewski’s effort to cut into Kaptur’s northern Ohio/Toledo union member base is strategic.</p>
<p>Ultimately, many elections are unpredictable affairs, and the 2022 midterms are no different. As candidates scramble for an advantage, changes in messaging can serve as real advantages for some candidates. In other circumstances, message changes can be viewed as insincere politicking (‘flip-flopping’ c. 2004) and can be used as the basis for a political attack by one’s opponent. The 2022 election cycle offers multiple examples of candidates from across the country trying to turn their opponents’ words against them, and next Tuesday, we will have a better idea who among them will be successful.</p>

<p>Algeria is the largest Arab country and the largest country in Africa. It has tilted left ever since its war for independence from France. It is an outspoken opponent of the <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.state.gov/the-abraham-accords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abraham Accords</a> and especially Morocco’s close relations with Israel.

The two states are rivals in the Maghreb, and Algeria <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/87055" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> the Polisario Front independence movement in Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine has been a boost for Algeria, which has large natural gas deposits. The rise in prices for gas in Europe is giving Algeria a windfall.</p>
<p>Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune chaired the summit meetings, as host. Before the summit, Tebboune negotiated a unity meeting between Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen) of the Palestinian Authority and the leadership of Hamas. It is not clear what this will mean in practice.</p>
<p>Egyptian President Abdul Fattah Sisi attended the 39th Arab summit, as did his Tunisian, Iraqi, Somali and Palestinian counterparts. Saudi King Salman, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — known as MBS — did not attend, MBS allegedly for health reasons (an ear infection). Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdallah represented Jordan, a first for the prince. The amir of Dubai was the United Arab Emirates (UAE) representative. The amir of Qatar was there, and the sultan of Oman sent a senior minister. Moroccan King Mohammed VI did not attend. Nor did the king of Bahrain and the amir of Kuwait. Syria was expelled from the Arab League a decade ago.</p>
<p>The turnout of heads of state reflected the Abraham Accords states’ preference to avoid confrontation with Algeria. The UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco declined to face the criticism of the strongly pro-Palestinian Arabist Algerians.</p>
<p>The communiqué reiterated past summit positions: calling for an independent Palestinian state, full membership for the Palestinian Authority in the United Nations, and an international conference to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. Protecting the Muslim sites in Jerusalem is a priority. Vague calls for resolving the conflicts in Syria and Libya were issued, and the summit endorsed the Yemeni council fighting against the Houthis.</p>
<p>The summit took a neutral posture toward the Russia-Ukraine war. Algeria has longstanding close relations with Russia, from whom it purchases most of its arms. No country pressed for a tilt toward Ukraine.</p>
<p>The summit did not take a position on the Abraham Accords, reflecting the divisions between the Arabs. Arab summits help set the parameters for the public debate in the Arab world. The Algiers summit largely reiterated established norms and avoided contentious issues. It did underscore the growing importance of the host nation Algeria.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has engaged with Algiers. The Secretary of State Antony Blinken <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinkens-meeting-with-algerian-president-tebboune/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visited</a> Algeria in March 2022 for a productive exchange. The White House should invite Tebboune for a working visit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Kristin Butcher, Kelsey Moran, Tara Watson</p><p style="font-weight: 400">The U.S. population is aging. By 2034, the U.S. Census Bureau projects that people aged 65 years and older will outnumber those aged 18 years and younger for the first time in U.S. history; by 2050, demographics across the U.S. will mirror those in the oldest areas in Florida today. The vast majority of elderly report that they would prefer to age in place (i.e., live in their own homes as they age) rather than move into institutional settings such as nursing homes. Yet difficulties with mobility, cognition, and self‐ care rise steeply with age.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Demand for home health and personal care aides is projected to grow by 25 percent in the next decade. Currently, immigrants make up a disproportionate number of workers in the health care and household services sectors, particularly in roles that may be crucial complements to aging in place. Our study thus examines whether immigration affects the likelihood that the U.S.-born elderly age in place rather than live in an institutional setting.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Care for the elderly requires a combination of less‐ educated labor, more‐ educated labor, and physical infrastructure. Institutions serve to share the costs of infrastructure, and the care that takes place in institutions tends to be more infrastructure intensive than it is for home‐ based care. A robust supply of less‐ educated workers may lead to a different balance in the delivery of caregiving services—one that is less infrastructure intensive and more likely to be based in a home setting.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Using statistical methods to tease out the causal effect of immigration, we analyze whether U.S.-born elderly living in areas with increased levels of less‐ educated immigrant labor make different decisions about institutionalization. We find that there is a negative relationship between the less‐ educated foreign‐ born labor force share and institutionalization of the U.S.-born elderly. Specifically, our findings suggest that a 10 percentage point increase in the less‐ educated immigrant labor force share is associated with a 1.5 percentage point lower probability (from 5.2 percent) of living in an institution for those aged 65 and older and a 3.8 percentage point lower probability (from 14.8 percent) for those aged 80 and older.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">These effects represent 29 and 26 percent reductions, respectively. These results remain after accounting for the health status of different cohorts, for the possibility that immigrants might move to places with better health care job opportunities, and for the prospect that the elderly move to areas in response to the supply of care services. The findings complement previous research showing that immigrant labor supply affects household decisions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">We next explore a possible mechanism for these findings: the labor market for caregiving and household services. We show that U.S. regions with high levels of immigration have both lower wages and increased employment of health and nursing aides. We see similar impacts for other less‐ educated occupations that may support home‐ based care, such as construction work, housekeeping, and gardening. By contrast, wages increase for workers that require more training, such as registered nurses, and the hours they work decrease. The presence of immigrants appears to change the mix of caregiving services in a way that enables aging in place.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The COVID-19 pandemic shined a light on nursing home staffing and resident outcomes, issues that are likely to continue to be pressing as the nation ages. Our work highlights the important role that immigrants play in the market for elder care. U.S.-born elderly are less likely to live in institutions if they are in areas with increased levels of less‐ educated foreign‐ born labor, likely due to the expanded supply of labor in caregiving and other household services that helps the elderly age in their own communities. Our estimates imply that a typical U.S.-born individual over age 65 in the year 2000 was 0.5 percentage points (10 percent) less likely to be living in an institution than would have been the case if immigration had remained at 1980 levels. Together with recent work showing that immigration improves the health outcomes of those living in institutions, this line of research shows that immigration can both reduce the use of institutions by the U.S.-born elderly and improve their outcomes within them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Fred Wertheimer</p>
<p>There is a misconception that needs to be clarified about the potential impact of an upcoming Supreme Court case.</p>
<p>That misconception is this—if the “independent state legislature theory” is adopted by the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/moore-v-harper-2/"><em>Moore v. Harper</em></a>, state legislatures will be empowered to override the choice of voters on Election Day in a presidential election.</p>
<p>That’s not correct.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the Court’s decision in <em>Moore v. Harper</em> could dramatically and dangerously rewrite American democracy. <em>Moore v. Harper</em> will be argued before the Supreme Court on December 7. The case involves a gerrymandered North Carolina congressional map that was rejected by the state’s Supreme Court and is being defended by North Carolina legislators. They claim the state court’s decision violates the independent state legislature theory.</p>
<p>The independent state legislature theory has long been considered by many to be a radical, fringe idea. Simply put, it would prevent state courts from reviewing laws passed by state legislatures to redistrict congressional seats, or to establish voting rules or other laws applicable to federal elections.</p>
<p>In other words, a state Supreme Court would no longer have the right to decide whether state laws dealing with federal elections comply with the state’s own constitution.</p>
<p>The federal Constitution gives states the authority to regulate the “manner” of conducting federal elections in the state. When states exercise that authority, their laws have to comply with both federal constitutional requirements and laws (such as the federal Voting Rights Act) as well as state constitutional requirements (like anti-gerrymandering provisions that may be in a state’s constitution). But under the independent state legislature theory, the state legislature would be free to enact state laws to regulate federal elections in the state that would not be subject to review by state courts. In other words, the state legislature would be able to pass laws that are contrary to the state’s own constitution.</p>
<p>Just three years ago, the Supreme Court in <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf"><em>Rucho v. Common Cause</em></a>, rejected a request that the Court find another North Carolina redistricting plan to be an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander under the federal Constitution.</p>
<p>The Court majority rejected that request because it found that the federal Constitution does not set forth judicially manageable standards on what constitutes partisan gerrymandering. But some state Supreme Courts have said that their state constitutions or state laws do bar partisan gerrymandering. And in <em>Rucho</em>, the Supreme Court expressly said that while it would not strike down a redistricting plan on grounds of gerrymandering, there were other remedies that could be pursued, including state courts reviewing the actions taken by state legislatures.</p>
<p>The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, stated: “Provisions in state statutes and state constitutions can provide standards and guidance for state courts to apply.”</p>
<p>That position by the Supreme Court in 2019 directly contradicts the independent state legislature theory being advocated in the <em>Moore v. Harper</em> case.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chief Justice Roberts was joined in the <em>Rucho</em> opinion by conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, the very Justices who supporters of the fringe independent state legislature theory are relying on to win the case.</p>
<p>But, given the radical path the Supreme Court majority has been taking, there are no guarantees that this Court will practice what it preached just a few years ago.</p>
<p>It is, however, important to correct one key misconception regarding the state legislature theory—that if it is accepted by the Supreme Court, it could allow state legislatures to override the choice of voters in presidential elections.</p>
<p>To understand the independent state legislature theory with regard to presidential elections, we need to understand that in presidential elections, the U.S. Constitution and federal law control when presidential electors are chosen in a state.</p>
<p>Under <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II of the Constitution</a>, Congress is empowered to choose the “time” when presidential electors will be chosen. Federal law implementing the Article has established that electors are chosen on Election Day, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the Constitution gives state legislatures the power to choose electors, every state legislature has delegated to the voters the power to choose the President by voting for the presidential electors of the candidate they choose. While a state legislature in theory could take this power away from voters prior to Election Day, it is politically unfeasible and would lead to a national firestorm.</p>
<p>Once electors are chosen on Election Day, state legislatures, under the U.S. Constitution and under implementing federal law, have no authority to replace the choice for electors made by the voters with electors chosen by the state legislature—apart from one loophole contained as part of the 19th-century Electoral Count Act.</p>
<p>Under that loophole in current law, if a state legislature decides, for whatever reason, that voters have “failed” to make a choice on Election Day, the state legislature can name its own electors after Election Day. This dangerous loophole was brought into sharp focus by former President Donald Trump’s effort to use state legislatures to help overturn the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Congress, however, is well on its way to closing that loophole.</p>
<p>Legislation that closes the “failed choice” loophole along with other important reforms has <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://democracy21.org/news-press/press-releases/democracy-21-applauds-house-passage-of-the-presidential-election-reform-act">passed the House</a> and similar legislation was <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://democracy21.org/news-press/press-releases/electoral-count-reform-act-reported-today-by-senate-rules-committee-in-14-1-vote-is-essential-legislation-to-protect-against-another-presidential-coup-attempt">reported out of the Senate Rules Committee</a> in September. The Senate legislation, the Electoral Count Reform Act (ECRA), has strong bipartisan support, including 15 Republican sponsors—enough to overcome a filibuster. The bill is expected to be voted on by the full Senate in the lame-duck session following the midterm elections.</p>
<p>If the ECRA passes and the loophole is closed, state legislatures will then have no authority to override the presidential choice of the voters. Federal law, not state legislatures, will continue to control here, regardless of how the Supreme Court decides the <em>Moore </em>case and the independent state legislature theory. Because federal law would require electors to be chosen only on Election Day if the ECRA passes, state legislatures would have no power to choose different electors after Election Day even if they do not like the choice the voters made on Election Day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Gabriel R. Sanchez, Carly Bennett</p><p>As prepare for election night, it will be important to consider the impact that misleading and biased information has on the voting behavior of the public. This post draws from a conversation we had with <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.brookings.edu/experts/nicol-turner-lee/">Dr. Nicole Turner</a> Lee for the <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2022/10/31/techtank-podcast-episode-56-latino-voters-midterm-elections-and-the-effects-of-misinformation-and-disinformation/">TechTank podcast</a> which focused on the implications of misinformation targeting Latinos, with a particular emphasis on Spanish-language media.</p>
<p>Latinos are vital to the goal of decreasing the impact of blatant misinformation campaigns in the United States because they are more likely to <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/nielsen-2021-hispanic-diverse-insights-report-210682-D9.pdf">receive, consume, and share “fake news” and misinformation online compared to the general population</a>. We utilize a mix of existing research and original analysis to identify what puts Latinos at greater risk for misinformation, the implications of misinformation specific to this campaign season, and how we might improve our collective defense against dangerous misinformation efforts.</p>
<h2>Factors that make Latino Americans vulnerable to misinformation</h2>
<p>Several <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/13/spanish-latino-misinformation-2022-elections/">media stories have suggested that Latinos’ reliance on digital media for political information has made them particularly vulnerable to misleading information,</a> as they are platforms regularly used to spread lies.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/11/among-u-s-latinos-the-internet-now-rivals-television-as-a-source-for-news/">Pew Research Center</a>, Latinos’ use of social media, mobile apps, and other digital platforms increased more than that of the general U.S. population during the COVID-19 pandemic, with social media rivaling television as the dominant source of new content.</p>
<p>False political information is <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2021/on-screen-representation-is-driving-latino-tv-viewing/">more likely to reach U.S. Latinos as they spend more time on sites such as YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram.</a> Recently, the <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://naleo.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/10_11_22_-_NEF_Release_-_Tracking_Poll_-_Week_5_FINAL.pdf">National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials’ (NALEO) National Latino Voter Tracking Poll</a> identified YouTube as the top source of political news used by Latino voters this election cycle, with nearly half of the sample reporting they use it “very often.” When we look at potential variation based on language preference, we find that Spanish-speaking Latino households are 12% more reliant on YouTube than English dominant homes–48% to 36%.</p>
<p>The high rate of Spanish-language use among Latinos is suggested to be a factor that has likely led them to be targeted for misinformation, with high rates of false information occurring in Spanish. Targeting Latinos in Spanish is particularly problematic given that most social media platforms do not perform the same amount of fact checking in languages other than English, which results in misleading content staying live on these platforms for a much longer period of time than English content. Analysis of online misinformation also found that Facebook (now Meta) <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/facebook_coronavirus_misinformation/">failed to flag 70% of Spanish-language misinformation surrounding COVID-19</a> compared to just 29% of such information in English.</p>
<p>Although most research on this subject has focused on digital media, older and more traditional forms of media are also susceptible to false information. The use of <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/25/latino-misinformation-spanish-social-media/">Spanish-language radio has been particularly damaging to Latinos</a> because of its prevalence, as well as the fact that Spanish-language media outlets offer little to no response to misinformation, allowing conspiracy theories to spread.</p>
<p>Addressing the structural challenges to combating misinformation in Spanish at the source is vital given the high levels of trust Latinos have in Spanish-language news. In a <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/18/9629">recently published academic article</a>, my co-authors and I find that trust in Spanish-language media correlated with more positive views about COVID-19 vaccination information coming from state and local governments, and that this relationship is partially due to Spanish-language news journalists being highly trusted messengers among Latinos.</p>
<h2>Misinformation Directed at Latinos During the 2020 Election</h2>
<p>Although misinformation has been an issue well before the 2020 election, the 2020 election definitely saw a marked increase in the impact of misinformation on voting behavior. Scholars from the University of Houston found <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/25/latino-misinformation-spanish-social-media/">in their survey of Texas respondents during the 2020 election</a> that 35% or more of Latinos believed unfounded conspiracy theories, including 41% who believed that President Biden was under the influence of Black Lives Matter and Antifa.</p>
<p>External actors interested in utilizing misinformation to impact election outcomes, not surprisingly, focus on states where a slight shift in voting behavior can have an outcome on the electoral college. This means battleground states like Florida will continue to be a hotbed for this activity. <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/facebook_election_insurrection/">Almost half</a> of Spanish-speaking voters in Florida encountered misinformation on Facebook in the days leading to the 2020 elections. Demonstrating the strategic and targeted nature of false information campaigns, ads that were aired in Florida, where the largest concentration of Venezuelan Americans resides, attempted to link Biden to Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<p>During the 2020 elections, YouTube was the source of several videos that were deemed as credible news stories coming from Latin America but, in reality, were full of lies directed at Democratic candidates. In New Mexico, for example, video clips directed at Latino voters <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.axios.com/2021/04/15/republicans-youtube-latino-voters-democrats-trump">that falsely indicated that former Representative Xochitl Torres-Small (D-NM) supported the Green New Deal.</a> This was one of the factors that led Torres-Small to lose her seat.</p>
<h2>Evidence of misinformation disproportionately impacting Spanish-speaking Latinos this cycle</h2>
<p>Abortion policy has emerged as a key policy issue in this election cycle, and misinformation regarding the issue is unfortunately being directed at Latinos. The <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://naleo.org/COMMS/PRA/2022/BSP_Latino_Voter_Tracking_Poll/10_26_22_-_BSP_NEF_Week_Seven_Toplines_-_FINAL.pdf">NALEO National Latino Voter Tracking Poll</a> found that an overwhelming majority of Latinos in the survey (76%) have heard that abortion is now illegal nationwide and that a person can get arrested for seeking one. The percentage is even higher among Spanish-speaking Latino households, as 43% of Latinos who live in predominately Spanish-speaking households reported that they had seen or heard “a lot” about this, 7% higher than predominately English-speaking households.</p>
<p>Not only is this misinformation saturating the Latino community, more than three fifths of Latino registered voters (63%) believe that this is true. When we look at differences based on language, these have significant impact on the likelihood that Latinos will believe these false claims. Latinos who live in Spanish-speaking households are 13% more likely to believe that this statement is “mostly true” compared to English-speaking Latino households.</p>
<p>This survey also provides evidence that the Big Lie continues to be a problem for Latinos this election cycle, as 75% of voters have heard or read that there was “cheating and election fraud in 2020 and that Donald Trump was the true winner.” Despite no evidence to suggest that this is accurate, over a third (34%) of Latino voters believe that this is “mostly true.”</p>
<p>There is a large difference in exposure and acceptance of this dangerous narrative based on language. As reflected in the figure below, 62% of Spanish-speaking Latino households report that they have “seen or heard a lot” about this issue, which is a robust 22% more than English-speaking Latino households. Fortunately, there is a much smaller difference in believing the statement is “mostly true” based on language spoken at home: 21% for Spanish-dominant households compared to 20% of English-speaking households.</p>
<h2>Potential solutions</h2>
<p>Facebook’s leaked data suggests that the company <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://time.com/6110234/facebook-papers-testimony-explained/">spends 87% of its misinformation budget on U.S. content</a> but does not have a solution for detecting non-English comments and misinformation that may be generated outside of the country. Given that this is likely not unique to Facebook, there needs to be a sector-wide movement to increase the focus on misinformation in Spanish and other non-English languages.</p>
<p>Having more high-level Latino representation in ownership of media would be a game changer for the fight against misinformation directed at this community. We are therefore excited to see the emergence of the Latino Media Network, which has purchased several major Spanish-language radio stations across the country. The partners of the network say they plan to prioritize helping Spanish-language audiences <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://latinomedianetwork.com/about/">“navigate the ocean of information that exists in our society.”</a></p>
<p><a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/07/26/misinformation-is-eroding-the-publics-confidence-in-democracy/">As discussed in a prior post</a>, many of the longer-term strategies to combat misinformation revolve around improving the ability of the public to be informed consumers of digital information. Requiring every state <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.npr.org/2021/08/12/1026993142/illinois-is-the-first-state-to-have-high-schools-teach-news-literacy">to offer news literacy courses at every high school,</a> like Illinois has done, would be highly valuable to the Latino community given that Latinos are significantly younger than the overall population.</p>
<p>Finally, our review of the relevant research in this area has identified one silver lining in Latinos’ consumer behavior. <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://medium.com/harmony-labs/finding-the-immigrant-story-a1aab067c704">Research conducted by United We Dream and Harmony Labs</a> found Latinas are more likely to consume information about immigration and immigrants from a variety of sources, minimizing the spread of misinformation. Learning more about how Latinas navigate political information broadly would be worthwhile, as it may identify strategies for improving the ability of Latino men (and other communities) to identify and discount misinformation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Mitchell Barnes, Lauren Bauer, Wendy Edelberg, Sara Estep</p><p>Earlier this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) covering September 2022. This latest readout on the labor market accords with our recent <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/a_closer_look_at_a_hot_labor_market">economic analysis</a> highlighting the useful information provided by the fill rate (the ratio of job openings to hires). This month’s <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm">report</a> shows extremely high rates of job openings; based on either the fill rate or the ratio of job openings to unemployment, the labor market is very hot.</p>
<p>However, the two measures suggest different <em>gaps</em> between the current strength in the labor market and what a more sustainable level would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The openings-to-unemployment ratio (known as the Beveridge Curve) suggests substantial tightness and the need for a much higher unemployment rate to achieve a sustainable and more-typical level of job openings.</li>
<li>The fill rate, on the other hand, suggests less tightness and therefore less need for a substantial softening of the labor market.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fill rate shows that firms looking to hire large numbers of workers are indeed expanding employment at a rapid pace—because hires are also relatively high firms are clearly finding available workers. In contrast, while the Beveridge Curve has been moving in the direction of less tightness since July as the number of openings per unemployed has declined, that measure suggests that the matching of workers to jobs has dramatically worsened.</p>
<p>In this analysis we show that the rate of job openings has been more in line with its historical relationship to the hires rate than its relationship to the unemployment rate. Given labor market dynamics since 2021, getting the openings rate back to a more sustainable pace implies a hires rate in line with the 2015 hires rate but an unemployment rate more than double its 2015 rate.</p>
<p>The two ratios—job openings-to-hires and job openings-to-unemployment—have a track record of explaining price and wage pressure. However, we find that inflation appears to be more sensitive to changes in the openings-to-hires ratio than the openings-to-unemployment ratio. On one hand, this means that elevated openings relative to hires have done more to contribute to inflation; on the other hand, it means that as openings come down relative to hires price pressure should moderate.</p>
<p>Because the unemployment rate does not fully capture the pool of potential workers right now—many are coming straight into jobs from outside the labor force or are quitting their jobs to take new ones—the unemployment rate should not be the only indicator policymakers incorporate into their understanding of the labor market. We reiterate that if the labor market today is indeed quite hot (many job openings are available) and only moderately tight (many of those openings are getting filled) then the unemployment rate may not need to rise dramatically for the labor market to move to a more sustainable level.</p>
<h2><strong>How is the rate of job openings related to other labor market indicators?</strong></h2>
<p>Figure 1a shows the Beveridge Curve (job openings-to-unemployment), and Figure 1b shows the fill rate (job openings-to-hires). Both measures have been <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20939/w20939.pdf">used</a> to examine the tightness of the labor market, although the Beveridge Curve is better known and tracked. Any one of the inputs into these ratios—the unemployment rate, job openings rate, and hires rate—is less informative about labor market tightness than when they are combined.</p>

<p>In our recent <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/a_closer_look_at_a_hot_labor_market">economic analysis</a>, we find that the labor market looked considerably less tight from the vantage point of the fill rate (Figure 1b) rather than the Beveridge Curve (Figure 1a), though both have been moving modestly in recent months in the “less tight” direction. The data through September are consistent with that interpretation: both the job openings-to-unemployment ratio and the fill rate remain very high. But the job openings-to-unemployment ratio suggests a more significant change in labor market dynamics from before the pandemic. Not only is the ratio high, but it is well above a level implied by pre-pandemic relationships (the straight black line), suggesting that the unemployment rate would need to rise sharply to achieve a more sustainable labor market. The fill rate is also high but is less above its trend; as seen in calculations below, that suggests that a sustainable labor market can be achieved through a more moderate softening in conditions.</p>
<p>There are several factors that are contributing to the substantial differences between the implied labor market tightness from the Beveridge Curve and that from the fill rate. Relative to the last business cycle, transitions directly into employment from being out of the labor force are <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS17200000">high</a>, and, excluding the period just prior to the pandemic, transitions from out of the labor force into unemployment are <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS17600000">low</a>. This trend generally increases as the unemployment rate falls, but the extent it is occurring now is relatively elevated. The quits rate is quite <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSQUR">high</a>, but flows from employment to labor force nonparticipation are only <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS17800000">somewhat elevated</a>. The share of the employed holding multiple jobs has been <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12026620">increasing</a> since early 2021. These patterns all imply that an elevated number of people taking jobs are not coming from the ranks of the unemployed. If the pool of potential hires is larger than suggested by the pool’s historical relationship to the typical indicator of labor market tightness—active job seekers without a current job, i.e., the unemployed—then the fill rate becomes that much more important to track.</p>
<h2><strong>The fill rate suggests less labor market softening is needed to achieve a sustainable pace</strong></h2>
<p>By the Beveridge Curve (Figure 1a), if the total nonfarm job opening rate were to return from its current rate of 6.5 percent to its 2019 average of about 4.5 percent, <em>recent</em> history—the pattern over 2021 and 2022—would suggest an unemployment rate over 10 percent. In other words, the labor market currently appears to be so tight that a stable pace of hiring dynamics implies the unemployment rate would need to almost triple from September’s level.</p>
<p>For the fill rate (Figure 1b), the pattern over 2021 and 2022 is more consistent with the past two decades, at least relative to the Beveridge Curve. According to the job openings-to-hires relationship, to achieve a stable rate of job openings there could be less disruption in the labor market than is commonly thought. If the job opening rate were to return to its 2019 average, recent history points to a nonfarm hires rate of 3.6 percent, down from the current rate of 4.0 percent and consistent with the pace of hiring in 2014 and 2015.<a href="#ftnt1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Returning to the 2014–15 labor market would be far less disruptive than an unemployment rate of 10 percent, and a labor market like that of 2009–10.</p>
<h2><strong>Both indicators help explain inflation and wage dynamics</strong></h2>
<p>Both the Beveridge Curve and the fill rate help explain price and wage inflation. Table 1 shows these relationships based on regressions (Phillips Curve equations) of different measures of inflation on the ratios (or more precisely, the inverse of the ratios). Price inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy (core CPI inflation), and wage inflation is measured by the Employment Cost Index (ECI). Models were also estimated using lagged values of inflation (the autoregressive model in the table). We estimate these relationships on pre-pandemic data, from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2019.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows inflation rates based on core CPI (teal) and the ECI (purple) alongside predicted values from the models we estimate using the openings-to-unemployment (dashed line) or the openings-to-hires ratios (dotted line). One should interpret the “predicted” lines in the figure as the estimated contributions of labor market tightness to the pickup in inflation.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, predicted values are quite flat, reflecting the <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/what-best-measure-labor-market-tightness">well-documented</a> fact that inflation was only weakly related to labor market measures over the 2007–2019 period—the period that we use to estimate the relationship between the labor market indicators and inflation.</li>
<li>Second, using the 2007-19 relationship to make out-of-sample predictions in 2021 and 2022 shows that price and wage inflation are somewhat more sensitive to the recent movements in the openings-to-hires ratio; that is, the dotted lines show greater contributions to predicted inflation than the dashed lines.</li>
<li>Third, for the most part recent increases in either labor market ratio suggest little additional upward pressure on inflation; for example, predicted core CPI inflation remains at or below 2.5 percent in the third quarter of 2022, only marginally higher than in the second quarter.</li>
<li>Finally, because of the greater sensitivity of predicted inflation to the fill rate, a decline in this measure to pre-pandemic levels would likely reduce future inflation more than would a decline in the openings-to-unemployment ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, moderate declines in the fill rate point to greater easing of inflation than do moderate declines in the openings-to-unemployment ratio.</p>

If instead we exclude the data points from January to March 2021, which have a notable amount of leverage in the estimations, then the relationships from <em>April 2021</em> through September 2022 point to a substantially higher unemployment rate and a moderately lower hires rate that would be consistent with a job openings rate of 4.5 percent. The 2007 to 2019 data point to an unemployment rate of 3.2 percent and a hires rate of 3.9 percent consistent with a job openings rate of 4.5 percent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Elaine Kamarck</p><p>While there is no simple cure to the threats we face to our democracy, one small change could go a long way towards restoring trust: states should stop reporting incomplete vote totals on election night. This will provoke howls of protest from the news media which is, even now, preparing elaborate stages, fancy electronic maps and complex forecasting models in a race to be first to call the election­—some even going so far as to put a “<a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/business/media/tv-coverage-midterms.html">democracy desk</a>” on their stage­—in order to explain the chaos that is likely to happen.</p>
<p>But “election night” no longer exists and states can get rid of it. Today it’s more like election month. Early voting begins in some states in <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/09/20/early-voting-calendar-schedule-2022-midterm-election/10389747002/">early October</a> and continues into November and absentee voting has skyrocketed. Some of these trends are the direct result of COVID which shut the country down in 2020, leading election officials in many states to come up with ways to hold an election that didn’t involve standing in line inside a polling place and possibly contracting the virus. For the first time in history, only 30% of voters cast their ballots on Election Day in 2020.</p>
<p>The second reason election night no longer exists is that most states have laws which forbid counting the early votes before Election Day. That is understandable­—imagine the unfair impact reporting an early vote winner might have on subsequent voters. So, most states forbid counting these early votes until Election Day itself. This was never much of a problem when the early vote counted for a small portion of the overall vote. But in 2020, in addition to the large increase in early voting, early voting itself became politicized. These two factors combined to make the Election Day vote a very poor predictor of the election outcome.</p>
<p>This happened because President Trump decided, even before Election Day 2020, that absentee ballots would be the source of fraud against him (although he and the First Lady voted absentee). He convinced his supporters to vote in person while Democrats were urging their voters to vote early and/or by absentee ballot. The election night returns created what became known as “the red mirage”—the in-person votes were for Trump­—the early and absentee ones for Biden. As more and more votes were counted the candidate in the lead changed, creating a fertile situation for conspiracy theorists. In Phoenix’s Maricopa County, election deniers believed that <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/06/arizona-republicans-bamboo-ballots-audit-2020">40,000 ballots had been shipped in from China marked for Biden</a>. They set about looking for <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/06/arizona-republicans-bamboo-ballots-audit-2020">bamboo fibers in the ballots</a>­—surely one of the crazier theories in an altogether crazy year.</p>
<p>The third reason to get rid of election night is the prospect of chaos or even violence at polling places on Election Day and the prospect of interrupted or chaotic vote counts. We aren’t even at Election Day and already a court in Arizona has had to step in to keep <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/politics/arizona-voter-intimidation-ballot-drop-boxes/index.html">armed men</a> from establishing a threatening presence around ballot drop-off boxes.</p>
<p>The move towards hand counting of ballots and the many possible instances of chaos in a close election makes it likely that in some instances the courts will have to step in and sort things out­—a prospect that could take some time.</p>
<p>The combination of these factors plus many very close Senate races means that trying to call winners on election night­—let alone control of the Senate­—is a fool’s errand and one that is guaranteed to create even more confusion and suspicion as the votes are counted or the courts sort out issues. Below are multiple charts showing how many early votes and absentee votes were received as of the end of October in states where there is a key Senate race. Of the nine states with competitive Senate races, only three allow votes to be counted before Election Day. In the other six, vote counting could take a week or more. Early and absentee voting numbers are already breaking records, leading analysts to predict an even higher turnout than in 2018­—which broke records for a midterm election. In many states, Republicans are also voting early­—a sign that perhaps the convenience is outweighing the paranoia Trump spread in 2020. No matter how you look at it, election officials who cannot start counting votes until Election Day have a huge job before them, and they will need to do it accurately.</p>
<p>The bottom line? There is no reason that we need to know winners on election night especially when the race to call elections creates confusion and a fertile field for more conspiracy theories. States should resist the hyperventilating of the networks and announce winners when enough of the vote has been counted that the outstanding vote is trivial and cannot change the outcome.</p>

<h2><a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.nber.org/papers/w30612"><strong>AI narrows productivity gap among taxi drivers</strong></a></h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) can narrow the productivity gap between high- and low-skilled taxi drivers, find Kyogo Kanazawa of the University of Tokyo and co-authors. <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.nber.org/papers/w30612">By suggesting routes for taxi drivers in Yokohama, Japan, to take, the program “AI Navi” reduced search time by 7.4% for low-skilled taxi drivers and 6.1% for middle-skilled drivers</a>. On the other hand, high-skilled drivers saw essentially zero benefits. Rather than simply displacing jobs, AI’s impact on human labor can, in fact, be rather nuanced. To the extent that wages reflect productivity, AI has the potential to reduce wage inequality across workers within the same occupation, the authors conclude.</p>
<h2><a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.nber.org/papers/w30608"><strong>Nurse practitioners utilize more resources but have worse patient outcomes</strong></a></h2>
<p>Nurse practitioners perform the same tasks as physicians but are trained and compensated very differently. Using data on emergency department visits at Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, David C. Chan Jr of Stanford and Yiqun Chen of the University of Illinois at Chicago find that nurse practitioners use more hospital resources (such as ordering more tests and formal consults for their patients) but achieve worse patient outcomes than physicians. <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.nber.org/papers/w30608">Specifically, nurse practitioners increase the length of hospital stays by 11% and the cost of emergency care by 7%</a>. Nurse practitioners utilize more resources because they are likely less skilled than physicians, the authors suggest. Indeed, the gap between physician and nurse practitioner performance decreases with provider experience. The high resource utilization and worse outcomes associated with nurse practitioners cost $74 million per year across VA emergency departments, the authors estimate, suggesting that, “despite having wages half that of physicians’ wages, [nurse practitioners] are still more costly to employ.”</p>
<h2><a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/parenting-promotes-social-mobility-within-and-across-generations/"><strong>Low-cost programs focused on improving parenting are as effective as more comprehensive childhood enrichment programs</strong></a><strong>  </strong></h2>
<p>Early childhood enrichment programs don’t need to be expensive to be effective. Jorge Luis García of Clemson and James Heckman of the University of Chicago find that low-cost home-visiting programs that focused on improving parenting had similar effects on children’s home environments and cognitive abilities as time-intensive, costly programs that offered more services. <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/parenting-promotes-social-mobility-within-and-across-generations/">The findings suggest that “enhancing parenting [is] an essential ingredient” for effective early childhood enrichment, and that low-cost programs which focus on this component can achieve many of the same effects as more comprehensive alternatives</a>. Additionally, the authors find that high-cost programs have been successfully replicated and scaled in the U.S. through the Head Start program, and that low-cost programs are also likely scalable. Because the programs studied overwhelmingly serve socioeconomically disadvantaged children from racial minorities, the authors argue “national implementation of the programs…would substantially shrink the overall U.S. Black-White earnings gap.”</p>

<p>“[W]e have made progress on [the] normalization path, but that we still have ground to cover. As we have made that progress, I am also telling you that the ultimate destination that we want to reach is the rate that will deliver the 2% inflation target in the medium term. That rate, by the way, is not necessarily the rate at which we will have considered that normalization is completed. It may well have to go beyond that, but what I am also telling you is that we are going to decide meeting-by-meeting on the basis of data … So, it might well be several meetings. Now, how ‘several’ is, that will be determined meeting-by-meeting. We know the path, we know the journey, we know the destination – which is not as clear as a figure that you would like to pin down because we cannot do that. We simply cannot do that,” <a href="http://webfeeds.brookings.edu/~/t/0/0/brookingsrss/topfeeds/latestfrombrookings/~https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is221027~358a06a35f.en.html">says Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank</a>.</p>
<p>“[W]e have been utterly surprised by the unprecedented rise in inflation in a very short period of time that called for a change of our monetary policy stance. You&#8217;ve seen that we&#8217;ve moved from negative territory before July to now the 150 basis points for the DFR [Deposit Facility Rate]. We&#8217;ve done that because of the change of circumstances. Now, stance is one thing and it&#8217;s not enough. We need to have the best possible transmission, and that is the main reason why we are changing the interest rate … that will apply as of November. We&#8217;re doing that to make sure that there is no obstacle, that there is no deterrent to the transmission of our monetary policy, and that banks will actually transmit the lending rates, which by necessity of our monetary policy stance are higher and have to be higher.”</p>
