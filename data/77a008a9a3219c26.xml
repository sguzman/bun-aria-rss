   <media:description>Watch and witness the journey of open-source monitoring system, Prometheus. Before Kubernetes existed‚Äîeven before Docker‚Äîthe team at Soundcloud already knew their monitoring system deserved a complete, fundamental revamp. Of course, as with anything in development, this was no easy task.
Join us as we explore the story of Prometheus, from inception to adoption as told by the story‚Äôs key players including Julian Volz, Matthias Rampke, Bj√∂rn Rabenstein, and more. In the end, you‚Äôll see how a ‚Äúproblem to be solved‚Äù eventually led the industry to a completely new understanding of monitoring. We hope you‚Äôre ready to be inspired. üî•

   <media:description>Gr√ºezi, dear developers! Have you ever wondered what it‚Äôs like to live in Z√ºrich? In this episode of DevCities, we meet Marius Colaciou, Engineer Lead at Ledgy and nature-connoisseur, to learn about life in the Swiss city. We asked Marius to share some of his favourite local spots and tell us about the culture and work life.
Join us to learn more about why Marius chose startups over corporates like Google, what he thinks about the dev community and quality of life in Switzerland‚Ä¶ and why he calls the city a ‚Äòsweaty buffet‚Äô.
**Special thanks to Jahlela Hasle, Timo Horstsch√§fers and Jules Henze.

   <media:description>How many times can a person pronounce JSON differently in the course of one video tutorial? The answer is too many.  @Douglas Crockford, the inventor of JSON, would have never imagined 20-odd years ago, that people would get so hung up on the name. So, after years of staying out of a huge international debate around the correct pronunciation, we asked him to put vowels back into their rightful place. Think‚Ä¶ French. ü•ñ

   <media:description>We all know that saying 'no' is important in life. Saying 'no' is a common tip in virtually every self help book, but that doesn't mean it's easy to do. Sara Vieira, senior frontend developer and speaker, speaks honestly with us about why it's so hard to say 'no' in real life, how she got through and what could help other developers get through burnout. No bullshit.

As Sara says: if you're feeling burnt out, please talk to someone! It's a good place to start.

   <media:description>Burnout. According to some studies, 81% of developers have experienced it in recent years. While there‚Äôs no clear remedy for burnout, Anselm Hannemann has found one way to combat it‚Ä¶ by planting vegetables.

This mini-doc follows Anselm as he mixes development with being in nature. This is probably our most relaxing doc yet, so grab a tea and get cosy!

   <media:description>The official Kubernetes Documentary Part 2. 

Inspired by the open source success of Docker in 2013 and seeing the need for innovation in the area of large-scale cloud computing, a handful of forward-thinking Google engineers set to work on the container orchestrator that would come to be known as Kubernetes‚Äì this new tool would forever change the way the internet is built.

These engineers overcome technical challenges, resistance to open source from within, naysayers, and intense competition from other big players in the industry.

Most engineers know about ‚ÄúThe Container Orchestrator Wars‚Äô‚Äô but most people would not be able to explain exactly what happened, and why it was Kubernetes that ultimately came out on top.

There is no topic more relevant to the current open source landscape. This film captures the story directly from the people who lived it, featuring interviews with prominent engineers from Google, Red Hat, Twitter and others.

Kubernetes exists as a testament to the power of open source software.
