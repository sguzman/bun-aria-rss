      <title>Sleater-Kinney, Live At The 9:30 Club</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The last time Sleater-Kinney played the 9:30 Club, a transformer threatened to blow in the midst of a summer heat wave. Or maybe the Washington, D.C., club just couldn't handle Corin Tucker's pipes. That was nine years ago, on a goodbye-for-now tour that caught the trio at the top of its game. The show was rescheduled and taped for NPR Music, and we had our closure, crossing fingers that it wouldn't be the last we'd hear from Corin Tucker, Carrie Brownstein and Janet Weiss. In the intervening years, all three put their energies into other projects, musical and not, sometimes even with each other. But Sleater-Kinney has an electric chemistry of its own. As Brownstein says, "I really think Sleater-Kinney is a singular band with no clear predecessor or successor, so I don't think we started out creating music that you could see the palette of colors that we were using, and maybe draw a lineage." On the first night of a two-night gig at the 9:30 Club, Sleater-Kinney went all-in with its set list. Tracks from the band's monster of a new album, No Cities To Love, felt natural alongside songs like "Oh!" and "Words And Guitar," obliterating the band's timeline by demonstrating a catalog that's always present, always on fire.]]></description>

Sprung from the twisted imagination of flamboyant frontman Kevin Barnes, the band's shows include elaborate costumes and stage sets, synchronized dancing and massive bursts of psychedelic lighting effects.

You can hear the spectacle unfold in this concert, recorded live from the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., on April 3. To watch video of this concert, visit npr.org/liveconcerts.]]></description>

      <title>JEFF The Brotherhood, Live at the 9:30 Club</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It got loud when NPR Music live webcast these full concerts from two of the grittiest rock duos of the past decade, The Kills and JEFF The Brotherhood. Each band has an outsize sound, fueled by deafening guitar noise and trashy rhythms, and is known for feverish but playful live performances. JEFF The Brotherhood opened the webcast from Washington, D.C.'s 9:30 Club, followed by The Kills. Real-life brothers Jake and Jamin Orrall founded the duo JEFF The Brotherhood in Nashville in 2001. Over the course of a half-dozen full-length albums, they've built a reputation on distorted, noisy rock with a wry sense of humor. For the band's Tiny Desk performance at the NPR Music offices, they insisted on removing their shirts for what they called "a sad love song," which was immediately followed by plenty of guitar shredding and messy beats. No promises on whether the duo will shirt-up for Thursday's live webcast.]]></description>

JEFF The Brotherhood opened the webcast from Washington, D.C.'s 9:30 Club, followed by The Kills. Singer-guitarist Alison Mosshart and drummer Jamie Hince formed The Kills in 2001 after bonding over their shared love of blues- and punk-infused garage rock. Their fourth and most recent record, 2011's Blood Pressure — released after Mosshart heightened her profile alongside Jack White in The Dead Weather — is full of sex and swagger, dark guitar riffs and twisted beats.

      <description><![CDATA[Earth-rattling horns and mesmerizingly oscillating vocals: Boston's Debo Band takes the funky, psychedelic groove of 1960s Ethiopiaand transplants it firmly onto a 21st-century dance floor. With 11 musicians crammed every which way onto the tiniest stage of the night — the sousaphone barely cleared overhead pipes — Debo Band closed globalFEST in serious, sweaty, funky style. For more concerts, visit npr.org/liveconcerts.

      <title>Beirut in Concert From The 9:30 Club</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Beirut's latest album, The Rip Tide, was recorded in New York during the winter of 2010 and takes a surprise turn away from the group's early, ?o?ek-influenced sound and toward more mainstream indie rock. But the band hasn't reinvented itself entirely: Anyone drawn to the trumpet and ukulele on Beirut's first album, Gulag Orkestar, will find those familiar sounds on The Rip Tide, but set amidst wurlitzer, pump organ and percussion that can sound almost electronic at times. Beirut showcased this new material in a live concert webcast from Washington, D.C.'s 9:30 Club. ]]></description>

Hecker's sixth and most recent album — titled Ravedeath, 1972 — is an enveloping, almost suffocating exploration of noise music. Hecker buries melodies and rhythms in a deluge of dissonance and sound, obfuscating instrumentation; sifting through the thick, ambient textures of "The Piano Drop" is as gratifying as it is hypnotic.

      <title>CANT In Concert: Moogfest 2011</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It's obvious on even a cursory listen to Chris Taylor's new project CANT that he's taken advantage of his time off from Grizzly Bear. "Ghost," his first release in this incarnation, came hot off the heels of Grizzly Bear's critically adoredVeckatimest (an album he produced), and it sounded like it. On the recent Dreams Come True, however, the stylistic markers of Grizzly Bear are conspicuously absent. Gone are the tone cluster vocal harmonies and heavily reverbed guitar. The crunchy fuzz bass of "Believe" plays more like a brilliant cover of a lost '80s R&B ballad, while "Answer" is a glitchy Goth new-wave slog and "Be Around" would feel at home under an action-movie montage. They comprise a dazzling alternative universe from an already accomplished artist. Hear CANT in a full concert, recorded live on October 29, 2011 at Moogfest in Asheville, N.C.]]></description>

His recent performances have highlighted his work as a DJ, departing from his mid-period forays into rock musicianship, but at Moogfest, he was in full-on rock star mode, stalking the stage and playing guitar, drums and keyboards while leading a band clad all in black through songs from throughout his nearly 20-year career.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Few artists have survived the constantly mutating world of dance music from era to era quite like Moby. From his roots in New York's early-'90s rave scene to the commercial gold of Play and 18's ambient electronica, Moby has maintained his place on the shortlist of the genre's crossover stars. His recent performances have highlighted his work as a DJ, departing from his mid-period forays into rock musicianship, but at Moogfest, he was in full-on rock star mode, stalking the stage and playing guitar, drums and keyboards while leading a band clad all in black through songs from throughout his nearly 20-year career. Hear Moby perform a full concert, recorded live on October 28, 2011 at Moogfest in Asheville, N.C.]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Austra In Concert: Moogfest 2011</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Austra, a.k.a. Toronto-based Katie Stelmanis, released her debut album Feel It Break all of one month before it was shortlisted for the Polaris Prize. It's easy to see why: The disc pairs clear, powerful vocals with dark, distorted analog synthesizers to beautiful effect. She didn't win, but — as she rides a rising tide of dark new-wave artists along with Zola Jesus and a rejuvenated Trent Reznor — it's safe to say things are looking up for her. Hear Stelmanis and her band in a full concert, recorded live on October 28, 2011 at Moogfest in Asheville, N.C.]]></description>

      <title>Emmylou Harris: Newport Folk Festival 2011</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Emmylou Harris' Grammy-festooned career stretches back more than 40 years, to her legendary early collaborations with the late country-folk legend Gram Parsons. Hard Bargain, her new album, is suffused with mourning, both for Parsons (in "The Road") and for her late friend Kate McGarrigle, whom she memorably memorializes in "Darlin' Kate." But the Country Music Hall of Famer still knows where and how to locate sweetness and joy in her music, and she remains vital and contemporary. Here, Harris closes out the 2011 Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I. joined on stage by many special guests: Pete Seeger, The Civil Wars, David Wax Museum and more.]]></description>

      <title>The Civil Wars: Newport Folk Festival 2011</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Joy Williams and John Paul White were strangers when they were paired up at a Nashville songwriting session in 2008, but you'd never know that now: Though not romantically involved, they perform their sweet, harmony-rich folk-pop songs with loving chemistry, often staring sweetly into each other's eyes. After attracting huge buzz at this year's SXSW music festival, the pair has gone on to be a large-scale cult item, thanks in part to the warmly winning songs on this year's Barton Hollow. The Civil Wars draw heavily from that album, and a few choice covers, when the band performs live at the 2011 Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I.]]></description>

But talk about making the most of an opportunity: The band was everywhere at Newport last year, passing out CDs and signing bands up to its mailing list when it wasn't breaking spontaneously into song every chance it got. Since that breakthrough, the group has found a national audience for its recent album Everything Is Saved, which finds David Wax mixing the roots of American and Mexican folk music while Suz Slezak gives the band's music the percussive edge that can only come from a stick dragged rhythmically against a donkey's jawbone.

But he's remained remarkably level-headed and creatively ambitious in the five years since the group's demise, exploring his more progressive leanings in Punch Brothers and teaming up with Michael Daves for a more traditional collection paying tribute to past bluegrass greats like Bill Monroe and fellow Newport artist Earl Scruggs.

It feels a little silly to think of her as a frontwoman — the mere lead singer of some band — but she's all showmanship and command on the live stage.

      <title>SXSW 2011: Raphael Saadiq Live In Concert</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For all its irresistibly soulful energy, what really jumps out about Raphael Saadiq's music is the smooth precision with which it falls into place. A perfectly tailored showman, with perhaps the whitest teeth in show business, the producer and former member of Tony! Toni! Ton?! plays the part of the in-control frontman to perfection. But don't mistake his impeccably presented persona with sterility: This set from Stubb's in Austin, Texas -- recorded live as part of the South by Southwest music festival — is a full-blown soul revue, complete with choreographed backup singers and buckets of sweat. When a guy this cool exerts this much effort, it's a joy to behold. Hear Saadiq perform live at SXSW from Stubb's in Austin, Texas, on March 16, 2011.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Smith Westerns' members are no strangers to NPR Music's coverage of the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas: Just last year, they were a bunch of skinny, no-name teenagers winning over the crowd at NPR Music's annual daytime party. That enjoyable and ingratiating set — all propulsive rock energy, timeless pop hooks and some of the shiniest hair in music — laid the groundwork nicely for last fall's well-received Dye It Blonde, an engaging blast of candy-coated swagger.

      <description><![CDATA[Yuck doesn't worry much about first impressions: Short of calling a band "We're Terrible," it's hard to imagine a name riper for dismissal. On stage, though, this is a remarkably assured young riser. Yuck captures the frayed noise and hooky, guitar-driven melodies of '90s rock, even though its members, at 20, are too young to have experienced it firsthand.

Martinez was added to globalFEST at the last minute after a Cuban group had visa trouble; he also played without his own band and had to put together a pickup group quickly. Despite all this, Martinez was a delight. He has been studying under the the legendary African singer and bandleader Youssou N'Dour — an important connection in his life since the Garifuna community descends from escaped African slaves. The culturally endangered Garifuna song forms such as paranda ballads find new life as the Honduran musician complements them with his melancholy yet hopeful singing.]]></description>

      <title>Ballake Sissoko &amp; Vincent Segal: globalFEST 2011</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This was one show everyone wanted to catch. Magic happens when Ballak? Sissoko and Vincent Segal perform. This night at globalFEST was no exception. When the kora and a cello sit side by side, there's a clear cultural juxtaposition of African and European musical tradition. But despite the striking contrast, when the Malian kora player Sissoko and French cellist Segal sit down together, nothing sounds more natural. Sissoko plucks sweet harp-like sounds from the 21-stringed kora, while Segal draws unexpected sounds from his cello, sometimes evoking woodwinds. The acoustic pairing and cultural combination has become an exciting new sound in chamber music.]]></description>

      <title>Red Baraat: globalFEST 2011</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This was my globalFEST surprise. Imagine a New Orleans street band playing Indian Bollywood tunes with a go-go beat — you can't?

Long a star in his native Ireland, thanks to a long string of albums with The Frames, Hansard couldn't catch a break in America, where he bounced from label to label without finding much success. But then Hansard and young Czech singer Marketa Irglova sang and starred together in a little 2007 indie movie called 'Once,' and everything changed: The two won an Oscar for "Falling Slowly," the movie's soundtrack sold millions, and The Frames gave way to The Swell Season, in which Hansard and his old band perform with Irglova. The two singers' romantic relationship ended as they were recording 2009's 'Strict Joy,' but they continue to work and perform together.

Naturally, he keeps one eye on tradition, but -- true to form for an adventure- seeking free spirit -- he's always looking forward, too. LaFarge's newest album, recorded with his South City Three, is titled 'Riverboat Soul.' Here, LaFarge and his band perform live at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I.]]></description>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[You wouldn't expect someone called Pokey LaFarge to grow up in fancy boarding schools, so it's not a huge surprise to learn that he came of age as an all-around rural wanderer who found his voice in roving packs of fellow buskers. Naturally, he keeps one eye on tradition, but -- true to form for an adventure- seeking free spirit -- he's always looking forward, too.

      <title>David Wax Museum: Newport Folk Festival 2010</title>
      <description><![CDATA[David Wax Museum knows how to make the most of an opportunity. The talented Boston roots-folk band won its spot on a Newport Folk Festival stage after winning a contest, then spent the first day of the festival courting fans cheerfully but aggressively. By the time its set was half over -- after it had passed around its mailing list and hawked its line of hats -- the group had gathered a fairly enormous crowd, which it proceeded to win over in an increasingly big way. Before its set was over, the full band had congregated in the middle of the crowd to perform without amplification; judging by the deafening roar that followed, David Wax Museum won't need to enter contests much longer.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The songs on July Flame orbit around Veirs' acoustic-guitar playing and voice. But it's her idiosyncratic lyrics and melodic flourishes that imbue her music with sun-dappled warmth; hers is the sound of immense, wide-open spaces.

For this short Tiny Desk Concert, Stanley performs three classic songs, all a cappella: "Gloryland," "Turn Back, Turn Back" and "Amazing Grace."]]></description>
