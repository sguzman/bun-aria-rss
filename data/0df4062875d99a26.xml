        <![CDATA[<p>We're wrapping up Season Three of <em>Out Travel the System</em> on an <em>extremely</em> high note - by interviewing none other than  <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>  and  <strong>Rob McElhenney</strong>! Although you may know them best from their antics on both the small and big screen, the topic at hand is their new project,  <strong>Wrexham AFC</strong>  - one of the oldest football clubs in the world.  </p>

<p>Listen in to our last episode of the season as they talk about their business bromance with host <strong>Nisreene Atassi</strong> , ably supported by Wrexham AFC executive director  <strong>Humphrey Ker</strong>. The fellas talk about what they sincerely admire about each other, their hopes for the team, and what there is to check out in town, should you have the opportunity to go to northern Wales to watch a match in person.</p>

<p>Along the way, they share details about some of their favorite travel memories (why is Ryan running around Paris at 3 am), poke fun at Humphrey, and drop a few cusswords (please don't mind the bleeps.) They also confirm why they're likely to be using <a href="https://www.expedia.com/Wrexham.dx5625" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Expedia</a> in the near future!</p>

<p>Here are handy links to a couple of things mentioned within the episode:<br>

      <title>When to Splurge and Go Big When it Comes to Travel</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 13:00:00 -0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In all of the conversations we've had this season, a couple of threads keep resurfacing:  how much we appreciate the ability to travel, and how to really maximize a trip. Well, we thought it was high time to devote an episode specifically to this!</p>

<p><em>Out Travel the System</em> host  <strong>Nisreene Atassi</strong>  dives into the idea of splurging while traveling, and how that can mean different things to different people. She is joined by expert travel planner  <strong>Sarah Groen</strong> , host of the <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/luxury-travel-insider" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Luxury Travel Insider</a> podcast, as well as  <strong>Tomiko Harvey</strong> , Vice President of the  <strong>Black Travel Alliance</strong> , and writer at <a href="https://passportsandgrub.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Passports and Grub</a>.</p>

<p>They'll take you through how a splurge - whether it's adding on a private tour, upgrading your seat on a flight, or making sure your home away from home has everything you need - can make or break the way you remember your travels. Sarah shares how to plan out the 'arc' of a trip (hint, save the best hotels for last), and Tomiko talks about some of her favorite splurges.</p>

        <![CDATA[In all of the conversations we've had this season, a couple of threads keep resurfacing:  how much we appreciate the ability to travel, and how to really maximize a trip. Well, we thought it was high time to devote an episode specifically to this! Out Travel the System host Nisreene Atassi dives into the idea of splurging while traveling, and how that can mean different things to different people. She is joined by expert travel planner Sarah Groen, host of the Luxury Travel Insider podcast, as well as Tomiko Harvey, Vice President of the Black Travel Alliance, and writer at Passports and Grub. They'll take you through how a splurge - whether it's adding on a private tour, upgrading your seat on a flight, or making sure your home away from home has everything you need - can make or break the way you remember your travels. Sarah shares how to plan out the 'arc' of a trip (hint, save the best hotels for last), and Tomiko talks about some of her favorite splurges. So go ahead, book that second massage at your vacation hotel, line up that private tour, and borrow a page out of Sarah's book by really upgrading your rental vehicle - take this episode as the encouragement you need to say yes to your next travel splurge! ]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Well it's official, <em>Out Travel the System</em> fam - Pumpkin Spice Latte Season (PSL Season) is underway. What better way to mark it than by mapping out your route to check out fall foliage, head out on a quick road trip, or indulge in your favorite fall activities and dishes?</p>

<p>Listen in as host  <strong>Nisreene Atassi</strong>  chats with 'Queen of Fall'  <strong>Steffy Degreff</strong>  of <a href="https://steffysprosandcons.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steffys Pros and Cons</a>, and <a href="http://www.andrea-romano.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">writer and content producer</a> Andrea Romano. They share their thoughts on why fall is the best season, and how to thoroughly 'PSL-ize' your life, if you're in the mood.</p>

<p>Put on your coziest chunky-knit sweater and wooly socks, and sit back to listen, PSL in hand - you'll never believe how many ways there are to celebrate PSL Season.</p>

<p>Here is some inspiration from the episode:<br>

        <![CDATA[<p>When we talk about the magic of travel here on <em>Out Travel the System</em>, we often mean it figuratively... but this episode is <em>literally</em> about travel magic - yes that's right, it's time to get the inside scoop on planning your trip to  <strong>Disney</strong> ,  <strong>the Magic Kingdom</strong>!</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>As anticipation grows for international travel, we at <em>Out Travel the System</em> thought this would be the perfect time to profile   Spain. It's one of host  <strong>Nisreene Atassi's</strong>  favorite places in the world, for a long list of reasons.</p>

<p>Joining her on the delicious way through this episode is Chef <strong><a href="https://www.jaleo.com/story/#culinary-director" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ramon Martinez</a></strong>, culinary director of Jaleo Restaurants, which operate under the umbrella of Chef  <strong>Jose Andres</strong>' <a href="https://thinkfoodgroup.com/jose-andres/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ThinkFoodGroup</a>, as well as Nacho Alonso, Spain Area Manager for  <strong>Expedia</strong>.</p>

<p>They dish on why Chef Ramon is calling in from the dry goods pantry of the restaurant, and how even that showcases a Spanish specialty. From the best beaches, to Spanish history and culture, and why a winter visit could be a good bet, this episode has it all.</p>

<p>Listen in for tips on when to travel to maximize your budget, and for the last word on where to get a truly authentic paella - and what exactly that means. This episode of <em>Out Travel the System</em> is your go-to guide on planning your first or 50th trip to Spain, and finding hidden gems even locals may not know about.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[As anticipation grows for international travel, we at Out Travel the System thought this would be the perfect time to profile Spain. It's one of host Nisreene Atassi's favorite places in the world, for a long list of reasons. Joining her on the delicious way through this episode is Chef Ramon Martinez, culinary director of Jaleo Restaurants, which operate under the umbrella of Chef Jose Andres' ThinkFoodGroup, as well as Nacho Alonso, Spain Area Manager for Expedia. They dish on why Chef Ramon is calling in from the dry goods pantry of the restaurant, and how even that showcases a Spanish specialty. From the best beaches, to Spanish history and culture, and why a winter visit could be a good bet, this episode has it all. Listen in for tips on when to travel to maximize your budget, and for the last word on where to get a truly authentic paella - and what exactly that means. This episode of Out Travel the System is your go-to guide on planning your first or 50th trip to Spain, and finding hidden gems even locals may not know about.]]>

They delve into the key elements of what makes a lake vacation so special, and how it's different from say, a vacation involving a beach or a pool.</p>

<p>Fishing, boating, swimming, or simply doing nothing at all - there's nothing quite like the traditions involved in this style of vacation, whether it's the first or the 50th time you've headed to the lake.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>We get it - it can still feel like a big world of unknowns out there when it comes to travel. Who better to ask about this than  <strong>Expedia</strong> , and our community of travelers who have 'been there and done that'?</p>

<p>Host  <strong>Nisreene Atassi</strong>  chats with commercial pilot  <strong>Garrett Ray</strong>  (<a href="http://instagram.com/flywithgarrett" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@flywithgarrett</a>) and former Olympian, current awesome human  <strong>Perri Edwards</strong> , aka Perri Shakes-Drayton (<a href="http://instagram.com/itspsd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@itspsd</a>) about the itineraries they curated for <a href="https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8898551-expedia-travel-week-kicking-off-june-8th/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Expedia Travel Week</a>, and what essential travel has been like during the past year.</p>

<p>Along the way, we talk about why Perri is splitting her time between London, UK and Lagos, Nigeria, and how Garrett is adjusting to a temporary pause in airline pilot tradition. We also delve into their hopes for the future, both for travel and in their own lives.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Dun dun, dun dun, dun dun... please imagine the <em>Jaws</em> theme song as we circle... closer... to... unpacking some travel bags that have sat, virtually untouched, for TWO YEARS.</p>

<p>Yes, in this episode of <em>Out Travel the System</em>, we are literally taking you inside host  <strong>Nisreene Atassi</strong>'s baggage. Learn what this incredibly seasoned traveler makes sure to pack every time, and why 'Inception pouch' may be your new mantra as you get ready to think about traveling again. It may just be the prompt you need to refresh the items on your packing list. Don't forget Nissy's trick of pre-measuring shampoo, lotion, etc., to ensure you aren't lugging around bits of product that you won't need on your travels.</p>

<p>We'll also engage in a flight of fancy to envision what it would be like to prep for a trip - something that may be the right choice for you this year.</p>

<p>Here are some items for your travel bag that you may not have thought of before:<br>
-two in one hand lotion and hand sanitizer (yes, both in one product)<br>
-a spray and cloth to clean off your cell phone<br>
-two sets of headphones, one compatible with airplanes, and one for regular use</p>]]>

Don't forget Nissy's trick of pre-measuring shampoo, lotion, etc., to ensure you aren't lugging around bits of product that you won't need on your travels. We'll also engage in a flight of fancy to envision what it would be like to prep for a trip - something that may be the right choice for you this year. Here are some items for your travel bag that you may not have thought of before: -two in one hand lotion and hand sanitizer (yes, both in one product) -a spray and cloth to clean off your cell phone -two sets of headphones, one compatible with airplanes, and one for regular use ]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Here we are, once again, thinking about what travel means during a pandemic.</p>

<p>What's different about Season Three of <em>Out Travel the System</em> though, is that we feel as though we can expand beyond <em>inspiring </em>and <em>informing</em>, and — cautiously, optimistically — talk about <em>dreaming</em> and <em>actually</em> <em>going</em> when the time and circumstances are right for you.  </p>

<p>Host <strong>Nisreene Atassi</strong> is joined here by <em>Out Travel the System</em>'s associate producer  <strong>Katie Doten</strong>. Together, they pull back the curtain on some of the travel topics and destinations we'll be exploring in Season Three - as well as some of the realizations they've come to, about the value of travel to them. Katie tells a story about a side hustle she's seriously considering, and shares a tip that you may never have thought of - she would be delighted if you bite her style!</p>

<p>ps if you want to know more about Katie's Alaskan camper van pick, please check it out <a href="https://www.alpinecampervans.com/gallery-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Japan isn't just the Land of the Rising Sun - it's a place where you can explore the latest and greatest technology, traditions that date back centuries, and artisan craftsmanship taken to its very highest levels.</p>

<p>In this episode of <em>Out Travel the System</em>, host  <strong>Nisreene Atassi</strong>  delves into the infinite possibilities of Japan with the help of  <strong>Rie Homura</strong> , Japan Area Manager for  <strong>Expedia</strong> , and Shayla Silva, a social media manager for  <strong>Expedia</strong>. </p>

<p>Take in their tips for how to start researching the many, many, many things you can do in Japan, when the time is right for you to travel. That includes where to stay, what to see, and how to save yourself some money - like the <a href="https://japanrailpass.net/en/about_jrp.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">JR Rail pass</a> specifically designed for tourists.</p>

<p>From cherry blossoms to hidden gem dining spots to when you can spot Godzilla, this episode of <em>Out Travel the System</em> takes a deep dive into your next dream vacation.</p>

<p>Here are a few more useful tips, right from  <strong>Nisreene's</strong>  desk:</p>

<p>-when using taxis, it can be helpful to have the exact address and phone number of your destination written down<br>
-it is not the usual custom to tip in restaurants<br>
-many places are strictly 'shoes off', so make sure you're wearing clean socks in good condition!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>Out Travel the System</em> is back for Season Two, bringing you the information that travelers both want and need right now.</p>

<p>In this first episode, we preview what's to come in the new season - including how to make the most of your travel budget - and the best way to plan for destinations like Hawaii and Japan. We're indulging in our love of food, whether it's how to travel like a foodie, or how to bring your favorite dishes home from your travels.</p>

<p>We're also taking the opportunity to answer some of your burning questions about previous travel plans that probably didn't turn out the way you had initially hoped for. Host  <strong>Nisreene Atassi</strong>  puts  <strong>Haytham Akremi</strong> , a customer experience manager at  <strong>Expedia</strong> , in the proverbial 'hot seat' about refunds and credits. They also look ahead to what travelers can research as they take advantage of some of the amazing travel deals currently out there.</p>
