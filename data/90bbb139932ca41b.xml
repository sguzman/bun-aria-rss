On our way out to this location which is about a half mile up a rail trail along side a big pond, we made sure to be noisy to alert any black bear that may be around. We made it to the spot which turns into a peninsula surrounded by water. We made sure there were no animals or anything in this little peninsula and walked in. We were quickly closed in by two things that sounded to be bipedal and heavy footed. We had a very bad feeling so we loudly yelled “ okay we are leaving”. As we approached the rail trail, the sound of those two things on either side of us run across the trail into the woods across the way. We made it to the trail and walked back toward the car but this whole time, we could hear one of them walking along side us in the tree line. This is where it gets even more strange. Two doe about 100 feet ahead of us hop out of the woods and wait for us on the trail and walked out with us as this thing was still along side us."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>John writes “January of 2017 I moved to Pikeville, Eastern Kentucky. The apartment complex I moved into was an old abandoned coal mine holler that had been converted which had an old coal road that went up a mountain and then swing around it with acre’s of woods.</p> <p>Well, whenever Id sit in the picnic area to have a cigarette id notice around 10+ at night this howling out in the nearby hills which now i can say sounded almost identical to the Ohio Sounds. I’d hear one howl and then maybe 30 seconds later there’d be another one from another hill that was maybe a mile or so away, and then I’d hear another, and another, and you could listen to these call and responses for hours without end. Well by April I was trying to get back into shape and I love to hike so I decided I’d get up around 6 am and hike up that coal road and back. As I’m hiking up and it got darker and darker up that road I noticed this strange bird whistling at me. It was strange because of how loud it was, and I mean the pitch was just so loud and I thought to myself, “that’s a big damn bird!” And I whistled back. Wes, my grandpa was a Green Beret in Vietnam who partly helped raise me, and I’ve been in the woods of Illinois and Wisconsin my whole life and never encountered much that was weird, although my Grandpa did and told me stories here and there, but I wasn’t afraid of much. Well, I’m hiking up and not only is that whistling getting closer, and I mean close to where it was like ten feet from me in the treeline of woods. I turned on the flash light on my phone and couldn’t see anything it was so dense. But then I noticed this “bird” was keeping pace with me.</p> <p>Then small pebbles started landing in front of me as I walked down. At first I thought it was just loose rock sliding down, but then it became apparent that something was tossing them right at my feet. At this point I’m about 300 feet up this old road in the pitch dark. So, I gently tossed one back, and then a big one, maybe 1/2 pound rock flung right at my feet. I froze man! Now, I gently yelled out, “is someone out there?” And that bird whistling started up even louder than it had before! Idk what overcame me, but I started belting out the St. Michael prayer in Latin and then the Hail Mary pretty audibly, and not wanting to turn back continued up that road. All of this whistling, keeping pace, and Pebble tossing just amped up as I was coming to a bend in the road that turned with the mountain. Idk what it was, but as I reach it with rosary in hand I got this bad bad feeling like something is really wrong here, and I spoke aloud and said, “idk what ya are, but im just walking here…” And the Pebble tossing got more intense and I could now hear “things” trudging through the wood at paces that I knew werent people. So I turned around and calmly began to go home. I thought that this could be bear or well hell a damn bigfoot. How loud the trudging was, combined with the whistling, and Pebble tossing I wanted to run the hell outta there down back into that holler, but if ya think that there’s an animal ya just don’t do that. And idk why, but something told me do not turn your back to them. So I’m trying to make it down while keeping an eye on what’s behind me, and the moments that I looked down the road towards the apartment complex something just leaped from the side of the mountain onto the road, and then down into a bunch of thicket. And I stopped and yelled, “what the fuck was that!” If it were a man he’d have fallen 400 feet down a vertical fall and broke his neck or something I mean it was steep! And covered in thicket and thorn bushes. And how loose the rocks were I mean if you did get a footing you’d just fall on your ass and slide and tumble down. Whatever this was got it’s footing and slid and trudged down with great volume like stomping through a huge snow drift. So there I am feeling like a fool the sun is begging to make the horizon pink up just a little at this point.</p> <p>I kept thinking to myself that this is not how I’m gonna die! By this point I felt with all of the noise that had to be five to eight things in the woods stalking me. Honest to God I knew that I was being followed and scrutinized and that I had pissed something off with my presence! The pebbles were being tossed at an alarming rate, there were by now eight or so “big birds” whistling at me from about ten or so feet in the woods, branches were snapping, and it was like multiple freight trains just trudging through those woods! This is a steep hill I mean it is steep I cannot imagine men being able to do this without falling down the only flat surface was the road. When I got about 100 feet down before the apartment idk what overcame me but something told me to just book it for the farm lamp and I ran like hell until I got to it spun around. I stood there watching and couldn’t see anything! They had stayed up there, but were still just making all sorts of noise.<br /> <br /> Idk what I started, but after that I felt like I was being watched whenever I was outside in that holler. If I went outside my apartment by my car to smoke pebbles would start getting tossed right at my feet in the parking lot from a mountain side, or a big bird would start whistling at me. And we had huge street lights shinning onto our parking lot. And as this is happening I’d take out a big old flashlight and shine into the woods. I did get eye shine a couple of times, but couldn’t make out faces of what they were which just creeped me out to no end. I went up the mountains couple of times in the day and found what appeared to be tree breaks, a couple of structures, sticks in the road. Now idk, these sticks were just laid ever so carefully in the road. What creeped me out was that they’d appear when I was coming back down. On one hike, idk I got dizzy on the way home. Now I do have epilepsy, but this was different. I’m hiking down the road and suddenly I got dizzy, the sound in my ears was like tv static, and I wanted to take my shirt off because I felt so hot, but I laid down in the dirt ditch for a few minutes and just felt drained of everything I just thought of my mother and picked myself up and forced myself down that road. When I got home I just collapsed in bed and slept for a good six hours. Now I think looking back that that was side effects of infrasound.</p> <p>But then one night my roommate and I went out to one of the picnic areas to smoke and talk and as we’re making it back toward my building idk Wes the ground shook to the point I felt like I’d lost my footing like a giant was stomping in front of us BOOM BOOM BOOM and let out this scream I’ve never heard before or since it was like a woman mixed with a bear, a lion, and a witch all in one terrifying scream idk, but I JUMPED like three feet up and just ran up a picnic table and I could not look at it! We were stuck in that parking lot until the sun came up! Everytime we even made an attempt towards my building it would scream and we couldn’t find it, couldn’t see it! We had the sensation that it was behind this old 100+ year old white oak tree, but we made five attempts to go home and it was not having it. But when the sun began to rise we made our sixth attempt and then heard something just trudge up that mountain side in time that no man or woman could! I’m talking a 100 foot vertical hike that this thing scaled in seconds and just kept going until we saw trees moving at about 500 feet up. We never went that far out at night again and that was a lighted parking lot/picnic area in the middle of an apartment complex. After that I’d smoked at night at the door dealt with the whistling and Pebble tossing give it the finger and go inside. I moved to Louisville in June and never went back! I’m not afraid of the woods or anything, but I definitely will never go in them again without a 30-30 or something bigger!</p> <p>The power just in the lungs of this thing it could have killed us if it had wanted to! I ldk what we did that night; we weren’t messing up in the woods or nothing and I feel like I was being stalked for having gone up there, but over residents went up there, but not at night. I have a deeper respect, appreciation of the mountains and the woods. Since all of this the guns I have and carry with me in the woods are enough to take down a bear, but yeah, like I said I will never go in the woods unarmed again.”</p> <p><a href= "https://sasquatchchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/STALKED.jpg"> <img class="alignnone wp-image-215826" src= "https://sasquatchchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/STALKED-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="462" /></a></p> <p> </p> <p>I will also be speaking to Brian. Brian said “I was stationed at Ft. Lewis in Washington state. We were running a training exercise and we saw what we thought was someone in a ghillie suit. This made no sense since we all had the same equipment and there was not any snipers present. This “guy” was huge he was about 7 foot tall, I am 6’4. I did not know anyone in my unit that big. We decided to track it and find who is was. That is when it stood up. I thought it was 7 foot tall but it was crouched. When it stood up it was closer to 9 feet. Five of us saw it that night.”</p> <p> </p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John writes “January of 2017 I moved to Pikeville, Eastern Kentucky. The apartment complex I moved into was an old abandoned coal mine holler that had been converted which had an old coal road that went up a mountain and then swing around it with acre’s of woods.</p> <p>Well, whenever Id sit in the picnic area to have a cigarette id notice around 10+ at night this howling out in the nearby hills which now i can say sounded almost identical to the Ohio Sounds. I’d hear one howl and then maybe 30 seconds later there’d be another one from another hill that was maybe a mile or so away, and then I’d hear another, and another, and you could listen to these call and responses for hours without end. Well by April I was trying to get back into shape and I love to hike so I decided I’d get up around 6 am and hike up that coal road and back. As I’m hiking up and it got darker and darker up that road I noticed this strange bird whistling at me. It was strange because of how loud it was, and I mean the pitch was just so loud and I thought to myself, “that’s a big damn bird!” And I whistled back. Wes, my grandpa was a Green Beret in Vietnam who partly helped raise me, and I’ve been in the woods of Illinois and Wisconsin my whole life and never encountered much that was weird, although my Grandpa did and told me stories here and there, but I wasn’t afraid of much. Well, I’m hiking up and not only is that whistling getting closer, and I mean close to where it was like ten feet from me in the treeline of woods. I turned on the flash light on my phone and couldn’t see anything it was so dense. But then I noticed this “bird” was keeping pace with me.</p> <p>Then small pebbles started landing in front of me as I walked down. At first I thought it was just loose rock sliding down, but then it became apparent that something was tossing them right at my feet. At this point I’m about 300 feet up this old road in the pitch dark. So, I gently tossed one back, and then a big one, maybe 1/2 pound rock flung right at my feet. I froze man! Now, I gently yelled out, “is someone out there?” And that bird whistling started up even louder than it had before! Idk what overcame me, but I started belting out the St. Michael prayer in Latin and then the Hail Mary pretty audibly, and not wanting to turn back continued up that road. All of this whistling, keeping pace, and Pebble tossing just amped up as I was coming to a bend in the road that turned with the mountain. Idk what it was, but as I reach it with rosary in hand I got this bad bad feeling like something is really wrong here, and I spoke aloud and said, “idk what ya are, but im just walking here…” And the Pebble tossing got more intense and I could now hear “things” trudging through the wood at paces that I knew werent people. So I turned around and calmly began to go home. I thought that this could be bear or well hell a damn bigfoot. How loud the trudging was, combined with the whistling, and Pebble tossing I wanted to run the hell outta there down back into that holler, but if ya think that there’s an animal ya just don’t do that. And idk why, but something told me do not turn your back to them. So I’m trying to make it down while keeping an eye on what’s behind me, and the moments that I looked down the road towards the apartment complex something just leaped from the side of the mountain onto the road, and then down into a bunch of thicket. And I stopped and yelled, “what the fuck was that!” If it were a man he’d have fallen 400 feet down a vertical fall and broke his neck or something I mean it was steep! And covered in thicket and thorn bushes. And how loose the rocks were I mean if you did get a footing you’d just fall on your ass and slide and tumble down. Whatever this was got it’s footing and slid and trudged down with great volume like stomping through a huge snow drift. So there I am feeling like a fool the sun is begging to make the horizon pink up just a little at this point.</p> <p>I kept thinking to myself that this is not how I’m gonna die! By this point I felt with all of the noise that had to be five to eight things in the woods stalking me. Honest to God I knew that I was being followed and scrutinized and that I had pissed something off with my presence! The pebbles were being tossed at an alarming rate, there were by now eight or so “big birds” whistling at me from about ten or so feet in the woods, branches were snapping, and it was like multiple freight trains just trudging through those woods! This is a steep hill I mean it is steep I cannot imagine men being able to do this without falling down the only flat surface was the road. When I got about 100 feet down before the apartment idk what overcame me but something told me to just book it for the farm lamp and I ran like hell until I got to it spun around. I stood there watching and couldn’t see anything! They had stayed up there, but were still just making all sorts of noise.  Idk what I started, but after that I felt like I was being watched whenever I was outside in that holler. If I went outside my apartment by my car to smoke pebbles would start getting tossed right at my feet in the parking lot from a mountain side, or a big bird would start whistling at me. And we had huge street lights shinning onto our parking lot. And as this is happening I’d take out a big old flashlight and shine into the woods. I did get eye shine a couple of times, but couldn’t make out faces of what they were which just creeped me out to no end. I went up the mountains couple of times in the day and found what appeared to be tree breaks, a couple of structures, sticks in the road. Now idk, these sticks were just laid ever so carefully in the road. What creeped me out was that they’d appear when I was coming back down. On one hike, idk I got dizzy on the way home. Now I do have epilepsy, but this was different. I’m hiking down the road and suddenly I got dizzy, the sound in my ears was like tv static, and I wanted to take my shirt off because I felt so hot, but I laid down in the dirt ditch for a few minutes and just felt drained of everything I just thought of my mother and picked myself up and forced myself down that road. When I got home I just collapsed in bed and slept for a good six hours. Now I think looking back that that was side effects of infrasound.</p> <p>But then one night my roommate and I went out to one of the picnic areas to smoke and talk and as we’re making it back toward my building idk Wes the ground shook to the point I felt like I’d lost my footing like a giant was stomping in front of us BOOM BOOM BOOM and let out this scream I’ve never heard before or since it was like a woman mixed with a bear, a lion, and a witch all in one terrifying scream idk, but I JUMPED like three feet up and just ran up a picnic table and I could not look at it! We were stuck in that parking lot until the sun came up! Everytime we even made an attempt towards my building it would scream and we couldn’t find it, couldn’t see it! We had the sensation that it was behind this old 100+ year old white oak tree, but we made five attempts to go home and it was not having it. But when the sun began to rise we made our sixth attempt and then heard something just trudge up that mountain side in time that no man or woman could! I’m talking a 100 foot vertical hike that this thing scaled in seconds and just kept going until we saw trees moving at about 500 feet up. We never went that far out at night again and that was a lighted parking lot/picnic area in the middle of an apartment complex. After that I’d smoked at night at the door dealt with the whistling and Pebble tossing give it the finger and go inside. I moved to Louisville in June and never went back! I’m not afraid of the woods or anything, but I definitely will never go in them again without a 30-30 or something bigger!</p> <p>The power just in the lungs of this thing it could have killed us if it had wanted to! I ldk what we did that night; we weren’t messing up in the woods or nothing and I feel like I was being stalked for having gone up there, but over residents went up there, but not at night. I have a deeper respect, appreciation of the mountains and the woods. Since all of this the guns I have and carry with me in the woods are enough to take down a bear, but yeah, like I said I will never go in the woods unarmed again.”</p> <p><a href= "https://sasquatchchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/STALKED.jpg"> </a></p> <p> </p> <p>I will also be speaking to Brian.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Next week I will be traveling but I am going to pack my equipment and do some interviews. I am also going to try to do some video production.</p> <p>I am packing up for PhenomeCon. If you are going to be in Vernal Utah next week stop by and say hi. Tonight I will be posting a rewind one of my favorites. Something Out Of A Nightmare</p> <p>Bill writes “I was 15 it was second day of buck season. It was around 7am. It was snowing so the sun wasnt out full like usual. I heard what sounded to me like a damn bull running through the thickets. There was a deer run just next to it. My stand was about 25-30 yards from where the deer run shot through the thickets. I had clear shots all around. Our stands were built 360 around two giant oak trees.</p> <p>Anyway I was seriously waiting to see a damn brama bull come plowing through this scrub. So I sat on the bench up there and figured whatever it is my chance of getting a buck were gone for next few hours. So I leaned back against the tree and put my 30.06 across my lap. My dad insisted we always loaded heavy with hollow points. My dad reloaded all out ammo. I’m not sure what grain he used in the shells. But I know you couldn’t buy them with that much grain powder in them.</p> <p>Anyway. All sudden everything just goes silent. You know that Erie silence you hear when it is snowing. Like the snow absorbers all sound. No more birds, squirrels, nothing there was no sound. Lime mother nature hit the mute button. Then I saw movement. It was about 6 doe trying to sneak by. When they got near the thicket my jaw dropped. These doe jumped straight up in the air! And there legs were running in mid air as well. 4 doe sprinted away when the hoofs hit the ground. But what exploded out of the thorny thicket was these two massive BFs they were on top of these does in milliseconds grabbed them by the throats and snapped the does necks as if they were breaking twigs! These monsters were both reddish brown. Their faces were something out of nightmares. I froze. Did not move a muscle. I just watch as they threw these does probably about 150 pounds each over there should like I would have my book bag from school. And then they walked right under my stand. And stopped. Then what happened next it was all I could do not to piss myself. From right under me came this Unholy roar. That seemed to go on forever. The tree stand was vibrating from the sound waves. Then when the roast stopped, I heard the other go like humph!! And then they walked away with their prize over there shoulder. As they walked I watched them and it was if the trees swallowed them up and they were gone.</p> <p>Next I heard running towards my stand, but it wasnt heavy. It was my dad. He ran to me when he heard the roar. He was running towards me with the intent to shoot anything to save me. My dad did three tours in Vietnam. He was running as if he was going into battle. I didnt recognize it when I was 15, but after my training in the Navy. I was a Navy Corpsman with 2nd Marine recon battalion out of camp legune NC.</p> <p>When I saw there faces I became terrified because it triggered a memory from when I was like 5 or six. And something with that sinister face and teeth would stare through the window in my bedroom of that cabin. I was to terrified to run to my dad. I couldn’t even speak. I was frozen in fear. My mind must have blocked it out, until I saw them that day when I was 15.</p> <p>My dad had to climb up to me in the tree stand and assist me down the tree. It was if my brain locked every muscle in my body. I couldn’t even speak for about 10 minutes or so. I was in shock. That roar right under me sent a fear through every fiber in my mind body and soul.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to John. John writes “I am a Registered Nurse at the hospital here in town. My encounter happened on approximately November 17, 2020.</p> <p>As Covid was in full swing many of us had to take our turns working on the Covid unit. My home unit had high risk patients so I was being swabbed twice a week to try and prevent Covid from coming onto that floor. Prior to leaving work on Tuesday morning, the 17th, I was swabbed for Covid prior to going home with the plan to come back to work that evening at 7 PM. As I was ready to leave for work that evening I received a phone call from the hospital. I was told I could not come to work because my Covid swab from that morning came back positive and I would need to quarantine for the next 7 days. My problem was that my Father-in-law, who would be considered high risk if he contracted the virus, was staying at our home during that time. My wife and he were not in the house when I found out I had the virus so I formulated a plan and called her. The plan was that I would get out of the house and go quarantine at our cabin at Rough River Lake, KY. She brought my Father-in-law home and met me in the parking lot at the grocery store. I waited out in the parking lot in my pickup while she went in and bought enough groceries to last me during my quarantine and came out to my pickup and she put the groceries in my tool box so we had no contact.</p> <p>The next morning, my wife and Father-in-law went and got tested and were negative- thank goodness because I would have been the one to have given it to them and I did not want to have harmed them. The Drive from Owensboro to the lake was about 56 miles and it was really dark that night. I remember seeing only a sliver of the moon earlier, but by 9 pm or so when I made my drive it was just really dark with no moonlight that I could see. On the way up to the lake I had the radio off (it is usually on) as I was deep in thought about the whole situation. As I drove on I came to realize that my biggest fear would be laid to rest one way or the other in the morning when my wife and Father-in-law would be tested for the virus. I then thought about how I could actually make the most of the quarantine by calling people I hadn’t spoken to in a while and working on my book which I was working on at the time and has been published since.</p> <p>The route I take to the lake once I get through Owensboro is Highway 54 east for roughly 25 miles. When I got through the small town of Fordsville, I turned left to go North on 261. This is an 11 mile stretch to get to a junction called McQuady where I would turn right on 105 south to take the rest of the way to the lake. Ten miles in on the aforementioned 11 mile stretch is where I had my encounter. I had been deep in thought coming through the dark, wooded area. I came to an area that had a row of trees along the road to the left coming off a ravine. When I passed the end of that there was a second ravine with trees about 30 yards back that came to an end roughly 100 yards farther than the closer ravine. What initially caught my attention was the yellowish/white eye shine of a deer off to the right side of the road. I started to slow up as this really nice white tail buck walked right onto the road in front of me and just stopped in the middle of the road. He was not looking at me and paid no attention to me coming toward him! He was gazing to the left side of the road toward the end of the second tree row/ravine I mentioned. As I got within about 20 yards of this deer and had almost come to a stop, I looked over toward where the deer was watching. You know how your car headlights cast light off to the left and right of the vehicle?</p> <p>Well, in that cast off light I picked up what I would describe as very large orange eye shine, about 4 feet off the ground near the end of this stand of trees. It was coming from the back side of the trees around the tip or end of the tree stand, so It was facing me at about 9 o’clock position when I picked up the eye shine. I can only describe that I saw a dark creature, moving like a spider but about 4 feet off the ground, with a large head with eyes almost as large as silver dollars around 6 or 7 inches apart that shined orange. When I looked back at the deer standing on the road before me, it suddenly took off in the direction it was facing into open field. I then saw this spider creature turn toward the running deer and started to quickly move toward it. That’s when I about dropped a biscuit as this thing rose up onto 2 feet in fluid motion to take flight after the deer! I rolled my window down to see if I could smell anything which I did not, but I heard in the trees to the right side of the road, where the deer had initially come, what sounded like a large branch breaking, so I hit the gas and got the heck out of there.</p> <p>I feel that there was a creature on the right side of the road in the woods that pushed this deer toward another creature at an ambush point and I came along at the wrong time. As fast as this thing took off, in an open field, I have no doubt it would catch up to the buck.”</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to John. John writes “I am a Registered Nurse at the hospital here in town. My encounter happened on approximately November 17, 2020.</p> <p>As Covid was in full swing many of us had to take our turns working on the Covid unit. My home unit had high risk patients so I was being swabbed twice a week to try and prevent Covid from coming onto that floor. Prior to leaving work on Tuesday morning, the 17th, I was swabbed for Covid prior to going home with the plan to come back to work that evening at 7 PM. As I was ready to leave for work that evening I received a phone call from the hospital. I was told I could not come to work because my Covid swab from that morning came back positive and I would need to quarantine for the next 7 days. My problem was that my Father-in-law, who would be considered high risk if he contracted the virus, was staying at our home during that time. My wife and he were not in the house when I found out I had the virus so I formulated a plan and called her. The plan was that I would get out of the house and go quarantine at our cabin at Rough River Lake, KY. She brought my Father-in-law home and met me in the parking lot at the grocery store. I waited out in the parking lot in my pickup while she went in and bought enough groceries to last me during my quarantine and came out to my pickup and she put the groceries in my tool box so we had no contact.</p> <p>The next morning, my wife and Father-in-law went and got tested and were negative- thank goodness because I would have been the one to have given it to them and I did not want to have harmed them. The Drive from Owensboro to the lake was about 56 miles and it was really dark that night. I remember seeing only a sliver of the moon earlier, but by 9 pm or so when I made my drive it was just really dark with no moonlight that I could see. On the way up to the lake I had the radio off (it is usually on) as I was deep in thought about the whole situation. As I drove on I came to realize that my biggest fear would be laid to rest one way or the other in the morning when my wife and Father-in-law would be tested for the virus. I then thought about how I could actually make the most of the quarantine by calling people I hadn’t spoken to in a while and working on my book which I was working on at the time and has been published since.</p> <p>The route I take to the lake once I get through Owensboro is Highway 54 east for roughly 25 miles. When I got through the small town of Fordsville, I turned left to go North on 261. This is an 11 mile stretch to get to a junction called McQuady where I would turn right on 105 south to take the rest of the way to the lake. Ten miles in on the aforementioned 11 mile stretch is where I had my encounter. I had been deep in thought coming through the dark, wooded area. I came to an area that had a row of trees along the road to the left coming off a ravine. When I passed the end of that there was a second ravine with trees about 30 yards back that came to an end roughly 100 yards farther than the closer ravine. What initially caught my attention was the yellowish/white eye shine of a deer off to the right side of the road. I started to slow up as this really nice white tail buck walked right onto the road in front of me and just stopped in the middle of the road. He was not looking at me and paid no attention to me coming toward him! He was gazing to the left side of the road toward the end of the second tree row/ravine I mentioned. As I got within about 20 yards of this deer and had almost come to a stop, I looked over toward where the deer was watching. You know how your car headlights cast light off to the left and right of the vehicle?</p> <p>Well, in that cast off light I picked up what I would describe as very large orange eye shine, about 4 feet off the ground near the end of this stand of trees. It was coming from the back side of the trees around the tip or end of the tree stand, so It was facing me at about 9 o’clock position when I picked up the eye shine. I can only describe that I saw a dark creature, moving like a spider but about 4 feet off the ground, with a large head with eyes almost as large as silver dollars around 6 or 7 inches apart that shined orange. When I looked back at the deer standing on the road before me, it suddenly took off in the direction it was facing into open field.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Nate writes "We decided to go night fishing for catfish in the Kern River canyon because it was too hot during the day. I decided not to go too deep into the canyon but to the first or second campground off the 178hwy. We arrived to lower richbar around 12:30am just after midnight. All three of us were armed, just for protection like we always do. Haul our fishing gear and started fishing with chicken liver as bait. By 1:30am we caught at least 6 catfish in a stringer.</p> <p>We were happy that we didn’t really had to use the flashlight since the moon was out. As we were talking, we heard this roar. Roar so loud that we felt instant fear as it vibrate through our chest. I have heard many animals nothing like this. Then we all noticed across the river by a tree, this thing stood up, all black, tall 9-10ft, muscular. We all froze. It proceeded to push the tree next to it into the river.</p> <p>The tree snapped and echo throughout the canyon. I grabbed my knife and cut my fishing line. My friend and brother also in a hurry brought their poles to cut our lines. As I’m finishing up with that, it jumped into the river and was swimming (more like walking through the water) towards us. At that moment, I drop the poles, pulled out my gun, and keys. Told the guys to run to the car. Understand that this river, Kern River, have killed many people, trying to swim across or drowned. We all ran to the car with left our poles, the fish and stringer, and tackle box. Running in fear to the Lexus and drove off. I must’ve been going 70mph. After a couple miles we came out of the canyons towards Bakersfield, I slowed down, and utter the first words. Wtf was that? We were in shock but asking that it snap the guys back. My friend said the .45 wouldn’t do a thing to it. We laugh but we’re all still in shock, how big it was, how it was swimming through those rapids, like it was in a indoor swimming pool.</p> <p>Like the river current wasn’t an obstacle to get across. It shook all of us. Let me know if you like to hear the second story.”</p>]]></description>

The road dips into a shallow valley where Buck Creek runs through it. And crosses and set of railroad tracks before heading up the other side. I crossed the tracks and started up the other side. As I crested the top I noticed eye shine. Not yellow like racoon or like deer. This was different and had my attention. As I got closer I noticed a dark shape in the bushes. This is a gravel road. And I was only doing around 15 mph. These eyes where a lime green in the headlights.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Rick returns for part two as we deep dive into Sasquatch, UFO’s and the Paranormal. Timothy Renner from Strange Familiars Podcast joins the discussion. Are there correlations or coincidences?</p> <p>Rick writes “I’m a regular listener to your podcast and find it very informative. On one of your recent shows, I believe you mentioned getting a Ufologist, Paranormal Researcher, and Cryptid Investigator together in order to compare notes on the potential similarities/ connections within all three fields.</p> <p>During my tenure with MUFON, I investigated many sightings to include the abduction phenomenon. I found that many of those cases had elements of the paranormal associated with them, which intrigued me. I then began investigating the paranormal with the Center for Paranormal Research and Investigation (CPRI), also in Virginia. I’ve investigated many cases. Some involved negative entities or the “demonic”. One of these cases was featured on an episode of “A Haunting” entitled “Mark of Evil”. That was a rather serious/ horrific case that changed my life dramatically.</p> <p>I’m still with that organization. However, my wife and I also started the Virginia chapter of the North American Dogman Project (NADP). We’ve been investigating Dogman/ cryptid cases for the past five years. During my research, I’ve seen some cases that have “crossover elements” to them.”</p>]]></description>

Approximately 2 miles in on foot a large rock landed directly between my friend and I.</p> <p>We both looked at each other thinking the same thing, someone is messing with us. However the we also thought the other unnerving thing, no one knows we’re here and no one is anywhere close. Approximately 30 minutes later and about another mile in I caught the second rock in mid air out of my periphery before it hit.</p> <p>I immediately turned my head in the direction I thought it came and there that big bastard was. Only 70-80 feet away, no more than 30 yards."</p>]]></description>

SC EP:820 I Thought I Shot A Man Spoke to the eyewitness and he said “In 1981 I was in North Louisiana and I came across this creature. He came from around a tree that was about 6 feet from me and we stared at each other.</p> <p>I wasn’t sure what it was but I could tell by his facial expressions he was mad and working himself up to attack me. I shot it and I know it was a lung shot. I could describe every detail about him. This has weighed on me for the last 40 years, I have only told one person about it. It bothers me that I shot but from the way it was acting I thought it was him or me.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dianne writes "As it came closer it stopped right behind the wood line. I could see the massiveness of this creature. It had to be over 9' tall and shoulders 4' across. I could only see parts of it. It seemed to know it was obscured by the trees. I could see the torso area of shiny black hair. At that point I lost my nerve to keep looking and frankly if I would have seen it's face I probably would have had a heart attack. My body went into what I've coined LIQUID TERROR. My insides felt like jello. I decided to pretend everything was just ok and with shaking hands I started beading again. It actually helped me calm down but IT WOULDN'T LEAVE. I thought if I ignore it it will go away. No such luck."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tim writes“My first encounter happened in the state of Vermont. Between Clarendon and Tinmouth. My father was with me. And we was deer hunting. To start from the beginning.</p> <p>My father was a minister and he had started a church in Rutland. We had a family that had started coming on a regular basis. And it was almost rifle season and we didn’t really have a place to go. So in conversation with this family and my father, we got invited to go out to there farm. This would be my first hunt. Like I said, we didn’t really know where to go. But the man told my father that they had deer on there property and if we wanted to go, we were more than welcome to hunt there. I was excited since this would be my first time hunting and my dad was going to let me use my aunt’s old rifle. She was short and the butt of the stock had been cut so she could shoulder it. I had shot it before. And I could shoot it quite well. It was a Winchester model 54 and chambered in a 30-06 caliber. My dad was using a ruger chambered in a 7mm Magnum. We got up early that morning.</p> <p>It was November and cold. We left our house early because dad wanted to get out and get settled in before it got to light out and things had time to get quiet. We got out to the property, found the barbed wire gate and dad got out opened the gate and drove the truck in and closed the gate behind us. There was what we called a two track road that we could drive on. It had grass in the middle of it and we drove a ways in and found a place where we could get the truck off so the man if need be could get by if he chose to come out. Vermont is mountainous and rocky and lots of ridges and ravines. We got out threw on some warm insulated hunting clothes on and loaded up and started walking up and over ridges. Dad as we walked said that the highest ridge would give us the best advantage to see. By the time we reached the ledge of the highest ridge daylight was breaking. Dad pointed out a huge sugar maple that would be good to sit up against and I made my way to it. Dad said that he would go down farther on the ledge and still be within eye sight if I needed him. I cleared the leaves where i was going to sit at up against the trunk of the tree so if I needed to move , I could without any noise. The mountain was still behind me and it was steep so I was expecting deer to feed among the ridges and ravines for acorns. I bunched my knee’s up against my chest so I could use them as a steady rest. It wasn’t long and I could hear something coming down from behind me and it was coming fast. 4 does came full tilt running and ran down the ledge I was sitting on and they never stopped.</p> <p>They ran through some spruce tree’s and was out of sight. It wasn’t long and something else was coming down from behind me and it was coming fast. Now Wes, I noticed just from feeling the ground with the steps it was taking that this wasn’t deer. I literally froze , and didn’t move a muscle. Whatever it was , was behind the tree I was leaning against. From this point on. Things went into very slow motion. I heard what sounded like a nut hatch bird sounded like on the side of the tree. I heard dirt or bark hitting on my left shoulder. Moving my head extremely slow a looking up and over my left shoulder was a HUGE and dirty hand. This hand had enormous fingers. If I was to compare the size of the diameter of the fingers I would have to say that they were as big around as the packaged eckrich sausage is that you see in the grocery store meat coolers. They were extremely dirty and a dark grayish black in color hair on top of the back of the hand that wasn’t really thick hair because you could still see the skin. From where my head was I’d have to say that the hand was every bit of 5ft above me. I seen breath as it was breathing as it plumed out from behind me. I literally lost all bodily functions. I soiled my pants as well as wet myself. It emitted a very low but vibrating growl. I don’t know if you have ever heard alligators during the breeding season where they do a low growl and the water literally vibrates off there backs in the water. But it was very similar. I could feel it inside myself. It then took off down the ledge where the deer went. It moved with such a speed that you cannot comprehend. The hair looked black at the base and where it was longer it looked almost a deep brownish red. It was every bit of 9ft tall and the shoulder width was massive. Probably 4 and a half to maybe 5ft .the hair on the back where the shoulder blades are located looked longer in length. And it had mud matted in the hair wherever it had been sitting. I never at one time thought about the rifle that I had in my hands. After it took off my Dad came running over to me and asked me if I was ok. He said that he would have shot it but was literally afraid that if he did then it would have probably killed me. We cautiously made our way back to the truck. Which wasn’t easy with the way my pants was.</p> <p>I vomited before I got into the truck and we left. We got to the gate opened it and closed it and never returned to the location. I was shaking violently on our way home. We pulled into the driveway and dad shut the truck off and told me. Don’t you ever talk about what had just happened. We would be ridiculed in town and school for me. This happened in 1979. I just told my wife whom I’ve been married to for 26 years. This encounter has given me a paranoia every time I’m around woods or I’m outside in the dark.” </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Robert writes “I had encounters in the Daniel Boone National Forest in the 90’s. I think it’s still a hotspot but most people won’t talk about it. Most of my encounters were brief except for one.</p> <p>I had a bear walking towards me and one came running down the mountain and actually chased the bear off. I was walking back down a gravel road as my car was broke down. It actually jumped into the road, slid in the gravel before coming to a complete stop. Turned towards me and bluff charged me twice to push me out of the area. It was 7.5 to 8 fat tall, browns oh red with white hair which made me think it was an older one. Right before it turned towards me I could see it looked like it had “road rash” on the back of its left shoulder.</p> <p>You could see it had hair missing as it looked scabbed over. Kind of like the aftermath of sliding in gravel while wearing shorts for us. There are a lot more details about that encounter but too many to type up.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A little Holiday show for everyone. On 20 December 1943, Franz met the B-17 bomber named "Ye Olde Pub" and its pilot Charles "Charlie" Brown for the first time. Franz had shot down two B-17s earlier that day and he soon caught up to a wounded B-17 flown by Charles Brown.</p> <p>Lining up to finish the bomber and shoot it down, he noticed the tail gunner never moved the guns. Upon further inspection of the airplane, he saw through large holes in the fuselage a frantic crew trying to save the lives of their fellow airmen.</p> <p>Franz is quoted as saying "and for me it would have been the same as shooting at a parachute", in reference to a statement by his commander and mentor Gustav Rödel; "If I hear of one of you shooting a man in a parachute, I'll shoot you myself!". Stigler motioned to Brown to land his airplane in neutral Sweden because of the extensive damage. However, Brown didn't understand, and decided to keep flying towards England. Stigler escorted the B-17 and its crew to the North Sea coast, protecting it from German anti-aircraft gunners.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Deep in the darkest heart of the Philippines sits a terrifying creature. As night falls it begins the hunt for human blood, stalking its prey in the shadows of your town, neighborhood and even your own home.</p> <p>Its tongue drips in hunger, emitting a tick-tick-ticking noise from the vast darkness. This is the aswang, the most feared creature in Philippine folklore.</p> <p>According to Philippine folklore, an aswang is an evil, shapeshifting creature that shares the grotesque characteristics of werewolves, vampires and ghouls. It has no consistent image or description because its appearance varies per region. People have often characterised them based on hearsay, which is why the term aswang has commonly been used as a catch-all description for most evil creatures that lurk in the night.</p> <p>But sometimes….things are not quite as they appear.</p> <p>“To the superstitious, the Huk battleground was a haunted place filled with ghosts and eerie creatures.” -Air Force Brigadier General Edward G.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 2005, I had moved back home. So had my friends Ryan and Kelly. The 3 of us grew up in the same cul de sac with each of our houses being one house apart. Kelly had just finished college and me and Ryan just needed to move home for whatever reason. We were all about 23 or 24 years old. One day, I believe it was in August, we were out playing softball with some friends at the local high school. Kelly’s girlfriend helped couch the team so she had a key to the fields. When we had finished, we were all going to go home, clean up, and then meet back up with everyone at Applebee’s. Since Ryan, Kelly, and I lived in the same cul de sac we had driven together. When we got home, Kelly went to his house, but me and Ryan went to Ryan’s house to have a beer and smoke a cigarette. We’re sitting on his back patio just hanging out when Kelly calls to see if we were ready to head out. We told him we had been chilling having a drink. He came up to join us. (We we’re not drunk or on any drugs during this. We had 1 beer and we’re smoking cigarettes).</p> <p>Ryan’s back yard is where this happened. His back yard has a concrete patio directly out from the kitchen. It’s on ground level. Extending along the back of the house from the patio is a concrete basketball court with a hoop at the far end. His yard is completely fenced off and the gate was closed. The yard itself goes slightly up hill from the patio/basketball court with a shed in the corner of the yard. There are flowers lining the fence. They had been doing yard work so there were various tools around. There was a wheelbarrow lying on its side under the hoop and a shovel leaning against the house near the kitchen door. On the patio was a patio table which is where we were sitting. Kelly sat with his back to the basketball hoop, Ryan was to Kelly’s left, so his right side was to the hoop facing the shed, and I sat to Ryan’s left directly facing the basketball hoop.</p> <p>As we sat there talking, the sun was going down. We didn’t have any lights on except for the light coming out from the kitchen. There was a faint light from that pre dusk just before the sun sets.</p> <p>This is where things start getting weird. So, as we’re sitting there I notice that there is these lights up in the top of the evergreen trees behind the shed. It looked like someone had two flashlights and was moving them in circles next to each other. Those trees are pretty tall. I pointed it out to the other two. It was weird enough to take note of, but we were just like, that’s weird, but whatever. Not weird enough to freak us out or anything. Then, like 2 minutes later, from behind the wheelbarrow crawled this creature. I was facing towards it so I pointed and was like, “What the f*** is that?!?” This creature looked at me with as much surprise as I had. I looked at this thing in the face. Next, it took off running fast up the hill, and it sounded like a horse of a race track. Like it was heavy. It ran hand over feed and it was booking it up the hill and then it jumped OVER THE SHED into the trees where the lights had been shining.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Wade will be my guest tonight. Wade writes "The childhood experiences with my 5 sisters and 1 brother all older have being horrifying to all of us when we lived in Rainier Oregon. Dad was a pipe fitter and worked on a new nuke plant there. Mom was a stepford wife so to speak. Not long after we moved there odd things happened..no one could explain..starting with the 3 other houses that no one came out at night.</p> <p>Animals disappeared and or twisted and put in trees. Lots of foot prints. The lumberjacks dad hired kept leaving. The well drillers pulled off twice. And then it got way worse. Bangs on the house, broken windows. We think there were 5 for sure....they all looked different and had NO fear of us. This was over a 3 year span. It had a life long no BS effect on the family. I talked to my older family about Rainer and it was way worse than could 10 year old to grasp. I went back there 2 years ago. It continues to this that day. It's hard to piece together so so many things over the years. There were a hell of a lot of stuff people knew back then. And we were warned by the very old couple dad bought the land from."</p>]]></description>

A listener writes “Hey everyone, So, I wanted to share my video with y’all , that I took a few Saturdays ago on 7/24. <p>First of all, I wanted to tell you a little about myself. I’m a pastor of a small country church for the past 15 years and I’m also the lead vocalist for a Christian rock band called: Stained Red.</p> <p>I live in Royse City Texas and The morning of the sighting was very hot and dry and I was basically just outside early in the morning sipping my coffee about to go in my prayer room, when I noticed a couple fields over from my farm something moving very quickly to the North.</p> <p>So, I thank God that I grabbed my phone and began to video this creature. I also noticed that it had a white tail doe on its back. ( I did have my phone on zoom) But notice how quickly it crosses the fence, which I measured at 48”, but no hair to be found , and the ground was to hard and grassy for any foot prints.</p> <p>The grass was 3’ at fence line, but it was still moving very gracefully. I couldn’t get any closer when I was filming because I was already against my fence line to my prayer room. And honestly I was a little scared to go down and look for it, not knowing if it had babies down in trees that it might try to protect.</p> <p>Tell me what you think, your friend IronMan of Stained Red . I would believe that it was about 7.5’ tall easy and very heavy. God bless you all!!!”</p> <p>It will be uploaded to the podcast players shortly.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight we will be chatting with Nick who is currently serving in the United States military. He is going to share with us his experience while training at Fort Polk.</p> <p>Nick said “It was a strange night and I wasn’t the only person to experience this thing, whatever it is. I have also seen the lights on Fort Polk. There is a term that is used among solders and we call it the box witch.” The term has nothing to do with a witch but Nick will explain why they call it that.</p> <p>Nick said I’ve started a side project of collecting Soldiers stories, specifically what they’ve experienced with “not normal.” It’s on Instagram @Tales_From_The_Gridsquare.”</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>]]></description>

Approximately 3:00 a.m. I woke up with a bad stomach ache (probably from all the s'mores I gorge myself on) and was outside of the tent and stoked the fire back up when about 10 mins later I heard some swishing in the water as if somebody was walking in knee deep water against the current, it came up to within approximately 20 ft of me but did not come onto The Sandbar but stopped short to reach down and grabbed one of the two fish baskets and lifted its head up looked at me as if to say "I'm taking these fish, please and thank you" then walked back downstream with the basket of fish and I had no idea where it went after getting out of site of the fire glow. I got no ill intent from it, I was freaked out but not in a scared way.</p> <p>Told my dad about it when he got up..and he told keep quiet about it until we could be alone and talk openly.. which we did 2 days later.</p> <p>I have had one other siding which was a fleeting glimpse of a Sasquatch running back into the woods from the edge of a field, and have had two or three other weird experiences that later in life I've come to a tribute to Sasquatch experiences."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>John writes "I stepped out of my tent and turned on my spot light and Wes I’ll be honest I pissed my pants I was so scared. About 10 yards stood a family group of 4 or 5 creatures that stood about 10 feet tall the small ones were about 6 1/2 feet tall they screamed and whooped and threw rocks and it got much much worse. This is the most terrifying experience I’ve ever had and I haven’t gone back to this property since. I can’t tell you everything through email because this story would take about an hour or so to fully describe what I saw that night.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jeff writes “Wes, I had an encounter back in 1989, I was 15 yrs old in MI. Left Detroit when I was 10 in 1984 to MI. The woods were new to me, which I spent every waking moment in the woods as a 80’s kid especially since coming from the city.</p> <p>It was myself, my brother, my best friend Scott, his brother and a mutual friend of all of ours. We built a half pipe in the woods and we skating it. One night we all started smelling something rancid and after awhile we all heard something crashing towards us.</p> <p>Sounded like no other animal in the woods, it was charging at us and making a noise which I never heard before or afterwards in the woods. All I can say it was like an ARK vocal. It ran like a bulldozer, it was coming to our ramp. It was definitely bi pedal. Step after step going through bushes and trees, it was nuts. I have a lot more to tell and would like to talk with you and my best friend that was there. I never saw it, I ran. Scott saw it. Thanks for your time.”</p>]]></description>

Ken said “I thought it was a man but I knew it was impossible for a man to move like that.”</p> <p>Damien Nott will be returning to the show. I interviewed Damien on episode 723 The Strange Light Phenomena. One of the encounters he had with the lights almost killed him and he has been suffering from what appears to be radiation sickness. I wanted to discuss it on episode 723 but I wanted to make sure he was ready to talk about it.</p> <p>Damien Nott (Australian Aerial Phenomena Investigations) began investigating and researching the UFO phenomenon after a sighting he witnessed at the age of 9. He went public in 2012 after multiple sightings and considerable media attention and has become a passionate voice both nationally and internationally for the phenomenon. Damien regularly gives presentations across Australia showing his UFO captures and speaks about his own experiences and research regarding UFO’s. His goal is educate those who are interested in the phenomena, as well as those who may find themselves having had an experience or encounter of their own.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be chatting with Timothy Renner and Joshua Cutchin. Their book is called "Where the Footprints End: High Strangeness and the Bigfoot Phenomenon, Volume II: Evidence."</p> <p>The guys write "Despite continued attempts to uncover the truth, proof of the bigfoot phenomenon has eluded researchers and cryptozoologists for decades. Witnesses regularly describe seeing and interacting with something like a large, undiscovered hominid... and yet, such sightings regularly produce evidence directly at odds with conventional scientific explanations. It seems impossible to reconcile these peculiarities—among them mystery lights, UFOs, unusual sounds, mindspeak, cryptic stick signs, and anomalous footprints and trackways—with the notion of flesh-and- blood creatures evading detection in the modern frontier.</p> <p>As remarkable as the discovery of a manlike primate would be, what if bigfoot is something stranger still?"</p> <p>Also check out Tim's Podcast: <a href= "https://www.strangefamiliars.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://www.strangefamiliars.com/</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode, we are joined by Tony Merkel from The Confessionals podcast, who will be our Sasquatch Chronicles guest host, while Wes hosts an episode of The Confessionals for Tony as part of this special swapcast! Tony brings guest Michael to the show, who shares with us all about a life riddled with unusual experiences pointing to him possibly be an alien abductee at the age of three. Michael was visited by entities at that time, and later came to understand that they were Grey extraterrestrials. He lays out a series of events which followed as he grew older that sometimes left him feeling so terrified he was afraid to go to sleep at night. The feeling of ice cold hands grabbing him eventually became a tell that alerted him he was being attacked. Once while he was sleeping he found himself in a type of sleep paralysis state from which he could not awaken, and all the while he felt like something was peeling the skin off of his feet. When he finally came out of it, hediscovered he really was missing chunks of skin! Michael also describes another instance when he felt the ice cold hands grabbing his ankles and pulling him off his bed, only to drag him down the hall. What happened as he was being dragged is hard for himto describe or understand because it seemed like he was being taken into a whole other realm. Michael shares as many bits and pieces of these abduction events as he can remember on this week’s swapcast episode, ‘They Took My Flesh.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you want o hear me on The Confessionals, come listen to at <a href= "https://www.theconfessionalspodcast.com/theconfessionals/307-billy-the-kid-the-man-who-died-twice"> https://www.theconfessionalspodcast.com/theconfessionals/307-billy-the-kid-the-man-who-died-twice</a></p> <p> </p>]]></description>

It looked like a huge hairy human, it looked at me and I looked at it. It wasn’t a bear and it wasn’t a human being. I would say it looked more human like.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The witness is a veteran and has agreed to come on the show. Chris writes “Wes, I recently discovered your podcast and have been listening and enjoying it.</p> <p>For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in Bigfoot/Sasquatch and believe enough evidence has been found to prove their existence. On to my possible encounter.</p> <p>In June of 2006, my fishing buddy and I were on Lake Ouachita (pronounced wosh-i-taw) in Arkansas. We hit the water around 1900 that evening, launching from the Joplin recreation area boat ramp. The breeze was calm and the moon was bright, a perfect night for fishing. Around 2200, we had been fishing the perimeter on one of the many islands on the lake. This particular island has a nice long inlet on one side that has a finger protruding just off center and we always catch some nice fish there. This evening was no exception.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The witness is a veteran and has agreed to come on the show. Chris writes “Wes, I recently discovered your podcast and have been listening and enjoying it.</p> <p>For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in Bigfoot/Sasquatch and believe enough evidence has been found to prove their existence. On to my possible encounter.</p> <p>In June of 2006, my fishing buddy and I were on Lake Ouachita (pronounced wosh-i-taw) in Arkansas. We hit the water around 1900 that evening, launching from the Joplin recreation area boat ramp. The breeze was calm and the moon was bright, a perfect night for fishing. Around 2200, we had been fishing the perimeter on one of the many islands on the lake. This particular island has a nice long inlet on one side that has a finger protruding just off center and we always catch some nice fish there. This evening was no exception. After landing my second bass, there was a loud splash from a decent sized rock being tossed in the water.</p> <p>I looked back to my buddy giving him the WTF look only to notice he was giving me the same look. As we were about to say something to each other, there was another splash in front of the boat.

We will wrap up with Matt who is a truck driver from Western Pennsylvania and witnessed a creature on the side of the road. Matt said “I wasn’t sure what it was the eyes were red, which confused me. I never looked into Bigfoot before this and did not realize their eyes could be red…it was strange.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “Hi Wes, I had an encounter in 1979-1980 in Goshen, Virginia. We were at the Boy Scout Camp and got up early to try and see deer. I lived outside of Washington, D.C. so catching sight of a deer would have been a highlight for a young kid.</p> <p>As we walked through the woods near our cabins, there was a thick morning fog. We were being lead by one of the Scout leaders, it was a small group of maybe four or five people. As we walked along for maybe 10 minutes, I felt that there was another person or group with us. It was not the feeling of being watched but more like we were walking along two parallel paths in the woods. I recall hearing the irregular sound of sticks cracking etc. I wasn’t familiar with these particular woods so I wouldn’t know what was normal or unusual.</p> <p>As we stopped to look at some tracks, I recall looking into the woods and seeing something but not seeing it. It was as if something (a man-like creature) was standing flush against the trees..</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Jack who had an encounter when he was young. Jack says "I lived in a rural area in Pennsylvania. I remember going down this road and I had this bike and the chain would always come off. I looked down at my chain and had a feeling I was being watched I looked up and saw this thing watching me. We will also be speaking to Will who is from Canada and he had a recent encounter. Will says "I thought it was a basketball player with a hoodie on. It had a small tree or branch in its hand and when it dropped what it had in its hand I noticed the deltoid muscle was the size of a basketball. It reminded me of a primitive man."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “I was running my airboat on the upper St. Johns River, Florida doing what I like to do best frog jigging on a Friday night.</p> <p>It wasnt the first time I was out on the river at night,I use to run the north and south parts of the river all the time.I still do but I rarely go at night and if I do it’s with 5 or 6 other boats..Anyway I was coming up on the oak’s.The oaks are located right next to Duda’s property.Just a wee south of Lake Winder. I figured I would pull up into the oakhead and drink a few cups of joe before I started to gig.Out of the corner of my eye I saw something bolt into the cabbage palms.I figured it to be a hog,I really did not know what it was the last thing on my mind was it could of been the big guy.Anyway I ran up on dry ground about 15 yards spun my boat around so it was pointed toward the river and shut it down.I just poured a cup of joe when I heard something about 10 yard behind me. It sounded like it was wrestling with a cabbage palm or maybe rolling around in a bunch of palms.that’s when I heard something hitting the ground and making a God awful noise then out of know where I heard a thump right next to my boat.</p> <p>I looked but did not see anything then again I heard it behind my boat then something hit my rudders I turned on my head lamp and saw mud on my rudders I then saw a bunch of mud fly over me and hit my bow I shined my light in the direction of where it was coming from and I saw his face and a good portion of his body he was pissed all I could think was my holy father please deliver me from evil.I lost all feeling in my body I just about passed out I was lost I didnt know what to do. I was in total shock I figured I was about to be ripped apart by this giant he was huge, I looked at him for 15 to 25 seconds it seemed longer I paired him with the front of my boat and this thing was huge. He definitely was a he, it had Male junk he had brown hair not very long and a leathery face. I just about peed my pants I was so scared.</p> <p>I never in my natural born life moved so fast to crank my boat and got the heck out of there I was amazed my boat cranked as fast as it did I was waiting to get pulled off my seat and got the tar beat out of me I was amazed my boat started, I gunned it I really dont even remember starting it .I almost sank my boat when I hit the river. I just went north knowing I would be in the lake.I was scared to drive home so I parked in the middle of Lake Winder and took a few sips of drink to calm my nerves and try to talk my self out of what I saw, I stayed there until first light. I was afraid to try and head back down the narrow part of the river in fear the big guy could snatch me off the boat and kill me, sitting in my front seat of my boat I sit 9 feet above the ground I was just about eye level with him during my confrontation.</p> <p>I have never been back to that spot again I was asked by a researcher if I could bring them there which I said I would but only during the day and I would be armed. It really ruined my life I use to love going out on the river and loved going camping and couldn’t wait to do it with my sons when they got old enough but you wont catch me out there at night, the sounds it made and the size it was is forever etched in my memory forever just writing this is got me crying from emotion.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jay writes “I grew up on a big cattle ranch in eastern Oregon where I hunted and farmed from a young age. I pride myself in saying that can track a cotton ball in a snow storm and guiding many hunts for people for bear, elk, and deer. I have seen and experienced every predator in the Pacific northwest and know what track they lay, and how old. But one experience changed my life forever and I feel maybe you could bring some insight, and or knowledge.</p> <p>I would like to get into the mountains as much as possible and find new spots or fishing holes. I was traveling east on mountain roads in between cascadia and sisters on a road system on the north side of green peter and foster dam. I would stop occasionally and walk a little bit of the road to ensure it wasn’t overgrown or sunk in. It was around the first of May nobody goes up where I was because it can be a bit dicey. But i would check if there was any spots i could drop off the side and fish or gold pan. I did this until i hit a dead end. I was literally in between sisters and Cascadia when i had to turn around and head back to another road system. On the way back I rounded a corner and saw a pile of rocks on the road. They were stacked in a pyramid.. big from small, top to bottom. They were not there on the way up, but almost in the middle of the road on the way back. So I parked the my jeep, I was about 30 yards from the pile.</p> <p>I exited my jeep and walked to the pile, but was in shock.. this is how the Iraqis would mark IEDS, and almost in shock. There was and embankment going up to my left almost vertical about 30 feet, and tapered off a little bit to the top of the hill, and almost a sheer drop off to my right. As I studied the rock pile for a few seconds something started to charge me from on top of the mountain on my left. I’m always carrying a gun so I drew my pistol and held it where the sound was coming from and as soon as I drew it, it stopped. I was frozen with my pistol held where the sound came from with the mentality I’m about to smoke this bear. I have about 30 feet to move left or right while dumping 230 grains of hollow points in it, but it never showed. It froze when I did.. I held that position for about a minute when I decided to start moving towards my vehicle. As I moved towards my jeep I could hear it parallel me on the ridge above out of sight but I never dropped my weapon. That’s when i knew something else was going on. I have experienced bear, cougar and every predator in our mountains and a bear wouldn’t have known if someone drew a pistol. So I was thinking human possibly? But didnt know, because how would it know to stop when I drew down? As I got to my jeep and held for a bit to make sure I wasn’t imagining things, or hearing things.. I switched to off hand with my pistol while holding up the mountain, started my jeep and drove off.</p> <p>I was so confused when I drove off that I headed straight to my hunting partners house and told him we needed to head up there to see what’s going on. When we got back up there the rock pile was still there.. and we heard nothing but silence for the first few minutes.</p> <p>It was around 10 minutes of studying the rock pile and seeing strange tracks behind us going up the cliff when we heard whoops. They were in sequences of 3 directly to our south. It was just a whoop, whoop, whoop. It happened until towards the Bend of the road to the north started doing a whoop.. this was also in a sequence of 3. We were super confused, then around the Bend of the road on the east side the whoops started there… and both spots in between whoops started, but at this point there was only 1 whoops per area. It sounded like a grouse mixed with Hercules or hulk. Idk… but not right..we decided to get out of there.</p> <p>We went back 2 days later with a fire team and track whatever it was. When we got above the cliff it was like a nuke went off. Tree barks everywhere… loke 8-10 in dug firs pulled from the ground and shoved top first into the ground. Root was and all. Tree breaks on break breaks. I’ve never seen anything like it. The strangest thing was we found 3 separate tracks, human like barefoot tracks different sizes. It was the strangest thing I’ve ever encountered and from this day I will not go into the woods alone. Some of the guys I was with say wiccans and their summer solstice festival, some say bigfoot. I can only say what the tracks tell me, and no human could have came at me that fast down the mountain, and stop when I drew my pistol.”</p> <p>Kelly writes “We was riding dirt bikes in the back country of Central Utah. When we stopped to gauge the trail things were just weird. Dead no birds nothing my little brother pointed out to me. My cousin walk up the trail to see how bad it gets when he call my name to come look. As I stated walking I had a really weird gut feeling. As we’re walking up hes walking down. He catches something out of the corner of his eye to left up the Hill. Screaming as he drops to the ground faster than I’ve ever seen anyone I see a large tree coming horizontally at him breaking smaller trees as it went. I looked to see what was going on and I saw the biggest thing that I ever seen. There is so much more to this encounter id be typing all day I’m not very good with emailing I apologize for the grammar and spelling and punctuation.</p>]]></description>

As I moved towards my jeep I could hear it parallel me on the ridge above out of sight but I never dropped my weapon. That’s when i knew something else was going on. I have experienced bear, cougar and every predator in our mountains and a bear wouldn’t have known if someone drew a pistol. So I was thinking human possibly? But didnt know, because how would it know to stop when I drew down? As I got to my jeep and held for a bit to make sure I wasn’t imagining things, or hearing things.. I switched to off hand with my pistol while holding up the mountain, started my jeep and drove off.</p> <p>I was so confused when I drove off that I headed straight to my hunting partners house and told him we needed to head up there to see what’s going on. When we got back up there the rock pile was still there.. and we heard nothing but silence for the first few minutes.</p> <p>It was around 10 minutes of studying the rock pile and seeing strange tracks behind us going up the cliff when we heard whoops. They were in sequences of 3 directly to our south. It was just a whoop, whoop, whoop. It happened until towards the Bend of the road to the north started doing a whoop.. this was also in a sequence of 3. We were super confused, then around the Bend of the road on the east side the whoops started there… and both spots in between whoops started, but at this point there was only 1 whoops per area. It sounded like a grouse mixed with Hercules or hulk. Idk… but not right..we decided to get out of there.</p> <p>We went back 2 days later with a fire team and track whatever it was. When we got above the cliff it was like a nuke went off. Tree barks everywhere… loke 8-10 in dug firs pulled from the ground and shoved top first into the ground. Root was and all. Tree breaks on break breaks. I’ve never seen anything like it. The strangest thing was we found 3 separate tracks, human like barefoot tracks different sizes. It was the strangest thing I’ve ever encountered and from this day I will not go into the woods alone. Some of the guys I was with say wiccans and their summer solstice festival, some say bigfoot. I can only say what the tracks tell me, and no human could have came at me that fast down the mountain, and stop when I drew my pistol.”</p> <p>Kelly writes “We was riding dirt bikes in the back country of Central Utah. When we stopped to gauge the trail things were just weird. Dead no birds nothing my little brother pointed out to me. My cousin walk up the trail to see how bad it gets when he call my name to come look. As I stated walking I had a really weird gut feeling. As we’re walking up hes walking down. He catches something out of the corner of his eye to left up the Hill. Screaming as he drops to the ground faster than I’ve ever seen anyone I see a large tree coming horizontally at him breaking smaller trees as it went. I looked to see what was going on and I saw the biggest thing that I ever seen. There is so much more to this encounter id be typing all day I’m not very good with emailing I apologize for the grammar and spelling and punctuation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I wanted to reach out to you specifically because of some odd experiences that keep me wondering what really happened that night.</p> <p>It was about July and I was feeling ambitious so I decided to camp up in Northwestern hills solo in a hammock. The Wyatenoic state forest seemed remote enough. As darkness set in, I was circled in my hammock and heard a grunt just out of sight. I left soon after with the fear of being too deep in the woods without any real protection from cougars, bears.. I want to add the other event that took place in Dudleytown on December 26 2018.. I wanted to check out the place and explore the ruins.</p> <p>We were not too far into the woods when my buddy started to go back towards the car due to increasing paranoia about something in the woods. Ill admit I wasn’t concerned as him, but there was something large that seemed to parallel us. As he walked back I stood in the woods looking around and taking in the beauty. I closed my eyes for maybe 30 seconds just happy to be there.. After that I walked back to my friend who was moving quickly up the trail with stone walls.. I turned around and a small black figure moved from the trail to behind the tree.. It was the same size as my friend who is 6 foot but was much smaller in build than him.. I was perplexed because it seemed rather lanky and kept me guessing if I saw a shadow figure.”</p> <p> </p> <p>We also be talking to the guys from Into the 400.

My uncle owns and operates a small beef cattle farm where he has cows, chickens, and goats.</p> <p>I was visiting my family that live in the area because I live in Kentucky now. We was talking and he was telling me about how some of his chickens a had been pulled out of there pens and disappeared over the last couple weeks. We both agreed there may be a coyote or two getting into his chicken pin. I like varmint hunting so I agreed to spend a couple nights out there and see if I bag the coyote for him. I had brought my .300 AAC AR build to shoot with some of my family. It was equipped with a day and night sight because I mainly use it for coyote and smaller game hunting. Well one the second night I was posted up in the top of his barn that has a small opening on the second floor that faced the wood line.</p> <p>I was scanning the woodline with the night setting when I noticed something moving some small trees about 150 yards to my left. So i focused on it. As I watched this 7 and half 8 foot tall creature stepped out. It was covered in dark hair. The moon was almost full so I had alot of illumination to help my night sight. At first I seemed like someone in a ghillie suit. But I quickly realized it wasn't as it cover the halfway to the chicken coops in just a few steps. I yelled out stop or I'm going to fire. The thing stops and I can see it stare directly up at me and bare its teeth. It let's out this ungodly roar and barrels toward me. I quickly switched my weapon to fire and open up on it at about 75 ft.</p> <p> </p> <p>I empty my first mag and was reloading my second when it slammed the side of the barn shaking it. It aimed down and emptied another half a mag directly down on it. It looked up at my yelled and again and made a beeline straight back into the woods. My heart was pounding. I have done 2 combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan and this rattled me to my bones. I waited till morning to climb down and make my way back to uncle's house. I told him what I saw and what I did. We went back and couldn't find blood but found some partial tracks.</p> <p>We ended up calling our family friend who was a Missouri Conservation Officer and he came out. I told him my story and with a serious face and tone he told me dont tell anyone and hed handle it. Well there's my story."</p> <p> </p> <p>Al in Connecticut writes "Hey Wes, I had a short encounter, I know what I saw and I am a huge skeptic...WAS." Spoke to Al and he owns a farm in Connecticut. He said after weeks of animals coming up missing he saw what was taking his animals. Al said "It was so strange I had doors to the cages and whatever was taking the animals had hands because it had to open the doors. Early one morning I went out to find several doors open and I felt like I was being watched. I was saw what I thought was a tree stump. Something wasn't right, I picked up a stick and threw it at it and this thing stood up and took off running on two legs. It was huge."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “I am originally from Miami, Florida. I lived with my grandparents in Clewiston, Florida which is right by lake Okeechobee. They lived in an unincorporated community called pioneer which is about 23 miles from Clewiston. And about 80 miles from Big Cypress preserve.</p> <p>A very rural part of the country indeed. I was about 10 at the time the encounter. It occurred during the summer time. So bearing this in mind many of the canals in the area were low of water. My grandparents owned a couple of acres of land, so they were far apart from neighbors. I loved being outside trying to find different animals and trying to catch black racers, rat snakes, and different turtles in the area. The surrounding area around the property were full of palmettos which were towered by evergreen trees. I would like the fence in the back of the property to go catch reptiles. I walked a half a mile deep in the woods and hit a small dry creek bed, which is where I found different animals from time to time. The creek extended to about a mile which fed into a canal. As I was looking for reptiles heard the brush move from across the creek bed. I was used to rustling in the wood, so I didn’t pay attention until I saw something step out from the brush out of the corner of my eye. What I am about to tell you still haunts me to this very day. What stepped out was 7 ft tall ape looking thing. Its fur was a deep reddish brown. It was almost boxy in shape with legs longer than its body. It almost seemed designed to live in the swamp. I just froze. I knew it would not be wise to run through this brush.</p> <p>So I did something that learned from years of watching nature documentaries. I crouched down and pretended I was eating leaves. I remember seeing a documentary about Diane Fosse, and I recalled she would do this as to not provoke the silverback. I was too scared to do anything else, and whatever I was doing was keeping me alive. Every so often I would glance up at it, and it was just standing there tensely examining me. It would also look back and forth almost over me almost to assure I was alone all the while making a huffing sound. The only thing separating us was a dry creek bed. Which may have been 15 ft of space. It was doing this for about 3 minutes, but it felt an eternity. Then that’s when it went down on its haunches and squatted. I felt the courage to raise my head and look at it. We were just examining each other. At this time I noticed it was female due to the breasts. I also noticed at the time that she wasn’t alone. I saw small arm draped over her shoulder. We just kept looking at each other for about another 5 minutes. The whole time my body was telling me to run. Like some primordial instinct saying danger, but my mind remained extremely calm. At the same time I was expecting to smell a stench, but none ever came.</p> <p>I only thought this because I have heard what a skunk ape was and heard the stench they exude, but she wasn’t smelly. After five minutes she reached behind her never taking her eyes off me the whole time and held her baby. It was looking at me with intent. Examining me like its mother. It couldn’t have been more than a month old. It was kind of small but bigger and more advanced than a human infant. She must have given birth to it last month. I felt as if she was teaching her baby what a human was, but at the time I think she may have been confused what I was considering my skin is dark brown like hers and I had long curly black hair. While she was holding her baby, I could notice scars on her face. I figured she was old. Never did she bare her teeth at all during this encounter. About 6 minutes later she stood up and turned her body, slung her baby on her back, and stared down the creek bed when I noticed a bigger one of these things was standing 50 feet away. He was staring directly at me with disgust. This one bared his teeth at me.</p> <p>He looked kind of like Caesar in rise of the planet of the apes only taller and more muscular. He may have been half a foot to a foot taller than her. I noticed the stench and she also began to reek of this smell. I can only describe it as hot garbage, and dead animals mixed into a vat. I later concluded maybe they only smelled when they’re stressed, or angry. They both started to puff up. Meaning that they were trying to make themselves bigger than they were. The female then positioned herself between me and the male. As if to almost protecting me. Maybe it was all those motherly hormones in her that told her this. The standoff lasted for maybe at least two minutes. Then the male walked back in to the brush on the side where the female came out of. She then without looking back at me began to make her way back in the brush as well. I think she was making sure that male didn’t follow me, I have no idea. I turned to leave very quickly and didn’t turn back till I was back inside the house. I never went back in the woods ever again behind my grandparent’s property. I tried telling my mom what happened, but my mom was more of a city woman, so she did not believe me. That really hurt me. I did however tell my grandma what I saw, and she simply said, “I believe you”. I never knew if they had any encounters with them considering none of them ever came on the property.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Johnathon writes “I would like to tell you my experiences. I grew up in a small town or village (depends on how you define Either or ) Slana, Alaska. Growing up me and my family didn’t have power or running water.</p> <p>My first experience was when I was 7 so to get water for the house we would have to load buckets in to the old station wagon drive down to the river. My job was to sit in the back and hold the jugs so they don’t tip over not like hold them on my lap but just hold them still. I remember pulling out of the pullout at the river and looking out the back window and seeing a (as I put it to my parents) big hairy dude stand up out of the ditch on the other side of the ditch. He had vary thick brown and dirty wight hair on his chest and on what we would consider his beard.</p> <p>Of course my parents didn’t believe me said I was just imagining things.</p> <p>The scary experience is what I’m really hear to tell you about to say nothing ever tried to interact with us would be a misrepresentation of the reality of living out there. From small things like sitting in the outhouse and having acorns thrown at you to coming home to find something has ripped your door off the hinges taken all your food and trashed your cabin (normally blamed on bears) witch is rare but does happen.</p> <p>One day my friend mat came to visit me and my family from the city so me and my sister decided to take him camping up in the mountains. Me and my sister packed up with a shotgun an SKS with her dog Lucius food and couple tents set off. to get to the trail it was a 2 hour drive plus a 3 hour walk to get to where we wanted to camp. When we got to the clearing we noticed moose bones but we thought it was just a hunter’s camp but now looking back Hunter’s wouldn’t have left the antlers. We set up the camp and it was an uneventful day the dog was happy running around it wasn’t tell we all laid down for the night it was me and mat in one tent my sister and her dog in the other tent. It was about midnight when I woke up to branches breaking outside of my tent I called over to my sister did you hear that she called back that I was just hearing things then it sounded like something ripped a tree down. We jumped out of the tent we could hear things circling the clearing we were in running around. We could tell that they were on two lags it’s a varey distinct sound but at the time we were thinking wolves trying to get the dog so we built up the fire and shot off a couple rounds from the SKS cuz we had bear slugs in the shotgun.</p> <p>It dies down for about 15 minutes then it starts up again just running around the camp then we realized that they were not making any noise no barking or growling bears and wolves make lots of noise when they are hunting.so we fired off a bunch more rounds but they didn’t leave this time mat came running over saying something was touching the tent he was in we ran over and we found the dog in the tent he had peed on himself and refused to come out he is a big boy to pit bull American bulldog cross about 90 pounds was still young at the time. He has been around bears wolves and links nothing has scared him but now he won’t move. So we decided it was time to leave we packed up the camp we went to the tree we put are food in then we could see shadows in the fire we never heard them walk up on us it was like the running was just a destruction. I had to carry the dog so my sister had the shotgun mat had the pots and pans and the SKS my sister was up front with the flashlight and mat was in the back with a flashlight so me and the dog were in the middle so nothing could try and grab him.we could hear them following us all the way down the mountain but half way down we had to take a break when mat put the pack down it made a loud clang then we heard something Sprint off it was standing only about three feet away from mat and we had no clue it was there. The dog never stopped crying but they seemed more interested in mat we made it back to the car and drove away very fast.</p> <p>We never got a good look at what they were and we shot at the noise but I don’t think we hit any thing.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Johnathon writes “I would like to tell you my experiences. I grew up in a small town or village (depends on how you define Either or ) Slana, Alaska. Growing up me and my family didn’t have power or running water.</p> <p>My first experience was when I was 7 so to get water for the house we would have to load buckets in to the old station wagon drive down to the river. My job was to sit in the back and hold the jugs so they don’t tip over not like hold them on my lap but just hold them still. I remember pulling out of the pullout at the river and looking out the back window and seeing a (as I put it to my parents) big hairy dude stand up out of the ditch on the other side of the ditch. He had vary thick brown and dirty wight hair on his chest and on what we would consider his beard.</p> <p>Of course my parents didn’t believe me said I was just imagining things.</p> <p>The scary experience is what I’m really hear to tell you about to say nothing ever tried to interact with us would be a misrepresentation of the reality of living out there. From small things like sitting in the outhouse and having acorns thrown at you to coming home to find something has ripped your door off the hinges taken all your food and trashed your cabin (normally blamed on bears) witch is rare but does happen.</p> <p>One day my friend mat came to visit me and my family from the city so me and my sister decided to take him camping up in the mountains. Me and my sister packed up with a shotgun an SKS with her dog Lucius food and couple tents set off. to get to the trail it was a 2 hour drive plus a 3 hour walk to get to where we wanted to camp. When we got to the clearing we noticed moose bones but we thought it was just a hunter’s camp but now looking back Hunter’s wouldn’t have left the antlers. We set up the camp and it was an uneventful day the dog was happy running around it wasn’t tell we all laid down for the night it was me and mat in one tent my sister and her dog in the other tent. It was about midnight when I woke up to branches breaking outside of my tent I called over to my sister did you hear that she called back that I was just hearing things then it sounded like something ripped a tree down. We jumped out of the tent we could hear things circling the clearing we were in running around. We could tell that they were on two lags it’s a varey distinct sound but at the time we were thinking wolves trying to get the dog so we built up the fire and shot off a couple rounds from the SKS cuz we had bear slugs in the shotgun.</p> <p>It dies down for about 15 minutes then it starts up again just running around the camp then we realized that they were not making any noise no barking or growling bears and wolves make lots of noise when they are hunting.so we fired off a bunch more rounds but they didn’t leave this time mat came running over saying something was touching the tent he was in we ran over and we found the dog in the tent he had peed on himself and refused to come out he is a big boy to pit bull American bulldog cross about 90 pounds was still young at the time. He has been around bears wolves and links nothing has scared him but now he won’t move. So we decided it was time to leave we packed up the camp we went to the tree we put are food in then we could see shadows in the fire we never heard them walk up on us it was like the running was just a destruction. I had to carry the dog so my sister had the shotgun mat had the pots and pans and the SKS my sister was up front with the flashlight and mat was in the back with a flashlight so me and the dog were in the middle so nothing could try and grab him.we could hear them following us all the way down the mountain but half way down we had to take a break when mat put the pack down it made a loud clang then we heard something Sprint off it was standing only about three feet away from mat and we had no clue it was there. The dog never stopped crying but they seemed more interested in mat we made it back to the car and drove away very fast.</p> <p>We never got a good look at what they were and we shot at the noise but I don’t think we hit any thing. I think we accidentally walked in to where they were staying for the night. There is more experiences but this email is already long winded so thank you for your time.” </p> <p>Fox is my second guest.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ed from Indiana writes, “Listened to one of your shows tonight. He said he saw a little green man. I had an experience similar to his. I was arrowhead hunting here in Indiana, in the banks of the Ohio River.</p> <p>I had crossed over with a friend’s neighbor to the Indiana side. Just caught a ride over with him, and his wife on their boat. My plan was to walk from West Point Ky, back to New Albany Indiana. Well, I mean I started out across from West Point. This was the summer of 93. It was a great day, and I found lots of points. Some places were overgrown with poison ivy, and sumac. I had anticipated this problem, and had food, and essentials in plastic bags, so I could swim, or wade if I needed to. I stopped for about two hours to rest, and eat. I found a small runoff area, that had cut a channel down from the cornfields, to the river bank. So, I’m sitting there, just resting after I had eaten. I was facing south towards the Ky bank just enjoying the quiet of the river. I heard something off to my left,coming through the small willows that grow in a band, along the middle part of the bank. I’m sitting back up in the runoff so I couldn’t see what it was immediately.</p> <p>I was thinking it was a beaver at first, they love the young willows to eat. Then around the edge of the runoff, two small “men”, for lack of a better word, come walking around the edge of the runoff. It was just like you, and your guest, stated. They weren’t green though, they were more like small Native Americans. Not proportioned like a dwarf, or midget, but like a grown person. Say about the size of a four year old child. The one in front saw me, and he made this buzzing type sound, the other stopped when he did this. I say he, because they appeared to be male. In breechclout, with leggings. It was like looking at woodland era Native Americans. He looked at me, made the sound, the other stopped, and the one in the lead just stood there, staring at me, and me at him. Then they just turned and walked away. Not in a hurry, or alarmed, they just turned and left.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Visit <a href="http://www.sasquatchchronicles.com" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">www.sasquatchchronicles.com</a> for additional weekly shows and exclusive content.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dustin from Colorado writes, "Two years ago my oldest daughter of 9 at the time keep begging me to take her bear hunting so I did and all we did is drive the side by side around because taking a 9 year old out and blowing on a call hoping to have a bear come at you at a dead run and hope your gun shoots true and the shot is effective and the dam thing don't get pissed and kill you is stupid with a 9 year old girl in tow.</p> <p> </p> <p>Well fast forward to last fall I had a big bear coming into the water hole I had sat at for a few days, but the timing never was right to fill my tag. My kid keep begging to go and being the mean dad I am I said no. so one day my kids where at my fokes house while I was working and my oldest went to my dad and told him she wanted to go out hunting tomorrow with me but I wouldn't let her and why is that papa. Well he told her it's not safe to take your kids at a younger age out predator hunting. Deer and elk hunting is safer but not bear and he told her this story that I had never heard until that evening but the strange thing is I have memories about some of it even before dad relayed it to me that day but we will find out why. When I was 5 years old it was still legal to bait in bear with bait barrels in Colorado so one afternoon dad was babysitting me his only kid at the time and mom was running late from work to relieve him so he could go hunting so he scooped me up and out we went now I can't tell you where he was hunting at the time due to me not asking. so anyways we get there, and he was just going to put the few pig heads in the barrel and head home and hit it first thing in the morning on his own. Well he walks me into the area, and he had a few of the pig heads with him he places them in the barrel, and he placed me down and said stay. so, he turned around to walk the 30 ish yards to the Honda 3-wheeler for the other pig heads. He only went 10 to 15 yards and I started screaming for him and he flipped around to find me hauling ass down to him. He scooped me up and walk back to the bait station to see what he told my daughter at the time was a bear running of in the timber. But later that night when I asked him about that story, he said I'm not going to lie to you son it was a f&%$#$% bigfoot walking off with the pig heads. It came up took the heads out of the barrel with you sitting 5 yards away. All I remember is seeing the pig heads and riding on the gas tank of the 3-wheeler and seeing a barrel not much before are after but he said the barrel was in a tree about 3 feet when we arrived and he had to pull it out of there and reset it. So there's my first experience with them. My dad has a few more very hair raising story's that he had years prier but they are his story's not mine and I will talk with him about sharing them with you over the phone. I have returned to those areas and had my own experiences also.</p> <p> </p> <p>My second one was in around spring of 2007 I was upriver ridding my four-wheeler and I was in this area where I could see down 300 to 400 yards below me into this meadow and there's a tree line and above the tree line is a road. Well I stopped and was sitting, and I looked down to that meadow with my binoculars to see a dark figure walking across the meadow towards the road. My first thought was holy shit moose but after further monitoring it. It was on two legs swinging its arms in a kind of way I've heard a few people on your show say crazy bag lady kind way only this thing looked like it was frolicking through the meadow like something on the little house on the prairie. So I'm not sure what I'm looking at then 2 dirt bikes come screaming down the road above the tree line and this critter turns towards my direction and starts running still on two legs then dropped to all four and it runs right to the timber line then does this barrel roll looking deal into the timber and was gone no smell no noise.</p> <p> </p> <p>I later ran into something else. I'll be honest with you Wes this was no bigfoot, but I don't want to say dog man I'm still on the fence with that critter. So its 2013 and myself and my wife are out shed hunting in one of my favorite places out in mule deer country north of my land in this place that I called slaughter gulch due to the unreal amount of dead deer you would find everywhere back then. Yes, the place is packed full of coyotes and mountain lions but you did find a lot of dead coyotes also at that time so anyways my wife and I where out. It was a beautiful day we had been walking all day with lots of luck well we got back to the four wheeler and she wasn't done so she took off walking up the draw nearby and I stayed at my machine I busted open a cold one and was sitting looking at our trophy's for the day so far and trying to think about where to head to next. Then straight Infront of me to the west I saw movement about 200 yards out in between two huge boulders so I put up my binoculars and could see a dark figure with points on top of its head that well looked like ears on a dog. I could kind of make out eyes and a noise so I pulled the binoculars down and look at it with my naked eye then put the binoculars back up and once I found it again with the binoculars its ear twitched and it turned its head to reveal and canine nose then looked back at me for a second and ran towards me on all fours a few feet then dropped into this huge wash in between it and me and that was the first and last I saw of it but to this day my wife will even tell you my attitude that day change bad for a few hours. I have never been as scared as the day I saw that. I mean one month later I got hurt at work and literally was staring death in the face for a few weeks and I was not as scared as that day not even with the encounters I have wrote so far. Going to continue to wright to you. There was no smell or sound to this one. I'm pretty sure its to blame for most the dead deer and dead coyotes. Because I have noticed a huge drop in the dead deer, I found out there and I continue to shed hunt out there never seen it again but have had other issues after that with my dog out there. But even to this day I avoid that area ill ride two miles out of my way up to the top and glass the bottom but I wont walk in there anymore.</p> <p> </p> <p>So fast forward to 2016 I have heard whoops out in the timber. I have smelt bad smells worse than a 3-week-old dead elk in July, kind of smells while bow hunting and bear hunting for years. So, I made buds with a coworker. I have never really felt like I could talk about the fury one's to anyone that would take me serious besides my dad and uncles and with them it was taboo to talk about the fury ones and there other native monsters. so, my new buddy and I worked the same shift's 7 on 7 off day's and night's and we got to talking one day when he saw one of my bigfoot book's laying on the seat of my company truck. So, he jumps in, He says to me, "dude you believe in bigfoot," and I said ya if you laugh, I'll beat you into the gravel. He said no he believes to. So, after many weeks of talking about bigfoot with him, and him turning me on to your Facebook page. He goes out and buys a side by side and asked me to build it up for him, so I put some light bars on it a lift kit and a few other things. Once I was done with it, I called him to come get it. So, he came out and said lets ride tonight and hang out. So I took my four wheeler and he brought out this so called bad ass military guy who turned out to be fake he never served or even signed up to serve so anyway. We headed out upriver I think we put 25 miles on the machine's and stopped cooked some burgers and just BS for a few hours. Around 10 pm we headed to the pickups. There was a set of pond's that we stopped at on the way up and looked for bear track's earlier that day. when we started to approach the pond heading back I caught eye shine in my light bar then my machine dropped down a water bar in the road and once it came back up the eyes stood up and stayed. So my first thought was it must be a bear drinking then stood up, On his back legs to look at us. then it started running and the eyes stayed at around 6 plus ft high. and Wes bear cant run like that so boom its him!! The fury guy so I flipped around backwards on my four wheeler with it still rolling and started digging into my bag for my big spotlight once I get ahold of it the machine has come to a stop and my buddy rolls up next to me and said what's the deal bud. I look at him and said eye shine he said "so" I looked him dead in the face and said "f#$%^& tall eye shine running". he goes "oh crap" jumps out I have always carried my H&K USP 45 and that guy has way to many gun's to list I think he had a 40 on him that night so any way we go walking across the field and his tag along guy stayed at the side by side per my command. I didn't like nor trust him so me and my buddy keep walking spotlighting the trees and BOOM eyes peaking from behind a tree. You could see the hand's holding the tree, and this thing peaking around the tree. so, we are staring at it and it's staring at us then I hear the rack of a hand gun and I turn back and look at my buddy with his gun loaded and in position for action. I calmly but in a loud sort of way I say put it away and he says "it's for protection," and I said his "name" PUT IT AWAY NOW!! so he does we look back in time to see a tall figure run deeper into the timber. We back up slow and get back onto the machines and head out my buddy claims that once he gets back to his machine his friend said what's the deal? He told him we just saw a bigfoot! and that dude melted down freaking out!! I went back up a few days later in the day light there's cattle tracks everywhere, so ground evidence was gone but I think I found the tree. If it was the right tree it would have had to of stood 8ft tall. I have a picture of a footprint in that location from a few years later. My dad told me that back in the mid 90's there was some small logging in that area and he had heard that there equipment was always getting messed with at night and strange noises could be heard in the later part of the day .There is a huge pile of logs that showed up in the middle of the meadow out of no where one day and some of the logs I cant even get my arms around them. I have pictures of the various log piles.</p> <p> </p> <p>My fifth, Is with my same coworker. We had been out multiple time's ridding with nothing to report so later that fall myself and my wife went camping in a different area up river and my coworker planed to show up later and stay for two nights. So, after 2 days and 2 nights of ridding and fishing and multiple nap's my buddy shows up later in the evening and talk's me and my wife to go for a night ride. So, we go out my wife him and I. I tell you what I about left the guy because every puddle/creek any kind of dirt we came to he had to find a way to avoided it he says he must keep his buggy clean. The only reason I bring it up is because it will be used later in this trip, so after hours of laying my coat in puddles for him to keep his shoes clean we get up to where I had my experience in 2007 my wife is the first to notice! The smell the worst I have ever smelled. So, we stop and sit a while and we hear a few tree knocks and very strange noses that left me very confused. I kind of wonder if it wasn't a hunting party there where grunts and some strange chines jibber talk. We headed back to camp about an hour after that I had a very uneasy felling in my gut that night. The next morning, we load up my four-wheeler and his side by side and head back up just to ride and after avoiding any kind of dirt/mud/bird poop, we get to the same location as the night before. I take them down into where it is. It's really nice country its full of elk and bear there's a huge creek that splits into 2 creek crossing's one after another. We cross that and sit in a spot that I use to camp years ago all the time. We eat lunch have a beer or two and right before we leave my buddy said hay can I shoot my shotgun here? I said do it! So, he kill's a tree reloads kills it again. We head out back to camp. After dinner and its dark. he pipes off and said, "let's go back up and see if we can hear them noises." So, against by better judgment I load up my wife and we head up and as we are leap frogging mud puddles I'm getting this bad feeling just chewing at me and the further we get up there the harder the feeling chews at me. So yes, I want to hear them noises again I want answers but dangit I had my wife in tow, and even native Americans would say you keep girl's away from these big guys. In mid ride I stop my machine get off tell my buddy if we are doing this she goes back first. Something's bad and it has had a mouth full of me this whole ride so far. I'm not doing this, so we turn around and get to camp well he's not giving up so against my better judgment I leave my wife behind at the camper 20 miles away she's safe there. We load up in his side by side and after a hour of a bad feeling chewing on me and the pure boredom of riding with this guy who will not get dirt on his machine we get to the double creek crossing and right before we cross. A owl comes and lands in front of us on a branch across the first creek crossing and if you follow native American folk lore that could be good or bad sign. The one I follow that's a bad sign. We cross making sure we don't get any of that clean water on that machine. Right across the creek is where we stopped that day and he shot his gun, so we pull in turn around and parked on the road shut the buggy off and get out. I put a lantern on the toolbox in the bed of his machine he kind of wanders around for a minute. a few minutes go by and he said we should record just sitting here and I told him he's pissing in the wind. That creek is to loud and that's all it will pick up. so behind us the road come's down towards us at a angle and just to freak him out and get a laugh I told him to look up the road and he did, at the same time I said picture a monster running down that, at you! He responds with a "F you pal." so I go to the front of the machine to relieve myself, he stayed at the opposite side of the machine at the back, talking to me so for the shits of it. I let out the best whoop I have ever done! and he cheered me on for it. So, all done I come back to my side of the rear of the machine to continue talking with him. A few minutes later in the conversation he lights up a cigarette and with that pause in the conversation comes this huge crack of a limb getting busted right behind us, about 30 yards both of our eyes get big. We sit for a bit and once we start talking again there is this huge thud right behind my buddy and he starts yelling, "f this lets go." so we both jump into his machine and right before he takes off I shine my spotlight through the back of his buggy to see this huge dark figure with its arm's down. He punched the gas as we came to the creek crossing he never slowed down it was a wall of water on the buggy with both crossings and as we flew up the switch backs I had to tell him to calm down before he wrecks and send us back down the mountain to that things feet. The whole time out of there that goofy basterd was screaming there not supposed to be real and if they are real, they don't live here in Colorado. So, after that wild hairy ride hitting every puddle and lighting him 3 smokes he asked for another. I told him to stop and light one himself we are in the clear now! So, he stops and we are both really shook up. He lights a smoke and we head back to camp. The next day after he leaves I leave my wife back at camp so she can sun bathe and I fly up to that location for answers what I find is a big limb that both my hands couldn't reach around that was broke off at least 12ft up on the tree and a rock right next to the peal out marks of his buggy that I could barely roll let alone pick up there was no smell with this big guy. I'm willing to bet he was in there earlier that day when he was shooting and realized it was the same dumb rednecks that came back and that was his polite way of saying get the heck out.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the fall of 2018 I was with my same buddy and my youngest brother in-law and we headed up to where me and my buddy had are first experience together. well the forest service had done a lot of work up there on the ponds and one pond in particular had a lot going on there. Their was tracks witch I have pictures, there was a log thrown in the middle of the pond right after they finished digging it and my buddy is a big guy and him and my brother in-law couldn't pick it up we found the other end of the log and there was no drag marks just foot prints. so we get to a good look out and for a few hours its silent then around 8 pm the coyotes start going off all around then out of nowhere there's tree knocks and the worst deepest howling that completely shut the coyotes up. All I could say is it sounded like a wolf imitation but to me it sounded like a damn hell hound and the whole place goes silent and the same change happens to my brother in law he was almost brain washed quiet and he stayed that way even a few days later when he arrived home he just wouldn't talk but he's fine now.</p> <p> </p> <p>Last spring of 2019, Wes I'm not sure what this is but I will tell the Division Of Wildlife was even looking for this thing. There were dogs killed, goats and chickens this thing was seen in daylight just moseying around by multiple people even a D.O.W agent saw it so I was told. So I have a very nice flock of chickens and ducks well when one of my mallard hens took to hatching her second batch of chicks the first batch a weasel got to them days before they where to hatch well I think it was a weasel anyway she made a nest up in the oak brush in my back yard and she hid herself good so after a few weeks her and the eggs just up and disappeared no egg shells like before on the first attempt her and the eggs gone. A month after that my daughter, my same brother in law from the prev encounter and myself where heading out to shed horn hunt. My wife calls me to say there is a huge bobcat in our yard, so I told her to shoot it. So she runs out in the front of my house 22 mag in hand and my mom behind her on the phone talking to me. So when my mom and wife get to the front of the yard after locking up the livestock they see this thing disappear behind the rimrock wall that borders my land and my mom still on the phone says "Dustin this isn't a bobcat or mountain lion ".My father is a taxidermist so mom knows what them critters look like. Once myself and my kid and brother in-law get home my wife tells me what she saw it was a tan cat thing with very long legs, no tail, very tall pointy ears but the strangest of them all it had a canine muzzle. I have security cameras around the house but of course it didn't catch that critter. So I set up a trail camera right at the horse water trough that my wife seen it at. So after three days of it being set up we took it down and the images where very hard to explain. It took video of me setting it up of course and my brother in-law testing it out and one of the ducks in the water trough but after that the only thing it videoed was me anytime I walked by it, it had me but not the ducks that swim in there all day long, I saw my kids dancing in front of it and the many deer and elk that we know drink from there hell we got them on my security camera drinking there but not on the game camera. Two days later myself and my brother in law where on my back wraparound porch talking about the next days shed hunting plans when just over his head on top of the rimrock wall under a cedar tree I could see this thing looking at us. So told him I would be right back and went inside grabbed my 223 rifle and stepped out to find it still in the same spot I put the gun up found it in the scope and oh god the face on it ugh I touched my gun off and we heard it hit and it jumped back but once we got up there to where I saw it all I found was blood I never found a body and there has not been anymore animal killings after that."</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dustin from Colorado writes, "Two years ago my oldest daughter of 9 at the time keep begging me to take her bear hunting so I did and all we did is drive the side by side around because taking a 9 year old out and blowing on a call hoping to have a bear come at you at a dead run and hope your gun shoots true and the shot is effective and the dam thing don't get pissed and kill you is stupid with a 9 year old girl in tow.</p> <p> </p> <p>Well fast forward to last fall I had a big bear coming into the water hole I had sat at for a few days, but the timing never was right to fill my tag. My kid keep begging to go and being the mean dad I am I said no. so one day my kids where at my fokes house while I was working and my oldest went to my dad and told him she wanted to go out hunting tomorrow with me but I wouldn't let her and why is that papa. Well he told her it's not safe to take your kids at a younger age out predator hunting. Deer and elk hunting is safer but not bear and he told her this story that I had never heard until that evening but the strange thing is I have memories about some of it even before dad relayed it to me that day but we will find out why. When I was 5 years old it was still legal to bait in bear with bait barrels in Colorado so one afternoon dad was babysitting me his only kid at the time and mom was running late from work to relieve him so he could go hunting so he scooped me up and out we went now I can't tell you where he was hunting at the time due to me not asking. so anyways we get there, and he was just going to put the few pig heads in the barrel and head home and hit it first thing in the morning on his own. Well he walks me into the area, and he had a few of the pig heads with him he places them in the barrel, and he placed me down and said stay. so, he turned around to walk the 30 ish yards to the Honda 3-wheeler for the other pig heads. He only went 10 to 15 yards and I started screaming for him and he flipped around to find me hauling ass down to him. He scooped me up and walk back to the bait station to see what he told my daughter at the time was a bear running of in the timber. But later that night when I asked him about that story, he said I'm not going to lie to you son it was a f&%$#$% bigfoot walking off with the pig heads. It came up took the heads out of the barrel with you sitting 5 yards away. All I remember is seeing the pig heads and riding on the gas tank of the 3-wheeler and seeing a barrel not much before are after but he said the barrel was in a tree about 3 feet when we arrived and he had to pull it out of there and reset it. So there's my first experience with them. My dad has a few more very hair raising story's that he had years prier but they are his story's not mine and I will talk with him about sharing them with you over the phone. I have returned to those areas and had my own experiences also.</p> <p> </p> <p>My second one was in around spring of 2007 I was upriver ridding my four-wheeler and I was in this area where I could see down 300 to 400 yards below me into this meadow and there's a tree line and above the tree line is a road. Well I stopped and was sitting, and I looked down to that meadow with my binoculars to see a dark figure walking across the meadow towards the road. My first thought was holy shit moose but after further monitoring it. It was on two legs swinging its arms in a kind of way I've heard a few people on your show say crazy bag lady kind way only this thing looked like it was frolicking through the meadow like something on the little house on the prairie. So I'm not sure what I'm looking at then 2 dirt bikes come screaming down the road above the tree line and this critter turns towards my direction and starts running still on two legs then dropped to all four and it runs right to the timber line then does this barrel roll looking deal into the timber and was gone no smell no noise.</p> <p> </p> <p>I later ran into something else. I'll be honest with you Wes this was no bigfoot, but I don't want to say dog man I'm still on the fence with that critter. So its 2013 and myself and my wife are out shed hunting in one of my favorite places out in mule deer country north of my land in this place that I called slaughter gulch due to the unreal amount of dead deer you would find everywhere back then. Yes, the place is packed full of coyotes and mountain lions but you did find a lot of dead coyotes also at that time so anyways my wife and I where out. It was a beautiful day we had been walking all day with lots of luck well we got back to the four wheeler and she wasn't done so she took off walking up the draw nearby and I stayed at my machine I busted open a cold one and was sitting looking at our trophy's for the day so far and trying to think about where to head to next. Then straight Infront of me to the west I saw movement about 200 yards out in between two huge boulders so I put up my binoculars and could see a dark figure with points on top of its head that well looked like ears on a dog. I could kind of make out eyes and a noise so I pulled the binoculars down and look at it with my naked eye then put the binoculars back up and once I found it again with the binoculars its ear twitched and it turned its head to reveal and canine nose then looked back at me for a second and ran towards me on all fours a few feet then dropped into this huge wash in between it and me and that was the first and last I saw of it but to this day my wife will even tell you my attitude that day change bad for a few hours. I have never been as scared as the day I saw that. I mean one month later I got hurt at work and literally was staring death in the face for a few weeks and I was not as scared as that day not even with the encounters I have wrote so far. Going to continue to wright to you. There was no smell or sound to this one. I'm pretty sure its to blame for most the dead deer and dead coyotes. Because I have noticed a huge drop in the dead deer, I found out there and I continue to shed hunt out there never seen it again but have had other issues after that with my dog out there. But even to this day I avoid that area ill ride two miles out of my way up to the top and glass the bottom but I wont walk in there anymore.</p> <p> </p> <p>So fast forward to 2016 I have heard whoops out in the timber. I have smelt bad smells worse than a 3-week-old dead elk in July, kind of smells while bow hunting and bear hunting for years. So, I made buds with a coworker. I have never really felt like I could talk about the fury one's to anyone that would take me serious besides my dad and uncles and with them it was taboo to talk about the fury ones and there other native monsters. so, my new buddy and I worked the same shift's 7 on 7 off day's and night's and we got to talking one day when he saw one of my bigfoot book's laying on the seat of my company truck. So, he jumps in, He says to me, "dude you believe in bigfoot," and I said ya if you laugh, I'll beat you into the gravel. He said no he believes to. So, after many weeks of talking about bigfoot with him, and him turning me on to your Facebook page. He goes out and buys a side by side and asked me to build it up for him, so I put some light bars on it a lift kit and a few other things. Once I was done with it, I called him to come get it. So, he came out and said lets ride tonight and hang out. So I took my four wheeler and he brought out this so called bad ass military guy who turned out to be fake he never served or even signed up to serve so anyway. We headed out upriver I think we put 25 miles on the machine's and stopped cooked some burgers and just BS for a few hours. Around 10 pm we headed to the pickups. There was a set of pond's that we stopped at on the way up and looked for bear track's earlier that day. when we started to approach the pond heading back I caught eye shine in my light bar then my machine dropped down a water bar in the road and once it came back up the eyes stood up and stayed. So my first thought was it must be a bear drinking then stood up, On his back legs to look at us. then it started running and the eyes stayed at around 6 plus ft high. and Wes bear cant run like that so boom its him!! The fury guy so I flipped around backwards on my four wheeler with it still rolling and started digging into my bag for my big spotlight once I get ahold of it the machine has come to a stop and my buddy rolls up next to me and said what's the deal bud. I look at him and said eye shine he said "so" I looked him dead in the face and said "f#$%^& tall eye shine running". he goes "oh crap" jumps out I have always carried my H&K USP 45 and that guy has way to many gun's to list I think he had a 40 on him that night so any way we go walking across the field and his tag along guy stayed at the side by side per my command. I didn't like nor trust him so me and my buddy keep walking spotlighting the trees and BOOM eyes peaking from behind a tree. You could see the hand's holding the tree, and this thing peaking around the tree. so, we are staring at it and it's staring at us then I hear the rack of a hand gun and I turn back and look at my buddy with his gun loaded and in position for action. I calmly but in a loud sort of way I say put it away and he says "it's for protection," and I said his "name" PUT IT AWAY NOW!! so he does we look back in time to see a tall figure run deeper into the timber. We back up slow and get back onto the machines and head out my buddy claims that once he gets back to his machine his friend said what's the deal? He told him we just saw a bigfoot! and that dude melted down freaking out!! I went back up a few days later in the day light there's cattle tracks everywhere, so ground evidence was gone but I think I found the tree. If it was the right tree it would have had to of stood 8ft tall. I have a picture of a footprint in that location from a few years later. My dad told me that back in the mid 90's there was some small logging in that area and he had heard that there equipment was always getting messed with at night and strange noises could be heard in the later part of the day .There is a huge pile of logs that showed up in the middle of the meadow out of no where one day and some of the logs I cant even get my arms around them. I have pictures of the various log piles.</p> <p> </p> <p>My fifth, Is with my same coworker. We had been out multiple time's ridding with nothing to report so later that fall myself and my wife went camping in a different area up river and my coworker planed to show up later and stay for two nights. So, after 2 days and 2 nights of ridding and fishing and multiple nap's my buddy shows up later in the evening and talk's me and my wife to go for a night ride. So, we go out my wife him and I. I tell you what I about left the guy because every puddle/creek any kind of dirt we came to he had to find a way to avoided it he says he must keep his buggy clean. The only reason I bring it up is because it will be used later in this trip, so after hours of laying my coat in puddles for him to keep his shoes clean we get up to where I had my experience in 2007 my wife is the first to notice! The smell the worst I have ever smelled. So, we stop and sit a while and we hear a few tree knocks and very strange noses that left me very confused. I kind of wonder if it wasn't a hunting party there where grunts and some strange chines jibber talk. We headed back to camp about an hour after that I had a very uneasy felling in my gut that night. The next morning, we load up my four-wheeler and his side by side and head back up just to ride and after avoiding any kind of dirt/mud/bird poop, we get to the same location as the night before. I take them down into where it is. It's really nice country its full of elk and bear there's a huge creek that splits into 2 creek crossing's one after another. We cross that and sit in a spot that I use to camp years ago all the time. We eat lunch have a beer or two and right before we leave my buddy said hay can I shoot my shotgun here? I said do it! So, he kill's a tree reloads kills it again. We head out back to camp. After dinner and its dark. he pipes off and said, "let's go back up and see if we can hear them noises." So, against by better judgment I load up my wife and we head up and as we are leap frogging mud puddles I'm getting this bad feeling just chewing at me and the further we get up there the harder the feeling chews at me. So yes, I want to hear them noises again I want answers but dangit I had my wife in tow, and even native Americans would say you keep girl's away from these big guys. In mid ride I stop my machine get off tell my buddy if we are doing this she goes back first. Something's bad and it has had a mouth full of me this whole ride so far. I'm not doing this, so we turn around and get to camp well he's not giving up so against my better judgment I leave my wife behind at the camper 20 miles away she's safe there. We load up in his side by side and after a hour of a bad feeling chewing on me and the pure boredom of riding with this guy who will not get dirt on his machine we get to the double creek crossing and right before we cross. A owl comes and lands in front of us on a branch across the first creek crossing and if you follow native American folk lore that could be good or bad sign. The one I follow that's a bad sign. We cross making sure we don't get any of that clean water on that machine. Right across the creek is where we stopped that day and he shot his gun, so we pull in turn around and parked on the road shut the buggy off and get out. I put a lantern on the toolbox in the bed of his machine he kind of wanders around for a minute. a few minutes go by and he said we should record just sitting here and I told him he's pissing in the wind. That creek is to loud and that's all it will pick up. so behind us the road come's down towards us at a angle and just to freak him out and get a laugh I told him to look up the road and he did, at the same time I said picture a monster running down that, at you! He responds with a "F you pal." so I go to the front of the machine to relieve myself, he stayed at the opposite side of the machine at the back, talking to me so for the shits of it. I let out the best whoop I have ever done! and he cheered me on for it. So, all done I come back to my side of the rear of the machine to continue talking with him. A few minutes later in the conversation he lights up a cigarette and with that pause in the conversation comes this huge crack of a limb getting busted right behind us, about 30 yards both of our eyes get big. We sit for a bit and once we start talking again there is this huge thud right behind my buddy and he starts yelling, "f this lets go." so we both jump into his machine and right before he takes off I shine my spotlight through the back of his buggy to see this huge dark figure with its arm's down. He punched the gas as we came to the creek crossing he never slowed down it was a wall of water on the buggy with both crossings and as we flew up the switch backs I had to tell him to calm down before he wrecks and send us back down the mountain to that things feet. The whole time out of there that goofy basterd was screaming there not supposed to be real and if they are real, they don't live here in Colorado. So, after that wild hairy ride hitting every puddle and lighting him 3 smokes he asked for another. I told him to stop and light one himself we are in the clear now! So, he stops and we are both really shook up. He lights a smoke and we head back to camp. The next day after he leaves I leave my wife back at camp so she can sun bathe and I fly up to that location for answers what I find is a big limb that both my hands couldn't reach around that was broke off at least 12ft up on the tree and a rock right next to the peal out marks of his buggy that I could barely roll let alone pick up there was no smell with this big guy. I'm willing to bet he was in there earlier that day when he was shooting and realized it was the same dumb rednecks that came back and that was his polite way of saying get the heck out.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the fall of 2018 I was with my same buddy and my youngest brother in-law and we headed up to where me and my buddy had are first experience together. well the forest service had done a lot of work up there on the ponds and one pond in particular had a lot going on there. Their was tracks witch I have pictures, there was a log thrown in the middle of the pond right after they finished digging it and my buddy is a big guy and him and my brother in-law couldn't pick it up we found the other end of the log and there was no drag marks just foot prints. so we get to a good look out and for a few hours its silent then around 8 pm the coyotes start going off all around then out of nowhere there's tree knocks and the worst deepest howling that completely shut the coyotes up. All I could say is it sounded like a wolf imitation but to me it sounded like a damn hell hound and the whole place goes silent and the same change happens to my brother in law he was almost brain washed quiet and he stayed that way even a few days later when he arrived home he just wouldn't talk but he's fine now.</p> <p> </p> <p>Last spring of 2019, Wes I'm not sure what this is but I will tell the Division Of Wildlife was even looking for this thing. There were dogs killed, goats and chickens this thing was seen in daylight just moseying around by multiple people even a D.O.W agent saw it so I was told. So I have a very nice flock of chickens and ducks well when one of my mallard hens took to hatching her second batch of chicks the first batch a weasel got to them days before they where to hatch well I think it was a weasel anyway she made a nest up in the oak brush in my back yard and she hid herself good so after a few weeks her and the eggs just up and disappeared no egg shells like before on the first attempt her and the eggs gone. A month after that my daughter, my same brother in law from the prev encounter and myself where heading out to shed horn hunt. My wife calls me to say there is a huge bobcat in our yard, so I told her to shoot it. So she runs out in the front of my house 22 mag in hand and my mom behind her on the phone talking to me. So when my mom and wife get to the front of the yard after locking up the livestock they see this thing disappear behind the rimrock wall that borders my land and my mom still on the phone says "Dustin this isn't a bobcat or mountain lion ".My father is a taxidermist so mom knows what them critters look like.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We speak to Devin, Todd and Mason from New York. Devin writes, “I was using my hen call and I was getting no response from anything it was pin drop quiet with a slight fall breeze every now and again would pick up. I came to the edge and I could see the shelf and it was empty no turkey’s so I went down to see if I could find a track. Once I popped over the edge it hit me the feeling of like I am being watched looking for tracks.</p> <p>I ignored it thinking it was just a squirrel or something so I ignored it continuing my investigation for the disappearing Turkey. I looked for about 10 minutes duck walking around looking for tracks when I stood up next to this tree looking down into the ravine with my gun propped on my boot like Daniel Boone would with his Kentucky long rifle. This overwhelming feeling like I was being watched was still in the back of my head when my brain said “TURN AROUND NOW!” so I did and as I turned from the corner of my eye I saw a massive red, brown auburn blur retreat from the edge which I just dropped down from.</p> <p>My first though was oh it was a deer but then it occurred to me why didn’t I hear leaves crunching or it running through branches? So I said maybe it was my eyes playing with me so I tried to recreate the “blur” and I couldn’t. I will not lie when I say at 17 in the woods with the cannon I was carrying at this moment I was scared shi#less. My heart was racing and the adrenaline kicked in. I raised that shotgun to my shoulder and I started walking back along this shelf heading south back to the camper because it came right out to the driveway within eye site of our camper.”</p> <p>He went on to say “A lot has happened, we returned to the area and this thing or things are still in the area. I have found a lot of strange structures what appear to be hunting blinds.

I did not see anything, but I definitely heard it. I could feel the steps it took as it started to run away. Looking back, I think it was startled in my sudden change of position or was having issues locating me. Anyway, I looked up, what would be up, what the hell would be up? What the….hell…was that?

My next encounter was with a friend outside of Fletcher, Nc. We were charged by a (roughly) 7 foot individual in the dark... then lights appeared and my paradigm started to change after that.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight we will speaking to three eyewitnesses. Mike from Virginia writes “Summer of 1989 a few friends and I “6 to be exact” decided to go to a very rural gravel backroad to party, drink etc. In my home state of Virginia. We all piled in my buddies Toyota 4wd pickup and headed out, it was a terribly hot and humid night, but very clear with a full moon.</p> <p>One of my friends was a female, who would sneak out to be with her boyfriend “One of my other friends with me”. We arrived somewhere close to 11PM and began to drink, laugh, and kid around. We had the radio going, but not very loud at all. Out of nowhere we heard a HUGE CRASH, sounded just like something fell out of a tree “Looking back I’m convinced that’s what it was” immediately after that we could hear VERY heavy footsteps. I’ve been in the woods all my life, and have heard about everything walking. This thing was different, it was MOST DEFINITELY walking on 2 legs. It circled us for what seemed like FOREVER roughly 50 to 75 yards deep in the treeline. The area is so thick I had a 1 million candlelight spotlight and it wouldn’t penetrate the cover. It was making VERY unusual deep grunting/growling sounds. One thing I noticed looking back was there were NO usual forest sounds. No cicadas “Which flood Virginia” in the Summer. No frogs, no crickets, no whiperwills NOTHING. We tracked the sounds to about 150 to 200 yards behind us, all of a sudden this thing let loose a ROAR that I could NEVER even attempt to explain. We FELT IT from that distance, it scared us to DEATH.</p> <p>Immediately after the roar it stepped out of the treeline to give us our first glimpse. This thing was MASSIVE at least 8ft tall and 4ft wide. This thing was WHITE yes WHITE!! It climbed what looked to be a 30ft bank up to the road in about 3 steps. Immediately we scrambled to get in the truck, I was driving and floored the gas spinning gravel. It was on top of us in a matter of seconds, one of my buddies hit it with a 30 ton bottle Jack that was in the back of the truck and it just bounced off. It scared us so bad that 3 of us lost control of our bladders. The girl I mentioned earlier that snuck out, she had a nervous breakdown she was FRANTIC!! We had to take her home to her parents “Who had no idea she’d even left the house” and try to explain to them what had happened.”</p> <p>We'll also be speaking to Dustin who had a strange encounter with his brother in Michigan. We'll close the show with Delbert from Colorado who had an encounter while fishing with friends.</p> <p> </p> <p>Visit our website <a href="https://sasquatchchronicles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a> for additional weekly shows and exclusive content.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Shiloh writes So I'm writing this because my uncle has urged me to do it. I had a big foot encounter when I was 17-18 driving home late one night. It was literally right in front of our farm. I've also had three other incidences where I've heard monkey sounds in our words and have been screamed out on two occasions When taking care of my uncles dogs. It always happens the same time of year. And I'm getting ready to take care of my uncle's dogs again and I figured I would say something at this point because it's pretty much like clockwork that the same things happen. My uncle also had an encounter while burning Grass along his Fence line."</p> <p>Melissa writes “In December of 2017 I saw a being from my back porch. I have told no one but my husband and I only told him because I wanted to protect him, make him aware to be on guard.And then I didn’t even tell him exactly what I saw, just to be careful because I saw a shadow of a huge animal about 150 feet from our house. My mind was overwhelmed and for a long time I called it a shadow but, in reality it was the creature I was looking at. It doesn’t feel right to call it a Sasquatch or a bigfoot, It looked and felt way to ominous to be just an undiscovered hairy hominid.</p> <p>It was early December, possibly late November, around 7:30 pm, dark outside except for an exceptionally bright moon, they mentioned the bright moon on the news earlier and that was the only way I would have seen it. My husband was going somewhere and I walked out talking to him as he was leaving, I glanced to the right and saw it and to this day I have no idea what I was saying at the time, I stopped talking and just stared. The next thing I remember is looking up at my husband and he was looking down at me like, well, go on, what is the matter with you? We talk about everything but, all I could do was say, be careful, I love you, have a good time. He looked at me funny and said ok. I watched him get in his truck and leave, to make sure he wasn’t out there and I couldn’t see it anymore, so I went inside and locked the door.</p> <p>I could only see it from the bottom of his bicep up, a huge bicep, I kept focusing on that. Because the moon was shining on the white siding of a building next door. Here’s the thing that shuts me up, the siding was only on the second story of that building, above a garage door opening where, now abandoned, big trucks were stored. I am trembling now. Dear God, how tall does that make it? The shadow was the darkest black I have ever seen and the whole silhouette was that same color. The only movement was from side to side, like it was gliding on a skateboard. It had a protruding brow ridge and mouth and the nose was completely flat in between, it was a side view.</p>]]></description>

One account Kurt relates was a call where the home owner said there was a prowler on the property. When the officer’s arrived they said there was large canine tracks around these peoples home. These tracks were larger than normal and there was scratch marks on the side of the house about 8-9 feet up.</p> <p>Kurt relates “I got a call one time about a lady who said someone was walking on her roof. When we arrived we walked around her property and could not find anything. There was a lot of snow but as I shined my light up on the roof I saw what appeared to be footprints on this ladies roof. It was odd….I remember getting in my patrol car not sure what to make of this.”</p> <p>Kurt will be sharing this and many more incidents that he encounter as a police officer.

I went into the wood line and saw my dog and he was whining. He would not look at me, he was looking up in the tree. I looked back and up to see what he was looking at and I saw this monkey in a tree. It was huge! This thing vocalized and another one came running. This one was much larger and it was carrying something. I realized he was carrying a 200lbs hog in his arm. The one in the tree screamed at me and then the larger one screamed/roared at me.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “Thought I’d share an experience that I had back in the mid 80’s. Probably not as exciting as many of those encounters that I’ve heard on your podcast, but non-the-less interesting.</p> <p>The entire experience was at least a 10 minute observation which I shall never forget. I am now 56 years old. This took place when I was in my early 20’s. Up in the high Sierra Nevada mountains, tucked away at about 7000 feet in the John Muir Wilderness, is a popular lake named Huntington Lake. I frequented this spot as I am an avid fisherman, hiker and love to explore. This lake has easy access with “the” main highway running through the area. So in the summer months it is quite populated with tourists and such. I would often fish the lake and hike the area.</p> <p>When hiking I often times would exit the trails and go off on my own, equipped with essentials and, of course, a compass. I was coming down the mountain from an afternoon hike and found a beautiful scene too lovely to not sit and take in for a while. A small rock face, or ledge if you will, perched just 12 – 15 feet overlooking a mountain meadow surrounded by redwoods. A mile and a half down from there you could see Huntington Lake, which seemed so small considering it’s actual size. It was about 4 pm and I was sitting there, and had been for at least an hour, when I saw movement just to my left where the redwoods quit and the meadow began. Granted I was approximately 15 up on the rock ledge but the movement was not more than 25 feet or so from the rock ledge. At first I thought it was a bear or a deer due to the size of what I was able to see. As I watched further, it came out fully into the open, sniffing the air, reaching for various plants and bushes….nearly in complete silence. it would pull up a plant, or off a branch…and nibble on the leafy parts. Nope. Not a bear! Certainly not a deer! It was in the open and foraging about…unaware of my presence. The small cliff I was sitting on/in was somewhat concave so it kinda wrapped around me to a point so my perch must have been somewhat concealing. If this would have been a bear I would have been concerned. I was floored. Taken. Nearly mesmerized I could not believe nor comprehend what I was seeing! And it wasn’t like the creature was difficult to see. It was a matter of 20-25 feet from me as it worked it’s way toward the rock face that I was sitting on. The hair was orange. Similar to an orange cat. The hair under the arms from the armpits to about the wrists was longer, about 4 or 5 inches long. The skin light gray. Standing at approximately 7 feet tall, this thing was blowing my mind. I was too amazed to be afraid.</p> <p>It had this permanent expression on its face like it was worried or sad. It wasn’t worried or sad….just had that look on it’s face. The face was nearly human. No ape looking attributes at all really. That is the part that freaked me out the most. It looked like a depiction of a Cro-Magnon. It was male. Undoubtedly male. Round – faced with a slightly pointy head…but not extremely pointed. Another thing that fascinated me was his eyes. They were the same orange-gold color as the hair. Mind – blowing. I still stand in amazement at what I saw. As he worked his way toward the rock cliff and me, I noticed him sniffing the air more frequently and looking around more. I figured he possibly had picked up on my scent. At this point he was no more than 20 feet from me. I would guess perhaps even closer. But I was up about 15 feet atop him on the cliff. Figuring that I had better make myself known to him rather than scare him…I softly said “Hi” and raised my right arm and waved it back and forth. He was startled and I could clearly see his eyebrows raise. He zoomed in on me instantly Freaky! He stood there not moving. I was feeling, for the first time, like “OH SHIT!”. What was this thing going to do? Or more specifically, do to ME? His eyes were larger than a human’s eyes but not by a whole lot. I could see whites on the insides and corners of the eyes. He stood there for what seemed like a minute but was probably less. Just looking at me. He didn’t seem angry or agitated. Mostly surprised that I was there. I was staring at him as well…probably for the same reasons. He then started walking off. His body turned but not his head.</p> <p>He never took his eyes off me as he walked away. A part of me was glad that he was leaving me in peace. But the curiosity part of me didn’t want him to. He was still looking at me as he was walking away. I raised my arm and slowly waved and said “Don’t go.” This is going to really seem stupid but non-the-less true. He stopped for a moment and very slowly raised his right arm ever so slightly…then walked into the redwoods. I was relieved but stunned. I cannot believe that I asked it to stay! I don’t know what I was hoping for in doing that. I do believe that this being was very intelligent. It had a curiosity and wonderment just as we do. I also believe….no, I KNOW, that this creature could have pounded me into the earth like a hot knife goes through soft butter. But yet it chose not to. I am more than grateful for that.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Green River was dammed up to create an 8,210 acre lake, “Green River Lake.” During this time my friend’s family owned land on green River. Naturally, As the lake filled up, many caves in the area were flooded. We think that’s what drove the Sasquatch in this story out into the open and searching for new territory.</p> <p>My friend and his cousin came down to the riverbank to do some target practice with their 22 rifles. They would walk up stream a ways, throw pop cans in the water, then run back down stream and wait for the pop cans (targets of choice) to float by.</p> <p>While blowing the cans to smitherines, my friend’s cousin’s gun jammed.</p> <p>They walked around a tree line, across a field and back up to their car which was sitting on the side of the road. They opened the trunk, sat on the back bumper, and began to dislodge the shell from his 22 rifle. As they were reloading they heard limbs snapping, they looked up and back toward the tree line they had just walked from. The tops of the trees were swaying wildly.</p> <p>My friend’s cousin asked, “who let the elephant out?” They decided to check it out.</p> <p>They closed the trunk and jogged back down across the field then walked quietly around the line of trees and back into the opening on the river bank where they had been standing moments before.</p> <p>“Sam” not his name..said when they came into the opening something started screaming at them. They jumped and looked toward the scream….Standing on top of a deadfall was a creature covered in hair, his arms were above his head and he was waiving them back and forth in a left, right motion. Sam’s cousin spun the barrel of his rifle around and shot 5 times.</p> <p>Sam said all five shot’s hit the creature in his chest area. He said he could hear the bullets landing almost like the sound of them hitting the water. The creature dropped his arms and fell straight back behind the deadfall. He hit with a large thud, then silence. The silence was very short lived. Sam’s cousin, started screaming, “I’ve killed our crazy uncle”</p> <p>“I’ve killed our crazy uncle”</p> <p>“I’ve killed our crazy uncle”</p> <p>“He dressed up in a monkey suit to scare us and I’ve killed him.”</p> <p>Sam told him, I don’t know what you’ve killed but it’s not our uncle. They were both in shock so holding onto each other they walked slowly over to the dead fall and looked over it to the back side. The creature was laying on its back and not moving. One of them (not sure which one) said, what the heck is it?</p> <p>This stirred the creature, he opened his eyes and jumped up. They jumped back, turned and started running. The creature “galloped” away in one direction, the two cousins in the opposite. I say galloped because of the way he was swinging his arms.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Spoke to Randy and he said “I have never seen a Sasquatch but I have dealt a lot with demonic possession. I have many accounts that made the hair on my arm stand up. Many people come to me with accounts of running into these creatures.”</p> <p>Randy writes “I have two encounters to share, both happened in Kentucky, one was right outside of Louisville city limits.</p> <p>1968,69-70</p> <p>The Green River was dammed up to create an 8,210 acre lake, “Green River Lake.” During this time my friend’s family owned land on green River. Naturally, As the lake filled up, many caves in the area were flooded. We think that’s what drove the Sasquatch in this story out into the open and searching for new territory.</p> <p>My friend and his cousin came down to the riverbank to do some target practice with their 22 rifles. They would walk up stream a ways, throw pop cans in the water, then run back down stream and wait for the pop cans (targets of choice) to float by.</p> <p>While blowing the cans to smitherines, my friend’s cousin’s gun jammed.</p> <p>They walked around a tree line, across a field and back up to their car which was sitting on the side of the road. They opened the trunk, sat on the back bumper, and began to dislodge the shell from his 22 rifle. As they were reloading they heard limbs snapping, they looked up and back toward the tree line they had just walked from. The tops of the trees were swaying wildly.</p> <p>My friend’s cousin asked, “who let the elephant out?” They decided to check it out.</p> <p>They closed the trunk and jogged back down across the field then walked quietly around the line of trees and back into the opening on the river bank where they had been standing moments before.</p> <p>“Sam” not his name..said when they came into the opening something started screaming at them. They jumped and looked toward the scream….Standing on top of a deadfall was a creature covered in hair, his arms were above his head and he was waiving them back and forth in a left, right motion. Sam’s cousin spun the barrel of his rifle around and shot 5 times.</p> <p>Sam said all five shot’s hit the creature in his chest area. He said he could hear the bullets landing almost like the sound of them hitting the water. The creature dropped his arms and fell straight back behind the deadfall. He hit with a large thud, then silence. The silence was very short lived. Sam’s cousin, started screaming, “I’ve killed our crazy uncle”</p> <p>“I’ve killed our crazy uncle”</p> <p>“I’ve killed our crazy uncle”</p> <p>“He dressed up in a monkey suit to scare us and I’ve killed him.”</p> <p>Sam told him, I don’t know what you’ve killed but it’s not our uncle. They were both in shock so holding onto each other they walked slowly over to the dead fall and looked over it to the back side. The creature was laying on its back and not moving.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jeff writes “Hello Wes, I absolutely love listening to your show. I wanted to share with you one of my two encounters with Bigfoot several years ago. I live in a town called Bluff City, Tn.</p> <p>The first incident was back in January 2008, and I was 15 years old at the time. I remember it like it was yesterday! It was a cold, crisp night and there was at least 3 inches of snow on the ground. Where I grew up at was on an old road that ran through the middle of a holler and it was rather secluded. We’ve always had many things there on that road happen and it was conmen that none of us would go out after dark. For one the road had only one street light on it so besides the light at my parents house and the single street lamp it was virtually pitch black on the road. We also had plenty of wildlife back in that holler. There were coyotes, bobcats, bears ( and I had came upon several bears walking threw the fields and woods there), deer, the occasional mountain lion. So plenty of animals and all of our neighbors had hunting dogs and cattle and horses. I say all of that for the significance of the story. But going back to the cold snowy night in January.</p> <p>I stepped outside with my dog to walk it so it could do it’s business and it started there. It was about midnight and my dog would always go out on its own, rain, snow, you name it the dog didn’t care at all. But that night the dog refused to go out. I pushed it out the door for it just to stand there and whine and scratch at the door. This was highly unusual because the dog had never acted like that before. Like it was genuinely scared. So I grabbed the leash and took it out to the front yard. Our yard at the time in front of the house was about a full acre and I had walked the dog to the far end of the yard. Back behind our house was a 19 acre horse farm that belonged to our neighbors. From where I was at you could see a very good amount of the field. So here I am at midnight in all the snow and thank God it’s a full moon night. Having the full moon and all the snow it was lit up like daylight outside so you could see everything! I noticed after standing still for about a minute or so I started to smell a rather odd oder. It’s was one like I had never smelt before. It was musky and pungent and just completely odd where we where at. I mentioned all the wildlife we had in the holler because I had been around all of it. Hunted it all too. And none of those animals ever had a smell like this. That’s when the neighbors dogs who had been barking like a mad fool suddenly went completely quiet and my dog ran behind me and laid on the ground at my feet shaking like a leaf.</p> <p>I froze and stood as still as I could trying to listen knowing I would hear anything moving with the snow being everywhere. That’s when I heard the walking and shuffling. I turned around and faced my parents house and all was black because I was the only one up at the time always being the night owl that I am. But I faced the house and the 19 acre field behind it and started to look for the source of the sound. Normally I wouldn’t have been so still like I was but this was an odd shuffle that I heard. Because I could distinctively tell that whatever it was, was walking on two legs. There is a difference and I always learned to listen for that in the woods at home so I could tell the difference between game, and a fellow hunter. We all hunted the same land so it was common to run across the occasional hunter. But this was a slow heavy step that I was hearing. Or so I thought it was slow. That’s when I seen it come from behind a line of trees that was in the middle of the field and it was walking through a clearing of about 100 yards or so. It’s was huge. Even though I knew I was about 100 to 120 yards away I could tell that this thing was massive. It the time I was 6’ even and weighed around 280 pounds so I wasn’t very little at my age. But seeing this thing made me feel significantly small. I would say it was anywhere around 7’ or taller. It’s stride was huge. That’s why I said I thought it was a slow heavy step. Even though it was taking fewer steps it was making a quick pace across the field with its long gate. It was taking probably a 6’ step every time.</p> <p>I could clearly see that it was extremely hairy, you could see the hair swaying on its arms has they swung back and fourth as it walked. And it had a large cones head that was hairy as well. I stood there until it got to the middle of the field and it registered on my mind what I was truly seeing. It was a Sasquatch! I had always believed and had done plenty of research on it. I knew it would be better if I stayed quiet and just watched it go but my curiosity got the better of me. So I let out a small, shrill whistle to see what would happen and the thing stopped in its tracks, turned around and faced directly towards me! I was terrified but yet mesmerized at the same time. I had always heard that these were intelligent creatures so I simply raised my hand in the air almost just as an acknowledgement, and honestly to try and make myself look bigger. But as I did this something amazing happened. The Sasquatch raised its hand in a mimicking fashion and stood there as long as I did with its hand up! When I lowered my hand down again it lowered its hand and then turned back and headed towards the end of the field! The field was surrounded by a 4’ tall barb wire fence and this creature stepped over it like it was nothing.</p> <p>That’s me moment I lost sight of it was when I grabbed the dog and ran for the house as fast as I could! I woke everyone up to tell them what happened and they have called me crazy every since. But I know without a shadow Of a doubt what I saw that day. Unfortunately for me it snowed again very hard that night and when I went out the next morning and into the field to find the tracks the snow had covered it up except for two wide ruts where it’s feet drug across the top of the snow. But there where no distinguishable tracks to see. I have had another encounter with a Sasquatch as well, and I also had a friend with me witness it the second time. But I won’t go into detail yet on that one since my first encounter was so long and this one is even longer! I have cold chills typing this up to send to you but I know what I saw. And I will never forget what I happened.”</p> <p> ---</p> <p>Chris writes "I live in a very rural county in Kentucky. One night, after hours of playing poker, I was leaving a friend’s home at about 2 or 3 in the am.</p> <p>As I stepped off his porch I heard a noise next to the tree line in front of my jeep. The distance between the porch and the tree line is about 15 yds with his driveway the only thing in between. Looking toward the sound I expected to see a deer or coon or something like that which is nothing strange in the area. What I saw was something crouched down like a baseball catcher. When my eyes landed on it , it stood. Couldn’t see facial details due to the moon backlighting everything from behind the tree line but it was around 7ft tall. It had very broad shoulders, a narrower waist and had arms reaching down to the knees.</p> <p>It felt like it lasted forever, us looking at each other, but probably only lasted 7 – 10 seconds. It then huffed at me then ran off into the trees. I think I surprised it by noticing it and the huff was it saying “dont follow me a$$hole.”</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></description>

Even though I knew I was about 100 to 120 yards away I could tell that this thing was massive. It the time I was 6’ even and weighed around 280 pounds so I wasn’t very little at my age. But seeing this thing made me feel significantly small. I would say it was anywhere around 7’ or taller. It’s stride was huge. That’s why I said I thought it was a slow heavy step. Even though it was taking fewer steps it was making a quick pace across the field with its long gate. It was taking probably a 6’ step every time.</p> <p>I could clearly see that it was extremely hairy, you could see the hair swaying on its arms has they swung back and fourth as it walked. And it had a large cones head that was hairy as well. I stood there until it got to the middle of the field and it registered on my mind what I was truly seeing. It was a Sasquatch! I had always believed and had done plenty of research on it. I knew it would be better if I stayed quiet and just watched it go but my curiosity got the better of me. So I let out a small, shrill whistle to see what would happen and the thing stopped in its tracks, turned around and faced directly towards me! I was terrified but yet mesmerized at the same time. I had always heard that these were intelligent creatures so I simply raised my hand in the air almost just as an acknowledgement, and honestly to try and make myself look bigger. But as I did this something amazing happened. The Sasquatch raised its hand in a mimicking fashion and stood there as long as I did with its hand up! When I lowered my hand down again it lowered its hand and then turned back and headed towards the end of the field! The field was surrounded by a 4’ tall barb wire fence and this creature stepped over it like it was nothing.</p> <p>That’s me moment I lost sight of it was when I grabbed the dog and ran for the house as fast as I could! I woke everyone up to tell them what happened and they have called me crazy every since. But I know without a shadow Of a doubt what I saw that day. Unfortunately for me it snowed again very hard that night and when I went out the next morning and into the field to find the tracks the snow had covered it up except for two wide ruts where it’s feet drug across the top of the snow. But there where no distinguishable tracks to see. I have had another encounter with a Sasquatch as well, and I also had a friend with me witness it the second time. But I won’t go into detail yet on that one since my first encounter was so long and this one is even longer! I have cold chills typing this up to send to you but I know what I saw. And I will never forget what I happened.”</p> <p> ---</p> <p>Chris writes "I live in a very rural county in Kentucky. One night, after hours of playing poker, I was leaving a friend’s home at about 2 or 3 in the am.</p> <p>As I stepped off his porch I heard a noise next to the tree line in front of my jeep. The distance between the porch and the tree line is about 15 yds with his driveway the only thing in between. Looking toward the sound I expected to see a deer or coon or something like that which is nothing strange in the area. What I saw was something crouched down like a baseball catcher. When my eyes landed on it , it stood. Couldn’t see facial details due to the moon backlighting everything from behind the tree line but it was around 7ft tall. It had very broad shoulders, a narrower waist and had arms reaching down to the knees.</p> <p>It felt like it lasted forever, us looking at each other, but probably only lasted 7 – 10 seconds. It then huffed at me then ran off into the trees. I think I surprised it by noticing it and the huff was it saying “dont follow me a$$hole.”</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be talking to three guests. My first guest Adam is from Florida and will be sharing an encounter he had with his parents while driving. They saw a Skunk Ape on the side of the road. Many years later Adam and his brothers ran into something much worse.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Jack writes "I am a retired U. S. Army (Rank Removed). I have had three combat deployments, including one as a commander in Iraq. Here is a synopsis of my encounter…</p> <p>It was the summer of 1988. I was a cadet (officer in training )through ROTC in college. I was at Ft Lewis, Washington for the summer. We were on maneuvers in the woods early in the morning. Our platoon was being trained by two Army Special Forces Non commissioned officers.</p> <p>We were on patrol in the middle of nowhere… probably 10 miles from the housing area of base. We had been choppers out as part of the training exercise. I still remember the name of the training event… “Adventure Challenge.”</p> <p>While out in the woods on patrol, we all heard something walking parallel to us. I was so dark- I could not see my hand! This thing continued walking… crunching while we walked, stopping when we stopped. Finally, our green beret instructor went out there. After about a minute, he comes running back telling us to get out of there. All we had were M16s with blanks… we were training, so no live ammo. I have more to tell if you want to hear.”</p> <p>--</p> <p>Emily writes "My husband and I had an encounter with something large in the woods of Southern Missouri on June 2nd of this year. In the afternoon I heard a huge tree fall in the woods in the direction of the river about 5 minutes after my husband left me at the camp to walk down to the water. About 30 seconds to a minute after the crash I heard 3 tree knocks, a pause and then 3 more with the same pattern on the opposite side of the river. A couple of times we heard snorts that sounded like wild hogs but never saw anything.</p> <p>I had gone to the tent around 10:30pm. My husband stayed around the campfire until around midnight. He went into the road after putting out the tiki torches and fire and heard a growling. He is not one to be freaked out by noises and such but he was a little unnerved by it. He got into the tent and told me about it. We talked for a couple minutes before saying good night. Less than 5 minutes after we stopped talking we both heard rustling in the leaves from a distance, we both lifted our heads and listened intently as the footsteps came closer. We both agree the footsteps were heavy. I have hunted in the woods before and it was not a deer. I would describe the sound as walking in the woods with boots on. My initial thought was maybe this is The man we rented the camping site from messing with us and it's part of the experience, but then realized he would be stupid to do that for fear of being shot. Bigfoot never crossed my mind. I was frozen in fear! It walked directly behind our tent. Probably within 3 ft of our heads. It sounded like it walked around the campfire ring and then off into the woods toward the water. We were absolutely silent while it was in the camp. As soon as we realized it had walked away, I began shaking uncontrollably! I have never felt fear like that and have never reacted to fear that way. My husband was trying to reassure me when we heard it returning about 2 minutes later. I grabbed the key fab to our van and hit the lock button so the lights would light up and hopefully scare away whatever it was. I did that 4 times and it walked off into the woods on the other side of the road behind our tent. We heard what sounded like a fight going on between two animals in that direction and I hit the lights again a couple times and the noises stopped. I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep in the tent anymore so we moved into our van for the rest of the night. I didn't look for Bigfoot signs because again Bigfoot didn't cross my mind until we got home that evening and we honestly thought it was probably a bobcat, but after looking at pictures of bobcats we both agree a bobcat wouldn't be big enough to make the sounds we heard. My husband has never been a believer in Bigfoot. I have been a believer for years but have never had an experience like this. I played several videos of animal sounds for him trying to identify the growl he heard. He said no to everything except supposed Bigfoot growl. He said that is very close to what he heard. In the same video of the growl you can hear footsteps of the creature and they sound almost identical to the steps we heard that night.</p> <p>We heard snorts again the next morning but could very well have been hogs. I sent a text to the owner the next morning asking if he knew what it might be. He said most likely deer...or Bigfoot! Then he listed several other animals he knew were on the property. I know none of the animals he listed could make those sounds...except Bigfoot.</p> <p>I haven't been able to stop thinking about this experience since it happened. A couple days after we got home I sent a text to the owner of the property and told him about the experience and asked if he had ever had any experiences and if he was serious about his Bigfoot comment. He said he was intrigued and wanted to know more so I shared our story. (I get the feeling he knows more than what he has told us) He said he did catch something on his trail cam the night of June 2nd and then directed me to his Facebook page where he had posted it. It was an orb. The time stamp says 11:11pm. 45 minutes before our encounter. I thought it was creepy! I'm convinced more than ever that it was Bigfoot that visited our camp that night. I just had to share!"</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “I’m going to try and keep this as short as possible but I have had about a half dozen encounters with what I used to think, but now KNOW, was a Sasquatch or something thereof.</p> <p>My cousin and my brother have spent the past week talking about all of our encounters here in AZ up off the Mogollon Rim and out at our family ranch north of Wickenburg. My cousin Chris came upon your show less than a week ago by accident and we have each listened to about 35-40 of the episodes since. He and I have talked over the past few days and because of what we’ve heard on your show, we are CONVINCED that what we’ve encountered is similar to those on your show. The timing worked out where my brother, who is active in the military, is in town and staying with us so the three of us have been reliving these experiences trying to find answers.</p> <p>The first memory was at our family ranch out in the middle of the desert where the nearest house or living human is a 45 minute drive down a dirt road. I was about 14 or 15 and my brother is two years younger than me. He and I heard the horses making a ton of noise down in the pasture in the creek that runs alongside the mountain the ranch houses sit on. We walked to the edge of the slope of the mountain where we could see below and saw the horses huddled together in the middle of our fenced in pasture. We caught glances of what we thought was a coyote in between the brush so we yelled down and made some noise. As soon as we did, this thing took off down the wash towards the Hassayampa river. We saw it running and it was big and black. It ran kind of like a dog but was 90-100 yards away below in the wash so it was thought to tell. It darted between the mesquite and the brush but it was jet black. If it was a canine, it was the biggest one we have ever seen. Running on all fours, it’s back had to be at least as high as my chest at the time but it was very bulky. When we asked our grandpa about it he said it was a bear but we have never seen a bear move that fast or agile.</p> <p>We had another encounter while sitting on the porch of the ranch house at night a few years later. My cousin and I were sitting on the porch with a girl from Germany and the rest of the family was inside. About 30 yards away, just outside of the light coming from the sliding glass door, we heard some movement for a few minutes, then the deepest growl I could have possibly ever imagined. It last for a few seconds and my cousin and I slowly got up on our feet. We looked at each other terrified and pulled our guns out. The SECOND I cocked the hammer back on my revolver, the growl turned into this terrifying scream. It didn’t sound like the typical woman scream you hear about, it sounded like a dinosaur. We threw open the door and slammed it shut and our family told us we looked like we had just seen a ghost. Neither of us slept that night.</p> <p>Around the time I was 19, my brother and a different cousin of ours had walked about a mile up river to do some target shooting with a shotgun. We didn’t have a lot of time before dinner so we were only shooting for 10-15 minutes before we headed back home. Walking down the creek we saw a jet black raven sitting in the middle of the creek. It was huge and wasn’t afraid of us. It had to sit 2.5′ talk and I have never seen a raven out there in that area. We walked by and didn’t think anything of it but as we got close to the house we saw a massive black creature on the side of the wash in the brush. At the time we all thought it was a bull but even then we thought it was pretty strange to see one off on its own that close to the house. 10-15 seconds later, when we turned to look back at it, it was completely gone. We asked our grandpa about a big black bull and he told us that we didn’t have any.</p> <p>I was 23 when I went camping off the Young road up on the Mogollon rim with some buddies. After the sun went down, we had a fire going and started hearing what we all thought was a woman screaming off in the distance. Over a minute or two the scream got closer until it was just outside the firelight and less than 30 yards from us. We were all freaked out since it sounded like this woman was dying. We called out and shined our flashlights towards it but never got a response or saw anything. Over a period of an hour, we heard some noises near by but eventually it got quiet and then we started hearing the screams again but the were moving away from us. We all slept in the truck that night and left the next morning.</p> <p>My last encounter was again, near the Mogollon rim with my cousin Chris, his wife, and a friend from work as his wife. The story is pretty long but we had heard screams in the forest during the day and after the sun went down we started to hear whistles coming in from at least 3 different positions getting closer to us. We saw red, green, and white lights coming down one of the hills that bordered the wash we were camping in. They were very soft lights like a glow stick in the distance. We would hear branches breaking and someone walking up the road. We would go out to look and couldn’t ever find anything. The whistles and noises would ebb and flow but during a period of quiet, our friend and his wife went to bed in their tent. The noises started up again and our dogs went so crazy we had to put them all in our trucks. My cousin, his wife, and I sat on his tailgate near the fire hearing at least 3 distinct whistles coming from different areas like we were being flanked. His wife didn’t read too much into it but we were terrified. I’ve got tears in my eyes just thinking about it. When one of the whistles got within 40 yards and right on the creek, I whistled into the dark and immediately, this thing immediately whistled right back to me in the exact same tone. The three of us panicked, we woke up our friends, packed up our camp within 10 minutes and left there in the middle of the night.”</p> <p> </p> <p>https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><a href="mailto:wes@sasquatchchronicles.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wes@sasquatchchronicles.com</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “So this started in the summer of 1982 in Yamhill County Oregon my parents were divorced and me and my sister had gone out to visit my dad for the summer.</p> <p>Now we’d only been there a few days and one of our chores was to go up to the barn and feed the cows about 1/2 Mile to a quarter mile away. On the way back now mind you we had dogs that darted in and out of the trees and they were real low pine trees low to the ground and the dogs are really friendly mid-size dogs. Anyway on the way back in the clearing we were walking through the clearing and out from the pine trees that were so thick you couldn’t see through someone/something tossed a rock at us. Now it wasn’t a big rock it wasn’t throwing overhand it was like an underhand toss. My dad was at work my dad’s girlfriend had just come out of the house because we could hear the door slam. We were way back in the woods and nobody around really known we were there yet so for somebody to be screwing with us it was highly unlikely.</p> <p>Anyway after the rock came out at us the dogs that would usually lick someone to death if they showed up at the house come shooting out from the trees and surrounded us and herding us down the Hill. Well we didn’t think nothing of it too much, I mean it was weird but we didn’t know what to think you know I was 12 my sister was eight. So the summer wore on and we hear strange sounds coming out of the forest I thought it sound like a woman screaming my sister thought it sounded like a howl but we also hear it sounded like a baseball bat hitting something. Well I decided to stay and live with my dad for a year ,my sister went home in the late summer. We had a spring that ran through the yard that kind of just made it a little muddy I went by there one day to feed the horse and in the mud it look like a huge footprint. I went and got my dad and he wouldn’t even look but when I got down on the ground and looked at the footprint I could see ridges like you would see you in your handprint but only in a footprint. So I went up to the barn and I went to check on the horse well the horse was nosed into a corner and had been there all night it looked like she had kicked up the dirt like she was trying to fight something off and she had scratches but I couldn’t tell what they were. The dogs on the other hand wouldn’t let me go in the barn and my dad seen this and became very angry cuz he’s just wasn’t a nice person.</p> <p>When he got up there the dogs ran off cuz they knew better and we went up in the barn and I had left the big doors open where you load hay in when you stock the barn. But something had been up there and made like a nest out of a bunch of the Bales , it was real easy to get in the barn from the big doors my dad could jump from the hill into the barn because it was that close, it was just wide enough for pickup. Well as a summer wore on i heard lots of weird noises coming out of the forest and you know you would think you would see something but you really didn’t or get the feeling of being watched. About mid-January the coyotes started howling and they would start howling every night about 10 and our dogs would run out in the backyard and bark And howl and carry on. Well this particular night the dogs come plowing back in underneath the porch.</p> <p>Now they would crawl under there and they’d make a lot of noise and see I slept in the basement by the window by the porch so I always heard when they were making noises and this night they were whining and hiding and trying to get farther up underneath the porch and I rolled over to grab a shoe to bang on the cement wall to get them to shut up and as I looked into the window there was Bigfoot staring at me right in the face 4 feet away and I have had that image burned into my mind since I was 12 years old. I tried to scream I couldn’t scream I freaked out threw the blanket over my head seems like forever but was probably only a minute or two went to look again and he was gone. So at first I thought maybe I was imagining things so I looked out my window and I could see the footprints by the window I was a size 8 in men’s as a twelve-year-old already and this was a good twice the size of my foot.</p> <p>I thought this was going to be it at last I’ll show Dad in the morning cuz I didn’t dare wake him up in the middle of the night cuz he would have beat my ass. But as bad luck would have it it started raining. Now I got a real good look at this bigfoot because the porch light was on the Barnyard light was on so I got a really good look at his face I guess I couldn’t tell you about the hands of the chest all I could tell you is the face the eyes are so human-like the bridge above his eyes and his mouth and nose. I have a real close picture that’s really close that I’ll send to you in an email that I found somebody drew or whatever that’s about real close to what I seen. so I tried to tell my dad the next day but of course you blew me off and as spring started coming about March and April. now my dad was a guy that got stressed out a lot and he got mean when he was really stressed 1 of his ways to deal with it as he would go walk in the woods. He would be gone a minimum of 3 hours and one time he was gone almost 12 hours. This particular time he’d been gone only 45 minutes he come back in the house he told his girlfriend I wasn’t allowed to go outside he grabbed his 30/30 rifle and a 45 Long Colt pistol and said he had seen something and would be back. he never did say what he seen but after that I wasn’t allowed to go back out by myself in the woods.</p> <p>I have had some other experiences in different states but not like this.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Here is some bonus content. I hope everyone enjoys the William Roe encounter from 1955.</p> <p> </p> <p>I, W. Roe of the City of Edmonton, in the province of Alberta make oath and say,</p> <p>(1) That the exhibit A attached to this, my affidavit, is absolutely true and correct in all details.</p> <p>Sworn before me in the City of Edmonton, Province of Alberta, this 26th day of August, A.D. 1957.</p> <p>(Signed) William Roe</p> <p>(Signed) by W.H. Clark</p> <p>Assistant Claims Agent</p> <p>Number D.D. 2822</p> <p>EXHIBIT A.</p> <p>Ever since I was a small boy back in the forest of Michigan, I have studied the lives and habits of wild animals. Later, when I supported my family in Northern Alberta by hunting and trapping, I spent many hours just observing the wild things. They fascinated me. But the most incredible experience I ever had with a wild creature occurred near a little town called Tete Jaune Cache, British Columbia, about eighty miles west of Jasper, Alberta.</p> <p>I had been working on the highway near Tete Jaune Cache for about two years. In October, 1955, I decided to climb five miles up Mica Mountain to an old deserted mine, just for something to do. I came in sight of the mine about three o’clock in the afternoon after an easy climb. I had just come out of a patch of low brush into a clearing when I saw what I thought was a grizzly bear, in the bush on the other side. I had shot a grizzly near that spot the year before. This one was only about 75 yards away, but I didn’t want to shoot it, for I had no way of getting it out. So I sat down on a small rock and watched, my rifle in my hands.</p> <p>I could see part of the animal’s head and the top of one shoulder. A moment later it raised up and stepped out into the opening. Then I saw it was not a bear.</p> <p>This, to the best of my recollection, is what the creature looked like and how it acted as it came across the clearing directly toward me. My first impression was of a huge man, about six feet tall, almost three feet wide, and probably weighing somewhere near three hundred pounds. It was covered from head to foot with dark brown silver-tipped hair. But as it came closer I saw by its breasts that it was female.</p> <p>And yet, its torso was not curved like a female’s. Its broad frame was straight from shoulder to hip. Its arms were much thicker than a man’s arms, and longer, reaching almost to its knees. Its feet were broader proportionately than a man’s, about five inches wide at the front and tapering to much thinner heels. When it walked it placed the heel of its foot down first, and I could see the grey-brown skin or hide on the soles of its feet.</p> <p>It came to the edge of the bush I was hiding in, within twenty feet of me, and squatted down on its haunches. Reaching out its hands it pulled the branches of bushes toward it and stripped the leaves with its teeth. Its lips curled flexibly around the leaves as it ate. I was close enough to see that its teeth were white and even.</p> <p>The shape of this creature’s head somewhat resembled a Negro’s. The head was higher at the back than at the front. The nose was broad and flat. The lips and chin protruded farther than its nose. But the hair that covered it, leaving bare only the parts of its face around the mouth, nose and ears, made it resemble an animal as much as a human. None of this hair, even on the back of its head, was longer than an inch, and that on its face was much shorter. Its ears were shaped like a human’s ears. But its eyes were small and black like a bear’s. And its neck also was unhuman. Thicker and shorter than any man’s I had ever seen.</p> <p>As I watched this creature, I wondered if some movie company was making a film at this place and that what I saw was an actor, made up to look partly human and partly animal. But as I observed it more, I decided it would be impossible to fake such a specimen. Anyway, I learned later there was no such company near that area. Nor, in fact, did anyone live up Mica Mountain, according to the people who lived in Tete Jaune Cache.</p> <p>Finally the wild thing must have got my scent, for it looked directly at me through an opening in the brush. A look of amazement crossed its face. It looked so comical at the moment I had to grin. Still in a crouched position, it backed up three or four short steps, then straightened up to its full height and started to walk rapidly back the way it had come. For a moment it watched me over its shoulder as it went, not exactly afraid, but as though it wanted no contact with anything strange.</p> <p>The thought came to me that if I shot it, I would possibly have a specimen of great interest to scientists the world over. I had heard stories of the Sasquatch, the giant hairy Indians that live in the legends of British Columbia Indians, and also many claim, are still in fact alive today. Maybe this was a Sasquatch, I told myself.</p> <p>I levelled my rifle. The creature was still walking rapidly away, again turning its head to look in my direction. I lowered the rifle. Although I have called the creature “it”, I felt now that it was a human being and I knew I would never forgive myself if I killed it.</p> <p>Just as it came to the other patch of brush it threw its head back and made a peculiar noise that seemed to be half laugh and half language, and which I can only describe as a kind of a whinny. Then it walked from the small brush into a stand of lodgepole pine.</p> <p>I stepped out into the opening and looked across a small ridge just beyond the pine to see if I could see it again. It came out on the ridge a couple of hundred yards away from me, tipped its head back again, and again emitted the only sound I had heard it make, but what this half- laugh, half-language was meant to convey, I do not know. It disappeared then, and I never saw it again.</p> <p>I wanted to find out if it lived on vegetation entirely or ate meat as well, so I went down and looked for signs. I found it in five different places, and although I examined it thoroughly, could find no hair or shells of bugs or insects.

Clark</p> <p>Assistant Claims Agent</p> <p>Number D.D. 2822</p> <p>EXHIBIT A.</p> <p>Ever since I was a small boy back in the forest of Michigan, I have studied the lives and habits of wild animals. Later, when I supported my family in Northern Alberta by hunting and trapping, I spent many hours just observing the wild things. They fascinated me. But the most incredible experience I ever had with a wild creature occurred near a little town called Tete Jaune Cache, British Columbia, about eighty miles west of Jasper, Alberta.</p> <p>I had been working on the highway near Tete Jaune Cache for about two years. In October, 1955, I decided to climb five miles up Mica Mountain to an old deserted mine, just for something to do. I came in sight of the mine about three o’clock in the afternoon after an easy climb. I had just come out of a patch of low brush into a clearing when I saw what I thought was a grizzly bear, in the bush on the other side. I had shot a grizzly near that spot the year before. This one was only about 75 yards away, but I didn’t want to shoot it, for I had no way of getting it out. So I sat down on a small rock and watched, my rifle in my hands.</p> <p>I could see part of the animal’s head and the top of one shoulder. A moment later it raised up and stepped out into the opening. Then I saw it was not a bear.</p> <p>This, to the best of my recollection, is what the creature looked like and how it acted as it came across the clearing directly toward me. My first impression was of a huge man, about six feet tall, almost three feet wide, and probably weighing somewhere near three hundred pounds. It was covered from head to foot with dark brown silver-tipped hair. But as it came closer I saw by its breasts that it was female.</p> <p>And yet, its torso was not curved like a female’s. Its broad frame was straight from shoulder to hip. Its arms were much thicker than a man’s arms, and longer, reaching almost to its knees. Its feet were broader proportionately than a man’s, about five inches wide at the front and tapering to much thinner heels. When it walked it placed the heel of its foot down first, and I could see the grey-brown skin or hide on the soles of its feet.</p> <p>It came to the edge of the bush I was hiding in, within twenty feet of me, and squatted down on its haunches. Reaching out its hands it pulled the branches of bushes toward it and stripped the leaves with its teeth. Its lips curled flexibly around the leaves as it ate. I was close enough to see that its teeth were white and even.</p> <p>The shape of this creature’s head somewhat resembled a Negro’s. The head was higher at the back than at the front. The nose was broad and flat. The lips and chin protruded farther than its nose. But the hair that covered it, leaving bare only the parts of its face around the mouth, nose and ears, made it resemble an animal as much as a human. None of this hair, even on the back of its head, was longer than an inch, and that on its face was much shorter. Its ears were shaped like a human’s ears. But its eyes were small and black like a bear’s. And its neck also was unhuman. Thicker and shorter than any man’s I had ever seen.</p> <p>As I watched this creature, I wondered if some movie company was making a film at this place and that what I saw was an actor, made up to look partly human and partly animal. But as I observed it more, I decided it would be impossible to fake such a specimen. Anyway, I learned later there was no such company near that area. Nor, in fact, did anyone live up Mica Mountain, according to the people who lived in Tete Jaune Cache.</p> <p>Finally the wild thing must have got my scent, for it looked directly at me through an opening in the brush. A look of amazement crossed its face. It looked so comical at the moment I had to grin. Still in a crouched position, it backed up three or four short steps, then straightened up to its full height and started to walk rapidly back the way it had come. For a moment it watched me over its shoulder as it went, not exactly afraid, but as though it wanted no contact with anything strange.</p> <p>The thought came to me that if I shot it, I would possibly have a specimen of great interest to scientists the world over. I had heard stories of the Sasquatch, the giant hairy Indians that live in the legends of British Columbia Indians, and also many claim, are still in fact alive today. Maybe this was a Sasquatch, I told myself.</p> <p>I levelled my rifle. The creature was still walking rapidly away, again turning its head to look in my direction. I lowered the rifle. Although I have called the creature “it”, I felt now that it was a human being and I knew I would never forgive myself if I killed it.</p> <p>Just as it came to the other patch of brush it threw its head back and made a peculiar noise that seemed to be half laugh and half language, and which I can only describe as a kind of a whinny. Then it walked from the small brush into a stand of lodgepole pine.</p> <p>I stepped out into the opening and looked across a small ridge just beyond the pine to see if I could see it again. It came out on the ridge a couple of hundred yards away from me, tipped its head back again, and again emitted the only sound I had heard it make, but what this half- laugh, half-language was meant to convey, I do not know. It disappeared then, and I never saw it again.</p> <p>I wanted to find out if it lived on vegetation entirely or ate meat as well, so I went down and looked for signs. I found it in five different places, and although I examined it thoroughly, could find no hair or shells of bugs or insects. So I believe it was strictly a vegetarian.</p> <p>I found one place where it had slept for a couple of nights under a tree. Now, the nights were cool up the mountain, at this time of year especially, and yet it had not used a fire. I found no sign that it possessed even the simplest of tools. Nor a single companion while in this place.</p> <p>Whether this was a Sasquatch I do not know. It will always remain a mystery to me, unless another one is found.</p> <p>I hereby declare the above statement to be in every part true, to the best of my powers of observation and recollection.</p> <p>(Signed) William Roe</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Here is Sundays early release. I will be speaking to four guests tonight. My first guest writes “I’ve recently started tuning into your podcast. My dad told me about it Friday and today I’ve been able to listen to it. And I’ve been listening since 9 this morning. I wanted to share my experience/encounters with you. My name is Sebastian.</p> <p>I have a couple experiences in Illinois and one in Idaho. The first instance took place when my brother and I were walking through the woods out by Staunton lake in Illinois. We went down the spillway and were walking the trails back behind the lake. We were about a mile into the woods and my little brother decided he wanted to stop and rest. So I went to walk a little farther ahead. I walked maybe 50 yards away from him before I realized it was dead silent. Which it wasn’t before. There were birds chirping and squirrels running around and just sounds of activity maybe 5 minutes prior to me realizing. After I realized it was quiet I slowed my pace. And took maybe fifteen more steps before I heard a branch break up the hill to my right. And right after I heard the break there was a low toned grunt that came afterwards. I was 13 at the time. And my little brother was 9. I heard the grunt and immediately took off running back towards my brother. I came barreling past him and all I could say was run. We ran all the way back to the road and made the mile walk back into town. He kept questioning me about why we ran. And I told him about the noise. He didn’t believe me. Well 3 or 4 weeks later we were at the same lake. It was about 9:30 to 10 at night. We were night fishing. We weren’t having any luck so we decided to throw rocks and sticks and anything else we could find across the little cove into the woods on the other side. We had a fairly bright lantern that lit up the other side of the cove, but just to the base of the tree line. We couldn’t see anything else past the tree line. Well maybe 20 minutes after we stopped throwing rocks and everything we heard some movement just out of eye sight on the other side of the cove. And then rocks started coming out of the tree line towards us. None made it to us, they all just hit the water in front of us. At the time I thought it was just people.</p> <p>That’s still a possibility. It wasn’t super remote. I’m not sure what happened out at the lake. And I’ll never know for sure. But my experience in Idaho is a little different. I’m getting goose bumps just typing about it. In 2016 I moved to Idaho with the girl I was seeing at the time. I was 19. We moved to Idaho falls in south east Idaho. Well it was late September and my girlfriends parents and I got into a little argument and I wasn’t wanting to stay there that night. So I packed a blanket and pillow into our 2001 Honda Accord we had, and drove about 8 miles outside of town into the mountains. It was a bright moon and plenty of stars. No light pollution. So it was very well lit. I eventually found this rock road off the main road, and I took it for about another mile. And then a red dirt road came off of the rock road and went back further towards the mountains. I had never been there before so it was all new terrain. I decided to take that dirt road. And it was full of twists and turns and it eventually lead me down the side of the mountain on the backside from where I came in at. It lead down to a valley in between these two mountains. And it had a small river running through it. I got down there and decided that was where I was going to sleep for the night. I shut the car off and the lights. I didn’t have any service on my phone, so I was playing games and smoking cigarettes in the car to try to pass time. It was about midnight. Now from the front of my car to the creek bank was about 6 feet. And I could tell from looking that there was a small drop off from the bank down to the creek. Maybe 3 feet or so. And there were bushes along the bank. The creek itself was maybe 15 feet away. Well anyway something told me to look up from my phone. I’m not sure why I did it. Or what possessed me to look up. But something told me to look up. And when I did I seen this very large hairy man like looking thing standing with it’s back turned to me in the creek. Maybe 20 feet away. Just into the creek. It was a dark brown. Not quite black. Hair was maybe 2 inches in length. I didn’t see arms passed the elbow at first. Then I realized they were kinda bent up. Like it’s hands were by its mouth, so I couldn’t see the forearms. I’m not sure if it was eating fish or what it was doing. But I got terrified.</p> <p>So I flipped the headlights of the car on. When I did that it instantly dropped to the ground. Quicker than I’ve ever seen. It was there then it wasn’t. And in a matter of maybe 2 seconds it went from 20 feet to peeking at me through the bushes right at the edge of the bank. 6 foot away from the front of my car. I could see it’s eyes, and the skin around the eyes. But nothing else. Massive eyes. Almost like baseballs, but just a little smaller. And we locked eyes for what felt like an eternity. But in reality probably no more than 3 or 4 seconds. After those few seconds went by I started the car and slowly started to reverse. When I did it didn’t move, flinch or nothing. Just kept my face in its sight. I backed up a little bit to where I’d be able to drive off and floored it. Sped up the mountain. Almost rolling off in the process of trying to get away. Now I’m a big guy. I’m 6’5 and 280 lbs. I’ve been training in martial arts for the last 9 years now. I know I can hold my own against certain things. I was the same size at 19. I’m 22 now. And I felt helpless. Like I could have fought with everything I had, and it not even register on this things scale, not even faze it. It was immense. I’ve been 15 feet away from a grizzly before while in a vehicle. And I though that was massive. But the grizzly had nothing on what I saw. My shoulder width is just a little over 2 feet. The shoulder width of this was easily two to three times mine. And it was easily a foot and a half to two feet taller than I was if I had to judge it. The back wasn’t necessarily like cut and lean, but I could tell there was a fair amount of muscle in the back. And the back of the arms looked muscular. And it had the cone shaped head. I’ve shared my Illinois encounters with other people. But never my Idaho encounter. And your show made me want to reach out.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Check out Ron's website <a href="http://ronmorehead.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://ronmorehead.com/</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ann writes, “Last year, in spring I had an experience that has significantly and profoundly affected my life in such a way that I am no longer able to enjoy the past times that I have been so deeply in love with since a child.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “My cousin and I were in a church sponsored scout troop in St. Louis, Missouri. We decided that we wanted to go to scout summer camp and since there weren’t enough in our troop that wanted to go we hooked up with another troop in Hillsburo that was also with our church.</p> <p>We paid our fees and were taken south of St. Louis to Hillsburo and then that Monday morning we arrived at S-F Scout Ranch ( pronounced S bar F). Our troop was assigned a camp site and we went out and made ourselves at home. We followed a path for a couple of hundred yards out from the camp building and here and there there were paths that branched off to the various camp sites.</p> <p>Ours was one of the outlying camps and was at the end of the lake that was there. The lake was huge. It wasn’t too wide you could canoe across it in a few minutes but seemed miles long. From out camp we could just see the lake through the trees. Paul and I were just a couple of inner city boys on our first scout camp. Tents were already set up in a circle around a table and fire pit. Our scout leader brought what he called a fly, a tarp supported with poles that we put up over the table to have a dry place to eat when it rains. There was a short pole on the table the went up to the center of the tart where there was a small hole for the pole to go in and it brought the tarp up to a point over the table. The camp supplied a plywood box with a padlock for us to put our food in that we picked up every day at the px. We never locked the padlock since there weren’t any bears around but there were raccoons, skunks and other varmints.</p> <p>The first night I found out how heavy a sleeper Paul was. Normal midnight hijinkage with the new boys the others tried to tip my cot over from the out side of the tent. I heard them coming stealthy like and kept them from pushing mine over but Paul was already asleep and they dumped him over on the floor and ran laughing. Paul picked himself up and as he got back in the cot he asked what happened. This was all by flashlight since there was no electricity at the camp. The next day Paul didn’t remember being knocked over and talking to me. Heavy sleeper.</p> <p>The third night is when the encounter happened. I, unlike Paul, am a light sleeper, now more than I was before that night. I was awakened by something late at night. Didn’t know what it was and couldn’t hear anything at first then I thought I heard something moving around the table. So I got out of the cot and put my left hand on the pole by the door of the tent and with my right I slowly pushed open the tent flap. At first I thought I saw someone at the table but in the moonlight and it being under the tarp I could quite tell what it was. At first I thought it was a bear, but I remember the camp people telling us there were no bear in the area.</p> <p>Suddenly there was a crack and a soft grunt and I could see, my eyes were adjusting to the moonlight, that it was a bigfoot and that it had pried open the food box from the side and bent it up off the hinge. Suddenly I was soo scared I couldn’t move. I watched a sasquatch from about fifteen feet from the side over it’s left shoulder as it was moving something white from the box to it’s mouth. Bread… it was eating our bread. After watching for a while I realized I wasn’t breathing and not wanting it to know I was there I slowly exhaled and took in a breath. Still frozen in place I watched it eat an entire loaf of bread and then start rummaging in the box for more. It found our donuts and ate those.</p> <p>And then suddenly there was a scream of BEAR from across the camp. The sasquatch was leaning over the table and as it had been eating it would straighten up some and it’s head would disappear into the pointed center of the fly and I couldn’t see it’s head but when it was lower it would turn from side to side as it chewed. It was darker under the fly since it was out of the moonlight but I could see the profile. I could not see eyeshine and the eyes did not glow red. When the scream of BEAR rang out the sasquatch stood up straight and when it did it ripped the pegs out of the ground and the fly began to collapse around it’s head. It let out a yell and swung it’s arms around and the fly fell across the table. It turn away from the yell and it noticed me there. It paused for only and instance and then walked quickly towards me.</p> <p>I thought it was coming after me but it was really going between my tent and the next one over. It’s foot got caught on the loose rope and peg from the collapsed fly and pulled it for a second and it seemed to turn that was and pulled it’s leg out of the rope and then disappeared between the tents. I don’t know what came over me but as it went by I stepped out of the tent and watched it disappear into the trees. Lights began appearing from all over the place as everybody but Paul had been awakened in our camp and the adjoining camps. The boy who yelled Bear said he just saw the dark shape since it was all he could see under the tarp outlined by the moonlight on my tent and then he ducked back into his tent. I tried to convince everyone that I could see what it was and that it was a bigfoot. Sasquatch wasn’t really used then and in Missouri it’s called Mo Mo the monster.</p> <p>The next morning there were no tracks since it was a heavy traveled area and I didn’t really feel inclined to go searching for proof in the woods on my own. We had a canoe trip planned for that day and a campout on the other side of the lake. We went and during the night it began to rain and since there was the threat of lighting hitting the lake we hiked in the dark around that massive lake in the rain. The whole way I was searching the woods for the bigfoot. I could hardly sleep the rest of the week and couldn’t wait for the camp to end. The sasquatch was big but not huge. I was able to walk under the fly without ducking down but our scout leader couldn’t. He had to duck and little so it must have been just below 6 feet at the edge. The sasquatch was hunched under the tarp and it’s head would disappear in the peak as it ate. When I stood up it was tall enough to collapse the tarp on itself so it must have been 7 feet tall or more. When it turned and walked past me I was looking up at it’s face and it seemed to tower over the tent. I could feel each step as it went by and it looked big and thick. Lots more detail if your interested and I am willing to communicate more on the encounter.”</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

What we might first assume in a America to be a little man in a green suit or a leprechaun, Kevin explains that something is lost in translation because what he saw was what most would consider to be a 2-3 foot tall little grayish/green alien. Not only did he see it but his family saw it. Kevin said “In our culture we would leave it gifts to leave us alone. My aunt said it had the head of a porcelain doll because it was so smooth and the face did not move.”</p> <p>Kevin goes on to say, “I came to America and joined the Marines. I served this country but my strange experiences did not stop in Ireland I have also seen a Sasquatch.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tree Jumping Creature</strong></p> <p>Spoke to a witness who has agreed to come on the show. He said “Many years ago I worked on cell towers in remote locations. We were in Pennsylvania and I stepped away from the job site to use the bathroom. There are no bathrooms in these remote locations so we used a 5 gallon bucket and a plastic bag. I heard leaves moving around but could not tell where it was coming from.</p> <p>I finished what I was doing and about 40 feet away this thing jumped from the tree, it didn’t fall, it jumped down.It was huge, I mean it was really huge.</p> <p>This is during the day and this thing jumps from the tree and lands. It turned to look at me. This has upset me most of my life. I am not sure what to say, he looked like the ugliest human ever but much bigger and covered in hair. It turned and looked right at me. This thing snarled, growled and showed its teeth. It than turned and walked away. I was in shock. We had been hearing strange noises prior to that like whoops and knocks but we were so busy working we didn’t pay attention. After that day I never went back.”</p> <p>-------</p> <p><strong>The Rock Pile</strong></p> <p>Randy Harrington returns to the show to give us an update on a property he has been investigating with Shane Carpenter along with others. They are putting together evidence on what they have found so far. Randy is known for thinking outside of the box. I had him on a few shows where he talked about setting up a fake campsite and watching it from a distance. Randy says “The creatures sit on this ridge line above our camp and throw rocks at us almost every night. So we decided to give them ammunition to throw at us. We investigated the area during the day and found where they were throwing rocks, so we setup rock piles and marked the rocks with a black marker. Each pile we marked the rocks so we could tell exactly where they were and what pile of rocks they were using. The results were interesting to say the least.”</p> <p>-------</p> <p><strong>The Green Lights</strong></p> <p>A listener writes “Wes, I’ve been listening to the show for about 4 years and I have to say that I am really impressed with the platform you’ve built and the community you’ve brought together. I’m currently a desert rat living in Las Vegas, NV and I wanted to share my personal story of encountering orbs.</p> <p>I have never had a Sasquatch encounter but I definitely believe there is something out there especially with some of the accounts that have been passed down through my family.</p> <p>My encounter took place in Marietta, GA. I was 17 at the time and I had taken a late night flight into Atlanta to see my dad for Christmas. I landed around 9:30pm and it took about an hour to drive to my dad’s house. My dad lives at the end of a cul-de-sac with about 3 miles of forest behind his house. His home is 2 stories with a basement. The main floor overlooks the forest and sits about 30 ft off of the ground with large bay windows overlooking the back deck and the surrounding forest.</p> <p>Once I settled in my dad went off to bed around 11:30pm. I was set up on the couch in the living room that overlooked the woods. Still on Vegas time(3 hours behind) I was wide awake and was sitting comfortably on the couch reading a book. I looked up from the pages and noticed a faint green glow way off in the trees. I thought at the time it was an insect or a lantern but that thought quickly changed. Over the next 15 minutes the light became more defined and appeared to wobble through the woods. As it got closer I could clearly see 3 distinct orbs all lightly bouncing and wobbling about 10ft off the forest floor. As they got closer I began to feel intense fear and the realization that I could not look away became very distinct. These three orbs floated closer until they got to the backyard gate to which they steadily floated up until they were eye level at the bay windows. They were roughly basketball sized, with a pale green luminescence with a slight haze coming off of them. They were lightly translucent and were frankly very beautiful. I felt mesmerized but gripped with fear. They began bobbing up and down in a random sequence slowly and then more vigorously. At this moment I passed out and have no recollection of anything else that night. I woke up with a significant pain on my left forearm and horrible migraine. I noticed a small metallic object a few centimeters under my skin that was blueish silver in color.</p> <p>About 4 years later I was back in Vegas doing an evening hike at calico basin. I summited one of the small mountains and was admiring the night sky when I caught a faint green light in the darkened sky. I could see the rising constellation of Orion at the time and I observed this green light stay perfectly still for about 5 minutes. I became gripped with fear again and quickly got off the mountain and went home. I removed the metal object in my forearm and it was incredibly difficult to do so. I ended up making a small incision and using forceps had to pull it out as my flesh had grown around it. There were tissue fibers attached to it and it was incredibly difficult to break those fibers to remove it. I have attached a photo of the scar left behind by removing this object. The object itself was blueish silver but with almost a dark grey patina.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tree Jumping Creature</p> <p>Spoke to a witness who has agreed to come on the show. He said “Many years ago I worked on cell towers in remote locations. We were in Pennsylvania and I stepped away from the job site to use the bathroom. There are no bathrooms in these remote locations so we used a 5 gallon bucket and a plastic bag. I heard leaves moving around but could not tell where it was coming from.</p> <p>I finished what I was doing and about 40 feet away this thing jumped from the tree, it didn’t fall, it jumped down.It was huge, I mean it was really huge.</p> <p>This is during the day and this thing jumps from the tree and lands. It turned to look at me. This has upset me most of my life. I am not sure what to say, he looked like the ugliest human ever but much bigger and covered in hair. It turned and looked right at me. This thing snarled, growled and showed its teeth. It than turned and walked away. I was in shock. We had been hearing strange noises prior to that like whoops and knocks but we were so busy working we didn’t pay attention. After that day I never went back.”</p> <p>-------</p> <p>The Rock Pile</p> <p>Randy Harrington returns to the show to give us an update on a property he has been investigating with Shane Carpenter along with others. They are putting together evidence on what they have found so far. Randy is known for thinking outside of the box. I had him on a few shows where he talked about setting up a fake campsite and watching it from a distance. Randy says “The creatures sit on this ridge line above our camp and throw rocks at us almost every night. So we decided to give them ammunition to throw at us. We investigated the area during the day and found where they were throwing rocks, so we setup rock piles and marked the rocks with a black marker. Each pile we marked the rocks so we could tell exactly where they were and what pile of rocks they were using. The results were interesting to say the least.”</p> <p>-------</p> <p>The Green Lights</p> <p>A listener writes “Wes, I’ve been listening to the show for about 4 years and I have to say that I am really impressed with the platform you’ve built and the community you’ve brought together. I’m currently a desert rat living in Las Vegas, NV and I wanted to share my personal story of encountering orbs.</p> <p>I have never had a Sasquatch encounter but I definitely believe there is something out there especially with some of the accounts that have been passed down through my family.</p> <p>My encounter took place in Marietta, GA. I was 17 at the time and I had taken a late night flight into Atlanta to see my dad for Christmas. I landed around 9:30pm and it took about an hour to drive to my dad’s house. My dad lives at the end of a cul-de-sac with about 3 miles of forest behind his house. His home is 2 stories with a basement. The main floor overlooks the forest and sits about 30 ft off of the ground with large bay windows overlooking the back deck and the surrounding forest.</p> <p>Once I settled in my dad went off to bed around 11:30pm. I was set up on the couch in the living room that overlooked the woods. Still on Vegas time(3 hours behind) I was wide awake and was sitting comfortably on the couch reading a book. I looked up from the pages and noticed a faint green glow way off in the trees. I thought at the time it was an insect or a lantern but that thought quickly changed. Over the next 15 minutes the light became more defined and appeared to wobble through the woods. As it got closer I could clearly see 3 distinct orbs all lightly bouncing and wobbling about 10ft off the forest floor. As they got closer I began to feel intense fear and the realization that I could not look away became very distinct. These three orbs floated closer until they got to the backyard gate to which they steadily floated up until they were eye level at the bay windows. They were roughly basketball sized, with a pale green luminescence with a slight haze coming off of them. They were lightly translucent and were frankly very beautiful. I felt mesmerized but gripped with fear. They began bobbing up and down in a random sequence slowly and then more vigorously. At this moment I passed out and have no recollection of anything else that night. I woke up with a significant pain on my left forearm and horrible migraine. I noticed a small metallic object a few centimeters under my skin that was blueish silver in color.</p> <p>About 4 years later I was back in Vegas doing an evening hike at calico basin. I summited one of the small mountains and was admiring the night sky when I caught a faint green light in the darkened sky. I could see the rising constellation of Orion at the time and I observed this green light stay perfectly still for about 5 minutes. I became gripped with fear again and quickly got off the mountain and went home. I removed the metal object in my forearm and it was incredibly difficult to do so. I ended up making a small incision and using forceps had to pull it out as my flesh had grown around it. There were tissue fibers attached to it and it was incredibly difficult to break those fibers to remove it. I have attached a photo of the scar left behind by removing this object. The object itself was blueish silver but with almost a dark grey patina. It was hard and almost felt like steel or iron but typically the body will push those heavy metals out of the skin if they are embedded.</p> <p>I am a skeptic and an atheist. I have no belief in most supernatural things as there is little physical evidence to support most claims. I cannot stress how little I actually believe as valid but this experience I cannot rationalize my experience and science tells us it is not only likely but it is statistically impossible for life to not exist outside of our planet. I am not sure if this was extraterrestrial in origin or perhaps a more rational terrestrial event but either way I am only left with questions and a mind grasping to connect the dots.</p> <p>Thank you for reading and for everything you do Wes!”</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “I shot one in 1995 deer hunting in the area around Oregon caves out of cave junction where I live. Have had a few other encounters and photos of footprints while hunting wild mushrooms, let me know if you are interested...”</p> <p>He said he was hunting and the night before they kept hearing someone or something around their camp. The next day he found a large boulder to sit on that over looked a clearing. He sat for awhile... then something stood up. The witness said “He was looking directly at me and I could see everything. I do not remember chambering a round. This thing started running so fast and I started shooting. I know I hit it 3 times in the back. It fell to its knees and got up and just ran off. I realized it was running in the direction of our camp and my friend was at the camp. I heard my friend start shooting. I ran back to the camp while it was leaving. The following night was a nightmare. Several of these things showed up and they were mad. I fired off almost all the ammo I had that night. The next morning we left. There are other things that happen.”</p> <p>--------</p> <p>Our second guest writes, “June 2009, early summer here in West Virginia. I lived in Ohio County on the outskirts of Wheeling. Which I know is a major city, yet it’s surrounded by thick tree on top of tree strangling wilderness.</p> <p>I lived approximately five miles outside of town back in the rural suburbs on a gravel road with two other neighbors. The property line of my house pressed right up against the Spidel Golf Course of Olgebay Park. I could see the 18th hole flag from my porch. There is a large tree in the middle of my yard, the yard itself slopes downward it’s some what of a hill. A few things happened leading up to this encounter, now I’m not gonna say I never believed in Sasquatch. I’m an open guy, I’ve had some run ins with the paranormal. From things that happened in my child hood to my early adult life. Yet I thought that this was a Pacific Northwest phenomenon, I had never heard of these creatures in Appalachia. If I knew now what I knew then, talk about going down the Rabbit Hole. All that opened up to me after seeing these things. I can’t rightly remember what day it was, all I know is it was around 10 pm. And my wife at the time, and I were about to leave the house and go to Blockbuster before it closed. I walked out onto the porch and let my cat out, he was a big ole tabby. And wasn’t afraid of damn near anything. As I walked down the three steps of the porch, I saw a flash of white and my cat had zipped back up the stairs and straight back into the house as I had left the door open.</p> <p>I just shook my head and began walking the path around to go down the other stairs to where we parked the cars. I stopped in my tracks, this overwhelming feeling of being watched. I’m not gonna lie I was petrified, yet I lifted my head up and started scanning the barrier of thickets and bramble that marked my property line. I saw some eyes looking back at me, the light from my porch making these eyes shine an orange like color, almost red. I stared at it, as it stared at me. I was about forty feet from the creature. It stood leaning against a tree, not just leaning it had on arm wrapped around the tree itself and even as it stared at me it would slowly rock to the side. I myself couldn’t move, I was frozen in place and the fear that gripped me. Was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It didn’t make any threatening motions, nor did it purse it’s lips or any of that monkey stuff. It was ape like and yet humanlike. The stare down only lasted two minutes, but it felt like an eternity. My wife called out to me from inside the house, the creature took it’s eyes off of me and looked towards my doorway. I too looked back at the door way, and then my head snapped back to the creature. It was no longer standing there, it was now walking away up a rolling hill side. In the light of the moon I could make out it’s back muscles and butt. It was like a guy on steroids. It kept walking until it disappeared into the tree line at the top of the hill.</p> <p>I tried to tell my wife about it, but she just thought I was trying to scare her. She would eventually believe me, as this wouldn’t be the last time we saw it or others. A few weeks would pass before we saw anything more, but upon seeing it. It opened my eyes up even more to the on goings around me. From the sounds I heard to things, I would notice. From something slapping the house in the middle of the night, to finding big rocks on the roof of my back porch. Blood curdling screams, that sounded like the came from not to far away. I’m not a hunter, but I do know the woods around me. I am however an avid fisherman, and I spend a lot of time down on the Ohio River and the creeks that bleed into it. I was a boy scout as a kid and we had to identify animals and their traits to gain badges. And I’m telling you there is no animal like this animal out there. I tried telling my family, my dad said no such thing. And my mom had a good chuckle. I apologize for not giving you more to go on. Hope to hear from you soon.”</p> <p>--------</p> <p>And our final guest writes, “We have had several strange occurrences during the past two years. The following have been occurring:Our dogs in our kennel have been barking non-stop all night, every night for the past year up to about 3 weeks ago (see below).</p> <p>On one occasion, one dog kennel (chain link fencing) was smashed in as if a bear or other large creature had tried to get at the dogs. We have had bear sightings in the past two years. However, that bear was shot and killed by a local farmer about 1 1/2 years ago (prior to this incident). No other bear activity since that time to our knowledge.</p> <p>Our next door neighbors have also heard whoops and other odd noises. The gentleman that lives there is a true frontier-style woodsman and has lived on the land all his life. As an avid hunter and outdoorsman, he is extremely familiar with the land and surrounding properties.

Upon arriving home one evening, there was a very loud tree knock as we exited our vehicle. We have heard what sounds like two men having a muffled conversation behind our home a few times. Often, after dark specifically, there is an occasional wet dog/skunky smell in the air and noises in the surrounding woods.</p> <p>Our motion sensor lights have been tripping almost nightly (until 3 weeks ago).

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Rob writes “I am from the state of Georgia. I had a encounter back in February 2019. I had been scouting for some wild hogs when I came upon a smell that would run a buzzard off a outhouse.Trying to find the source and looking down at the ground I caught movement to my right and looked up to see this creature some 80 feet from me. Dark brown eyes as dark as his coat. Scared 10 years off me.”</p> <p>Spoke to the eyewitness and while scouting an area he came face to face with a Sasquatch. He said “I just could not believe what I was seeing, I think it was just as surprised to see me as I was seeing it. It looked at my gun and looked back up at me.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Howard writes “I wanted to relate to you a sighting I had as a child in Tahlequah Oklahoma. My mother originally from California was adopted by a couple who lived in this area. It is a beautiful region with the Illinois river literally in there back yard. We live in the central part of the state and as a child we would go and visit my grandpa Pete and his wife. They lived a cabin that they had built because Grandpa Pete was a Cherokee elder so everyone in the area was of Cherokee decent. This place was a kids paradise. On the day I saw the Man at the river I was 11 and my brother 13 we had went to play in the old cabin they moved out of a few years back. As I said you could see the river from the old cabin. We were just being kids and playing when my brother said look at the guy by the water. I finally figured out what he was looking at that’s when I noticed it was covered in hair it was about 100 yards away so detail is tough. My thought never went to bigfoot as I didn’t know what that was at the time Im now 48. Being a smart ass kid this guy was clearly on my grandpas property so I yelled HEY. This is where it all went south this man turned and screamed like the sounds I heard on the Jurrasic Park episode in east Texas. Then it bolted running down the tree line eventually disappearing. I really just thought it was a person so we started back playing as kids do when out of no where the neighbor come running to us ordering to get to the cabin. Once we got inside Grandpa Pete and the guy went back outside. They were speaking Cherokee so I had no clue. When Grandpa Pete returned he asked what we saw so we both told him the same thing. We were not aloud past the first cabin for the whole weekend when asked who the guy was he said the river belongs to them right now so don’t go down there they are just passing through.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dylan writes "Wes, I want to tell you about an experience that I had with Bigfoot around Lena Lake in Washington state in the Olympic National Park.</p> <p>It was during a camping trip that I had with my dad and the interaction occurred while we were sleeping in our hammocks. We both awoke to what I first assumed was a bear because of the breathing noise it made. It wasn't until I looked through the gap in my tarp that I realized that the creature was standing and had arms. This camping trip was cut a little short because of some other concerns that we had while we were hiking. My dad and I only spoke once about this the next morning and after he told me that he was convinced that we had a bear problem I decided not to tell him what I saw.</p> <p>Shoot me an email if you'd like to hear more about the experience and why we decided to cut our trip short. To this day I haven't told anyone about the encounter because I've always thought of Bigfoot as a dumb joke and I never wanted to sound like a hypocrite to my friends."</p> <p> </p> <p>My second guest is Joe. Joe writes "Hi Wes, I’m from Ohio. I’m a huge fan of your show and I have been wrestling with the idea of mailing you and telling my story. But I guess if I’m going to tell anyone (outside my family) it would be you.</p> <p>Im an avid outdoorsman and have been spending as much time in the woods hunting, fishing, and hiking since I was six years old. My brother and I started out as our fathers hunting dogs, tromping on brush piles kicking up rabbits and pheasant for our dad and I’ve been hooked ever since. My Bigfoot story starts a few years back when we started hunting a new lease. Our second season in, It started out with hearing what sounded like someone talking far off in the woods , but you just couldn’t make it out. Which seemed odd but there are some(not many) but some people who live around the area. I brushed it off the first time, then a few days later my brother and I went hunting again and I heard the same thing, I was beginning to wonder what it was and was going to tell my brother about it, but I didn’t have to say anything to him. When I came out of the woods that evening he meet me at the truck and the first thing he said was “did you hear those people talking?” Not wanting to tip my hand I said I thought I did but couldn’t make it out,,, and he said “yeah same here. But it got kinda close and it was like they were talking gibberish!” That ride home was spent talking about what we both heard and then I introduced him to ur show. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to believe but he was about to get on board really soon. We both hunt pretty often and two weeks later we had both been to the woods multiple times and each had a few more “odd” things go on. A few more talking episodes a whoop or two a rock clacking incident, a few weird things but nothing that was definitively anything.</p> <p>All could possibly be explained away essentially. Then one morning about 3weeks after the initial incidents I had a work commitment and couldn’t join my brother in the woods. At about 530-6 in the morning I get a call from my brother, hoping nothing went wrong as I knew he’d be walking into his stand I answered and he immediately sounded upset. After a few minutes of calming him down, I finally got it out of him that something had “screamed at him as he was almost to his stand”. My brother is a tough guy, always was the bigger brother, my protector. And I had never heard him sound as scared as he was in that call. He told me it was like nothing he had ever heard before, it sounded like it was wanting to rip him apart he said. He also said there was something that sounded like grunting and growling together after the screaming, he said he could feel it shaking in his chest. He wanted to run, and hide all at the same time. He chose getting up in his stand and waiting on the sun to rise. He called me from his stand. He made me stay on the phone with him until he was ready to walk out.. I should probably mention that this is taking place in mid October. Ohio’s hunting season starts the last weekend of sept and my second time in the stand(which was day two of the season) is when this all began. It had been a pretty wet year so the majority of the leaves and foliage were still hanging on. My brothers stand was in a pretty thick area of our property. So as I tried to keep him calm and quiet and have him listen for things moving around him. Suddenly as we were on the phone he heard something and shushed me and said he thought he heard something. It was approaching that point in the morning when the woods seem to suddenly appear b4 ur eyes, that special morning time. Suddenly he panicked and said something exploded out of some brush about 75yds away and sounded like a freight train going thru the woods,, luckily going away from him and not towards the car. He waited till he couldn’t hear anything else and high tailed it outta there. A few days later after the shock of it all kinda subsided we went back to our land and tried to find some signs of the thing. Other than a few broken branches there wasn’t much and needless to say my brother, who I credited for even going back, wasn’t wanting to stay real long. So we got his stand and left the area.</p> <p>We stayed outta the woods for a few days, but the rut was about to start and we couldn’t stay away forever. We’re just to big of hunters and as I was thinking about it and discussing it, my brother and I convinced ourselves that if whatever made those screams wanted to hurt him it could have done whatever it wanted. It was probably just a warning. So we decided to give whatever it was that side of the property and we’d move to another part of the lease and just be careful. So back to the woods we went. A few hunts later, about a week or so, I was in my stand enjoying a beautiful afternoon. Now the woods at this time end of October early November are starting to thin out a little bit. It was one of those days when a strong breeze makes it look like it’s snowing leaves. It was about the last hour or two of the day when I heard it again,, the chatter. Only this time it was a little higher pitched than I remembered. I was on full alert at this point, then I started to hear something that sounded like it was approaching,, but it just didn’t sound right.. now my stand sits on top of ridge there’s about 30yds of flat(that is loaded with oaks) then it goes into valleys on either side. On my left which is the side my stand is on,, on the hillside there is two natural shelves one about 20ish yds down (which by the way the bucks love to cruise and scent check) and another about 50-60yds down. I can always see the closer shelf but the further one down is hard to see because of all the brush. But I do have two shooting lanes cut down there for gun season. Anyway just laying out what I’m looking at. So like said I could hear something coming my way but sounded weird. As I’m studying the woods the chatter and sounds start to become clearer. The chatter sounded like two monkeys chitchatting and the sounds seemed to be coming from the up in the trees and something walking on the ground. Suddenly I swore I could see the trees moving out in front of me to left. And it seemed as soon as I thought I was seeing that, I heard a noise I never heard in my life. It was like a grunt and huff and deep bark all rolled into one. And after that everything went silent. It was eerily quiet, no sound no movement nothing. Sat for what seemed like an eternity, probably two minutes lol,, but then the wind started moving and as a bigger gust came along the leaves began snowing again and I heard it again only in two tsk tsk sounds and at that point I heard some limbs breaking and what sounded like two tree stumps landed with two distinct thuds and was followed by two clearly running down the hill sounds. I never saw what made that noise but definitely sounded like two separate things running away and wasn’t bounding away like deer or anything else in the woods I had ever heard b4. Those ended kinda quickly. After the initial shock of that my attention immediately turned to what made the deeper grunts and tsk sounds. It sound like it came from the lower shelf but out in front of me. I studied and studied the woods for anything!! Any sort of something wrong in the woods, any sound any movement anything. Then the usually bane of my existence in the woods, the squirrels that seem to constantly run all around my stand came again. One of those furry bastards came from the other side of the flat and started down the other side towards the sounds.</p> <p>I was looking at the squirrel,, staring in the direction of the noises when suddenly the squirrel, which had got pretty close to where I thought the sounds came from, shot up a tree and immediately began barking his head off. As I again began studying the woods I caught the slightest movement.. a movement that changed my life. I finally remembered I took my crossbow that day instead of my usual compound, so I slowly raised and looked through my scope and saw it. A hand, just a hand that was wrapped around a big oak holding on. I stared at it and stared. Not believing it at first I looked off the scope blinking and looked again and it moved. Repositioning itself very slowly and methodically. I stared into that scope looking on both sides of that tree looking for what that hand was attached to. When suddenly very slowly and methodically a face began to creep around the tree looking directly at me. I was frozen and knew that she was looking at me and immediately knew by her expression that she knew I was seeing her. She looked panicked for a split second then immediately withdrew her face. At this point I’m in a state of disbelief not believing what my eyes just saw. It was dark skinned and had longer hair hanging down on the face but not very much hair on the face. I continue to stare down at the tree. When she moved her face back she also pulled her hand back. I sat there looking intently for what I instantly knew what I had saw. There was no mistaking it. Finally the long wait was interrupted by a loud clacking sound. Like someone taking two rocks and banging them together rapidly. It came in three quick bursts and was followed by a quick higher pitched whistle. This definitely got my and the attention of the mother that was below me. She made a sound like she was shushing the little ones down the hill. Or what I assume was the little ones. She then peeked her head out from behind the tree and was looking at me again. I instinctively lifted my bow and looked down at her and her face had taken on new much more fierce and clearly was not happy I was there and I assume wasn’t happy I was so close to her and her babies.</p> <p>She then stepped from one tree to another,, to another every few minutes whenever the leaves would start falling heavy again. I’d catch glimpses of her and see her for a second or so. she was about 7ft tall and had a bigger but still somehow lean build. I could see breasts on her, which is why I keep calling her mom. Another long pause with her outta sight, but I knew she hadn’t left the area. The exact spot she was in she would’ve had to either drop down a weird drop off which I felt I woulda heard, go back the way she came, or cross thru one of my shooting lanes. I was scanning the area with my scope looking for anything and that’s when she stepped into the lane and turned to face me. she was about 80-100yds or so away, and when she did this I was looking at her through the scope and I regret doing that now. I don’t know if she took it as aggression but as she stopped and turned she stood there for a sec and then got into a (for lack of a better way of saying it) an aggressive stance and began to growl and show her teeth to me and took two or three steps towards me. I lowered my bow instantly and even went as far as to hang it up on my extendable hanger. As I did that she stopped gave me one more mean look and walked briskly away. I could hear her moving down the hill, I then heard a louder whistle and heard the two (I assume babies) start moving down the hill away from me. They cleared about 400yds of downhill in a matter of seconds and when I could barely hear them I heard a loud grunt and suddenly a giant pop and crashing. Sounded like a larger tree being pushed over and snapping. I felt very shaken and extremely unwelcome instantly. After the woods settled down for a second and I was able to shake the shock and shakes enough to climb down from my stand and made the walk back to the vehicle ASAP.</p> <p>On my way home I tried calling my brother but he and his fiancé were at a function and he wasn’t able to answer me, so I left him a message and just hoped he would call me back. He unfortunately didn’t and the next morning he went hunting and went down the hill and past where I heard the Bigfoot exit the area I wAs in the night b4. On his stand he finally took some time to check his voicemail and heard my abbreviated story and on his way out was intrigued, searched around for a lil bit, and saw a tree that was broken and fallen. I’ll include a picture he took of the tree. It’s a tree that for no other reason should have been broken or damaged, as it was a perfectly healthy tree and there were no storms or anything else that could have done what happened to this tree. It has been two years since this has happened and I and my family have still been hunting this land. We have been extra careful and have adopted a live and let live attitude about this property.</p> <p>I and my brother have each shot deer and left them as “presents” for the Bigfoot. We love this piece of land and we also have our children who we bring with us to hunt (but we never let them hunt alone) and we can’t help but be hunters and enthusiasts about the search for an unknown species. As we’ve hunted over the last few years we have both shot deer and have left them over night, only to find significant blood trails that lead to pools of blood, hair everywhere, but no deer. We looked on these as “peace offerings” and haven’t ever pushed the issue on finding these deer. We have always had an extra agenda on our minds, and we have had a few more experiences (also floating lights which we were able to get a pic of one) and “things” go on.. but nothing like what I saw that day. I believe that our land is more of a summer into fall location, bcuz as soon as our land loses its leaves and we get into full winter the activity drops off and as full winter hits we lose all activity. We are pretty close to the Tappan Lake region(like two miles or less) which has had its fair share of sightings and claims over the years. And is about 20miles from the famed salt fork state park. I am more than a believer, just like you Wes. I am “knower” that we as humans share this land with an unknown biped.</p> <p>I also believe that our government is definitely aware of these creatures and is actively protecting them, monitoring them, and possibly even protecting and possibly moving them as they see fit. I’ve saved this last bit for the ending of my message to you as it may be the most unexplainable part of my experiences. This past fall I was in my stand for another hunt when I heard a helicopter approaching. Odd, but not totally extraordinary. But as it came closer I could see the heli beginning to slow down about 3/4 to 1 mile away and began slowly circling a smaller in size area. Suddenly the chopper blades became extremely loud and making an odd but very loud, bum bum bum slow and steady sound as it circled and began lowering. As it started to drop out of sight all of a sudden there was no sound anymore!! Even though I could still see the heli for a few seconds b4 it dropped out of visuals. And when I say no sound I mean no sound whatsoever! Then there was about a 5min gap of zero sound from the area where I knew the helicopter had circled down.</p> <p>I was dumbfounded by all of this, and as u know 5mins in the woods can seem like a day when exciting things are going on. When all of a sudden the extremely loud bum bum bum erupted again and I saw the heli rise up from the same spot. It lasted for about 30 seconds as it slowly rose and circled again then the sound of regular chopper began again and the heli moved around behind and I lost sight of it, but could still hear it and even though I couldn’t see it the loud bum bum bum sounds came and went again where I couldn’t see it. Only this time I heard something else. As the loud noises came the second time I heard some loud huffs and smaller scream/whooping noises accompanied by crashing and what sounded like something throwing something big and some more crashing noises from out in front of me. For some “visuals”.... the heli came from my back and to the left to out in front of me to the left. It then circled back from the same way it came,,, my left and circled behind me to 45degrees to my rear right shoulder. The noises I heard came from in front of my right shoulder about 45degrees. Just so you can picture it...... Now my rational thought immediately tried to explain this away as maybe there was an emergency that an emergency rescue or life flight was being executed. That seems logical as there are boaters, hunters and outdoor enthusiasts in the area. So I began to research that. I have friends who work at the two closest hospitals that would and are able to accommodate life flights and they both looked into the matter and neither had any flights come in within a week b4 or after the date in which this happened. So I struck out to try and find another resident of the area that had heard or saw anything weird. It had been about 4-5 days since the incident and a few people had heard something weird but no one close to where I knew the heli had went down. The area I saw the noise come from was particularly weird. I knew there was a home pretty close to that area and so I went there to try and start a dialogue. I started out as “neighbor” who had just got permission to the neighboring property and was wanting some hunting and property line info. The man and woman were extremely nice and were more than willing to help. We chatted for a about 10mins when I started to put out there that I was hunting another property close by. At the first mention of that there demeanor instantly began to change. We had ventured about 100yds or so from their house as we were chatting. And as i saw their attitude change I immediately decided to drop the bomb on them.</p> <p>I said I was hunting and had saw a helicopter circling around close to their property and they immediately shut down!!! They started walking back to their house and I kept right with them and began asking every question I could about seeing it hearing it, what they saw and everything else I could. They didn’t answer a single question. They just kept saying they didn’t know what I was talking about and were actively trying to get away from me. I went as far as sticking my foot in the door to keep them from shutting it in my face. The last thing I heard from these people was “we didn’t see anything, and if we did we wouldn’t tell you!!!” This obviously piqued my interest quite a bit. But I’ve yet to get any farther with anyone else around the area either....??? So Wes that’s my long story. Sorry for the lengthy message but as I was writing you it just kept coming out, and believe it or not I’ve left out some stuff. If you’d like to chat I’d be happy to, if not I understand. I’m sure you get a lot of people that contact you. Im just happy that there is someone like you who does what you do and helps people out as much as you do. You truly are a much needed outlet for people like us who come away from these encounters and “strange things” not knowing what or how to feel or deal with the stress of it all. Thanks again Wes have a great week."</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dylan writes "Wes, I want to tell you about an experience that I had with Bigfoot around Lena Lake in Washington state in the Olympic National Park.</p> <p>It was during a camping trip that I had with my dad and the interaction occurred while we were sleeping in our hammocks. We both awoke to what I first assumed was a bear because of the breathing noise it made. It wasn't until I looked through the gap in my tarp that I realized that the creature was standing and had arms. This camping trip was cut a little short because of some other concerns that we had while we were hiking. My dad and I only spoke once about this the next morning and after he told me that he was convinced that we had a bear problem I decided not to tell him what I saw.</p> <p>Shoot me an email if you'd like to hear more about the experience and why we decided to cut our trip short. To this day I haven't told anyone about the encounter because I've always thought of Bigfoot as a dumb joke and I never wanted to sound like a hypocrite to my friends."</p> <p> </p> <p>My second guest is Joe. Joe writes "Hi Wes, I’m from Ohio. I’m a huge fan of your show and I have been wrestling with the idea of mailing you and telling my story. But I guess if I’m going to tell anyone (outside my family) it would be you.</p> <p>Im an avid outdoorsman and have been spending as much time in the woods hunting, fishing, and hiking since I was six years old. My brother and I started out as our fathers hunting dogs, tromping on brush piles kicking up rabbits and pheasant for our dad and I’ve been hooked ever since. My Bigfoot story starts a few years back when we started hunting a new lease. Our second season in, It started out with hearing what sounded like someone talking far off in the woods , but you just couldn’t make it out. Which seemed odd but there are some(not many) but some people who live around the area. I brushed it off the first time, then a few days later my brother and I went hunting again and I heard the same thing, I was beginning to wonder what it was and was going to tell my brother about it, but I didn’t have to say anything to him. When I came out of the woods that evening he meet me at the truck and the first thing he said was “did you hear those people talking?” Not wanting to tip my hand I said I thought I did but couldn’t make it out,,, and he said “yeah same here. But it got kinda close and it was like they were talking gibberish!” That ride home was spent talking about what we both heard and then I introduced him to ur show. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to believe but he was about to get on board really soon. We both hunt pretty often and two weeks later we had both been to the woods multiple times and each had a few more “odd” things go on. A few more talking episodes a whoop or two a rock clacking incident, a few weird things but nothing that was definitively anything.</p> <p>All could possibly be explained away essentially. Then one morning about 3weeks after the initial incidents I had a work commitment and couldn’t join my brother in the woods. At about 530-6 in the morning I get a call from my brother, hoping nothing went wrong as I knew he’d be walking into his stand I answered and he immediately sounded upset. After a few minutes of calming him down, I finally got it out of him that something had “screamed at him as he was almost to his stand”. My brother is a tough guy, always was the bigger brother, my protector. And I had never heard him sound as scared as he was in that call. He told me it was like nothing he had ever heard before, it sounded like it was wanting to rip him apart he said. He also said there was something that sounded like grunting and growling together after the screaming, he said he could feel it shaking in his chest. He wanted to run, and hide all at the same time. He chose getting up in his stand and waiting on the sun to rise. He called me from his stand. He made me stay on the phone with him until he was ready to walk out.. I should probably mention that this is taking place in mid October. Ohio’s hunting season starts the last weekend of sept and my second time in the stand(which was day two of the season) is when this all began. It had been a pretty wet year so the majority of the leaves and foliage were still hanging on. My brothers stand was in a pretty thick area of our property. So as I tried to keep him calm and quiet and have him listen for things moving around him. Suddenly as we were on the phone he heard something and shushed me and said he thought he heard something. It was approaching that point in the morning when the woods seem to suddenly appear b4 ur eyes, that special morning time. Suddenly he panicked and said something exploded out of some brush about 75yds away and sounded like a freight train going thru the woods,, luckily going away from him and not towards the car. He waited till he couldn’t hear anything else and high tailed it outta there. A few days later after the shock of it all kinda subsided we went back to our land and tried to find some signs of the thing. Other than a few broken branches there wasn’t much and needless to say my brother, who I credited for even going back, wasn’t wanting to stay real long. So we got his stand and left the area.</p> <p>We stayed outta the woods for a few days, but the rut was about to start and we couldn’t stay away forever. We’re just to big of hunters and as I was thinking about it and discussing it, my brother and I convinced ourselves that if whatever made those screams wanted to hurt him it could have done whatever it wanted. It was probably just a warning. So we decided to give whatever it was that side of the property and we’d move to another part of the lease and just be careful. So back to the woods we went. A few hunts later, about a week or so, I was in my stand enjoying a beautiful afternoon. Now the woods at this time end of October early November are starting to thin out a little bit. It was one of those days when a strong breeze makes it look like it’s snowing leaves. It was about the last hour or two of the day when I heard it again,, the chatter. Only this time it was a little higher pitched than I remembered. I was on full alert at this point, then I started to hear something that sounded like it was approaching,, but it just didn’t sound right.. now my stand sits on top of ridge there’s about 30yds of flat(that is loaded with oaks) then it goes into valleys on either side. On my left which is the side my stand is on,, on the hillside there is two natural shelves one about 20ish yds down (which by the way the bucks love to cruise and scent check) and another about 50-60yds down. I can always see the closer shelf but the further one down is hard to see because of all the brush. But I do have two shooting lanes cut down there for gun season. Anyway just laying out what I’m looking at. So like said I could hear something coming my way but sounded weird. As I’m studying the woods the chatter and sounds start to become clearer. The chatter sounded like two monkeys chitchatting and the sounds seemed to be coming from the up in the trees and something walking on the ground. Suddenly I swore I could see the trees moving out in front of me to left. And it seemed as soon as I thought I was seeing that, I heard a noise I never heard in my life. It was like a grunt and huff and deep bark all rolled into one. And after that everything went silent. It was eerily quiet, no sound no movement nothing. Sat for what seemed like an eternity, probably two minutes lol,, but then the wind started moving and as a bigger gust came along the leaves began snowing again and I heard it again only in two tsk tsk sounds and at that point I heard some limbs breaking and what sounded like two tree stumps landed with two distinct thuds and was followed by two clearly running down the hill sounds. I never saw what made that noise but definitely sounded like two separate things running away and wasn’t bounding away like deer or anything else in the woods I had ever heard b4. Those ended kinda quickly. After the initial shock of that my attention immediately turned to what made the deeper grunts and tsk sounds. It sound like it came from the lower shelf but out in front of me. I studied and studied the woods for anything!! Any sort of something wrong in the woods, any sound any movement anything. Then the usually bane of my existence in the woods, the squirrels that seem to constantly run all around my stand came again. One of those furry bastards came from the other side of the flat and started down the other side towards the sounds.</p> <p>I was looking at the squirrel,, staring in the direction of the noises when suddenly the squirrel, which had got pretty close to where I thought the sounds came from, shot up a tree and immediately began barking his head off. As I again began studying the woods I caught the slightest movement.. a movement that changed my life. I finally remembered I took my crossbow that day instead of my usual compound, so I slowly raised and looked through my scope and saw it. A hand, just a hand that was wrapped around a big oak holding on. I stared at it and stared. Not believing it at first I looked off the scope blinking and looked again and it moved. Repositioning itself very slowly and methodically. I stared into that scope looking on both sides of that tree looking for what that hand was attached to. When suddenly very slowly and methodically a face began to creep around the tree looking directly at me. I was frozen and knew that she was looking at me and immediately knew by her expression that she knew I was seeing her. She looked panicked for a split second then immediately withdrew her face. At this point I’m in a state of disbelief not believing what my eyes just saw. It was dark skinned and had longer hair hanging down on the face but not very much hair on the face. I continue to stare down at the tree. When she moved her face back she also pulled her hand back. I sat there looking intently for what I instantly knew what I had saw. There was no mistaking it. Finally the long wait was interrupted by a loud clacking sound. Like someone taking two rocks and banging them together rapidly. It came in three quick bursts and was followed by a quick higher pitched whistle. This definitely got my and the attention of the mother that was below me. She made a sound like she was shushing the little ones down the hill. Or what I assume was the little ones. She then peeked her head out from behind the tree and was looking at me again. I instinctively lifted my bow and looked down at her and her face had taken on new much more fierce and clearly was not happy I was there and I assume wasn’t happy I was so close to her and her babies.</p> <p>She then stepped from one tree to another,, to another every few minutes whenever the leaves would start falling heavy again. I’d catch glimpses of her and see her for a second or so. she was about 7ft tall and had a bigger but still somehow lean build. I could see breasts on her, which is why I keep calling her mom. Another long pause with her outta sight, but I knew she hadn’t left the area. The exact spot she was in she would’ve had to either drop down a weird drop off which I felt I woulda heard, go back the way she came, or cross thru one of my shooting lanes. I was scanning the area with my scope looking for anything and that’s when she stepped into the lane and turned to face me. she was about 80-100yds or so away, and when she did this I was looking at her through the scope and I regret doing that now. I don’t know if she took it as aggression but as she stopped and turned she stood there for a sec and then got into a (for lack of a better way of saying it) an aggressive stance and began to growl and show her teeth to me and took two or three steps towards me. I lowered my bow instantly and even went as far as to hang it up on my extendable hanger. As I did that she stopped gave me one more mean look and walked briskly away. I could hear her moving down the hill, I then heard a louder whistle and heard the two (I assume babies) start moving down the hill away from me. They cleared about 400yds of downhill in a matter of seconds and when I could barely hear them I heard a loud grunt and suddenly a giant pop and crashing. Sounded like a larger tree being pushed over and snapping. I felt very shaken and extremely unwelcome instantly. After the woods settled down for a second and I was able to shake the shock and shakes enough to climb down from my stand and made the walk back to the vehicle ASAP.</p> <p>On my way home I tried calling my brother but he and his fiancé were at a function and he wasn’t able to answer me, so I left him a message and just hoped he would call me back. He unfortunately didn’t and the next morning he went hunting and went down the hill and past where I heard the Bigfoot exit the area I wAs in the night b4. On his stand he finally took some time to check his voicemail and heard my abbreviated story and on his way out was intrigued, searched around for a lil bit, and saw a tree that was broken and fallen. I’ll include a picture he took of the tree. It’s a tree that for no other reason should have been broken or damaged, as it was a perfectly healthy tree and there were no storms or anything else that could have done what happened to this tree. It has been two years since this has happened and I and my family have still been hunting this land. We have been extra careful and have adopted a live and let live attitude about this property.</p> <p>I and my brother have each shot deer and left them as “presents” for the Bigfoot. We love this piece of land and we also have our children who we bring with us to hunt (but we never let them hunt alone) and we can’t help but be hunters and enthusiasts about the search for an unknown species. As we’ve hunted over the last few years we have both shot deer and have left them over night, only to find significant blood trails that lead to pools of blood, hair everywhere, but no deer. We looked on these as “peace offerings” and haven’t ever pushed the issue on finding these deer. We have always had an extra agenda on our minds, and we have had a few more experiences (also floating lights which we were able to get a pic of one) and “things” go on.. but nothing like what I saw that day. I believe that our land is more of a summer into fall location, bcuz as soon as our land loses its leaves and we get into full winter the activity drops off and as full winter hits we lose all activity. We are pretty close to the Tappan Lake region(like two miles or less) which has had its fair share of sightings and claims over the years. And is about 20miles from the famed salt fork state park. I am more than a believer, just like you Wes. I am “knower” that we as humans share this land with an unknown biped.</p> <p>I also believe that our government is definitely aware of these creatures and is actively protecting them, monitoring them, and possibly even protecting and possibly moving them as they see fit. I’ve saved this last bit for the ending of my message to you as it may be the most unexplainable part of my experiences. This past fall I was in my stand for another hunt when I heard a helicopter approaching. Odd, but not totally extraordinary. But as it came closer I could see the heli beginning to slow down about 3/4 to 1 mile away and began slowly circling a smaller in size area. Suddenly the chopper blades became extremely loud and making an odd but very loud, bum bum bum slow and steady sound as it circled and began lowering. As it started to drop out of sight all of a sudden there was no sound anymore!! Even though I could still see the heli for a few seconds b4 it dropped out of visuals. And when I say no sound I mean no sound whatsoever! Then there was about a 5min gap of zero sound from the area where I knew the helicopter had circled down.</p> <p>I was dumbfounded by all of this, and as u know 5mins in the woods can seem like a day when exciting things are going on. When all of a sudden the extremely loud bum bum bum erupted again and I saw the heli rise up from the same spot. It lasted for about 30 seconds as it slowly rose and circled again then the sound of regular chopper began again and the heli moved around behind and I lost sight of it, but could still hear it and even though I couldn’t see it the loud bum bum bum sounds came and went again where I couldn’t see it. Only this time I heard something else. As the loud noises came the second time I heard some loud huffs and smaller scream/whooping noises accompanied by crashing and what sounded like something throwing something big and some more crashing noises from out in front of me. For some “visuals”.... the heli came from my back and to the left to out in front of me to the left. It then circled back from the same way it came,,, my left and circled behind me to 45degrees to my rear right shoulder. The noises I heard came from in front of my right shoulder about 45degrees. Just so you can picture it...... Now my rational thought immediately tried to explain this away as maybe there was an emergency that an emergency rescue or life flight was being executed.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Richard writes "When I was about 12 years old my Father had enough confidence in me to allow me to wander the forest near our home hunting for squirrels. Behind our home was undeveloped mountain property of several thousand acres.</p> <p>There were old homes and farms on the mountain, long years ago abandoned when the families died and dependents moved away. Most of this land was purchased by timber companies and hunting and walks in the woods were O K. I had been taught at an early age in hunting methods and gun safety by my Dad. He took me on exploratory trips into the woods to show me good places to hunt and blaze trails so I could find my way home. Dad was a very smart man and a wise father. He didn't want to find it necessary to search for me and lead me back home at night.</p> <p>One of these locations became my favorite. Very large beech trees filled a little valley and my access was one of the ridges that formed this place. There was a nice creek at the bottom of this ridge and the babbling of water helped cover the noise I made walking in. The trees were very tall and the canopy was very full, making entry feel like walking into a large covered room. In the fall of the year little red berries in the beeches made this place a favorite with gray squirrels. I adopted this place as my personal hot spot and mental relaxing den. Squirrels or not I enjoyed spending time here sitting on a log and admiring nature around me.</p> <p>Squirrel season opened around September 15 and I could hardly wait each year for the season to open. A few classmates bragged of sneaking out before opening day and harvesting a few early. Not under Dads watchful eye, I would follow the game laws or not be allowed to go all season. When opening day arrived during the 1957 or 1958 season I would rush home after school, grab my shotgun, and off I raced. After a few successful trips I went to my personal spot one evening to find nothing at all. No squirrels, no birds, no anything was moving. After waiting an appropriate time in my 12 year old brain, I decided to expand my territory. Crossing the bridge across the stream. In this area timber had been cut a few years back leaving few full trees, and extremely thick undergrowth, bushes and briars. I found a game trail (old logging road) circling the base of another ridge. It was quiet there just like I had found earlier, plus the undergrowth was very thick making eyesight limited. I had traveled 200 or 300 yards off my normal route and found nothing to investigate. I decided to turn around and walk very slowly back the way I came in. If quiet I might find game moving. Since I got out of school at 3:00 pm, it was almost time to return home for dinner anyway.</p> <p>As I got near the little bridge that would take me toward home, I heard an unusual noise. I listened carefully but did not recognize the sound coming from the thick undergrowth. It sounded somewhat like birds or squirrels scratching in the dry leaves looking for buried nuts or worms. I decided to investigate and determine the source of this rhythm noise. Ground cover dead leaves were very dry, making it very difficult to make any progress through the laurels, briars and undergrowth without announcing my presence. I eased myself into the brush making far more noise than desired. As I got closer to the noise, it got louder but couldn't see the source. The brush I was entangled in was almost as tall as me. Finally I parted the tangle in front of my face, I saw the source of the mystery. In front of me, lying on the ground was an extremely large animal in deep sleep. This animal had been careful to not leave a trail into the thicket it was concealed in. Had I not heard the breathing noise, I would never have discovered this hiding spot . What I saw was this large animal lying completely surrounded by thick brush, weeds and briars. It looked like a large rock that had been dropped into tall grass that gathered against all sides. The source of leaves being stirred was the breathing of this creature. With each breath the leaves were blown around as it exhaled. I could see no movement of the animal other than breathing. The color of the fur or hair was cinnamon brown. I had seen some cattle in this color, but this thing appeared to be larger than a cow.</p> <p>I tried hard to see more details but was unable to see enough to eliminate guesses. It appeared this thing was laying straight down with feet and legs folded up under it. It had made great effort to be concealed. The head and neck were pushed up under the bushes so I could not see details. It's breath was coming out of the bushes near my right boot, but I was wedged tightly enough that I could not see. At least I knew which end was the front. All I could could see well was the surface of the back. Considering bulk I could see of the body, I would estimate weight in the 700 lb. range or more. I smelled no odor nor heard any noise other than snoring.</p> <p>Please keep in mind I was 12 yrs. old and so excited my heart is trying to jump out my throat. I was trying to determine what this animal was. In my range of knowledge the only thing I could think of was a cow or bull. I brought my 20 ga., double barrel up in front of my chest and began backing out one step at a time. I tried to form a plan of action if this thing woke up with me bound up in bushes. If it came at me I had two barrels of #6 bird shot. My plan was to shoot at the eyes, therefore blinding it and slowing it down. Better than no plan, I thought. Thank our good lord, I got out of the thicket and back on a cleared path.</p> <p>As I started my walk toward home, it occurred to me I had crossed no fences. In fact I did not know of anyone with a pasture close enough for cattle to wander into this area.</p> <p>In 1957 or 58 I had no knowledge of a Sasquatch or Big Foot. I had not heard any stories or news about these creatures. Therefore I did not consider them when this event took place.</p> <p>No, I told no one of this event. Dad would be furious if I shot someone's bull. He would confiscate my beloved shotgun. If I told any of the guys at school they would make fun of me for my story or tell everyone I was afraid of a cow.</p> <p>At 12 years old the mind is an amazing thing. After a few days I hardly remembered the event, and then forgot it all together.</p> <p>The only event after this I can think of happened many years later. Don't know if this had any relation to my story. I was always proud of my father and never heard of anything he was afraid of. I went to visit him one evening and he had a story for me. He had been exploring deep in the same forest I used to hunt in. He had a Colt woodsman .22 pistol that he tools with him on most walks and hunting trips. He continued to say he had wandered into some deep woods that he had never explored before. He told me that he was so far afield that he became worried that there might be something in those woods he did not know about. He was so uneasy that he pulled his trusty Colt out of the holster and carried it in his hand on the walk home. For a man raised in a dense forest and hunted his whole life this was not normal. In fact he spent over 4 yrs in the Navy exposed to the worse battles of the pacific during WW 2. I never knew him to show fear in any situation. I wonder what he saw in the woods that he wanted to tell me about.</p> <p>I am now 72 yrs old and began enjoying your Big Foot videos. Within the last month I listened to an account on your program that sounded similar to me and my memory came flooding back. Had not thought of this encounter in 60 yrs.</p> <p> </p> <p>I speak to a lot of people off the air regarding different experiences. The show is 99% Sasquatch related. I spoke to this witness yesterday and heard about 20% of his encounter and I’m fascinated and want to hear the rest. Indulge me as we go off trail.</p> <p>A listener writes “I was abducted at age 5, have awaken on an exam table, paralyzed, Have been through time warps in the desert and seen flying saucers go in and out of the ocean, land in formation, hang in the sky at close range. I’ve had a lifetime of encounters with disembodied entities and have battled ghosts for my very body. If you are interested, I have a 54 page book I’m working on. I’m a 70 year old disability rights advocate and musician, author and public speaker. I’ve been an NPR commentator, been published in chicken Soup, been on the CBS News with Walter Kronkite and been in a BBC documentary on the US Disability Rights Movement. I’m a serious guy.”</p>]]></description>

Most of this land was purchased by timber companies and hunting and walks in the woods were O K. I had been taught at an early age in hunting methods and gun safety by my Dad. He took me on exploratory trips into the woods to show me good places to hunt and blaze trails so I could find my way home. Dad was a very smart man and a wise father. He didn't want to find it necessary to search for me and lead me back home at night.</p> <p>One of these locations became my favorite. Very large beech trees filled a little valley and my access was one of the ridges that formed this place. There was a nice creek at the bottom of this ridge and the babbling of water helped cover the noise I made walking in. The trees were very tall and the canopy was very full, making entry feel like walking into a large covered room. In the fall of the year little red berries in the beeches made this place a favorite with gray squirrels. I adopted this place as my personal hot spot and mental relaxing den. Squirrels or not I enjoyed spending time here sitting on a log and admiring nature around me.</p> <p>Squirrel season opened around September 15 and I could hardly wait each year for the season to open. A few classmates bragged of sneaking out before opening day and harvesting a few early. Not under Dads watchful eye, I would follow the game laws or not be allowed to go all season. When opening day arrived during the 1957 or 1958 season I would rush home after school, grab my shotgun, and off I raced. After a few successful trips I went to my personal spot one evening to find nothing at all. No squirrels, no birds, no anything was moving. After waiting an appropriate time in my 12 year old brain, I decided to expand my territory. Crossing the bridge across the stream. In this area timber had been cut a few years back leaving few full trees, and extremely thick undergrowth, bushes and briars. I found a game trail (old logging road) circling the base of another ridge. It was quiet there just like I had found earlier, plus the undergrowth was very thick making eyesight limited. I had traveled 200 or 300 yards off my normal route and found nothing to investigate. I decided to turn around and walk very slowly back the way I came in. If quiet I might find game moving. Since I got out of school at 3:00 pm, it was almost time to return home for dinner anyway.</p> <p>As I got near the little bridge that would take me toward home, I heard an unusual noise. I listened carefully but did not recognize the sound coming from the thick undergrowth. It sounded somewhat like birds or squirrels scratching in the dry leaves looking for buried nuts or worms. I decided to investigate and determine the source of this rhythm noise. Ground cover dead leaves were very dry, making it very difficult to make any progress through the laurels, briars and undergrowth without announcing my presence. I eased myself into the brush making far more noise than desired. As I got closer to the noise, it got louder but couldn't see the source. The brush I was entangled in was almost as tall as me. Finally I parted the tangle in front of my face, I saw the source of the mystery. In front of me, lying on the ground was an extremely large animal in deep sleep. This animal had been careful to not leave a trail into the thicket it was concealed in. Had I not heard the breathing noise, I would never have discovered this hiding spot . What I saw was this large animal lying completely surrounded by thick brush, weeds and briars. It looked like a large rock that had been dropped into tall grass that gathered against all sides. The source of leaves being stirred was the breathing of this creature. With each breath the leaves were blown around as it exhaled. I could see no movement of the animal other than breathing. The color of the fur or hair was cinnamon brown. I had seen some cattle in this color, but this thing appeared to be larger than a cow.</p> <p>I tried hard to see more details but was unable to see enough to eliminate guesses. It appeared this thing was laying straight down with feet and legs folded up under it. It had made great effort to be concealed. The head and neck were pushed up under the bushes so I could not see details. It's breath was coming out of the bushes near my right boot, but I was wedged tightly enough that I could not see. At least I knew which end was the front. All I could could see well was the surface of the back. Considering bulk I could see of the body, I would estimate weight in the 700 lb. range or more. I smelled no odor nor heard any noise other than snoring.</p> <p>Please keep in mind I was 12 yrs. old and so excited my heart is trying to jump out my throat. I was trying to determine what this animal was. In my range of knowledge the only thing I could think of was a cow or bull. I brought my 20 ga., double barrel up in front of my chest and began backing out one step at a time. I tried to form a plan of action if this thing woke up with me bound up in bushes. If it came at me I had two barrels of #6 bird shot. My plan was to shoot at the eyes, therefore blinding it and slowing it down. Better than no plan, I thought. Thank our good lord, I got out of the thicket and back on a cleared path.</p> <p>As I started my walk toward home, it occurred to me I had crossed no fences. In fact I did not know of anyone with a pasture close enough for cattle to wander into this area.</p> <p>In 1957 or 58 I had no knowledge of a Sasquatch or Big Foot. I had not heard any stories or news about these creatures. Therefore I did not consider them when this event took place.</p> <p>No, I told no one of this event. Dad would be furious if I shot someone's bull. He would confiscate my beloved shotgun. If I told any of the guys at school they would make fun of me for my story or tell everyone I was afraid of a cow.</p> <p>At 12 years old the mind is an amazing thing. After a few days I hardly remembered the event, and then forgot it all together.</p> <p>The only event after this I can think of happened many years later. Don't know if this had any relation to my story. I was always proud of my father and never heard of anything he was afraid of. I went to visit him one evening and he had a story for me. He had been exploring deep in the same forest I used to hunt in. He had a Colt woodsman .22 pistol that he tools with him on most walks and hunting trips. He continued to say he had wandered into some deep woods that he had never explored before. He told me that he was so far afield that he became worried that there might be something in those woods he did not know about. He was so uneasy that he pulled his trusty Colt out of the holster and carried it in his hand on the walk home. For a man raised in a dense forest and hunted his whole life this was not normal. In fact he spent over 4 yrs in the Navy exposed to the worse battles of the pacific during WW 2. I never knew him to show fear in any situation. I wonder what he saw in the woods that he wanted to tell me about.</p> <p>I am now 72 yrs old and began enjoying your Big Foot videos. Within the last month I listened to an account on your program that sounded similar to me and my memory came flooding back. Had not thought of this encounter in 60 yrs.</p> <p> </p> <p>I speak to a lot of people off the air regarding different experiences. The show is 99% Sasquatch related. I spoke to this witness yesterday and heard about 20% of his encounter and I’m fascinated and want to hear the rest. Indulge me as we go off trail.</p> <p>A listener writes “I was abducted at age 5, have awaken on an exam table, paralyzed, Have been through time warps in the desert and seen flying saucers go in and out of the ocean, land in formation, hang in the sky at close range. I’ve had a lifetime of encounters with disembodied entities and have battled ghosts for my very body. If you are interested, I have a 54 page book I’m working on. I’m a 70 year old disability rights advocate and musician, author and public speaker. I’ve been an NPR commentator, been published in chicken Soup, been on the CBS News with Walter Kronkite and been in a BBC documentary on the US Disability Rights Movement. I’m a serious guy.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “I have an encounter that happened many years ago in Washington State. Index to be more precise.</p> <p>My encounter isn’t terrifying (at least not now. It was when it happened.) It’s a bit puzzling and all these years later I can’t explain it.</p> <p>But I did hear some things which culminated in seeing something cross the trail. I’ve never gone public with this and have been met with skepticism by the few people I’ve told. But I know what happened over the course of a few weeks in 1989.”</p> <p>Spoke to the witness and she has agreed to come on the show. It is a very interesting encounter because so many strange things happened beyond the sighting. One thing the witness brought up was hearing chanting in the woods or what sounded like chanting. I heard this before by two separate hunters</p> <p> </p> <p>My uncle is a big fan of your podcast and he encouraged me to email you about my supernatural experience with a wendigo (possible Sasquatch).</p> <p>I grew up in small town in an incredibly rural region of southern Ontario. My house was situated in a forested environment with the Niagara escarpment snaking up my front yard. It is a land of unspoiled beauty that has the capability of hiding many secrets in its depths.</p> <p>My family always told me stories about the beasts that lurk in the woods, real and supernatural, but it wasn't until I had my own experience that I became a believer in the old legends.</p> <p>It was mid-autumn of 2012. At this time of year the sun slinks away early in the evening, the only light being the crescent of the moon. My sister and I have always enjoyed exploring the woods that surrounded our house, and on the night of my experience we were out galavanting in the early hours of the moonlight. My uncle (the same one who has convinced me to write this) had walked from his home a few kilometres away from ours and we had excused ourselves from the adult conversations. Our whole lives we had been warned about not venturing too far away from our home, especially in the darkness, so we mostly stayed around the perimeter of the unforsted part our house-land.</p> <p>Despite the events occurring seven years ago, my recollection is still shockingly vivid when I take myself back to that night. The air was slightly cool, but warm enough that I only needed a raincoat (sometimes it's cold enough to snow at this time of year). It was a good evening all together, my sister and I were getting along as we laughed and played in our yard.</p> <p>We were completely unbothered and unaware of what was about to happen. In what I then thought was a brilliant idea I encouraged my sister to come with me and enter the thin strip of woods (about 25 feet apart) that separated our property and an unused driveway on the adjoining land. It was covered in young trees and surprisingly sturdy grasses, that in the fall got so dry and brittle that they could hold you up when falling on them.</p> <p>We spent the next few minutes matting the grasses down enough so we could walk into the centre of the woods. Standing there we were about 5 feet from our property. I started to feel strange, I decided that it was about time to get back to the house as my stomach was turning. Taking one last opportunity before going home I shoved my sister hard intending for her to be kept from falling by the grass. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case and she fell hard on her back, shocked by the tumble. It took her a few moments before she reacted, as she was in a state dumbfounded shock. This had never happened before. I stood there worried that she would take off back home and tell my mom.</p> <p>I got on my hands and knees eye-level with her, before she could even bat and eyelash or say a word I was there trying to convince her that she was okay and that there was no reason to say anything to mom. If she did we would never be allowed outside together. Due to my age and stubbornness, I was reluctant to apologize. I did help her up and brush off the dirt on her backside. We stood there for a few moments, in the darkness I could see her big blue eyes, she was chattering,endlessly as only she can. I debated with myself, what I should do. If we go home like I had wanted to moments before, she would get me in a trouble, but if we stayed out against my better judgment, I knew something bad could happen. I was her older sibling, I needed to keep her safe.</p> <p>Before I could reach my final judgment, the sense of unwaryness exploded,tingles traveled from my neck down my spine. Both of us stilled, the flow of words from her mouth was abruptly silenced as I smacked my hand over it. I didn't expect that out of her quietness would grow a fear in me so deep, I rarely visited the forest again.</p> <p>It started out quieter, the slosh of heavy footsteps on a the unpaved laneway. The gravelled stones tinkling across each other as if they had been slightly kicked. This sound quickly grew louder. It almost sounded as if the small rocks were being cracked under each footstep. My sister and I stood there. Neither of us cowered, we were frozen in fear.</p> <p>The sound of the footsteps was soon deadened by that of heavy breathing, grunting. Disgustingly inhuman. We were held in an unmoving trance as the beast came into view. A mass of tangled, slightly curly fur. A body so big it would have dwarfed my burly grandpa (who was 6'4). It's body was illuminated by the dim light our house cast upon the yard. I was the first to break, I yelped, terrified. Despite its size the thing was surprising quick, its large head wiped to the side. Although I couldn't make out it's eyes, my sister and I could both feel the its gaze rapt on our unmoving forms.</p> <p>It was at this moment I found control over my limbs. Selfishly, I pushed my sister behind me, closer to the creature. And I ran, screaming for my mother, someone to come and save us. I barrelled away from my sister to the front stairs. She wasn't far behind me. The shock from me pushing her must of helped her move. As we mounted the stairs our hands fumbled at the front door handle as we trembled in fear. Finally, we got inside still on edge.</p> <p>Our family was abviously shocked by the state we were in. They weren't exactly receptive when we tried to explain what we had seen. They tried to tell us it could have been a bear (far too short, our little black bears could never stand that tall) or maybe it was a person (still too small, not burly enough and wouldn't most people say something instead of scaring two people?) My sister and I remained steadfast, we knew what we saw. We went so far as to beg our uncle not to walk home that night, we didn't want what was out there to get him.</p> <p>Over time the shock of what we saw has worn off, but both myself and my sister still maintain unquestionably that, that was the most terrifying moment of our lives. Even after we experienced a break and enter while we were alone together. I've racked my brain for what it could have been. At first I was convinced it was a Sasquatch, but years later I'm now not too sure. At this point in my life I'm nearly convinced it was a wendigo. Purely on the fact that it still gives me the shakes when thinking about, as I've always been told they inspire fear in their victims.</p> <p>I have a feeling I will always remain somehow marked by this experience. Even though it was years ago, it is often a point of conversation with my family. At first I'm certain they thought we were trying to joke with them, but seven years later they now realize our moments with the beast were very much real. It made believers out of the two of us and has opened our eyes to other strange happenings we have witnessed.</p> <p> </p> <p>Steven writes "Hey Wes. I’ve been listening to your podcast for about a month now and really appreciate your effort in getting people’s stories out there.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to three guests who all have very different encounters. Matt writes “The encounter happened during July of 95. I live in NC near the Uwharrie mountains now. Back in 95 I lived at the base of the Blue Ridge mountains. Wilkes county to be exact. Me and my friend Mike were headed from the bottom of the mountain to a friend’s house on the top of the mountain.</p> <p>We decided to take the scenic route, late afternoon. The scenic route was a pavement to gravel road called Big Ivy. It was paved at the base of the mountain. But as soon as you started up, it turned to gravel. It was hot even on the side of the mountain, and we were smoking cigarettes. So we had the windows open. We got half way up the mountain, around dusk, and rounded a curve to the left. The road had a drop off to the right, and a very steep bank to the left. As we came around the curve I noticed something walking up onto the side of the road on the right.</p> <p>At first in the dusk, I thought it was a real tall man in a trenchcoat. I said to Mike, “Who’s the trenchcoat”? I looked back and immediately stopped the truck. I saw it wasn’t a man. But whatever it was, it was 7-8′ tall. It just stood there stunned as we were that the other was there. The orange hair on it’s right leg had several places where it was matted together. It had a man’s face more than an apes. At least that’s the way I saw it. With hair up the cheeks of it’s face It had a slight grin on it’s face. Almost like it was smiling. I’m not sure if it was a male or female. I looked at it with awe.</p> <p>Mike however was on the side of the vehicle closest to it, and went into a panic. Kicking the floor board, pushing himself back into the seat. He started yelling “Get out of here”! Startled by his panic, I turned to look at him. Causing me to miss the Bigfoot cross the road right in front of the headlights. When I looked back, he was climbing up the bank on the left, with ease.</p> <p>This bank is so steep, I would have to climb up it on my belly. The Bigfoot went right up in no time flat. I ignored Mike’s yells, and got out of the vehicle. I immediately caught the smell. The smell of water rot, BO, and urine. Foul. I heard him crashing thru the brush on top of the hill. I stood around for a few minutes. Got back in the truck and we left. Excitedly telling our friend about the encounter. He dismissed us and our story. I went back to the spot after work the next day. Saw no trace of what went through there. There is a house on top of the hill. So I couldn’t go on top of the bank and look. But it was hot and dry so no footprints on the side of the road. There is a spring box on the side of the road, will a constantly running overflow pipe. That water supply on the side of the mountain maybe why he was in that area."</p> <p>I will also be welcoming to the show Shawn and Shawn writes “I’m from Alabama, born and raised but I moved to Utah for college. I’ve had a few different experiences in both states as well as nearby western Georgia. The Georgia experience is the one I’d like to share.</p> <p>I had recently moved back home to Alabama after finishing in Utah. I had been employed at a lawn maintenance company while going to college. This company is a Fortune 500 and is located in all 50 states and in every city of marginal populations. They handle fertilizer and weed control as well as aerations/dethatching, insect control and services for trees and shrubs both residential and for commercial accounts. I arranged to be transferred to a branch in Georgia as I was moving back to Alabama. My dad has recently been diagnosed with cancer and my mom needed help with the property. They live in a two-story house my dad built on a nice sized portion of land, it’s in the boonies with houses here and there but mostly it’s Alabama soft wood forests in all directions for miles and miles. As an only child helping became my torch to carry with all the animals and miscellaneous yard work not to mention driving my dad to the doctor or picking up groceries and paying the bills.</p> <p>This branch I transferred to in Georgia was about an hour away and only serviced areas in Georgia. One of our commercial accounts was for large tracks of Pine woods for Mead Paper. Some of these 100s of acres went specifically for paper pulp production, some equally sized portions Mead sold to furniture/construction companies but Mead still owned the actual land the trees come from and maintained the upkeep or a better way of saying that is, they hired other companies to take care of it.</p> <p>We had been hired by Mead to do Mauget treatments(pronounced Moe-shay or Moe-jay think French accents). A Mauget is essentially a treatment for trees that involve drilling(taping) roughly 1/12 the diameter of the trunk, equally spaced with about 6 injection points. We could inject iron if the soil was low due to the forests being reused so often, fungicides and insecticides. We were there because pine beetles had been eating up acreages of trees for the construction/furniture profits.</p> <p>These jobs typically take weeks to complete and had crews of 1 salesmen who was responsible for the account and 3-4 technicians. It was one of the only jobs we did where the sales rep helped with applications. State and federal laws govern how to prepare and clean up while doing tree injections. We don’t want iron capsules contaminating the soil or the poisons drifting into water supplies. We would get to the parcel of land around 7:30am with a google map loaded showing the target area. We also had the trees marked off by surveyors who would come in and designate the initial area and through out the weeks come back and mark the rest of the areas with ribbons while we were in other areas.</p> <p>I was the salesman of the account and met with a representative from Mead on-site 3 days before the job was to start so I could get a view of the land and work out the quickest way possible. He was running about 10 minutes late and I was in the truck calling in sales to our office. It was late February roughly 5:00 pm. I was parked on a dirt logging road, both sides of the road was going to be the area we treated. The road went down further about a half mile and ended with a cleared area for trucks to park or turn around. I got off the call and just had an uneasy feeling so I decided to drive down to the dead end and turn around so when the Mead rep got there our drivers sides would be next to each other and we wouldn’t need to get out to have a conversation. I didn’t know why but I didn’t want to get out and go for a walk inspecting woods this close to dark.</p> <p>When I got to the turn around I could tell this area hadn’t been used in a long time, the grass had grown up, there was no loading or logging equipment just a few boxes of ribbons left from the survey crew to use during the job. It was still light out but dark enough for the headlights to come on in the woods. I sat in the lot facing towards the road so I could drive and meet him when I saw him coming with the bed of the truck close to a mound of dirt pushed up right at the boundary of the woods behind me.</p> <p>I heard something crack really loud behind me off in the woods. I figured it was a limb break off a beetle infested tree. No more than 5 seconds later I heard thumping, the best way to describe it is someone running on a hard or compacted floor with extra large shoes flopping down with each step. I turned and put my right arm behind the passenger seat so I could look out the back window. I saw a single pine moving very rapidly back and worth, I could only see the top 60% of the tree because of the large mound of dirt moved to clear the area. It continued for about 10 seconds until I heard a loud series of knocks coming from the driver side off in the woods. I looked to my left and thought I saw a dark figure moving toward where the clearing becomes the road. Then I heard walking behind the truck, immediately I heard three distinctive “whoops,” I mean it was clearly a “woooowhooop, whoop whop!” that came from the same area I saw something walking. Then my truck was pelted with tiny pebbles once I left and looked at then they looked like little tiny pieces of gravel. Something was tossing pebbles from the wood line behind me. I put the truck in drive because things were really starting to freak me out and I heard the loudest yell I can ever remember. It wasn’t guttural but it was low and very reverberating as soon as it finished from behind the truck I heard what I can only describe as a shriek but it was very throaty and raspy.</p> <p>That was it for me, I pulled off and I was getting ready to get on the paved road to leave I saw my Mead contact parked waiting for me. He apologized for being late and we talked about the area and job. He told me flat out he hates coming to this area. I asked him why and he told me about Chris Thompkins. You might know this name if you follow Missing 411. He was a surveyor who went missing working with his crew pretty much in this same area in 2002. I hadn’t heard anything about it. He explained Chris was surveying with his crew spaced about 50 ft apart, he was last in line and just vanished.</p> <p>I told him about the noises I heard and he said he had experienced similar sounds back there and told me he saw a large animal run across the road on two legs and drop to all four when it made it into the woods.</p> <p>The first few days of the job went great but day 4 the survey guys asked us on the way in if we had taken their boxes of ribbons. I told them we wouldn’t have any use for them and I saw them in the clearing where everyone parked. He said someone must have came back there and took them because they couldn’t find them. They left for the day and said they’d come back tonight and lay some down for us to complete in the morning. We only had about 15 trees left in the area since they couldn’t mark any the rest of the day so I sent all but one technician home early. It was about 5:30pm when we finished and we’re picking up the injection caps from trees. He heard it first and asked what the hell is that!? It was the same yell I had heard about a week earlier. I told him I didn’t know and let’s finish grabbing the trash so we could leave. That’s when I heard something whiz throw the air. The cap injectors are cylinders that get a hole punched in one end and I was hearing the wind pass over it as it went through the air. I didn’t see it but we heard it. Two more where thrown and that was enough for us. We walked a pretty fast pace back to the truck and packed the truck up with the drills and spent caps. We sat and listened for about 30 minutes it was about 6:10pm. There was dozens of yells and whooping and that strange shriek. As we were leaving the cleared area we saw a large animal peering around a tree about 15 ft from the dirt road. It was rocking to our left and bobbing back behind the trunk over and over. The only knocking we heard was as we were leaving down the dirt road towards the main paved road.</p> <p>To cut the reading down I’ll condense the rest. The job started going slow because the survey ribbons kept getting torn off the trees and just littered the ground. We would find clumps of them wrapped together sometimes just laying in the middle of the clearing. They started using blue paint to mark and that’s when some drills started getting broken and trees we treated we would find, I mean they were pushed over. That’s the only way I can say it. Not all of them not even most of them but a good number the further back we treated.</p> <p>We ended up completing about 70% of the area and Mead canceled the rest. The rep would only tell me we did a great job all things considered and they were going to let the land “sit” for awhile. Ever since I always wondered about the missing surveyor and if any of us were in any real danger.”</p> <p> James will be also sharing his encounter. James writes “During the winter of 1993 I shipped off to Fort Leonardwood, MO for basic training and would eventually become a transportation expert in the National Guard. Fourteen months later I would then enlist into Active Duty after attempting a semester of college. I would find myself at Fort Knox, KY. About a year and a half while in my second unit the Brigade would move out towards western Kentucky, not far from Central City to conduct a month long field exercise. This is where I would witness one of these creatures.</p> <p>Last one day a battle buddy and I headed for the showers which were located near the entrance of the training area. The building was located over a hundred yards from the staging area where all large vehicles were to park. A road ran from the gate in front of the building towards the staging area which then split off into two separate directions. In the fork of this intersection was located the ammo/ fuel point. The road the split off to the left separated the staging area and the fuel point. At the back end of the staging area was a row of conex containers. Behind these containers was a hill. Near the end of the containers and not too far from the fuel point was a street light. Now this row ran about a hundred yards which came to a deep raven. We parked our vehicle, a HEMMET (10 Ton cargo truck). I was a PFC (Private First Class) at the time and my battle buddy was a SPC (Specialist) so he told me to go take my shower first, which I did. When I finished and headed back it was starting to get dark. I climbed into the drivers side of the vehicle and waited for him to return. We were facing the shower building and how I was seated I was facing out the passenger window looking at the end of the containers near the street light. It didn’t light up a huge area but I could see part way up the hill and the end of the containers.</p> <p>After a while I noticed “someone” come walking off the side of the hill. At first I didn’t think much about it believing someone was lost while doing night time land navigation. I watched for about five minutes till the figure walked behind the containers to never be seen again. As I continued to watch somethings started to make me question what I was looking at. They were tall and broad, wasn’t carrying a weapon of any type, and wasn’t wearing any battle raddle, especially a pro-mask (gas mask). Then I noticed that their pants weren’t bloused into boots. The figure had their head down, walking back and forth as if they were looking for something. Then they walked behind the containers where the top of their head reached the top of the container and really noticed how big this individual was.</p> <p>I am 6’3″ and if I stand in side a conex with boots on, stand on my toes and reach up I can grab the top of the conex.</p> <p>During this field exercise the majority would return to the rear for the weekend while each unit kept a small crew back to watch everything. Half way through the exercise my battle buddy and I was sent to the fuel/ ammo point. I took this time to walk over to where I saw the figure to see if any tracks could be seen. I found nothing which wasn’t a surprise for several reasons; it had rain by that time and the ground was so compacted that a HUMVEE would hardly leave a track there.</p> <p>There was no interaction between the subject and myself. I haven’t had any other encounters either.”</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

I live in NC near the Uwharrie mountains now. Back in 95 I lived at the base of the Blue Ridge mountains. Wilkes county to be exact. Me and my friend Mike were headed from the bottom of the mountain to a friend’s house on the top of the mountain.</p> <p>We decided to take the scenic route, late afternoon. The scenic route was a pavement to gravel road called Big Ivy. It was paved at the base of the mountain. But as soon as you started up, it turned to gravel. It was hot even on the side of the mountain, and we were smoking cigarettes. So we had the windows open. We got half way up the mountain, around dusk, and rounded a curve to the left.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Spoke to Glen who is a retired law enforcement officer. Glen said “I was injured on the job so I have taken some time off. A good friend of mine and I decided to take a long hike down the Appalachian Trail. We were warned by the park rangers not to hike the trail, they made the comment “We don’t work in anything less than a 4 man team. A lot of strange things have been going on.” Now I didnt really believe in bigfoot. After the night we spent on the Appalachian Trail, I changed my mind on a lot of things. It still haunts me to this day.”</p> <p>Aaron writes “Hey man my gf, and I had 2 interesting encounters during our trip to LBL. Went in with the intent to show her some wood booger’s, ended up running into what I can only assume was a demon/witch lady near a cemetery.My gf refuses to really talk about her because she had said hi to her as she walked past but the lady ignored her but looked up smiled and said hi back to me when I said hi. Her eyes were black but my gf describes her differently than I saw her said she got super cold but never saw her face her hair hid it but I saw short hair.</p> <p>Then later that night we went back in, and I believe around mile marker 26, 3 deer were off to the side of the road 1 was a really nice buck I slowed way down and in the corner of our lights we caught what I thought was a 4th deer so I didn’t think about it but my gf freaked and as I looked up this massive light grey/whitish dog creature leaps up what had to be a 30-40ft hill in 1 leap I was like wtf I stopped turned my light into the woods to follow the creature for a moment we lost sight of it.</p> <p>I looked at the deer, there eyes reflected yellow in the light but when I looked back into the woods what I originally past over as a tree originally looking in had reddish eyes in the light But it was tall I wanna say 9 maybe 10ft. I would like to know what you really know about that place. I did 10 years in the army, 4 of which were in a long range surveillance company. 13 months in Kandahar province among others, rural villages people would warn us of giants in the mountains, which really to me confirmed the Kandahar giant story to me the people genuinely were feared these things, and my buddies that had been in awhile all had some creepy stories So why not a big wolf man, wood booger’s, witch’s, etc. if you have any info on that area that hasn’t really been mentioned on the show I’d loved to hear back from you. Fascinated me that so many apex predators live in that area. I want to go back.”</p> <p> </p> <p>https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Feeling a little down and thinking about the Doc.</p> <p> </p> <p>John Albert Bindernagel (December 22, 1941 – January 17, 2018) was a wildlife biologist who sought evidence for Bigfoot since 1963. He published a book in 1998 entitled North America's Great Ape: the Sasquatch (ISBN 0-9682887-0-7). His second book, The Discovery of the Sasquatch – Reconciling Culture, History, and Science in the Discovery Process, was published in 2010.</p> <p>Bindernagel grew up in Ontario, attended the University of Guelph, and received a PhD in Biology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.He moved to British Columbia in 1975largely because the region was a hot spot for Bigfoot sightings. Over the years, he collected casts of tracks that he believed belonged to Bigfoot. He also claimed to have heard the creature near Comox Lake in 1992, comparing its whooping sound to that of a chimpanzee. Bindernagel believed that the Bigfoot phenomena should receive more attention from serious scientists, but remarked, "The evidence doesn't get scrutinized objectively. We can't bring the evidence to our colleagues because it's perceived as taboo."</p> <p>Bindernagel was a true pioneer in the field of cryptozoology and was a regular on the classic History Channel show MonsterQuest. Bindernagel and Dr. Jeff Meldrum often appeared together on the show and had a real-life friendship. Together they formed the bedrock of the Bigfoot Research Community.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “Hello Wes! I listen your show all the time I’m a big a fan of your show and Bigfoot. About 2 years ago I became fascinated with Sasquatch. I don’t have a Sasquatch encounter but I do have a paranormal encounter. One night in October of 2015. Me and a buddy of mine came across the creepiest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. 3 am we encountered a woman in a sparkling prom like dress who seem to have been waiting for my buddy. She was lifeless no emotion and stared at my buddy. I’d love to go into more detail and be able to tell you over the phone. Thank you Wes”</p> <p>Spoke to the eyewitness this afternoon.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “Hello Wes! I listen your show all the time I’m a big a fan of your show and Bigfoot. About 2 years ago I became fascinated with Sasquatch. I don’t have a Sasquatch encounter but I do have a paranormal encounter. One night in October of 2015. Me and a buddy of mine came across the creepiest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. 3 am we encountered a woman in a sparkling prom like dress who seem to have been waiting for my buddy. She was lifeless no emotion and stared at my buddy. I’d love to go into more detail and be able to tell you over the phone. Thank you Wes”</p> <p>Spoke to the eyewitness this afternoon.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Spoke to the eyewitness who is from the U.K. but she was in California for business. She shared some very interesting details about what she saw. She said “When the male rushed me the female stopped him and they were chattering back and forth, a very strange gibberish.” She has agreed to come on the show, her account is below.</p> <p>A listener writes “Dear Wes, My Brother suggested that I email you to tell you about an encounter with a group of hairy things, possibly Sasquatches, that I had back in the late 80’s when I was working in California. In brief, I was trying to take pictures of Sea Otters at a beach near Big Sur when a group of six one male, two female and three smaller creatures came down out of a creek and the male waded into the water and started pulling seaweed out and throwing it back to the females that were chewing at its roots and rubbing it into the fur. This was about 100 metres away from where I was sat on some rocks.</p> <p>The group noticed me when I tried to take some photos and the male charge at me whilst the females were screaming. The male stopped about 50 metres away from me and seemed to be having an argument with one of the females as they were gibberish away to each other. The last thing I remember was that it swung its body round to face me again, screamed so loudly that my insides were vibrating and slammed its fists into the beach. I think I must have fainted, but what I have never understood is that I came round about about an hour or so later with my jacket pulled over my head and quite badly bruised about ten metres from my car and could only assume that I was dumped there.</p> <p>I drove back to the hotel I was staying at and they called the police who came and took a statement. I was forcefully told that what I had seen were bears nothing else. When I argued with the man he got really agitated with me and asked me whether we didn’t have Officers like him in positions of authority where I came from. I replied that we did but that they weren’t allowed to tell us what to put into a statement. He then asked whether I understood English to which I replied that I was English. He just looked at me and told me that I had seen bears and not to say anything different to anyone else if I didn’t want to get kicked out of the country.</p> <p>I don’t know whether this is the sort of thing that you would be interested in as I am not from the US and this happened nearly thirty years ago now but I would be happy to write this up in more detail if you think it would be of any use to you.</p> <p>I haven’t spoken to anyone else about this other than my brother who is a primate photographer and suggested that I contact you.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “I first encountered Bigfoot in 79. I was 6 years of age. I grew up in Byhailya Miss 20 miles from Memphis on a small farm house 15 archers or so. It was me my mom 3 older sisters and my nephew a year younger than myself. We had chickens with a small coup a about 15 birds. An old smoke house, old barn and a nice garden.</p> <p>The landlord had about 60 cows in the back of the property in a large pasture. We also had two dogs and this place had no running water. It all started when me and mom went to the eggs out of the coup,so she could get back in to watch her stories on tv. Me and my nephew would watch with her lol. So when we came back in and began to watch tv around noon. The phone rang, it was our neighbor and her good friend ,that lived about 2 miles away.</p> <p>She said a creature had came on her property and picked up her small child as she was hanging clothes on the line on the side of her trailer house. She said the child wondered to the front yard, when she heard it cry frantically. She said she went to the front of property to see this creature with her child under its arms as it started off with the kid down her driveway. She picked up a garden hoe and gave chase,hitting this thing in the back it drops the kid and runs off ,down the road to the woods in our direction. She calls the Sheriff and then calls my mother to warn her knowing me and my nephew were little. I saw my mom go into full alert mode.</p> <p>Locking down the house all doors and windows locked ,loading rifles and shotguns. Scared the hell out of me and my nephew. We never locked a door or window, we never had too. We knew she had guns they weren’t loaded. I didn’t know anything about a monster they were make believe but my mom had to believe her or knew of this thing. How can a person call and tell you they saw a monster and you not bat an eye. My family encountered the creature that night with gunfire.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Now I was scared for him. “Dobbs!” I yelled. “Dobbs!”</p> <p>My voice echoed through the woods. I scanned the area with my light but didn’t see anything else. Keep steady, I thought to myself. He could have just dropped it. Or maybe the other Ranger, what’s-his-name. They were likely at the tower together. Or maybe scouting the fire they had spotted. </p> <p>“Dobbs!” I screamed this time. The sky now was now a little illuminated by the tell-tale orange glow of fire. “Dobbs, can you hear me?”</p> <p>​Then I heard a man’s voice say, “Shut up!” </p> <p>His sudden voice surprised the tar out of me. If hadn’t been so exhausted I’d have jumped up a tree right then and there.</p> <p>“Where are you?” he was close but I couldn’t see him.</p> <p>“Shhh! Keep quiet! It’ll hear us!” he said to me.</p> <p>I located where the voice was coming from, about 10 feet away and a little behind me, then swung the light at him. I saw Dobbs under a thick patch of cedars up against a big rock, huddled on the ground.</p> <p> “Turn the light off and get over here,” he whispered.</p> <p>I was moving to where he was and clicked off my flashlight when it occurred to me what he’d said. ‘It’ would hear us.</p> <p>He had his big revolver in his hand so I raised my carbine and crouched beside him. That’s when I saw ‘it.’ </p> <p>We were right at the bottom edge of a roughly oval clearing, sloping steeply uphill toward more deep woods. The fire light from above and to our right was brighter, so I figured the fire must be just over the ridge, maybe a quarter mile ahead. </p> <p>At the far edge of the woods, maybe 30 yards away I saw a tall (can’t guess but easily over 6 to 7 feet tall) outline of an upright figure backlit by the glow from the fire. As if it knew where we were it was turned slightly towards us.</p> <p>I could not make out facial features but I could see it had large eyes that were reflecting the dim light. If I had thought of it I would have made a mental note of how tall it was in relation to the nearest tree, but all I was thinking was that this time, this was no bear.</p> <p> </p> <p>For information about the Live Show go to: https://sasquatchchronicles.com/live-podcast-show/</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be releasing the public show tonight. I am working on a special show for the members on Sunday. I really think you guys and gals are going to like it. Tonight we will be talking to Ned who is a retired law enforcement officer from New York. Ned’s encounter took place many years ago and it started when his car broke down. Ned struggled for many years on what he ran into that night. It is very interesting to hear the ambush behavior Ned describes.</p> <p>Dylin who is from Louisiana will discuss his encounter while he was a truck driver for a logging company. Dylin had stopped his truck and trailer on the job site around 2 AM. As he was adjusting his straps on the side of the trailer he heard his driver door close. He felt something on the other side of the trailer messing with his straps. He thought a worker was messing with him or it was the wind until he looked up and saw the creature.</p> <p>Dylin writes “I could definitely make out an elongated pointed head and the whole left side of its body was covered in what looked like matted wiry hair and the one arm and hand I can make out has sausage like fingers, a forearm that’s larger in proportion that it’s bicep and it’s all hairy there is a difference in fur and hair and this was definitely hair. It reminded me of the beginning stages of dreadlocked hair that’s been unwashed and starts to kink up. I’m standing here frozen in fear trying not to breath, scream and piss myself at the same time. You just don’t expect these things during the daylight much less at 2am on a high traffic road standing right next to your vehicle between you and the cab of your vehicle which is the only area of safety you have. I can feel it’s sizing me up it’s head is steadily moving up and down but at the same time I feel it’s more curious than it is aggressive.”</p> <p> </p> <p>https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bill writes “Wes this sighting took place when I was a teenager. I’m fifty two now and I still remember it for the most part. Me and a buddy was on are way to are favorite fishing spot at the time. We lived near a dam. It was late summer.</p> <p>So the dam was low which maybe accessing the inlet possible. Now above the inlet was miles of private land that connected to next dam that was located in the mountains. To access the inlet you had to hike down into the bottom and walk through bottom ground that is underwater in spring. Well we were crossing a fence on the high side and as I crossed over I looked ahead and below us toward are destination in the tall willows I saw something bent over low digging or scraping in the dirt. It was hairy reddish color. I stoped and was trying to figure out what I was seeing about that time my buddy looked and saw what I was looking at. At the same time the creature must have heard us. To this day I remember this point and will never forget it.</p> <p>It stood straight up still with its back to us kind of turned a little glanced at us and took off running through the willows and brush up through the bottoms through crap so thick a man can’t get through. Just ripped right through it and disappeared. I’m pretty sure we saw a big foot. If you would like to talk or want more info email me.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Carl writes "Im a retired deputy sheriff and have had 2 road crossings as well,and have heard the wood knocks and whooping noises. I even had a large tree about 75 yards from me pushed over on a calm day while deer hunting. As i became aware i realized id experienced them around me my whole life."</p> <p> </p> <p>Chris Merola and he has agreed to come on the show. He describes buying a cabin in the woods of Connecticut that no one lived in for 11 years. He said when he first moved in he was terrified because of the things he was hearing outside late at night.Chris says “I setup trail camera’s all over the property trying to get a picture of these things and I never got any pictures of a Sasquatch. Frustrating….I finally decided to put one camera on my door behind the screen door. I captured what I think is one of these creatures. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L6rJxLWhYg" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">Here is the video.</a></p> <p>If you skip ahead to about the 5min mark you can see something move from the middle of the screen to the right. It is not conclusive but it is very interesting. Especially knowing Chris lives in the middle of no where and he was trying to bate these creatures with food. Chris goes on to say “I am not the only one who has heard and seen them in the area. We were screamed at by one of them and both my son and girlfriend ran into the cabin. I have seen them numerous times. I have also seen some very strange and weird things from these creatures. I do not know what to say, I do not think they are from here. My opinion of course.”</p> <p>Chris documented the incidents that happen over the years to him at his cabin. He wrote a book called <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/One-Who-Runs-Hides-Story-ebook/dp/B07JR3T37Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1547327960&sr=8-1&keywords=the+one+who+runs+and+hides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The One Who Runs and Hides</a>: A True Story. Check it out on Amazon.</p> <p>It is hard to put everything that happen into an hour long show and for some of the listeners some of what Chris has to say might rub you the wrong way but I can tell you a lot of what he talks about lines up with witnesses I have spoken to including the two brothers (We need help show) in Indiana.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dave writes “I had an experience while canoeing. It happen from an area where an event happen 40 to 50 years earlier. You can google the Mill Race Monster in Columbus, Indiana. I knew nothing about big foot before my experience…..changed my life.”</p> <p>Spoke to the witness and he was canoeing on the Flat Rock River when he got stuck in a wood jam in the river. He pulled the canoe out of the river. The witness said “I was dragging the canoe when I started smelling something terrible. It smelled like a dead animal and rotting garbage. It was so bad I almost started dry heaving. The forest erupted, it sounded like king kong was breaking trees and screaming at me. I had no clue what was going on. I grabbed the canoe and started dragging it back to the river. That is when all hell broke loose…..”</p> <p>MILL RACE MONSTER:</p> <p>On November 1, 1974, the Columbus Police Department received a series of panicked reports from no less than two sets of eyewitnesses, all of whom claimed to have seen (and even been attacked by) a huge, bipedal, green-skinned monstrosity that took to skulking near the waterways inside Indiana’s 83-acre Mill Race Park.</p> <p>These encounters would alarm locals and lead to what some consider to be the biggest “monster hunt” in the history of the United States.</p> <p>My second guest tonight is Shane. Shane writes “when I was about sixteen or seventeen years old, I had my first encount with this creature. I was coon hunting with two older friends in Barrow County, Georgia. At this time I had been hunting on this 3,000 acre tract of land for about two months.</p> <p>It was about 9 o’clock at night when the incident took place. It was a fairly cold night and very dark in those woods. We had smelt a terrible odor to which, at first, we had contributed to that of a skunk. After we passed through the area and out of the odor, we began to hear movement in the brush off of the trail behind us. We kept moving deeper into the woods some distance behind the hounds which had , by this time, was trailing a raccoon. The noises behind us kept getting closer and louder. We had first thought it was one of the dogs that had come back in to us for some reason. This was unusual to us as all of the hounds we had were champion coonhounds and would rather die than give up on running a raccoon.</p> <p>We began to curse and swear as we thought it was one of our hounds. We soon discovered that it was not one of our dogs. We could plainly hear each dog’s voice in the front of us as they were bawling away in pursuit of the raccoon. My friend Hubert, jokingly said that it must be the “Werewolf” that was following us. He told Ray and myself to turn off our hunting lights and wait for a signal from him. At his signal we were to point our lights in the direction of the noise moving ever closer to us. Hubert had a .22 rifle that he carried that was for shooting the coon out of the tree after our dogs treed it. Hubert made the comment that if he didn’t like what he seen in the beams of our lights that he was going to start shooting. At the signal Ray and I turned our lights on high and shined the beams in the direction of the noise. There in the light was a tall dark figure that ran off as soon as the lights were upon it. It was huge and ran upright on two legs just like a man. This stunned all three of us and Hubert never fired a shot as he was not sure as to what we had just seen. This was not a man nor was it a bear. It was too large and bulky to be a man and was too large to be a black bear. Besides, a bear only walks on it’s hind legs a short distance and awkwardly at that.</p> <p>This thing was sprinting away, leaning slightly forward as it moved. It was breaking branches and tree limbs as it ran away up a wooded hillside. It was soon out of hearing distance. We did not care to investigate it as we were too scared and shocked to do so. We then, after we calmed down, made our way to get the dogs and get back to the truck. Ater hurriedly putting the dogs in the dogbox and putting away our gear, we were soon on the old logging road getting out of there.</p> <p>One the way home, Ray and Hubert began to talk about more experiences as well as footprints that they had seen on this tract of land. I continued to hunt here for many years afterwards. I never again saw or heard anything again. We did continue to smell that same odor that we smelt when we had the encounter. It always unnerved me a little everytime we hunted in that area. Was what we saw a Bigfoot? I think so and will continue to believe so till my dying day.”</p> <p> </p> <p>https://sasquatchchronicles.com/</p> <p> </p> <p>wes@sasquatchchronicles.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year everyone! I have three guests tonight. A summary of their encounters are below.</p> <p>Case writes “I live in South Western Pennsylvania. I have had 2 sightings in my life. One was locally where I live (2014) the other at my camp in Clearfield county in (2013). The first was what made me realize there’s Bigfoot in our state.</p> <p>I was hunting at our camp which is 2 miles from the nearest paved road and we get very little traffic back there even in hunting season. I was still hunting along the spring that flows through the bottom of a valley below our camp. In the bottom is a 100 yard wide by 200 yard pine thicket. It is so thick through there I usually just carry my rifle slung under my shoulder shoulder and just hunt with my pistol (.357 mag) cause shots are under 30 in the thicket. Upon exiting the thicket I noticed 2 doe in front of me at about 50 yards. I retrieved my rifle and was watching these deer through the scope. They were not alerted to my presence and didn’t seem spooked cause they just fed along towards me.</p> <p>As I looked for a buck I hoped would be following the doe they fed into a mountain lion thicket to my left. I was just getting ready to take a step farther out of the pines when I noticed something to my right almost at the top of the valley about 140 yards away. When I seen it I thought to myself that’s the biggest bear I have ever seen in my life and threw the gun back up to look at it. My scope is a 3×9 and I had it set on 4 power for when I exited the pines cause I knew shots could range from 25-175 yards. This thing was squated down on its haunches behind a tree and it was looking down the hill at me. It had its hand stabilizing itself on the trunk as it peered around at me. When I looked at it I realized it wasn’t a bear. It didn’t have a snout but a nose. This thing looked almost human.</p> <p>I got a 10-15 second look as we stared at each other before I saw it’s expression change into this oh $h** look. It stood straight up then like a athlete finishing a squat turned to the left take a step and a half on 2 legs and disappear into the Laurel at the top of the valley. I have alot more details I haven’t gone into here ingrained into my mind I haven’t gone into here but would like to share my experiences with you.”</p> <p>---</p> <p>Matt writes “Wes, I was at my cousin’s in Tionesta, PA for Christmas dinner. I stayed until almost 9:00 pm visiting after. On my way back home, in Oil City, is about 16 miles of mostly deserted rural roadway.</p> <p>There is a section of Gamelands, state owned public hunting lands, numbering about 10,000 acres on both sides of the road. Driving back home it’s a slight downhill on the left side of the road and it goes uphill to a ridge top and dense, hemlock and mountain Laurel covered steep river hillside, all hundreds of feet above the Allegheny River.</p> <p>We had been hunting archery and rifle some behind my cousin’s house above Tionesta Lake, a Corps of engineers flood control lake, so we had been seeing deer on the way home numerous times, especially in this one stretch of road that travels through the Gamelands, so I generally drive a little bit slower and am a little more attentive in areas we frequently see the deer to prevent hitting them.</p> <p>So, here I was driving home, watching for deer, when a young deer, I would say a yearling or early fawn from this year came stumbling/sliding into the road, like it had been tripped or pushed. In seconds, a huge, hairy figure jumped off of the bank and landed in the middle of the other lane next to the deer that was just regaining it’s feet. In one motion, it scooped the deer up in it’s left arm, which caused it to blat loudly, similar to a spine shot deer that needs finished off to prevent it’s suffering.( I had been only going 30 mph roughly through that stretch and had jammed on my brakes and had stopped.) In just a moment, it took it’s right hand and grabbed the deers head and just twisted and broke it’s neck effortlessly. It seemed to have been so concentrated on catching the deer, it didn’t notice me right away.</p> <p>After it dispatched the deer, it turned slightly to it’s left, towards me and, having my high beams on, I saw it well, only 15-20 yards from my bumper. It’s lips parted slightly and it let out a low, rumbly growl and just hurdled the far guardrails, easily and must have sprang at least 20 feet in that one leap. It was a dark auburn to black, but it seemed to have reddish highlights in front of the headlights. I only got to see part of it’s face, the left side and from the back really well. It was 8 ‘ or so tall, longer from the waist to head than waist to foot, didn’t seem to have a cone shaped head from the angle I saw it from, hands had to have spanned a foot or more across, it was at least 4′ across the shoulders, legs as big as my waist and I am 6’ and 270#. I know without a doubt this was a Sasquatch, flat nose, had pointed canines, upper and lower on the left side when it’s lips parted, not really pronounced, but noticeably pointed. It had fairly long hair, it’s face was bare from it’s protruding eyebrow area to it’s lower lip. Gray/black skin, kind of looked like supple leather, not worn, really.</p> <p>I just sat there for several minutes to get my composure. As much as I wasn’t quite sure what I saw those years ago, I’m convinced it wasn’t a black bear, but I am positive that this was a Sasquatch."</p> <p>---</p> <p>Joel writes "We have some things going on at my house. Strange noises I have recorded. My six year old told me she saw a Sasquatch at her window before. It had creepy red eyes. It was black but had brown hair mixed in. It’s nose was flat. It scratched at their window. It hides, meaning it disappears and then appears I believe she means it ducks down and then stands up. She also said, and this is the wierd or creepy part, that it had blood on its teeth. I asked what she meant and she said it had red on or around its teeth. She also said it motions to them like come with him.</p> <p>The blood on its teeth sounded out of place and I know she’s young but when she told me this I believed her. I wonder if you’ve heard this before?</p> <p>This is the same girl who told me when she was three she saw a “monkey bear” with red eyes and a flat nose. She had a fever when she said this but I believed her and what is a monkey bear with red eyes and a flat nose? I have pics of foot prints, hair, and recordings from my house. I have a pic of what I think is a Sasquatch a guy gave me two-three miles from my house. If you can’t look into these or want to talk that’s fine but have you or anyone else heard of this type of behavior and details my daughter told me? Activity at my house has gone way down and I believe they keep their distance from us but we still hear them and experience things from time to time."</p> <p> </p> <p>https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

On my way back home, in Oil City, is about 16 miles of mostly deserted rural roadway.</p> <p>There is a section of Gamelands, state owned public hunting lands, numbering about 10,000 acres on both sides of the road. Driving back home it’s a slight downhill on the left side of the road and it goes uphill to a ridge top and dense, hemlock and mountain Laurel covered steep river hillside, all hundreds of feet above the Allegheny River.</p> <p>We had been hunting archery and rifle some behind my cousin’s house above Tionesta Lake, a Corps of engineers flood control lake, so we had been seeing deer on the way home numerous times, especially in this one stretch of road that travels through the Gamelands, so I generally drive a little bit slower and am a little more attentive in areas we frequently see the deer to prevent hitting them.</p> <p>So, here I was driving home, watching for deer, when a young deer, I would say a yearling or early fawn from this year came stumbling/sliding into the road, like it had been tripped or pushed. In seconds, a huge, hairy figure jumped off of the bank and landed in the middle of the other lane next to the deer that was just regaining it’s feet. In one motion, it scooped the deer up in it’s left arm, which caused it to blat loudly, similar to a spine shot deer that needs finished off to prevent it’s suffering.( I had been only going 30 mph roughly through that stretch and had jammed on my brakes and had stopped.) In just a moment, it took it’s right hand and grabbed the deers head and just twisted and broke it’s neck effortlessly. It seemed to have been so concentrated on catching the deer, it didn’t notice me right away.</p> <p>After it dispatched the deer, it turned slightly to it’s left, towards me and, having my high beams on, I saw it well, only 15-20 yards from my bumper. It’s lips parted slightly and it let out a low, rumbly growl and just hurdled the far guardrails, easily and must have sprang at least 20 feet in that one leap. It was a dark auburn to black, but it seemed to have reddish highlights in front of the headlights. I only got to see part of it’s face, the left side and from the back really well. It was 8 ‘ or so tall, longer from the waist to head than waist to foot, didn’t seem to have a cone shaped head from the angle I saw it from, hands had to have spanned a foot or more across, it was at least 4′ across the shoulders, legs as big as my waist and I am 6’ and 270#. I know without a doubt this was a Sasquatch, flat nose, had pointed canines, upper and lower on the left side when it’s lips parted, not really pronounced, but noticeably pointed. It had fairly long hair, it’s face was bare from it’s protruding eyebrow area to it’s lower lip. Gray/black skin, kind of looked like supple leather, not worn, really.</p> <p>I just sat there for several minutes to get my composure. As much as I wasn’t quite sure what I saw those years ago, I’m convinced it wasn’t a black bear, but I am positive that this was a Sasquatch."</p> <p>---</p> <p>Joel writes "We have some things going on at my house. Strange noises I have recorded. My six year old told me she saw a Sasquatch at her window before. It had creepy red eyes. It was black but had brown hair mixed in. It’s nose was flat. It scratched at their window. It hides, meaning it disappears and then appears I believe she means it ducks down and then stands up. She also said, and this is the wierd or creepy part, that it had blood on its teeth. I asked what she meant and she said it had red on or around its teeth. She also said it motions to them like come with him.</p> <p>The blood on its teeth sounded out of place and I know she’s young but when she told me this I believed her. I wonder if you’ve heard this before?</p> <p>This is the same girl who told me when she was three she saw a “monkey bear” with red eyes and a flat nose. She had a fever when she said this but I believed her and what is a monkey bear with red eyes and a flat nose? I have pics of foot prints, hair, and recordings from my house. I have a pic of what I think is a Sasquatch a guy gave me two-three miles from my house. If you can’t look into these or want to talk that’s fine but have you or anyone else heard of this type of behavior and details my daughter told me? Activity at my house has gone way down and I believe they keep their distance from us but we still hear them and experience things from time to time."</p> <p> </p> <p>https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Join us in celebrating Sasquatch Chronicles’ 500th episode on Friday, December 21. We’ll be welcoming Les Stroud to the show, and he sits down to talk about his journey as Survivorman and what lead him there, what he’s up to now, and of course, Sasquatch. Les will share with us some never before heard experiences, his opinion on what the creature is, and will give us some firsthand insight into some of the most memorable moments from Survivorman: Bigfoot.</p> <p>Les Stroud is a Canadian survival expert, filmmaker and musician best known for his hit television series “Survivorman,” where he uses his skills and knowledge to survive completely alone in the wilderness for up to 10 days with limited or no ready access to water, food, and supplies. He is the “only producer in the history of television to produce an internationally broadcast series entirely written, videotaped and hosted alone.”</p> <p>Les began his rich career as an outdoorsman in 1990 as a guide for Black Feather Wilderness Adventures leading canoe excursions into the Northern Ontario wilds. The time he spent there would lead him down the path to creating his first documentary, Snowshoes and Solitude, which was named “Best Documentary” at the Muskoka Film Festival and Best Film at the Waterwalker Film Festival. Stroud would go on to produce a collection of “specials” for The Discovery Channel Canada which laid the groundwork for “Survivorman” as a full-scale series, spanning 7 seasons and inspiring a long list of subsequent “survival”-themed television programs.</p> <p>His interest in the “Sasquatch Phenomenon” (as he likes to refer to it) began at a young age and continued to grow as he spent more time in the outdoors, especially in remote locations which offer few, if any, concrete explanations for some of his more mysterious experiences.</p> <p>Stroud dedicated an entire season of Survivorman to the mystery surrounding Bigfoot. He started the journey from a skeptic’s perspective – equally questioning and open-minded – in the pursuit of bringing legitimacy to the discussion of whether or not Sasquatch exists. He remains actively interested in the subject, subsequently conducting a handful of interviews expanding on his beliefs and divulging details from some of the unexplained encounters he’s had while out in the wilderness.</p> <p>To find out more about Les and what he’s currently up to, connect with him here:</p> <p>Website: <a href="http://www.lesstroud.ca" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">www.lesstroud.ca</a></p> <p>Facebook: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thereallesstroud" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">www.facebook.com/thereallesstroud</a></p> <p>Instagram: <a href="http://www.instagram.com/reallesstroud" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">www.instagram.com/reallesstroud</a></p> <p>Twitter: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/reallesstroud" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">www.twitter.com/reallesstroud</a></p> <p>YouTube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/lesstroud" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">www.youtube.com/user/lesstroud</a></p> <p>Spotify: <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/artist/0LsCXk6IVrhkR4bTjP5qG5" target= "_blank" rel= "noopener">https://open.spotify.com/artist/0LsCXk6IVrhkR4bTjP5qG5</a></p> <p>Soundcloud: <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/les-stroud-music" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">www.soundcloud.com/les-stroud-music</a></p> <p>Periscope: <a href= "http://www.periscope.tv/Survivorman/1gqxvqyYPgqJB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.periscope.tv/Survivorman/1gqxvqyYPgqJB</a></p>]]></description>

It didn't seem that big.</p> <p>Things around the property started getting bad. Aggression from these things picked up and horses and other live stock were being killed. We had to move. There are so many details and accounts I would be happy to come on and share what has happened to me and my family. I can tell you they are not human and they are not a monkey."</p> <p>The guest describes investigating a missing person report. The witness said "Later in life I started to investigate reports around the area. One report we looked into was a missing man. He decided to go "squatching" as his wife put it about 8-9 miles from where he lived and it was very rural. We found the missing man or pieces of him over several miles. We also found large Sasquatch footprints around his vehicle, they were different sizes. You could piece together what happen to this guy. No doubt in my mind these things killed this old man. I can go into greater detail."</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jim writes “I was driving north on I65 in southern Indiana through endless farmland. I was contacted by my dispatch team and told to check my reefer unit on my trailer. They said it was giving them alerts that my cargo temp was too high. I pulled over next to a thick wooded area off of an exit ramp. As i was running diagnostics on my unit, I became aware of the sound of breathing and was overcome by a smell most foul. I reached into the sidebox of my cab and hit my worklights and what I saw standing over me was stuff of horror films. It was HUGE! I froze in place as this thing stared me down. Finally the engine on my reefer unit started up, scaring me and it. I left as fast as my rig could move. I cant explain the feelings of fear being that close to this creature.”</p> <p>Spoke to Jim at length about his encounter and he said that he had encountered something strange a few years back when he was driving home with his young child. Jim said “I was driving down this back country road in Oklahoma and I thought I saw a coyote or a wolf walk out on all fours. This thing stood up like a man. I jerked the truck to miss it and this thing reached out and tried to grab my back bumper. I do not know what it was it was a wolf on a mans body. It was evil whatever it was, it looked evil. The road I was going down has a speed limit of 25 mph and I was doing 90 mph trying to get away. I am a long haul truck driver now but I was in law enforcement and I have seen some of the worst things you can imagine from mangled bodies in car accidents to just about anything you can think of and this scared me more then anything.”</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Mike who is a current law enforcement officer. He shares an encounter he had while doing an investigation.</p> <p>We wrap up with Shirley, Shirley writes “My story, at age 12, I am now 65. There was always an overnight camp out and I remember how excited all of us kids were as we climbed on the bus and it seems like forever to get to wherever we’re going to camp out but I remember they said it was on the edge of the Sierra forest and there was a river or a Creek If we dared to get in it. We didn’t know what that meant but all the more. it was suspenseful. The river was beautiful, but it was too wide for us kids to cross and the water was freezing cold.</p> <p>On October 21st, at the overnight campout in 1966 the night before I turned 13, all of us kids along with the counselors sat around the fire. We learned how to make baked potatoes and hotdogs on a stick. We made s’mores and roasted marshmallows and told ghost stories.</p> <p>One of the counselors disappeared we thought they had gone to the restroom, but in the middle of one of the other councilors telling a story they jumped out and scared the heck out of us and we all fell out laughing after we discovered it was the counselor. It was now time for bed. All the kids slept on the riverbank sandy beach. I knew it was going to be cold in the morning on that beach, so I slept near the camp table. Sometime later I woke up to go to the bathroom. Before I</p> <p>got out of my sleeping bag. The first thing I grabbed was my flashlight as we were all required to bring one with this in the event we needed to go the bathroom in the dark.</p> <p>I unzip my sleeping bag halfway down. I grab my flashlight and I turned it on. As I continued to unzip more, I rolled over to my right, flashlight in hand and I turned and saw a very An unbelievably tall and big silver/white hairy thing standing near the picnic table between me and the other kids that were on the beach. At first, I thought it was the counselors playing a prank, but I realized it was too big, too tall. And when I say this, I really mean it was way too tall and way too big. I remember looking at it and I looked all over and I saw it’s right side was facing me showing me that the arm with way way too long. I’m no biology expert but as I said I’m a voracious reader and I know how our bodies are supposed to look.</p> <p>I looked directly in its eyes, I guess it looked in my direction minutes on my flashlight on and I was puzzled and afraid but not terrified. There was no specific look on its face it just looked and basically ignored me. It looked like a person in the face. Part way down on his forehead around the eyes to just below the chin was no hair and the ears were covered with hair, I mean, all I could see was the eyes, nose, upper lip and mouth was skin I don’t recall in my memory what color the skin was and the rest was hair. I say hair because it was not fuzzy like a bear, dog other kinds of animals it was like our hair. It was straight but I can’t recall how long it was I just remember it covered all of its body except the hand I could see or rather the palm. I remember on the right side that was no hair on the palm. I have no concept of how much time went by, I recall looking into its eyes then looking down at my friends sleeping on the beach and there was dead silence and I recall flashing my flashlight while I was looking at them on the beach and flashing it back at it and it was gone. I heard it walking away, or shall I say I felt it walking away, because I could feel the vibration in the ground, you know kind of like when a big rig truck passes by your house and you can kind of feel that vibration.</p> <p>it was at that point I decided I didn’t really need to go to the bathroom and I slowly zipped up my sleeping bag to cover my head, you know as kids, we think if we can’t be seen we can’t be caught and I recall I was shaking. My flashlight was still in my hands but I don’t recall if it was on and I didn’t go back to sleep for the rest of the night.”</p>]]></description>

The river was beautiful, but it was too wide for us kids to cross and the water was freezing cold.</p> <p>On October 21st, at the overnight campout in 1966 the night before I turned 13, all of us kids along with the counselors sat around the fire. We learned how to make baked potatoes and hotdogs on a stick. We made s’mores and roasted marshmallows and told ghost stories.</p> <p>One of the counselors disappeared we thought they had gone to the restroom, but in the middle of one of the other councilors telling a story they jumped out and scared the heck out of us and we all fell out laughing after we discovered it was the counselor. It was now time for bed. All the kids slept on the riverbank sandy beach. I knew it was going to be cold in the morning on that beach, so I slept near the camp table. Sometime later I woke up to go to the bathroom. Before I</p> <p>got out of my sleeping bag. The first thing I grabbed was my flashlight as we were all required to bring one with this in the event we needed to go the bathroom in the dark.</p> <p>I unzip my sleeping bag halfway down. I grab my flashlight and I turned it on. As I continued to unzip more, I rolled over to my right, flashlight in hand and I turned and saw a very An unbelievably tall and big silver/white hairy thing standing near the picnic table between me and the other kids that were on the beach. At first, I thought it was the counselors playing a prank, but I realized it was too big, too tall. And when I say this, I really mean it was way too tall and way too big. I remember looking at it and I looked all over and I saw it’s right side was facing me showing me that the arm with way way too long. I’m no biology expert but as I said I’m a voracious reader and I know how our bodies are supposed to look.</p> <p>I looked directly in its eyes, I guess it looked in my direction minutes on my flashlight on and I was puzzled and afraid but not terrified. There was no specific look on its face it just looked and basically ignored me. It looked like a person in the face. Part way down on his forehead around the eyes to just below the chin was no hair and the ears were covered with hair, I mean, all I could see was the eyes, nose, upper lip and mouth was skin I don’t recall in my memory what color the skin was and the rest was hair. I say hair because it was not fuzzy like a bear, dog other kinds of animals it was like our hair. It was straight but I can’t recall how long it was I just remember it covered all of its body except the hand I could see or rather the palm. I remember on the right side that was no hair on the palm. I have no concept of how much time went by, I recall looking into its eyes then looking down at my friends sleeping on the beach and there was dead silence and I recall flashing my flashlight while I was looking at them on the beach and flashing it back at it and it was gone. I heard it walking away, or shall I say I felt it walking away, because I could feel the vibration in the ground, you know kind of like when a big rig truck passes by your house and you can kind of feel that vibration.</p> <p>it was at that point I decided I didn’t really need to go to the bathroom and I slowly zipped up my sleeping bag to cover my head, you know as kids, we think if we can’t be seen we can’t be caught and I recall I was shaking. My flashlight was still in my hands but I don’t recall if it was on and I didn’t go back to sleep for the rest of the night.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Does Sasquatch always attack? My first witness writes “I began hearing brush crack along with a foul smell that was similar to a skunk that was wet and sprayed with BO beside me, the cracking gradually moved ahead of me and then stop, I quickened my pace slightly and tried to block it out, but after I entered a small clearing I stopped dead as a large brown figure stood in front of me, I was around 5’9 at the time as I had hit a massive growth spurt and even then this thing dwarfed me in height, it had to be around 7-8ft tall and easily 500lbs without question, it looked me straight in the eye and made a short grunt and started to move towards me. I was frozen with fear…”</p> <p>My second witness had a very strange encounter he writes “I was out in the woods for four days camping by myself with my dog. I had a Sasquatch walk up on my tent, it made a sound like an ape or a monkey would make. I was terrified, the forest went silent like a switch had been flipped, there was no noise not even the insects. I don’t even know how to describe what happen next. After it walked off I had a soft light appear inside my tent and start spiraling like a yin yang, I thought I was losing my mind.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “Hi Wes, I’ll admit I feel awkward sending this e-mail as the people I’ve told have mocked me.</p> <p>Anyway here goes. I grew up on a farm in southern Maryland and we had over a hundred of acres of mostly wooded land. Our property was adjacent to other large swaths of heavily wooded acreage.<br /> To cut to the chase, I was an avid hunter growing up. So much that during my teens I’d go squirrel hunting daily after getting home from school.</p> <p>One afternoon in October I went out alone. I was 16. However this time I decided to go further into the woods. As I hiked along my mind was somewhere else until I noticed I was in a part of the woods I’d never been to. I was surrounded by old growth trees and the terrain was rolling hills. I looked down into the bottom of this hollow and saw large grove of laurel. I slowly made my way down and suddenly was overcome with a heavy feeling of dread and that I was being watched. So much that I froze and began to look around expecting to see another person but didn’t.</p> <p>This fear kept growing to the point that I felt terror for lack of a better word. Without notice I saw movement in the laurel. Footfalls and branch snapping.</p> <p>I called out that I wasn’t alone hoping that whoever was in there would stop trying to scare me.<br /> The footfalls stopped but my fear was still high. I was armed with a Ruger 77/22 bolt action rifle. I leveled the rifle at the laurel and again called out for whoever was in there to know I wasn’t alone.<br /> Then a chattering almost laughter came from the laurel bushes. It was so weird, it sounded like a cackle. Filled with fear I fired my rifle above the laurel.</p> <p>Then all hell broke lose. The laughter became a growl. And the laurel was crashing. I could see that from the top of the bushes that it was coming towards me.</p> <p>I again called out and again fired. It didn’t stop.</p> <p>I turned and ran up the slope. Now I should mention that it was dusk, the light was going fast and by how far I’d gone I wouldn’t get back to my house until after dark.</p> <p>When I crested the top of the hill I looked back and saw something hairy step out of the laurel and look up at me. Now as I write this I’m getting a chill up my spine.</p> <p>I can still see it looking at me.</p> <p>I cycled the bolt on the rifle and fired at it. I missed as it didn’t respond, it stepped fully out and stood up. Whatever it was wasn’t huge it was about five to six feet tall. I know, it doesn’t sound like a Bigfoot but it had wide shoulders, long arms and covered in hair.</p> <p>I took off as fast as I could, I was in a panic, I kept falling down and tripping. I was getting shredded by branches hitting my face but I didn’t care. I could hear whatever it was chasing me. It was barreling through the woods but not directing behind me. What’s odd is it seemed to be running parallel to me.<br /> After 15 minutes I could see the lights of my house through the trees and this thing was still running near me. The issue I had was that if I turned right to head to the trail to go to my house I’d encounter this thing, so I passed the trail and headed around the trail and out into the field.<br /> When I was in the field, I was screaming for my family, I turned and cycled the bolt and fired into the woods again. It was dark now completely.</p> <p>I listened but heard nothing but I could sense it was still there. I ran to the house and went inside.<br /> When I encountered my mom I was crying and covered in blood from all the cuts and slashes in my face.<br /> My older brother grabbed a shotgun and went out, I followed him with a fully loaded rifle. And it should be said this was against my mother’s wishes.</p> <p>We both fired into the woods, and yelled at whatever it was.</p> <p>I never encountered it again and I didn’t go hunting by myself ever again.</p> <p>My mother didn’t believe me, she thought it was probably a black bear and my other siblings made fun of me. However my grandmother who lived in a house on the farm for 55 years told me she’d seen stuff years before and even had seen lights above the forest years back.</p> <p>Even if I never talk to you, it feels good to get this off my chest.”</p>]]></description>

I know, it doesn’t sound like a Bigfoot but it had wide shoulders, long arms and covered in hair.</p> <p>I took off as fast as I could, I was in a panic, I kept falling down and tripping. I was getting shredded by branches hitting my face but I didn’t care. I could hear whatever it was chasing me. It was barreling through the woods but not directing behind me. What’s odd is it seemed to be running parallel to me. After 15 minutes I could see the lights of my house through the trees and this thing was still running near me. The issue I had was that if I turned right to head to the trail to go to my house I’d encounter this thing, so I passed the trail and headed around the trail and out into the field. When I was in the field, I was screaming for my family, I turned and cycled the bolt and fired into the woods again. It was dark now completely.</p> <p>I listened but heard nothing but I could sense it was still there. I ran to the house and went inside. When I encountered my mom I was crying and covered in blood from all the cuts and slashes in my face. My older brother grabbed a shotgun and went out, I followed him with a fully loaded rifle. And it should be said this was against my mother’s wishes.</p> <p>We both fired into the woods, and yelled at whatever it was.</p> <p>I never encountered it again and I didn’t go hunting by myself ever again.</p> <p>My mother didn’t believe me, she thought it was probably a black bear and my other siblings made fun of me. However my grandmother who lived in a house on the farm for 55 years told me she’d seen stuff years before and even had seen lights above the forest years back.</p> <p>Even if I never talk to you, it feels good to get this off my chest.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

We (Seal Team Three Alpha Platoon ) had a training exercise at Fort Lewis. Night land navigation with just a compass protractor and map with no weapons. Army SF made it sure we had no weapons, but they warned about Sasquatches, thought just to Psyhopp. US. so THE Patrolling was interesting say the least.”</p> <p>Spoke to the witness and he said “I recall several times I was being stalked and followed and there is no way this was a man but it was on two feet. Myself and other team members heard them communicating on many occasions. It was strange, it was like everyone on the base knew about these things or had some sort of run in with them. I never got a chance to see it but I was followed and stalked several times and this thing moved like lightning, so smooth.”</p> <p>I have some updates and some exciting news.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “I grew up in Missouri, or missourah as we say, in my youth, I ran with a pretty rough crowd, raced cars,(picture trucker caps, long hair, black t shirts, skynyrd cranking and jack daniels in the freezer).</p> <p>Anyway, we used to go down to the Lake if the Ozarks at my friend Matt’s cabin the Osage Beach/Branson area when it was nothing but filling stations and live bait stores, early 80s. During the weekends it was busy, kinda a red neck Hamptons. Dead during the week.</p> <p>One week in late August my friend Matt invited a bunch of us to hunt/fish/party for a couple of days mid week when nobody is there. We got a late start as usual, I remember stopping for gas, and the crusty old man who pumped it told us to watch out for those guys, he nodded at a couple of guys in a pickup with about 200# yeast and corn feed and copper line, ie moonshiners pulling out in a beat up Chevy truck (common in the Ozarks). “Don’t let them boys or the boogers get ya”. He was referring to the recent MoMo sightings in the area.</p> <p>The Missouri Monster or MoMo had been seen for a couple of years in Jackson, Clay Counties as well as the Ozarks. There have actually been sightings and confrontations dating back to the Civil War, (Jessie James and his guerrilla fighters actually had violent encounters with them in the caves on Boone Co.)</p> <p>Anyway, when we finally got to the cabin in a very desolate area of the lake (Cajun creek as they called it) with several small creeks in a densely wooded hillside, literally the sticks.</p> <p>That night we were pretty loud, partying/ girls/loud music/ the occasional drunken firearm discharged (sorry we were wild). At about 330 am, we started getting various chunks of wood and the occasional pebble tossed at us. We assumed it was some disgruntled moonshiners which we knew were in the area. We yelled back and threw the stones back. Then silence, dead silence. About 5 min later we heard a bunch of whooping, that was weird. Matt insisted it was a coyote, yeah the biggest assed one on the planet! After about 10 min of whoops from two directions it stopped. I guess MoMo doesn’t like skynyrd! The rest of the nighte was quiet. I should mention that Matt and Kevin were down at the lake night fishing for catfish with stinkbait, they caught several and gutted them on a large flat rock on the shore. While doing so they heard loud splashing that they thought were large fish or somebody tossing rocks.</p> <p>Fast forward to the am, a couple of the girls went down to the dock to hang out while we were cooking up catfish steaks for breakfast. About 1/2 an hr after they left they ran back screaming saying they saw a bear or something with long hair and arms hiding in the brush by the fish guts.</p> <p>We all ran down, nuthin. Of course nobody looked for tracks. After a day on the water we came back to the cabin, everything in order except the woodpile was toppled. Matt and I wanted to go squirrel hunting in the hills by the creek where there was a large beaver damn that had been there for years, you’d see them floating down the creek from time to time. Matt had a 12ga side by side and I had an Erma .22 cal m1 carbine (German post war). When we hiked up to the creek about 3/4 mi from the lake and directly above the cabin. When we got up there, the smell of death was strong, then we came upon the beaver damn which was in shambles, one beavers carcass was found pulled apart, like something grabbed the head, and another the tail and pulled. There were bites out of it, maybe 12hrs old.</p> <p>Matt was on one bank of the creek and I was on the other looking at the destroyed damn. The woods were silent. Then we heard somebody sloshing up through the creek (it was maybe a foot deep at most) coming down towards us. Slowly a figure came around the brush walking in the creek staring at the water, bent over trying to find something. It was ape like maybe 5 ft tall, black/ brown matted hair all over its body broad shoulders, male, no real neck, cone shaped head with longish hair on neck shoulder area, couldn’t really see ears. It’s nose was flat with forward nostrils black skin, large black eyes. It first looked at Matt grunted a snarled showing its incisors and turned and started going directly at Matt, who was paralyzed in fear. I aimed at him and chambered a round, clearly he never saw me, he quickly turned his torso looking my way with a puzzled look on his face, cocking his head at an angle. Then we heard a distinct clicking from up in the woods behind us, the one in the water clicked back and he quickly went back the way he came. The whole thing lasted 2 min. I had him in my sights but couldn’t pull the trigger. Looked humanoid but clearly more ape. The closest thing I’ve seen on line is the “them and us” version.</p> <p>The rest of the time was quiet and we never talked about it for weeks. I had another less dramatic encounter later that fall in Buckner, Mo which I can fill you in on later. Glad to get it off my chest, feel free to call or email me anytime to talk.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes ” Hello Wes my name is Jay and I’m writing you from Dallas TX. I have been wanting to write for about a month now and I just worked up the courage.</p> <p>The past year or two I have only began to look into this fenominon from the trauma caused from my encounter 20 years ago. So I’ll get right to it and the facts of what happened to us.</p> <p>November 1998 two days after thanksgiving we went to our hunting spot on type 2 public hunting ground just south of nacadoches east texas in a very remote location my dad loved to hunt. We would all go as a family and I have a little brother, but this particular encounter it was just my father and I. I need to also say this land always freaked me out and gave me bad vibes. We would bring our dune buggy with us to get to our location from camp. And in 1998 I was 15 years old. I didn’t really want to go because I had a girlfriend and wanted to stay in town with her, but it was important to my farther and I didn’t like him going out there by himself.</p> <p>Everything I’m about to tell you is non exaggerated and all facts. I remember them very clearly still to this day.</p> <p>We arrived to the road that lead Into the camp at 1am after a 5 hour drive from the city. The road leading down to our camp was rough and took another 30 minutes to get to. As we went down into a valley my dad told me where do you think this car is coming from? I was laying in the seat but awake. I sat up and looked to see what looked like bright headlights coming from inside the forest ( we are on the only road) the lights are very bright and moving. We sat there parked looking and this in silence. My dad tells me “oh don’t worry it’s someone in a jeep off roading”. And trying to make me not worry. But it gave me a bad feeling and I didn’t like it. We made it to our camp, the same place we camped every single year. We just unpacked few things then went to sleep. Our hunting trip was 3 days. My encounter took place on the very last day there.</p> <p>He let me use a 7mm hunting rifle but I never shot at anything. I had more fun getting muddy in the dune buggy about 10+ miles away wile my dad hunted. But on the last day he didn’t want me to drop him off and go play in buggy, he wanted me to hunt and he took the buggy. It was the second hunt of that day after lunch and before dark. The encounter happened and 6pm. It started to get dusk and sun was getting low. I knew my dad would soon be coming to pick me up and I had been in my tree climber for about 2 maybe 3 hours. Still and quite. I really just liked to see the wildlife, like I said I never shot at anything but I never told my dad that. But I often saw deer and would watch them, coyotes, birds and sometimes raccoons. I did like being out there, but many times my hair would stand up and have a bad feeling. I had been coming to this exact spot I was in for a few years, it was like my own place. As I climb down and get everything together I’m not concerned about making noise. I’m about 200 yards from the road looking into a clearing that’s top of the hill. As I start walking the direction of the road all of a sudden I hear what sounded like a tree knock. But it was close. And it froze me in my tracks and I couldn’t move, I frantically scanned the area looking for the source. Waited 5 minutes then started walking again, with a faster pace. When I arrived to the road I heard a scream! A loud scream! And it was deep pitched and went on to turn to high pitch scream. No animal, no man, a monster. A legitimate monster. And I could tell the directional sound of it was pointed at me and the volume of it I instantly knew whatever made it was massive! My knees actually buckled and now I’m sitting in the ditch next to the road and shaking. Then it screamed again! And again! It was moving it’s location and I could tell or had a feeling it was screaming at ME! pure fear cane over me. I couldn’t decide if I wanted to run or wed-sat to do. But reality I was froze in fear and I couldn’t move. Plus my father was 10 miles away. I knew I had a gun that was loaded but that did not help the terror I was going threw. Then it got quite and it started to get dark. And it was really quite. I heardthe sound of two legs crunching branched behind me and I turned and didn’t see anything, but wasn’t the direction of the screams, so Instantly thought oh shit it’s more than one monster. I turned back to look across the road from the direction of the screams… Then I saw it! It was crouched down sticking it’s head through the bushes. I could only see it face, but I saw it. I was 20 yards away. It had battleship grey skin, wrinkles and dirty. Dark black big eyes. Black lips but thin lips. It had reddish orange brown hair. Like greasy longer hair. But I was locked onto it’s eyes. I saw it blink. But I can’t say this looked human. No way. This was a monster. A real life monster and it looked terrifying.</p> <p>It’s head was round and as big as a basket ball. I had no clue what I was looking at, Bigfoot never crossed my mind. I could only think monster. About a minute went by then it made a huffing noise as he pulled his head back. Then I couldn’t see it. And it was dark by this point. I realized I was not holding my riffle. I was sitting on my butt and had my arms wrapped around my knees. This was so intense that I didn’t think to pull the riffle. Now I’m older I feel I would have shot it in the face. But there was more than one. I honestly thought I was going to die, and I was crying my eyes out. Then I saw the headlights of my dad coming in the dune buggy. Soon as I saw the light before he came over the hill this monster took off through the woods screaming at crashing trees. The ground was shaking. But I didn’t see how big it was. I only saw him stick his face through the Bush. When my dad pulled up I literally jumped in. Then I blacked out. I woke up few minutes later and my dad was yelling at me ” son what the hell’s wrong with you!!” I started yelling back JUST DRIVE! Drive, drive!! I had throw up on my pants leg and I felt so sick for a wile after. When we got back to camp I locked myself in the truck and layed down. I refused to get out. I didn’t want to tell my dad, hes southern Baptist and Vietnam veteran and he just wouldn’t believe. But he did know how terrified I was.</p> <p>Thankfully he packed up camp and agreed to drive home that night since it was day 3. I slept the whole way home and felt sick. I did have a near death experience that day and I would never want anyone to have that feeling. I was afraid to tell him for many years, and I confided in my bag friends mom few years later and she didn’t take me serious. Before my dad died a couple years ago he asked me what had scared me so bad that day. I just said “Bigfoot dad, I thought he was going to eat me” and we both laughed. He kept going back to that same spot for 2 more years until he bought his deer lease. I have never ever been back in the woods or been camping in the deep woods after that day. And I don’t think I ever could. But I have held this story in out of fear of ridicule, and now I’m married with two young boys. I have just now got to the point 20 years later where I can look Into this subject. And I prefer your podcast to hear other people encounters. Thank you Wes for listening and your time.

He encountered a Sasquatch late one night and wasn’t sure what he was looking at.</p> <p>Donald says “I was out with friends in the middle of nowhere and I watching this strange eyeshine, it looked like one eye not two.</p> <p>I thought was a cougar. I decided it would be better to leave. I was trying to turn the car around on this little country road and that is when the headlights lit this creature up. I can explain to you what it looked like, it was only 8 feet from my headlights standing in the tree line like a statue. Before I explain to you what I saw, this thing was injured. It looked like it was in a fight or something because the other eye was all mangled. Now I understand why only one eye was giving off eyeshine….”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Rick writes “Hi Wes, My name is Rick. Around Aug 2004 me and a friend were in Haliburton Forest planting pot. I’ve been growing weed for 25 years and I’ve been to some of the most remote locations in the southern part of the province.</p> <p>Ontario is huge and there is a lot of deep forest out there. I’v never seen anything like What I saw that year before or since. I had rented a cottage in Carnarvin, it,s just outside the town of haliburton and we were planting not far from there. It is remote Forrest out there, swamps and limestone and granite and thick thick brambles and vines and thorns and in some spots it almost impossible to go off trail because you just can’t . Well these are the places we like to go in fall or early spring to prep the planting area cut trees ect.</p> <p>Then come summer its grows in and there’s no trails leading to our patch. Well, we going into the area in the middle of summer for some reason I forget why and for some reason we had to go off trail so we were hacking through the brambles vines and thorns, I mean its so thick we get like 10 yards in 10 min. We hacked into the thicket for about 30 yards and we found a tunnel cut into the thicket. It ran for thousands of meters through the absolute thickest parts where you just can’t walk, it was like a highway through the brambles. It would fork off into different directions and there was a well worn path inside. It was absolutely crazy. It opened up Into a huge crater clearing. The crater must have been at least 80-100 feet from the center in a perfect circle. The perimeter was huge. It was about 25 feet deep with about a 20′ slope. We started to walk toward center when I looked on the ground and saw something I have never ever seen oh heard of before. Bones, thousands of them. The slopes the center , the whole floor of this huge crater was fucking covered in bones. Skulls ribs, vertebrae , mostly deer some moose and bear.. I got a sense of dread.</p> <p>Like I’m not supposed to be here. Me and my buddy were horrified. There is no way it was a poacher spot because there were no trees in the crater to hang an animal on for cleaning and gutting. We looked at the bones close and noticed obvious gnaw marks and we got the fuck out of there.</p> <p>As we started walking around the crater I noticed that there were several of these “tunnel” cut outs that opened up into this crater, basically all the way around. It was like there were hidden paths all through the Forrest and they all led to here. By the time we were to freaked out to stay any longer we couldn’t tell what doorway we came in through. I took a reading from my gps and we basically cut our way out in a straight line the fastest way out. It took us hours to hack though the brambles that we so quickly came in through by way of the tunnels, by the time we made our way to the trail we were so tired we just went back to the cottage and went to bed. Believe me we spent most of the night talking about what the hell could have made that intricate highway through the most dense brush imaginable, wolves, bears, ? We reasoned out that it couldn’t possibly have been either based on the height and width of the tunnels. They were like 8’w and 5’h all the way that we walked. Perfect tunnels in the thickets.</p> <p>The next day we went back into the forest to plant a spot we had already picked out. It was basically in a direct line with a local airport that was about 5 miles away. It was me my buddy and his little red nose pit bull and we were digging some hole in a big clearing when I herd a loud low flying Cessna coming in line with runway so we ducked down as not to be seen. We hid under a big tree and went prone as the plane flew over the clearing. As soon as it passed and the roar of the engine faded a bit we started to stand when all of a sudden two massive I mean massive black creatures, not bears way way to big to be blackies came charging into the clearing and passed us as the pit bull went nuts and gave chase.</p> <p>They were on all fours while running through the clearing but even on all fours they were easily up to my chin and I’m 5’10 . Wes I,v seen the biggest black bears and these ain’t no $%#@* bears. On all fours they were easily over 5 feet high and almost a wide at the shoulder. They went by so fast. I knew we were being stalked and that the sound of the plane spooked them as they were about to jump us. We banged shovel on trees and yelled and screamed the whole way out. We though for sure the dog was gone for good but she tracked our scent and found us about an hour later. When I saw this I knew where the tunnels and the bone pit came from. These things stalk there prey pacing it in the tunnels in the thicket beside the Forrest paths, pull it into the tunnel at some point and then whisk it down to the feeding crater until it’s nothing but a bone pile. Scariest, craziest $hit Ive ever seen.”</p> <p>Then I will speak to Ben who is from Ohio and shares some strange things on his property.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to two guests. Brent writes,<em>“Hey Wes! My name is brent and I live out in banks, Oregon. A friend and I had an experience a couple years ago up in Washington. Here is a copy of what I first wrote down while it was fresh. I have attached the recording and picture</em></p> <p><em>In the recording you will hear me trying to calm down my dog and get him to stay. Then I walk a short distance down the gravel road in the dark with no flashlight (crazy in retrospect) I stop and have my cell with the mic end pointed in the general direction of the initial screams. It’s a poor recording at best. But during most of it in the back ground you can hear the screams. In real life they started out as guttural grumpy ape sounds and then would escalate to high pitched screams and then back to guttural huffing and puffing from the “main one” . The responses were similar but seemed more like a “I’m in position chase them this way” from the others.</em></p> <p><em>Me and a friend recently went to forlorn lakes on 9/22 for a camping trip. We arrived at approximately 7pm.</em></p> <p><em>At approximately 1am we heard a very loud scream. There were 2 or 3 then another one answered back. It sounded like it was near the other side of the small lake we were camping at. Similar but slightly different tone. Then there were multiple answers back. I thought there were possibly 3 answers back to the first scream that was first and closest. My friend had better hearing and he thinks possibly 4. So that’s potentially 4 – 5 total. This went on for about 20 – 30 minutes. I have a German Shepard/wolf dog. He was whining, scared and trying to get as close to me as possible. When I put my hand on him his heart it was beating very rapidly. I have never seen him act like this before. And me and my friend were shaking uncontrollably. He asked if I could record it with my phone. After retrieving my phone from my van I turned on the voice recorder. And walked towards the first and closest screams. I got 2 minutes of recording, but as soon as I got down the road towards the main entrance it stopped. And the whole forest was completely quiet. We both slept in our vehicles that night.</em></p> <p><em>The next day I walked completely around the lake. I found a fresh set of elk tracks cutting across the edge of the lake where the screams were coming from. They were in a tight formation. almost single file. It read obvious that they were at a full run by the way that the softer mud was very churned up. And were not there for a drink. I triangulate the direction and went to the main road where I thought they were coming from. When I reached the swath of forest between the lake and road my dog went to a spot and started sniffing. When I checked it out there was a foot print that I would of never found if he hadn’t pointed it out. It was on the upside of the ditch headed in the same direction a the elk tracks. The dirt was already compacted, but I could clearly see a big toe print and heal. It was still early in the day and you could see the fresh moist dirt that was disturbed compared to the sun baked surround. I snapped a pic with my phone and ran back to camp. After that we decided to leave. I camp on average 30 days a year. And Indian heaven and forlorn lakes are one of my favorite spots. I have never heard anything like this before or been more scared in my life. I googled big foot /forlorn lakes when I got back and bfro report #26572 is very similar. same time of year/ conditions. The main difference is these screams were very close. I would guess about a block away. And the responses were about 2/3 blocks away. Also I feel like maybe they were hunting the elk. And that the loudest one was driving then towards the others and using the lake as a natural barrier to funnel them to the others waiting to ambush. Why would they make do much noise exposing their present and location? My only guess is to scare us away or hunting… Thanks</em></p> <p><em>Since I wrote this I have read many stories and listened to most of you pod cast. It was hard at first to listen to them, but but I feel as time goes on I have less ptsd about the situation. And I can really relate to you last couple episodes.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes, <em>“It was the fall of 1994 when I had my encounter. This took place in northern New Hampshire.</em></p> <p><em>It was a warm fall day must have been in the 70’s that day. The foliage was absolutely beautiful. So I decided to take a walk into the woods that day. I grew up loving the forest and nature. As kids we would play paintball every weekend.</em></p> <p><em>So I was a good hour/hour and a half into the woods, the forest was alive with activity that day, birds chirping, frogs croaking and squirrels running about. I came to an area when I noticed the lack of all sound. I was taught that if this happens chances are that a predator is nearby. So I stopped and looked around, at about 200 to 250 feet in front of me was this massive human looking thing with red hair all over its body except its face and hands, like an orangutans. It had hands and not paws. It looked like a jacked up basketball player. Its face looked like a baboon but its skin was a charcoal black.</em></p> <p><em>The thing was at least 10 feet tall if not more. It had its back against a telephone pole and it looked as if it was scratching its back. Its arms where out in front of it as it moved side to side scratching its back. The hair on its arms was about 8 inches long. I could see the muscles in its legs and arms. It never once looked in my direction. Every ounce of my being was telling me to run. I slowly began walking to my right, looking over my shoulders to make sure it was not coming. Once I heard the birds again is when I felt save enough to run. I never told anyone this until (2017) I will never forget that day.”</em></p> <p> ____________________________________________________________________</p> <p> </p> <p>We also have a special appearance from Tony Merkel of "The Confessionals" podcast.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Zach writes, <em>“I’ll go into my encounter in 2005. I lived in South Webster at the time and we were maybe five miles from the Wayne National Forest Trail Head.</em></p> <p><em>I graduated high school the year before and we would go up to the national forest and drive around the gravel roads up there. We called it the New road because it was built sometime in the 90s and allowed access throughout the forest. They set up primitive campsites and trails for 4wheelers and hunters. I deer and coon hunted it a lot as a young man and ran traps in the rivers running through the forest for muskrat and mink. Never in all my years out there have I encountered anything unusual beside a couple wild dog encounters and seeing a giant wild boar one morning. It was a last minute camping trip with friends one night that we all had an encounter.</em></p> <p><em>Me and some friends decided to camp out on the new road one Saturday evening. It was the end of September and the nights were becoming cold and chilly. We packed up my buddy Erics box van with beer and blankets then he followed me up the road behind my ford escort. We got to our campsite which was a dead end gravel road in Wayne National Forest. The locals use the circle turn around spot for target practice so there’s always shotgun shells and broken beer bottles everywhere. We cleaned up the area then start a fire. It was dark when we started the fire and kept it roaring through most of the night. We backed the van close to the fire and sat in the back just hanging out and bull*****. The first weird thing we noticed was every once in a while we would hear a ding off the top of the van. The first few times we didn’t pay much attention to it. I thought it was acorns falling or a bird dropping something from the trees over head. Well it kept happening so my buddy Eric climbs on top of the van and finds two gravel stones laying on the roof of his van. It was the same gravel from the gravel road we came in on.</em></p> <p><em>We laughed and though maybe it had popped out from under my tire and landed on the roof of his van because he did follow me a few miles through the forest on that gravel road. But it kept happened and as it got closer to midnight it was happening more often. Sometimes two rocks hitting at a time. We heard 4wheelers in the distance earlier that night and so my buddy starts yelling into the woods thinking it was someone messing with us. After Eric yelled and threw gravel back into the woods it seemed to stop. We finish our drinks (which was a 12 pack of Natty Light) then later down in the van to sleep for the night. I wanna say it was around 2am when we hit the hay.</em></p> <p><em>Anyway a couple hours later maybe around 4am I woke up to the sound of wood breaks and crashes in the forest. I woke Eric up and we sat there and listened to the woods cracking around our camping spot. If you ever seen the Blair Witch Project and remember the campers being woke up at night and the crashing in the woods around them. That’s what it sounded like. It was coming from different directions and once we stepped out of the van we noticed the sounds were coming from down the hill around our spot. The camping spot sat at the top of a hill and it was a sharp incline down on both sides and completely forested. After standing out here and listening for 15 mins or so we heard a loud crash closer to us so I grabbed the spotlight and we started shining down the hill into the woods.</em></p> <p><em>I shined for a few mins before I saw two yellow eyes looking up towards us from a bush thicket. I couldn’t make out the figure in the brush but thought it was something tall or something on a tree because the eyes looked like they were above the ground quite a bit. We watched it for a min then the eyes disappeared. I thought maybe it was a raccoon messing around. There is bear sightings there but it’s very uncommon to cross one. We started shining on the other side of the hill and soon we heard a big crash again. Like wood logs being smashed into the brush. We ran back over and shined down. This time we got a better look at the creature and it had red eyes instead of yellow this time. It was a tall dark figure but is hard to size because we were looking down at it form the top of the hill. We lite that sucker up with the spotlight and there was a Sasquatch. I have no other way of describing it.. it was built like tank and stocky. Looked more like the patty Bigfoot with the cone head. It’s fur looks black/gray and was matted in balls. The thing was Matty looking. Covered in dirt and mud. It’s hair did hang down a bit like a orangutans but was matter up bad. We didn’t smell anything tho.. that sucker was maybe 200 yards down a steep hill looking up at us. My Buddy Eric was freaking out and I was scared to death. I turned the light off and we packed up and was driving out of there in a matter of seconds lol. It didn’t really do anything besides stare up at us. No growls or movement at all. It was standing there still before I turned the light off and headed towards the car. We still talk about this story sometimes when we hang out. Made both of us a believer for sure.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zach writes, <em>“I’ll go into my encounter in 2005. I lived in South Webster at the time and we were maybe five miles from the Wayne National Forest Trail Head.</em></p> <p><em>I graduated high school the year before and we would go up to the national forest and drive around the gravel roads up there. We called it the New road because it was built sometime in the 90s and allowed access throughout the forest. They set up primitive campsites and trails for 4wheelers and hunters. I deer and coon hunted it a lot as a young man and ran traps in the rivers running through the forest for muskrat and mink. Never in all my years out there have I encountered anything unusual beside a couple wild dog encounters and seeing a giant wild boar one morning. It was a last minute camping trip with friends one night that we all had an encounter.</em></p> <p><em>Me and some friends decided to camp out on the new road one Saturday evening. It was the end of September and the nights were becoming cold and chilly. We packed up my buddy Erics box van with beer and blankets then he followed me up the road behind my ford escort. We got to our campsite which was a dead end gravel road in Wayne National Forest. The locals use the circle turn around spot for target practice so there’s always shotgun shells and broken beer bottles everywhere. We cleaned up the area then start a fire. It was dark when we started the fire and kept it roaring through most of the night. We backed the van close to the fire and sat in the back just hanging out and bull*****. The first weird thing we noticed was every once in a while we would hear a ding off the top of the van. The first few times we didn’t pay much attention to it. I thought it was acorns falling or a bird dropping something from the trees over head. Well it kept happening so my buddy Eric climbs on top of the van and finds two gravel stones laying on the roof of his van. It was the same gravel from the gravel road we came in on.</em></p> <p><em>We laughed and though maybe it had popped out from under my tire and landed on the roof of his van because he did follow me a few miles through the forest on that gravel road. But it kept happened and as it got closer to midnight it was happening more often. Sometimes two rocks hitting at a time. We heard 4wheelers in the distance earlier that night and so my buddy starts yelling into the woods thinking it was someone messing with us. After Eric yelled and threw gravel back into the woods it seemed to stop. We finish our drinks (which was a 12 pack of Natty Light) then later down in the van to sleep for the night. I wanna say it was around 2am when we hit the hay.</em></p> <p><em>Anyway a couple hours later maybe around 4am I woke up to the sound of wood breaks and crashes in the forest. I woke Eric up and we sat there and listened to the woods cracking around our camping spot. If you ever seen the Blair Witch Project and remember the campers being woke up at night and the crashing in the woods around them. That’s what it sounded like. It was coming from different directions and once we stepped out of the van we noticed the sounds were coming from down the hill around our spot. The camping spot sat at the top of a hill and it was a sharp incline down on both sides and completely forested. After standing out here and listening for 15 mins or so we heard a loud crash closer to us so I grabbed the spotlight and we started shining down the hill into the woods.</em></p> <p><em>I shined for a few mins before I saw two yellow eyes looking up towards us from a bush thicket. I couldn’t make out the figure in the brush but thought it was something tall or something on a tree because the eyes looked like they were above the ground quite a bit. We watched it for a min then the eyes disappeared. I thought maybe it was a raccoon messing around. There is bear sightings there but it’s very uncommon to cross one. We started shining on the other side of the hill and soon we heard a big crash again. Like wood logs being smashed into the brush. We ran back over and shined down. This time we got a better look at the creature and it had red eyes instead of yellow this time. It was a tall dark figure but is hard to size because we were looking down at it form the top of the hill. We lite that sucker up with the spotlight and there was a Sasquatch. I have no other way of describing it.. it was built like tank and stocky. Looked more like the patty Bigfoot with the cone head. It’s fur looks black/gray and was matted in balls. The thing was Matty looking. Covered in dirt and mud. It’s hair did hang down a bit like a orangutans but was matter up bad. We didn’t smell anything tho.. that sucker was maybe 200 yards down a steep hill looking up at us. My Buddy Eric was freaking out and I was scared to death. I turned the light off and we packed up and was driving out of there in a matter of seconds lol. It didn’t really do anything besides stare up at us. No growls or movement at all. It was standing there still before I turned the light off and headed towards the car. We still talk about this story sometimes when we hang out. Made both of us a believer for sure. Sorry for the long story. My mom had several night encounters around her house. She has heard the Ohio howl out there at night. Long whoops too. My late great aunt had an encounter when she was little out there.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Rob and he shares two encounters with us tonight. Both encounters he had something thrown at him.</p> <p>The second encounter he describes seeing a “Hairy man” after having a boulder thrown at him. I will also be speaking to Tony Merkel from The Confessionals podcast. With the upcoming International Bigfoot Conference coming up and Travis Walton will be a guest we discuss the "fire in the sky" incident. I will also be playing a clip of Travis talking about his encounter while on the ship to bring everyone up to speed before I interview him at the end of August.</p> <p>Rob writes “My name is Rob and I started listening to your show in August of 2015 while I was stationed at Fort Lee, Virginia for a 4 month leadership course. I found it very interesting, some of the behaviors people were reporting, mostly because of 2 occurrences I had, one in fall of 2011 and the other in the summer of 2014.</p> <p>I say occurrences because I was, and Still am not 100% what exactly happened in 2011 and what I saw in 2014.</p> <p>I am born and raised in Enumclaw Washington. I spent my life going river fishing with my dad. We would not even waste time with se river access and preferred and still do prefer solitude while fishing.</p> <p>So we would leave early in the mornings and head for mounting river fishing wherever we felt like we could make a good hike and be left alone. In 2011 I had just returned back to Washington from attending college in Ohio. For the 2 years I was out there finishing my degree I never quite had the time or opportunity to come home often, to spend much time with family, or fish. Once I graduated and came home, that fall my dad and I left early on a Saturday morning and headed over Snoqualmie to the head waters of the Yakima river just outside of Easton.</p> <p>We took the exit and drove in until we came to a bridge over the river. We crossed it, hoping that the road on the other side might follow the river a little further down stream, mostly just so we didn’t risk being in the first spot any other fisherman might come to. However, once we crossed the bridge and drove for a little while, we found out that the road didn’t follow the river hardly at all, so we turned back, crossed the bridge again and parked. We took our poles and headed down to the bank just upstream of the bridge. While we were talking about the best ways to fish that particular area, a pine cone came out of nowhere and landed just at our feet, about 3 feet from the water of the bank we were standing on.</p> <p>The bank was about 45 feet wide, and while there were pine trees up hill from where we were standing, they were in no way reaching anywhere close to over us. Not even close enough for a generous bounce and roll to reach us. We thought it was odd but kept talking and then pulled out the lures and began fishing. My dad walked upriver from me about 120 feet from me, completely visible to me. It was not even 3 minutes with my lure in the water before another pinecone landed to my left about 2 feet away. I never saw the arc of the fall of the pine cone. It just landed there. Pretty soon my dad called out saying that a pine cone hit him. At this point we started looking around to see if there was anyone, anything, a tree, and how they were flying in to judge where they might be coming from. It was so eerie, and I instantly became uncomfortable, but it didn’t seem to bother my dad too much. So we went back to fishing, but again not even 3 minutes and pinecone started falling so close, one bounced and hit my shoe. At that instant I called up to my dad and told him I had an uneasy feeling about what was happening, and that I was ready to go. He assured me it was alright, but said he was willing to head back to the car and try to work our way down river to find another spot, he just needed to use the wood line to “drop off a package”. So while he headed for the brush, I walked back up to the car to put the gear away. I was seated, just waiting for him, when he finally got back, he seemed pretty hasty, but I just assumed he was eager to get to a peaceful spot on the river and get to fishing ( This becomes important in 2017). So we headed back to I-90 and started to work our way down toward Ellensburg, trying to find spots along the river to fish. The rest of the trip was uneventful.</p> <p>In 2012 I joined the Army Reserve and met my finance, in 2013 I was married, and in 2014 I got divorced. When I got married I moved to Spokane and really didn’t have the chance to fish or spend time with my dad, so when I was divorced and moved back to Enumclaw, we decided that a Sunday on the Ohanapecosh would help get my mind off of things. So we took off, headed for Green Water, entered Mt. Rainier National park and headed over Cayuse pass toward Randall and Packwood.</p> <p>We had stopped along that road once before and walked down to the river to do some fishing, well that day we stopped in the same place only the river had moved. From the time we parked the car and actually got to where the river was at that time took 15 minutes, and we crossed 4 dry river beds with large patches of forest growing back up between them. Once we found the river, it had worked its way along a cliff. Like there had been the foot of a hill there until the water eroded it away. The cliff face was a good 25’ high which really didn’t mean to much, apart from the fact that where we arrived at the river, upstream was an enormous log jam.</p> <p>The log jam was so high that it reached to the top off the cliff wall. The log jam stretched from the cliff face, across the river, and was anchored in the forest of the last dry river bed we had come to. Like I said, it was enormous. The other thing that really didn’t mean much at the time was that the Jam had at some point collected enough sediment that a few small deciduous bushes were growing on the top. Well, my dad headed down stream, out of sight and I stayed there where we had come out to the river, I would guess about 200 feet away from the base of the log jam.</p> <p>I had been fishing about 10 minutes when I heard what sounded like a tree break. I looked up at the log jam but didn’t see anything. So I went back to fishing. About 5 minutes later though, a rock, easily the size of a beach ball hit the face of the log jam, making a breaking sound as it bounced, and then came to a stop in the river bank. As I looked over, having heard the branches it broke, then watching it thud to the ground, I saw movement on top the log jam. Honestly Wes, I don’t know what I saw, but to me, it looked like a furry human backside, up right, had run behind the bushes on top the jam. I saw what looked like a trailing thigh, knee, ass, and foot, ALL BLACK and FURRY or Hairy I guess, disappear into the bushes up top.</p> <p>I was horrified. And for a minute thought maybe it was a black bear. Any way. I turned by face back straight, keeping my eyes right and upstream while I calmly reeled in my line. Once I had my line in, I turned down stream to walk to my dad, all the time, not looking directly back, but keeping my head turned one direction or the other to keep my peripheral vision on the jam. When I found my dad I just told him that I wasn’t feeling too good and that the stress of the divorce was too much and I really wanted to go home and lay down. He was very sympathetic and reeled in his line and we headed back through the forest and dry river beds back to the truck. It was the most heightened state of alert in my life, every time we would cross a river bed and have to forge through the forest growing back in. We got back to the truck and headed home. I never told him what I had seen. Mostly because as terrified as I was I thought maybe there was a chance, in fright and panic, that I misidentified and it was just some normal animal.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2015, I was at Fort Lee, VA for an extended training course and had a lot of free time on m hands. There is not a whole lot to do there, and not a whole lot just off post. However there was a bookstore and I spent a lot of free time just browsing. One day I wandered through the Occult/ mystery / alien/ etc. etc. etc. section, and just perused some books on the subjects. When I got back to the fort that day I just happened to start looking at related videos on YouTube and stumbled across your show. Episode 11. Siege of Honobia. I listened to it, and I listened to more, and then all of the fishing events came back. I spent the rest of my time there reading and listening. I read David Paulides books religiously and listened to your show. When I got home after I started talking to my dad about bigfoot and other fringe topics, and he instantly brought up the Yakima occurrence. He told me that while he was in the wood line, another pinecone hit him, hard, while he was squatted in there, he said he absolutely had no Idea where it came from, and that he was actually pretty disturbed by it. So we started listening to your show when we would get together. We have even made 2 drives out to Yacolt, hoping to see something that would completely confirm the tiny bit of what I saw. We drove up Mt. Yacolt, just off the main road before you come into town by the school. That is an eerie feeling driving that road. The woods seem so claustrophobic and dark, even on the sunny day we went. The second trip down, we drove to Sunset falls, and drove all the way up to ( I believe FSR 50) and the feeling is much the same. Still no confirmation for me though.</p> <p>I don’t really know how to word it. I saw something. That much I know. I know what it kind of looked like. But it was just a 1 second glance. I do believe now, after listening to your show that there is something out there. I just cant say for certain that is what I really saw. But I would like to see one.</p> <p>I also don’t know about the pinecone throwing. That is not one I have heard on your show, or anywhere else, but maybe that is something someone has shared with you privately before?</p> <p>Lastly, I just wonder if you have gotten any reports off the Ohanapecosh or Yakima River in the Easton area?”</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Spoke to a witness who has agreed to come on the show. He has one of the most up close and personal encounters I have ever heard.</p> <p>The witness wrote “The encounter happened in Ohio. Prior to this encounter something was coming up to my window at night and would watch me. I told my mom and she said it was impossible because the window was too high up.</p> <p>I was playing with my friends in the woods and we started smelling this strange smell, it was like a wet dog or something dead.</p> <p>I came face to face with this thing that was only about 5 feet tall and it was hiding behind something. It was peeking at me over something’s arm, well that something must have been the mom. She had breasts. She was HUGE and she roared at me and I heard what I now know was samurai chatter behind me. There is so much I could go into. The large female had horse like teeth. They were yellow and broken. The little one had a different look than the female. I drew a picture below of her face, I am happy to come on and talk about the details.”</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to a witness from SE Oklahoma. There is a long family history of sightings. The guest will be sharing some of the encounters from his family as well as his own encounters. I will be having this guest back for a part two, otherwise this might be a 4 hour show tonight.</p> <p>One of the encounters that really interested me was when the guest was a teenager and he came face to face with a Sasquatch. Here is a small portion of that encounter:</p> <p> </p> <p><em>“I put the gun to my shoulder and took aim, I was on it and it looked almost surprised, its eyes got big and it just froze in place.</em></p> <p><em>I know it looked me right in the eyes, I said you better say something I am not kidding man you better say something or ill put one in you. Fight or flight kicked in and I wasn’t running.</em></p> <p><em>Its put it’s arms out to its side palms towards me and then let out a deep grumble like you hear a lion on tv do before it gets in a fight then from a grumble to a roar that shook my insides and I was still focused on it in the scope, I put one of those cci stingers right in its throat and it jerked and jumped real fast back to the sycamore then I could hear coughing a bit and just when I thought it was over it really wasn’t.”</em></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>John writes "In 1983 When I was 18 yrs old me and a friend who has since passed away, God rest his soul were backed up on a tractor path in forsyth county, North Carolina.</p> <p>This path was off an old dirt road that ended down where it got at the bottom of a holler at the creek bottoms. This road was bout 1/3 of a mile as the crow flies to corn products. This company takes corn and renders it down into animal feed and such. The company has corn brought in by rail in open boxcars and the corn would fall onto the rails from the shakin and moving of the train and such. The rails kinda follow the creek down in the bottoms before it rises up to the plant to be processed. I recond because of the water source cause them there rails been laid many a lustrum ago! That corn attracts many a critter down on the ground that away! We would go deer,dove and coon huntin down in them bottoms and have a field day.</p> <p>Many a family was fed with the critters harvested down in that holler. There was only a few farm houses on that road back then and they would use that path to get to the bottoms where they planted corn,soybean and such.The path was about 14-15 feet wide. That was so they could get the disc and such down in there. Us youngins would go park down there and party durin the summer cause the closest farm house was way yonder up on the hill overlookin the holler. Kinda place where u scream and nobody would hear ya. We did hear sum hollarin down in the creek beds now and again but we thought it was just sum good ole boys rasin hell and such. On a cloudy night it would get kinda spooky sum of the girls got a bad vibe down there! Like I said sum nights be as dark as the inside of a cow don’t cha know. Well this path was bout 30 feet from the end of the road and it cut through bout 100 yrds of thick timber. Path kinda rose up slightly and crested and went down to the bottoms. I know i’m rambling a bit but I think all this is kinda important to the sightin! Like I said we’d park down there and not be to eco friendly with our trash. We would eat and drink down there and try to keep it fairly clean cause the farmers would not like trash all over.</p> <p>The law would start getting involved. On the other side of dirt road was about 25 yrds of scrub and thicket. then a hill that went up 30 or 40 feet and hwy 52 was up there. You could not see road from hwy. Now we had seen sum scuff marks on path that kinda looked like prints but were way too big and too far apart that we didn’t think much of it. Well we had been there bout 10 minutes and we had a six pack of beer with us, back then u could buy beer at 18 and we had the windows rolled down and the ole car I had back then only had am radio so we had boom box playin real low, it seemed awful quiet in the woods that night. We were gonna go to this party at a girls house whos parents were gone 4 the 4th holiday I think that’s what got me thinkin bout this! It was bout 10 at night so we were gonna drink them beers real quick and smoke a fatty before we went to party cause they really didn’t get goin till bout 11:00 or 11:30. I had just opened beer and randy was lookin down twistin it up when I took my first swallow and as I was lookin down path this THING takes one stride now…and is standin facing us at the bottom of the path! I bout choked on that bud i’m here to say!</p> <p>Now I’ve been to wrestling matches and I’ve seen the undertaker and the big show up pretty close well this THING had about a foot and a half or maybe two on the big show, he made him look like the little show! The damn shoulders on it were damn near as wide as the hood of my pinto! I would put it at about 500 to 600 lbs! Now I had seen the legend of boggy creek and the Patterson footage.Like everybody says not here …In North Carolina.Then I thought well that’s what them tracks on the path were! I slowly elbowed randy in the side and whispered, slowly look up and do not scream..still lookin down he chuckled why…I said just do it and he did and jerked backwards and said what the f##k is that and I said guess. You could see the hair hanging down it’s body…but what I was concerned about was he was making fists with his hands over and over and I could hear the damn thing breathin over the radio..it was almost like it was working its way up to a confrontation and that breathin was spooky.Then he started lookin at us and kinda swiveling his head from side to side like a dog does when it hears sumthin it don’t understand u know what i’m saying? Then randy says turn your lights on maybe that will scare it away. I said r u crazy that thing is not afraid of any animal walking this earth. Then we heard this strange noise to his right our left..kinda like a whistle but different. Like people say it turned it’s head and body to look.</p> <p>Then it looked back at us and made this sound like when you disagree with somebody or think what they said was stupid…u know…psssst. Very loud and like he was saying your not worth my time, I got places to go and things to do. What I think the problem was we were blocking his easy access to the bottoms! He just turned and now just took one stride and was outta sight. We had turned off music and never heard a sound as he was leavin..somthing that big should make noise as it moved away but nuthin. Got the hell outa there and never went back! I have told 5 people all think i’m crazy except good ole boy used to work with said he seen one while huntin in Yadkin county!”</p> <p> </p> <p>JD writes "I am a lifelong Kentuckian of 39 years. I should have emailed you long ago as I have been a fan of your incredible show and platform that I consider a cornerstone institution of Sasquatch cryptology.</p> <p>I shared a series of 3 consecutive encounters with an individual male Sasquatch with some of my childhood friends the summer before our senior year of highschool in Wolfe County Kentucky.</p> <p>As the summer vacation was winding down before the start of our final year of highschool me and my friends knew the campouts and summer vacations we’d shared for so many years would not be the same once our final year of school was completed and our lives inevitably shifted into adulthood. At 17 years of age I had already signed my military contract and was scheduled for basic immediately following graduation.</p> <p>We had over the years spent countless nights camping under the cliff overhangs colloquially known as ‘ rock houses’, even going as far as installing carpet remnants and constructing elaborate stone fire pits and enjoying all night arrowhead digging with our own large, custom built, mesh screen sifters. Several of us local boys were quite knowledgeable about native American artifacts. We were All American eastern Kentucky lads, most of us having fairly impressive gun collections as teenagers, trophy white tail racks, and native arrowhead & pottery collections.</p> <p>On a whim we decided to camp down at one of our favorite cave houses situated within the Daniel Boone National Forest. I grew up on a rural spread in the D Boone(as we refer to it).</p> <p>It was in July of 1995 and as the 3 of us finished collecting supplies for a comfortable overnight we were joined by two other local boys from our senior class. Those two hadn’t spent as much time roaming the creeks and ridges as myself and my two compadres but they wanted to share in the last of the summer fun.</p> <p>All five of us brought our favorite guns & snacks and we trecked down to our humble abode for the night. We built a small fire from our extensive cache of firewood to cook on and settled in for an evening of cave ash sifting, a cold beer or two and profanity laced fish tales.</p> <p>When we were much younger and were spending our first nights on our own campout adventures my retired Air Force father would hike down at a late hour and just check on us and then hike an hour or two back home.</p> <p>I mention this because the first encounter began with footsteps approaching our camp. My closest friend asked me if my father could be hiking down to check up on us? I told him and the others it was very unlikely as it had been some time since he had done that but not to worry as it could mean there was a family emergency or other.</p> <p>As I listened to the footsteps approaching I commented on how much heavier the foot steps were compared to one of us walking up the same path.</p> <p>None of my companions seriously considered my observation. And the bipedal individual walked to point approximately 80 feet down the sloping hill below the cliff overhang we were set up in. It was a curious situation with whatever or whoever had come to visit was now silently lingering below us. Between the five of us we had ten firearms strewn about the rock house. And being together next to our camp fire we felt only mild apprehension and some guarded curiosity. I had already began considering what we possibly had on our hands as Sasquatch was a semi regular visitor in our neighborhood with numerous sightings in my family over the many years.</p> <p>My suggestion to the same was met with stiffled laughter but I paid my friends no mind. They believed it could only be my father checking up on us even though he had stopped doing such a few years earlier.</p> <p>The two local boys that had joined our outing seemed to be the most unsettled and busied themselves preparing a meal for themselves as a diversion. One of my oldest friends never quit sifting for arrowheads only commenting “if it comes up here just shoot it”. So two of us stepped beyond the edge of the firelight allowing our eyes to adjust and used two D cell flashlights to try and identify what we had apparently standing behind a large poplar tree. The first thing we noticed was two red eyes opening and closing peeking from the edge of the tree. Eventually stepping half way out from behind the poplar tree the two of us saw that this was not a human but a Bigfoot covered in grey / white hair. I mentally marked a spot near its head for measurement later which showed it to be 7 1/2 feet tall.</p> <p>This whole encounter had lasted twenty minutes at that point. The stocky creature eventually easing out from behind the tree giving us a fair gander at him. Wes, it’s face was human and reminded me of an 80 year old Irishman. The only hair on his face was what looked like naturally grown mutton chops. My friend prodded me to walk up to it and see if I could shake it’s hand which was simply another of our standard & ludicrous challenges posed amongst each other, these inevitably involved something of the stupid and dangerous variety.</p> <p>It never made a peep standing behind the largest poplar below center of the rock house. Walking up to our location it walked the same path we had. And it didn’t seem to concern itself with being heard as it walked up to us either.</p> <p>After finally, and seemingly purposely stepping out from his tree and allowing us a good ten second look at him he eased back behind the tree and stood there silently for enough time to pass my friend and I went back up under the cliff. Later on I surmised it had done this purposely however, when it set off on a diagonal path out of the holler it sounded as if it huffed & puffed in some frustration as if he had wasted time he could have been golfing.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I grew up in Arizona. At age 18 I joined the navy and began a 21 year career. I have wanted to share my experiences since my first experience in 1972. The only people I have shared these experiences with is my family, my mom and children. I have attached my experience:</p> <p>1972</p> <p>Willow Creek California</p> <p>Mid Afternoon</p> <p>My first encounter occurred while visiting a family friend in Willow Creek California in early June 1972.</p> <p>While visiting, my twin brother, and two family friends daughters went hiking on an old logging trail located behind the friend’s house. We hiked about 1 hour up this road and were getting ready to turn around, when off to the road in a small gulley filled with ferns. We all stood on the road looking up the gulley after we had heard some grunting noises. Setting about 150 feet from us was a tall creature with long dark brown hair. The creature was standing among the ferns I think it was eating the tops of young ferns. It just stood watching us for about 1 minute, then it grunted. The girls we were with said that we needed to go so we left, I remember running all the way back to the house. When we told the girl’s parents the father was concerned and told us not to go back up the road. On our way to my aunt’s house in Gresham Oregon, I remember my mom telling me that her friend’s husband called a couple of men and they went up the road. She also said that he turned on the electric fence around their black berry/boson berry patch. He told my mom and her friend that he did that to keep out the bears.</p> <p>The creature as I remember was about 7 feet tall with long dark brown hair. I could not tell if it was male or female. It seemed more interested in the ferns than us. At no time do I remember feeling threatened. However, my mom said that my twin brother and I had nightmares and began to walk in our sleep. Mom always felt that what happened or whatever we saw in Willow Creek caused these problems.</p> <p>November 1978</p> <p>Near Sedona Arizona</p> <p>Around 10:00pm</p> <p>This encounter was very short and happened on Highway 89A between Sedona and Cottonwood Arizona near a bridge crossing a place called Dry Creek.</p> <p>While driving home from work around 10:00PM we were following a car. My mom was driving and she asked me why there was some guy running down the road and should we stop. Then this individual took two steps and crossed the road right in front of us. My mom slammed on the brakes to keep from hitting this individual and she said to me did you see the size of that guy and boy he could really jump.</p> <p>The most interesting thing she said was “I think that was a big foot”. I just looked at her and she said, oh yeah I remember my grandfather talking about them being around here. Her grandfather was a rancher in the area of the Mogollon Rim. This was very interesting because this was the first time she ever mentioned it. I have talked with my family in the area and they told me that there are places near Flagstaff Arizona at a place called Rogers Lake that they do not like going there, because weird thing happened there and that the Great Grand Pa said not to go there.</p> <p>The individual we saw that night as I remember was between 6 and 7 feet tall. Long dark hair and very muscular. He crossed the road and disappeared down the side of the gulley. We did not stop and continued home. We never talked about that night much but mom always believed that Bigfoot always existed.</p> <p>September 1998</p> <p>In the Otay Mesa area of San Diego County.</p> <p>8:00PM</p> <p>While camping with my son and three of his friends about 10 miles off I-8 the sun had gone down. We had just finished eating dinner and the boys wanted to play capture the hide and seek around the camp site. I told them they could, they played around until about 10:00PM until I told them to go to bed. Around 11:00PM when the boys had gone to sleep, I heard some movement around the camp area and so I got up to see what was going on. Near the camp I was instructed to come into the trees. As I walked into the area of the voice I came upon tow Border Patrol Agents. They told me that all of their motion sensors in the area had been set off. They also told me that they were tracking a couple of really big individuals and that we need to pack up our camp and move on. So that is what we did. These men seemed to me very nervous and they were packing heavy.</p> <p>I still do not understand what the circumstances were. I never thought of a Sasquatch in this area. I did listen to a show that described what the some of the Border Patrol Agent had described. I do not know if there was a Sasquatch in the area but I feel like those men that night may have saved me a bunch of problems.</p> <p>November 1998</p> <p>Ellsworth Canyon, near Gabbs Nevada</p> <p>1:00PM</p> <p>I went cutting wood with my daughter Jessica, son Michael and friend Shawn. Shawn was trying to earn money to take my oldest daughter to Prom.</p> <p>We were cutting fire wood to sell. About 12:00 PM my daughter Jessica came to where I was cutting wood and asked me what I wanted. I told her that I did not call her, she told me that I had called her twice. I assured her that I had not. She took an arm load of wood back to the truck. A few minutes later Shawn came up the hill and told me that he had heard some coyotes howling down the hill from where we were. He said they had just started up.</p> <p>I told him to keep an eye out and let me know if they sounded closer. He grabbed some wood and went back to the truck. A few minutes after about 1:00 PM, Jessica and Shawn came back after hauling wood down for Michael to stack it in the truck. They wanted me to come down and eat some lunch and to see if we had enough wood. So I went back down and ate lunch. After a few minutes I went back to cutting would and all three kids came up to where I was. Jessica asked me if why I was giggling and what was so funny. I just kind of looking at them. Jessica told me she and Shawn heard some little kids giggling and asked if I heard them. I said no. Then my son came up the hill with a puzzled look on his face.</p> <p>He told me he went down the hill to go to the restroom, when he came back to the truck he said all of the wood was thrown out of the truck. He wanted to know if I wanted him to restack it. I told him to go down with Jessica and Shawn and restack the wood. Within a few minutes Jessica was back telling me that all of the food was gone out of the ice chest. She also said they heard that giggling again I ask them if the wood was restacked and she said the truck was full. Michael my son yelled up the hill and said everything was packed up so Jessica and I went down the hill to the truck.</p> <p>Michael and Shawn were standing on the driver side of the truck and Jessica was in the cab. Shawn walked to the back where I was standing and told me that there were two guys further down the hill watching us. We all got in the truck and started driving down the hill. Shawn kept looking out of the driver’s window and he told me that those guys were following us. When we got back to the road Michael and Shawn both said they saw the tall guys run back up the hill. The kids were quiet all the way home about 1 hour. In the last few months I have talked with all three kids by themselves, they all told me the same story and they told me they saw and heard a couple or more Sasquatch in and around the where we were cutting wood. Jessica told me that she sometimes has dreams about that day. Shawn has moved to Alaska and he will only talk about it with Jessica and Michael. Michael told me that he remembers the pair of Sasquatch watching us and that he thought they threw the fire wood out of the back of the truck.</p> <p>October 2001</p> <p>Ellsworth Canyon, near Gabbs Nevada</p> <p>9:00 AM</p> <p>My son Michael and I were cutting wood. I was setting on the tail gate of our truck watching my son cut up a tree. I noticed some movement behind him, a small group of Cow Elk came up and stood within a few feet behind him. They were acting really nervous, I thought it was really strange that the Elk were so close. I got Michaels attention and he was nearly face to face with the Elk. We heard what sounded like a large bear roaring coming from the scrub oak. The elk took off and ran pass my truck. Michael came up to the truck and said did you hear that. I told him I heard that roaring sound. So we did like the elk and took off. We talked about what happened all the way home. He asked me if I told mom and I told him that I would but, his mom is a skeptic.</p> <p>I believe that whatever Sasquatch is, I know that they exist. I have spent many years believing.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>“I was born and raised in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. When I was growing up as a troubled youth about 11 years old I was sent away to a group home (that’s what they did in the 70’s when I was a kid. if you were deemed a ‘problem child’ or were in trouble with the law, or you were a runaway (that was me) your parents signed ‘incorrigible’ papers on you and let the County juvenile authorities place you where they decide, which may be in a home with someone who would take care of you for a period of time instead of a jail cell. They called it a ‘group home’ or foster care. So, I come from a large catholic family of 12 other siblings (I was #6) and because I kept running away from being sexually abused by my older brother. He threatened me to never tell and I didn’t,(I never told anyone about the abuse, I just kept acting out in other ways, like running away, staying out late, and skipping school etc.) my parents too busy to figure out what was up with me, turned me over to Ramsey Counties Juvenile justice system and they placed me in a ‘Group Home’ which was a man who owned a farm in northern Minnesota who would care for and hopefully turn troubled teens around before they got into real legal problems with the law and ended up in prison. This man took in 4 teens at a time and basically used us as free labor to run his farm. He had about 80 milking cows, some pigs, sheep, a couple hundred steers, etc. you know the deal.On the outside, and to everyone else, like the county authorities, our parents, this guy looked like he was offering a service to help boys, what he REALLY was, was a 60 yr old ex military CO, child abuser who beat and tortured kids for fun. (can you frikkin believe that shit!?) and for whatever reason, he had a bad attitude about me and he physically beat me, tortured me and emotionally tormented me for 10 months. He did not beat any of they other boys, just ME. His name was Don, and he had a farm on if I remember correctly ‘Choke cherry road’. Its approx. 8 ½ miles west of Willow River, Minnesota, I believe in Finlayson township. Now this Don character was a real piece of work, He was so physically abusive to me, I actually thought I was going to die by his hands before my time was up there. I was to be there for 1 year. I lasted 10 months before the county got some report from a local constable and they pulled me from there and shut his place down. (that is another long story that I won’t go into) He did everything from poking me with pitchforks while he had me tied to a post, to whipping me with milking straps til I bled from the brass grommets. He would make me stand naked in the field from dawn til dusk and sunburn the shit out of me, and then in the frigid winter, he made me stand out in the driveway naked til I was frostbit. I have plenty of scars and afflictions to prove what I’m saying.</p> <p>He would keep me out of school until my obvious bruises and cuts were healed, and then I was allowed to return to school. (I missed A LOT OF SCHOOL THAT YEAR) He beat me and He beat his cows and horses , sheep and pigs the same way, so at 12 yrs old I felt like another of his animals. OK, so I bet your wondering, “what the hell does all this have to do with bigfoot or you? and Why am I telling you my childhood abuse stories? well this is why. His farm was located down this gravel road, about 8 miles from the highway. One other farm about ½ mile down the road, otherwise no other homes, farms, nothing for 10 miles in any direction.</p> <p>After many beatings, I started running away, and when I started to run away from him, he would always catch me because I didn’t know where I was, or how to get away, so I always just ran down the road until he would find I was missing and he would come after me with his old 67 Ford LTD that smelled like a cow pie inside. I would hear his car coming down the gravel road after me and I would go off road into the ditch, and hide. But he always found me and the beatings would begin again. I would have ran off the road and into the woods but I was afraid of the swamp that was on both sides of the road between the road and the woods. I would guess there was about 100 yds of swamp, then thick woods. When I did try to go off the road I would get cold and wet, and didn’t know why but I was so afraid of the swamp, I had heard howls and strange noises that I can’t explain whenever I was walking on the road and I was always afraid. but I shrugged the noises off to the local wildlife.</p> <p>On one of my ‘escapes’ I ran away and the only way ‘out’ was 8 miles down the dirt road that was the only way in or out of his farm. I would run for miles and then I would hear his car coming from a long way away but with nothing but swamps on both sides of the road I didn’t know where to go and every time he would catch me he would Tie my hands together and tie the other end of the 20 foot rope to his bumper and he would make me run behind the car as he headed back to the farm. He did this several times, and every time I would get tired and couldn’t run fast enough to keep up with the car and I would always fall sooner or later and he would not stop, he would just drag me the rest of the way back to the farm. I have many scars to this day to prove what I’m explaining to you.</p> <p>Again Wes, I know your thinking “what the hell does this have to do with Bigfoot??” well it will all be understood soon:</p> <p>One time (the last time) I ran away and ran down the road, (BTW, NO other farms or houses on this stretch of road. very desolate, open pastures and wooded forests and a strip of swamp on both sides of the long 8 mile gravel road. I don’t know, but I believe now that this Sasquatch had watched what was happening to me, maybe only once, maybe it saw every time I was abused on that road. (I’m sure that he drug me behind the car at least 8 times over that summer) I somehow feel it (the bigfoot) understood my plight, or if it just noticed I was in trouble, or if it saw me running before and saw Don (the asshole abuser) stop and grab me smack me around and then tie me to the car and take me on another drag. Maybe it was watching the farm all summer, as my abuse was a daily thing around the farm, easy to see happening if you were watching the farm. I Don’t know. it was in approximately the same location on the same dirt road that I heard noises before in one of my escapes that this guy don would come and find me at. So it goes like this; I was running down the side of the road, I hear Don’s car coming off in the distance, so I jump off the road and down into the swamp along the road and I start heading across this swampy area, hoping to cross it to the tree line and into the forest that is beyond the swamp.</p> <p>It’s getting deeper and muckier every step I take and I am panicking and struggling to get through the swamp before don’s car gets to where I was. My feet are sinking, I’m struggling every step and I’m quickly realizing that it’s too deep and I am not going to be able to cross this swamp to the tree line beyond it. Don’s car comes, I duck, Don’s car goes by, but he doesn’t notice me about 75 yds out in this swampy area. So I have avoided him for the moment but I know he will turn around and come back, as always. but now I’m stuck in the swamp and struggling to keep my head afloat and to get out. (sorry, I’m not good with distances, don’t know 50 yards from 50 feet but I think my numbers are close approximations)</p> <p>I’m panicking, I’m sinking, my feet are stuck in the muck up to my waist, and the water above the muck to my chest. The more I struggle, the more I sink into the swamp muck! I’m pulling at cattails and reeds, I’m screaming and crying and wishing Don had seen me, cuz a beating is better then a drowning! All of a sudden, from the tree line, I hear this big CRASH/SPLASH about 50 feet away from me on the edge of the woods/swamp. I look up expecting to see a bear or something because it sounded like a herd of buffalo was coming out of the tree line. What do I see? It’s a MONSTER!! 8 feet tall, and massive! it’s a HUGE BIGFOOT! (back then I thought it was a MONSTER, but now I know it was a bigfoot, so I’ll just call it that) I notice right away it’s a female because of the large hairy breasts. Weird how a 12 year old in puberty will notice tits, even on a bigfoot (LOL) anyways, tits or not it’s a monster and I am screaming and struggling in this swamp and I think I’m going to drown, I stop struggling in the direction going away from the road and start struggling back towards the road but can’t get my feet loose of the muck.</p> <p>I was finally able to pull my feet out of my shoes and get a few more steps, as this at least 8 feet tall brown hairy monster is coming straight towards me. I am dizzy from struggling and screaming and panicking and I have swamp water in my mouth and I’m coughing, and this Bigfoot is almost on top of me now, it never made a noise, no growling, roaring, nothing, and seemed to glide effortlessly through the swamp to me. The water seemed to only come to it’s knees and as it got to within about 10 feet of me I thought for sure it was going to just beat me or kill me and eat me or something bad. it did not. I cowered down with my hands and arms over my head as I saw the shadow of this beast surround me and then I notice this terrible stench! Like a thousand skunks and rotten meat at the same time. Worst thing I have ever smelled, ever! Then everything got silent. She/it was over the top of me and I was face down in the swamp with my hands over my head and my eyes closed tightly crying. Next I hear this beast sigh, like it changed its mind and gave up scaring me or something, hard to explain the emotion, but we both just froze for what seemed like an hour but was in reality about 10 seconds. It was like this beast woman was trying to figure out what to do with me. It had the look of intelligence, not a wild animal.</p> <p>I feel this wet cold mucky hairy hand grab the back of my jacket and my neck and pull me up out of the swamp. I start flaying my feet and twisting around to get loose but it had me tight and effortlessly held me out in front of it. I started screaming and crying as it held me out in front of her and started moving swiftly towards the road. It seemed to take about 10 seconds and we were back at the edge of the ditch next to the road. It took me 10 minutes to get out there struggling all the way, but it moved smoothly and quickly back the way I came into the swamp from the gravel road in a matter of seconds. From where she picked me up to the gravel road was about 75 feet. She dropped me in the ditch, and just looked at me for what seemed like an hour but was a few seconds, the look was of sadness, of confusion, but firm too. It looked up the road towards the sound of Don’s car coming back about a ½ mile away and turned looked at me again and walked away quickly straight back the way we came from following the same path through the swamp. It was into the tree line and gone in about 20 seconds.</p> <p>What I remember the most is the look on her face when she dropped me. she stood and looked at me for a couple seconds, she looked up the road where we both heard don’s car coming in the far distance, (you know the sound a car makes on gravel when there is no other noise? You can hear it break the silence from a mile away) as I said, She looks back to me and I saw this look, one of understanding, of motherly caring almost, and of concern and of ANGER all at the same time. Then she turned and moved swiftly back through the swamp to the woods on the other side of the swamp and disappeared.</p> <p>What I can tell you about the face is that it reminded me of a carnival ‘bearded lady’. I know how that sounds, but she did not look like a woman, she had long wet, dark brown hair, not fur draped in her face, a long dirty beard that seemed to start at her eyes and flow all the way off the chin. And the hair was full of pine needles and twigs and clumps of mud. Oh, and the skin, was dark gray, and her hands huge with brownish long nails that looked like an eagles claw, but dirty and chipped. Huge eyes, dark deep set and angry looking, but not angry at me. And the nose was wide and flat like a boxer or something, but not human. If I had to pick a bigfoot type that she most resembled it would be a cross between ‘Patty’ but with long messy dirty hair. Maybe Like the Florida swamp creature you have seen on the internet.</p> <p>I never told Don about the Bigfoot, he pulled up and saw me lying in a puddle in the ditch “your all fu**ing’ wet! Where are your fu**ing shoes? And you STINK! You’re not sitting in MY car stinkin’ like that! Get in the fu**ing trunk” He snarled, as he got out of his car and opened the trunk and pointed towards it. I was cold and wet and stinkin like a skunk and probably in shock, I was still sobbing. So I climbed in the trunk and he slammed the lid down and drove me back to the farm as he had done many times before. I was just happy he didn’t drag me this time. He made me throw the jacket away, we couldn’t get the smell out of it, and he blew it off that I somehow got tangled with a skunk. A dead skunk.</p> <p>I never told anyone about the Bigfoot, who would believe me? I also believe that there was a bigfoot near me while I was picking raspberries out in Don’s back forty a couple months earlier. I was in the woods. I heard a grunt in the bushes near the wild berry patch we always went to and I had a sudden fear come over me and I ran back to the house about a mile through the woods down the tractor trail. There seemed to be something moving through the woods on the side of me, but I could never see it, I was just scared shitless of something, and I ran. I Never heard the grunting sound again until I was walking on the road near the swamp months later.</p> <p>Until I started listening to your show, I figured I would take it to my grave. But you Wes, with your friendly voice and the way you make it sound ok and believable that someone saw a bigfoot and that the story should be told that I decided to at least put my encounter to paper.”</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“I was born and raised in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. When I was growing up as a troubled youth about 11 years old I was sent away to a group home (that’s what they did in the 70’s when I was a kid. if you were deemed a ‘problem child’ or were in trouble with the law, or you were a runaway (that was me) your parents signed ‘incorrigible’ papers on you and let the County juvenile authorities place you where they decide, which may be in a home with someone who would take care of you for a period of time instead of a jail cell. They called it a ‘group home’ or foster care. So, I come from a large catholic family of 12 other siblings (I was #6) and because I kept running away from being sexually abused by my older brother. He threatened me to never tell and I didn’t,(I never told anyone about the abuse, I just kept acting out in other ways, like running away, staying out late, and skipping school etc.) my parents too busy to figure out what was up with me, turned me over to Ramsey Counties Juvenile justice system and they placed me in a ‘Group Home’ which was a man who owned a farm in northern Minnesota who would care for and hopefully turn troubled teens around before they got into real legal problems with the law and ended up in prison. This man took in 4 teens at a time and basically used us as free labor to run his farm. He had about 80 milking cows, some pigs, sheep, a couple hundred steers, etc. you know the deal.On the outside, and to everyone else, like the county authorities, our parents, this guy looked like he was offering a service to help boys, what he REALLY was, was a 60 yr old ex military CO, child abuser who beat and tortured kids for fun.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Matt writes "I am a retired combat veteran of the Marine Corps. I saw combat in both the First Gulf War and Bosnia-Herzegovina/Kosovo.As a kid, I grew up in Kentucky. I had several encounters there. Then later I had one in Tennessee and another in East Texas.</p> <p>In Kentucky I lived with my grandfather. He was a Baptist minister and a man of good Scottish stock. We lived in central Kentucky in the Green River bottoms. I was used to seeing bobcats and panthers. From an early age I knew their screams and had a healthy respect for their space, especially at night. In about 1972 I was 7 years old. One summer evening my grandfather and I were walking just a few yards from our house at the edge of a 7 acre field. It sloped a bit up and ended in a tree line which had an old barn at its center. A small trail circumvented the entire field.</p> <p>As we looked east and up at the field’s edge, we saw something standing upright and much taller than the corn which was about 7 feet tall as it was late June. It was brown in color and looked directly at us. My grandfather turned me around and towards the house and said “You’ll not be going outside tonight.” I sensed a bit of fear but knew better than to ask why. That night was warm. Our house was built up about six feet to avoid the backwaters of spring. My grandfather and I slept in the same bedroom in two beds separated by a window which was open that night. It faced the field where we had seen the creature. As I drifted off to sleep I smelled a horrible smell.</p> <p>I awoke and looked out the window. Standing squarely in the majority of the window was a dark figure looking in and looking side to side. I could feel the warmth of its breath and see the eyes which were somewhat yellow and red. I looked across at my grandfather who had moved to lying prone with a pistol in his right hand. The only light was provided by the moon. After a few moments I heard the creature walk away towards the front of our house and step up on the wooden porch. At this point my grandfather bolted from the bed and grabbed a double barreled shotgun and yelled to me to stay put. I heard one shot which he had to have fired through the screen door then a growl/scream that shook the house. My grandfather yelled for it to “Fek off” and fired a second shot. By then I was next to him with my own 12 gauge.</p> <p>He reloaded as it jumped off the porch and ran back towards where we had seen it earlier. It yelled the rest of the night and we heard it for several days. I don’t remember if it ever yelled much after that week.”</p>]]></description>

From an early age I knew their screams and had a healthy respect for their space, especially at night. In about 1972 I was 7 years old. One summer evening my grandfather and I were walking just a few yards from our house at the edge of a 7 acre field. It sloped a bit up and ended in a tree line which had an old barn at its center. A small trail circumvented the entire field.</p> <p>As we looked east and up at the field’s edge, we saw something standing upright and much taller than the corn which was about 7 feet tall as it was late June. It was brown in color and looked directly at us. My grandfather turned me around and towards the house and said “You’ll not be going outside tonight.” I sensed a bit of fear but knew better than to ask why. That night was warm. Our house was built up about six feet to avoid the backwaters of spring. My grandfather and I slept in the same bedroom in two beds separated by a window which was open that night. It faced the field where we had seen the creature. As I drifted off to sleep I smelled a horrible smell.</p> <p>I awoke and looked out the window. Standing squarely in the majority of the window was a dark figure looking in and looking side to side. I could feel the warmth of its breath and see the eyes which were somewhat yellow and red. I looked across at my grandfather who had moved to lying prone with a pistol in his right hand. The only light was provided by the moon. After a few moments I heard the creature walk away towards the front of our house and step up on the wooden porch. At this point my grandfather bolted from the bed and grabbed a double barreled shotgun and yelled to me to stay put. I heard one shot which he had to have fired through the screen door then a growl/scream that shook the house. My grandfather yelled for it to “Fek off” and fired a second shot. By then I was next to him with my own 12 gauge.</p> <p>He reloaded as it jumped off the porch and ran back towards where we had seen it earlier. It yelled the rest of the night and we heard it for several days. I don’t remember if it ever yelled much after that week.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “Hi Wes, The things I encountered were in 1984 and 1988 when I was 12 and 16.</p> <p>I’m from Fresno California. I’m a long haul truck driver now, and I’ve been listening to you on and off since your episodes were in the 30s but I went back to the beginning.</p> <p>I come from a hunting family, and my father cut firewood on the weekend’s to make extra money. So we spent a lot of time in the Sierra’s.</p> <p>When I was 12 we went deer hunting somewhere in the Kings Canyon National Forrest. I don’t remember exactly where. It was my father 2 of his younger brothers and I.</p> <p>My uncle John had an old camping trailer. It had 4 bunks and nothing else. After hunting all day we went to sleep. It was probably 2 or 3 AM.</p> <p>Something picked up the back end of the trailer, and guessing dropped it from at least a foot or 2 off the ground. It was a really big drop. It jolted us all out of bed.</p> <p>It was a small trailer but with all of us in it, it must have weighed close to 2 000 lbs. It wasn’t made of the lightweight material they use today.</p> <p>I heard something moving around outside, and it knocking over stuff. My uncle Bobby grabbed his rifle and started to go out the door and my dad grabbed him by the arm. And my dad was dead serious. He wasn’t letting him go outside. My uncle started to argue with my dad and my dad just shut him down. He just said we’re going back to bed.</p> <p>My dad wasn’t a nice person. He did some time in jail and prison. He was mean guy and I never saw him scared of anything. He told me it was a bear and don’t worry about it.</p> <p>There’s no bear that did that. Only men or a sasquatch could have done that. If my dad thought men did it I know all 3 of them would have been out the door guns in hand.</p> <p>I always thought that was really strange.</p> <p>When I was 16 we were cutting some pine wood near mammoth pools near Yosemite National Park. I believe that’s Sierra national Forrest where we were. Not far from a little town named Oak Hurst, where we lived for a year when I was 6 years old.</p> <p>We had been in the habit of going up and cutting enough wood to fill the truck. We’d camp that night and get up the next morning and we’d fish for a while and go home.</p> <p>So the sun had just come up and we started trout fishing in this little stream. It was really cold, they had barely opened up all the small roads after the spring thaw. There was still ice on the banks of the stream. I was half asleep. It was really quiet. There wasn’t anyone around. I was just thinking how I wanted to go home and eat.</p> <p>I was just kind of looking around slow dragging my bait in when something caught my eye. There was a big dead log laying on the other side of the stream, about 50 feet away.</p> <p>That’s when I saw it. There was a sasquatch laying down on his stomach, propping himself up on his fore arms.</p> <p>He was hidden behind the log looking through the end of the log that had hollowed out. He was perfectly still his head tilted up just watching us.</p> <p>The look in his eyes was so hateful. The guy in your intro talking about that really hit home with me. He just looked so disgusted we were there. His eyes were like a chocolate brown.</p> <p>I reached over and tugged on my dad’s arm. He was just a couple of feet from me. He had just caught a fish and was re baiting.</p> <p>I was so scared. I could barely get words out. I said, 1:00 on the ground by the big log. I basically whispered it and he was all annoyed, what??? And then the words sunk in and he looked and saw it. He just said, don’t move. He looked over at his 30 ott 6 leaning against the tree next to him, but he didn’t pick it up. We just froze for what was seconds but if seemed so long. And suddenly we heard what I guess was a tree knock over across the road behind us. It sounded like a really sharply hit line drive off a baseball bat.</p> <p>As we looked back he jumped up from behind the log and ran across the stream. It was probably 25 feet wide, and he cleared it in 3 steps.</p> <p>He didn’t look like the patty gorilla type at all. He was very tall, I would estimate between 7 and 8 feet. I went to wrestling and watched Andre the giant walk in and he’s the only thing I’ve ever seen comparable in height. Where it looked like someone was carrying him in until you saw his legs.</p> <p>But this sasquatch was very thin. His shoulders were wide but he wasn’t heavily muscled like you normally hear about. His hair was either gray or dirty white, I’m not sure. The hair wasn’t very thick either. It was probably about 3 or 4 inches long, but was more thin. He might have been old I don’t know?</p> <p>He had super big hands with long fingers. I saw him plant one hand on the log as he lept over it. I’ve never seen anything like it.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I am returning from the beach after a long needed break. Tonight will be a replay. I really needed to recharge the batteries. I will return next week. Bo writes “If you got time maybe give me a call sometime. I want to tell you my encounter. To sum it up, I hit one with my car when I was 19 yrs old.” Spoke to the witness and he has agreed to come on the show. The encounter took place almost 20 years ago. He describes leaving an area late one night when this creature jumped in front of his car. He said he had his high beams on and saw this creature right before he hit it. He said it was a small creature and it reminded him of a baby gorilla or monkey. At the last moment he hit it and the impact caused a lot of damage. As he slowed down he heard a scream/roar from the tree line. The witness said he was terrified about what he just hit and now something else let out this scream/roar that seemed to shake his insides. The witness hit the gas and as he came around the bend he is pretty sure what ever roared at him was chasing him because he heard it again right next to the road. There is a lot of details we will discuss in this encounter. I will also be speaking to Tom who was on SC EP:319, he is returning to the show to talk about a recent encounter on his property.</p>]]></description>

What I thought is a Crack from hell itself had opened up and unleashed a beast unlike anything I could understand. My perspective is so much different than what I have been listening to is well close but this beast wanted to invoke sheer terror. This creature was almost 10 feet high and wrecked an oak tree. It was only 30 feet away bellowing out a sound that I can only describe as prehistoric. We had a bonfire burning for maybe 5 hours while moving these people into an old farmhouse. It must have smelled the fire. It was like a horror movie. We put the fridge in front of the back door and ran to the front room to block the front door and there was a giant window. We were to afraid to make any noise so we waited and watched tire dwindle. Nothing else happened but we watched for what seemed like days waiting for this beast to walk right through the house and certainly devour us.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight night I will be speaking to Connie. Connie said "when all of this started happening I thought it was homeless people but it just kept getting stranger. Several times I would go out on the property and call for my dog and something would mock and mimic me calling the dog. They sometimes call my husbands name. I have heard screams, whoops and strange chatter.</p> <p>My daughter caught one running off of the porch at the guest house."</p> <p>Connie said "We are seeing strange lights out here. I wanted to ask you have you ever seen one of these strange lights that almost forms like the michelin man? This strange figure keeps showing up in the pictures. At first I brushed it off as just something strange showing up, maybe it is a light and my eyes were playing a trick on me but this "thing" or strange light in the form of a person keeps showing up.</p> <p>The strange part is where we are seeing these lights come out of the forest is the same area where the creatures come out.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight night I will be speaking to Connie. Connie said "when all of this started happening I thought it was homeless people but it just kept getting stranger. Several times I would go out on the property and call for my dog and something would mock and mimic me calling the dog. They sometimes call my husbands name. I have heard screams, whoops and strange chatter.</p> <p>My daughter caught one running off of the porch at the guest house."</p> <p>Connie said "We are seeing strange lights out here. I wanted to ask you have you ever seen one of these strange lights that almost forms like the michelin man? This strange figure keeps showing up in the pictures. At first I brushed it off as just something strange showing up, maybe it is a light and my eyes were playing a trick on me but this "thing" or strange light in the form of a person keeps showing up.</p> <p>The strange part is where we are seeing these lights come out of the forest is the same area where the creatures come out. I never wanted this, I just want all of this to go away. Here is a couple of pictures I have many more including hours of audio."</p> <p> </p> <p>To see the pictures Connie submitted, visit the episode page on our website <a href= "https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep433-they-made-themselves-known/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My first guest, John, is from Louisiana, and he had an encounter when he was 6-7 years old. John says “I was out with my family and I started walking down the trail by myself and I came up on what I thought was a gorilla. It looked at me and made a RAAAA! sound and pushed his head forward. I ran back to my dad and told him what happen. My Dad told me that they were an ancient human/indian that lived in the woods and that he was paced out of the woods one time. The thing I ran into was huge and reminded me of a gorilla, now this is in the 60’s so information was scarce at best….”</p> <p> </p> <p>My second guest JC writes “I am a retired Navy Seabee and I live in South Central Maine. I, a friend &amp; associate of mine whom is a professional in the community, have had continuous contact/encounters with a family pod of Bigfoot for the past 18 months. This email has been difficult to write due to the fact that I am growing Marijuana in the forests in which these these encounters take place. The reason for writing now we feel is that we posses valuable information for you and your listeners.</p> <p>My story is very long but I want to keep this email as short as possible. I personally have been growled at, charged by numerous creatures at the same time. I’ve been paralleled in the woods, escorted out of those same woods by them. I have had tree limbs snapping all around me as I’m watering my plants inside my grow area holding my pistol in my other hand at the same time. No one goes into these woods and no one has for decades. First, the tics are so bad if it weren’t for the fact that I own an actual tic suit, I would not be out there, and I am out there 2 to 3 times a week mostly by myself. But there other times my friend is with me. I have also called in some juveniles and they like to use whistles to communicate. We have been visited by a family of 5 Sasquatch and have been within 10 yards of the 3 baby’s This will continue to happen because we have discovered this area is being used in sense as a nursery. We have discovered a large number of baby tree structures everywhere throughout these parts of the sticks. It will really start ramping up for me because in 2 weeks I am back out in the same area where I have been growled at and charged numerous times, 2 to 3 times a week. Only once last year I went out into the woods and I did not have a undesirable encounter. All encounters are UNDESIRABLE!"</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I would sit out on the back deck at night and would hear wood knocks and an occasional whoop but had never seen one. Sometimes I would take a baseball bat and hit a tree or even the railing of the deck and sometimes would get an answer. Any way, one day, this was about 20 years ago, I cut up over the ridge and was on the blacktop. I was almost to the back entrance of the park when this huge creature jumped the fence along the park, it was on my right, and stood in the road. I had to slam on my brakes or I would have hit it. When I stopped, I could not have been more than 15 to 20 feet away from it, if that. This thing was huge. I am guessing it was about 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall and 3 feet across the shoulders. It had dark brown hair all over its body except on its face. Broad nose, wide set eyes, a protruding forehead and its arms almost appeared to be normal from the shoulders to the elbows and from the elbow to the hands, the arms were very long. It just stood there and we made eye contact for a full minute. Maybe a little longer. I had the window down on my truck and there was a slight breeze and I caught a whiff of a strong odor. It was almost like a bad body odor. https://www.internationalbigfootconference.com https://sasquatchchronicles.com/          </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Arthur William Bell III (June 17, 1945 – April 13, 2018) was an American broadcaster and author. He was the founder and the original host of the paranormal-themed radio program Coast to Coast AM, which is syndicated on hundreds of radio stations in the United States and Canada. He also created and hosted its companion show Dreamland. In 2003, Bell semi-retired from Coast to Coast AM. During the following four years, he hosted the show many weekends on Premiere Networks. He announced his retirement from weekend hosting on July 1, 2007, but occasionally served as a guest host through 2010. He attributed the reason for his retirement to a desire to spend time with his new wife and their daughter, born May 30, 2007. He added that unlike his previous "retirements", this one was permanent, but he left open the option to return to broadcasting. Bell hosted classic episodes of Coast to Coast AM that can be heard in some radio markets on Saturday nights under the name Somewhere in Time.  </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener from Kansas writes “I lived in lenexa ks. in the 70’s and 80’s I was about 10 to 12 years old. I used to walk in the woods around my house all the time by myself.</p> <p>I was outside of my house I cannot remember exactly what I was doing at the time.. I just remember seeing something looking at me from behind a bush.. I thought it was some of the kids in the neighborhood playing.</p> <p>I had a football in my hand and threw it at the bush and screamed I see you.. it or they ran away …The same night later was very interesting.. as I was visited by I don’t know if it was a male or female protecting what I now know as the young one I threw the ball at…I was sleeping…I always for some reason was freaked out sleeping in that room because I always felt watched.</p> <p>So I slept on the floor close to the window…I was awaken by something looking dead at me in the window it scared the crap out of me. I didn’t know what I had seen I just know it was something I had never seen before.</p> <p>The next day I found all kinds of prints in the yard around the front window in the back yard around the tomato plants. A few nights later I was under the feeling I was being watched I turned off all the lights in the room when I looked outside I couldn’t see anything but I could hear the hard steps in the yard.</p> <p>The next door neighbor had a flood light in the driveway that lit a tree in the yard it was a very large old tree I don’t know what kind it was. When I looked out the window I heard a loud Growl then i saw a large branch on the tree get snapped right off.</p> <p>I ran to my mothers room and told her something is out there. She called the police they came and nothing was found…I can also recall getting up in the mornings in the summer and hearing this weird howling that made my hair stand up. I didn’t know what it was I thought it was a dog.</p> <p>I would shout at 4:30 in the morning to shut up. I didn’t understand until now what I had seen and been dealing with in my friends yard down the street there was several crab apple trees, neighbors in the area had fruit trees and also gardens.</p> <p>One winter we had a snow day and were snow ball fighting in his yard. When we discovered prints in the snow we followed then around his yard to the point where it walked over a chain link fence in stride one side of the fence had left foot over the fence and the right foot was on the side of the fence were were on. We followed it around under a bush they had separating his yard with the neighbors yard. there was a kinda cave inside the bush where we used to hide from each other…it had been in the bush…how scary….I can imagine it used to be in there times when that family came home from where ever..I know now that this Creature is out there every time I talk about this i get goose bumps.</p> <p>I can also remember putting foil up in the front door window…because I was sick really sick.. so I was sleeping down stairs on the couch, I remember seeing what I thought was a face looking at me in the window… it wasn’t stationary… it walked across the steps and down them or over the rail…I told my mother I saw a face in the window…</p> <p>This haunts me to this day.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be welcoming Jeremey to the show. He describes activity around his property and finding tracks. A little bit later, Jeremey and his friend decided to go camping not far from his property and something roared at them. They left all of their camping supplies behind and left as fast as they could. They decided to go back and get all of the camping gear the next day and found tracks of something very large, Jeremey said “It looked like a human track but just on a large scale.”</p> <p>They decided the next day they would follow where the tracks were going. They came up into an area in the woods when all hell broke loose. Jeremey said “as we came around the corner we could hear talking but it sounded like gibberish than everything went silent….something screamed at us and it came from three different directions and whatever these things were they started knocking trees over.</p> <p>We ran and I have never ran this fast in my life as we came down the trail this thing stood up on the side of the trail and I could see it from the chest up and it was huge. It wasn’t a monkey or human I wasn’t sure what it was but it was about 10 feet from me and it screamed at me. I really thought I was dead….”</p> <p>The incident took place in Maine.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Anthony writes “I live in Kentucky. I’ve had several encounters with Sasquatch, or as we refer as “Haints”. My encounter started when I would ride my motorcycle and would always park at a secluded rock quarry lake.</p> <p>I’ve had hands on interactions with a juvenile that resulted in me thinking it’s mother and another female was going to rip me to pieces. I later come to find out that an elderly lady feeds them and this is gonna sound really strange but she kind of ran a baby sitting house for the juveniles.</p> <p>This all seems unbelievable but I won’t waste your time if you don’t waste mine. I’ve told 3 people about this encounter and I figured I could tell you. If you choose to believe me or if you want to listen to my story just message me back.”</p> <p>I spoke to the witness late last night. The witness said “I was on my motorcycle and I was out in the woods and I heard what sounded like a child crying. I came up on this thing. It was small and was hanging upside down in a tree, it was small. I think it fell from the top of the tree and got stuck as I walked up on this thing I thought I was dreaming. I had never seen anything like this before. It looked like a hairy human/animal/kid.</p> <p>I am sitting there watching this thing trying to figure out how I am going to help it out of the tree and what is it….you are not going to believe this, I wouldn’t if someone told me this. As I am watching this thing two more stepped out and they were both females. It is a long story but one of the females screamed at me and I ran.</p> <p>This haunted me, I didn’t know what I saw. Later I went down that same road and I parked my bike. A short while later this old woman walked up to me and started talking about what I had seen. I had not told anyone about what I had seen and somehow this old woman knew what happen to me. She told me to come by her home sometime as she lived up the road.</p> <p>I decided later to stop by her home and this is where it gets really strange. If someone told me what I am about to tell you I would NOT believe them…..”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be welcoming on three guests on tonight. Mike writes “My encounter happened when I was about 12 years old in 1975. My parents had property in the Pocono mountains in Bushkill Falls, and my mother wanted to go check on the property and decide to go with her. We went and looked at the land because they did not have a house on the land, they just owned it. It was a beautiful fall day around October, the leaves were starting to turn and the air was crisp. As we were heading back about 2:30 in the afternoon, I believe we were on Bushkill Falls Road heading towards route 209- There is very little traffic on this road and Bushkill Falls Road has twists and turns. At one point as we turning to the left to go down the curving road, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. It was sitting about 6-8 feet in from the edge of the road in the small saplings. And at first I thought someone tossed out a stuffed animal and it was just sitting on the side of the road. But as we pasted it, I saw this thing turn it’s head and watch the wheels go by as it leaned on one arm.   https://sasquatchchronicles.com  </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ronny writes “I’ve been listening to you for about a month now and I was curious if you were interested in hearing about a close Sasquatch encounter that my wife and I had.”</p> <p>I spoke to Ronny and he has agreed to come on the show. The witness describes a creature approaching a van him and his wife were sitting in after pulling into the driveway. They lived out in the country and his wife had seen a “large man” run across the driveway. The creature approached the van screaming and mumbling. The creature started to rock the van. The witness said that his father came out of the home and fired off a shotgun and started yelling at the creature. The creature finally took off but it did not leave for the night as they would soon find out.</p> <p>I will also be speaking with Shane. Shane was out with his family when his wife and young son saw the creature cross the path in front of them. Shane said his son was ahead of his mother on the trail and as he approached she turned to look at him and that’s when this creature stood up and walked right in front of the son. As the mother turned around she got a glimpse of it going into the bushes.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned this guest in <a href= "https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep411-river-monster-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EP:411 River Monster Investigation</a>. I first heard bits and pieces of this encounter from the Cryptid Brothers Investigation. I think Lance and the guys do a great job.</p> <p>Two cousins who were fishing when the creature started throwing rocks. The witnesses thought it was a person throwing rocks until they ran into the creature. The Bigfoot attack them. This encounter has many bizarre twists and turns during the attack, but even more, the massive military and Federal Cover-up that followed, and that is still going-on.</p> <p>Tonight I bring one of the witnesses of that encounter onto the show. I was surprised by how many details the witnesses could recount.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be welcoming two guests to the show. My first guest, Georgie from Oklahoma, describes having an encounter with his family while fishing. He describes a creature with large breasts throwing rocks at him and his family.</p> <p>Our second guest Denise from Texas writes "Hey Wes, I’ve wrote before concerning the years we have shared the woods with some creature that no one believes is there. MANY strange things happened (whistling, knocks after I accidentally would bang a broom, large strange dead animals in the tree line) and I knew nothing about Bigfoot until I “scared him” twice and then witnessed him through a pair of binoculars. This allowed me to watch his expressions change and study his face, creepy as it was.</p> <p>I also wanted to tell you about another guy we knew here in town who was in law enforcement and shot one that was on his back patio one night.</p> <p>If you’re interested in talking, I’d be willing to share what we have gone through. Thanks for all you do, you seem very kind.”</p>]]></description>

I will also be speaking to Charlie Raymond is the founder of the <a href= "http://www.kentuckybigfoot.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Kentucky Bigfoot Research Organization</a> and he will be coming on and sharing encounters he has investigated in Kentucky. Russell Acord from the <a href= "https://www.internationalbigfootconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Bigfoot Conference.</a></p> <p>Clint writes “I put a 7mag round threw ones knee so it couldn’t get to me because I was afraid I couldn’t put enough rounds in it to get it down before it got to me, and there was another communicating so I knew if I killed it there would be no reason for the second to try and help it and would turn all its attention to me instead of its partner.”</p> <p>He was hunting and was up in a tree stand. As the sun was coming up the witness reports: “I felt like I was being watched from this one area. As I continue staring in this one direction this huge arm came from around a tree and half of this creatures body was sticking out. It appeared to be communicating with another one. They were going back and forth..”</p> <p>The short version of what happen is the witness shot the creature right above the knee. He was trying to wound the creature and not kill it because he could not see the other one. The witness says “I was terrified I didn’t think I was going to make it out of there and when I shot it,this thing let out a scream that shook me. The creature left after I fired. I came back and got the bullet that was lodged in the tree were the creature was. There was blood and hair. I collected everything and now I am not sure what to do with it.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thebigfootmovie/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to check out Bob Gimlin's movie and LIKE his page</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I had several encounters 20 years ago on and around some property that’s in the family. My Mother had lived there and past away from drug and alcohol problems in ‘95. So I went up to her old house and started fixing it up as it was in pretty bad shape. But even though Mom and I never got along and I was never close with her or that side of the family they didn’t give me any grief about me just taking over the old place. No one else wanted it at the time. I was a teenager with my own home and my own ride. That combo tends to make boys think they’re men. Most of time everything up there was quiet and normal. But several events occurred over the years that scared me so bad I buried it deep inside and tried for years to forget about it.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight we will be welcoming former police officer Brian Gosselin to the show to discuss his encounter and his new book Abair Road, The True Story.</p> <p>In August 1976, Police Officer Brian Gosselin had a face-to-face encounter with a Bigfoot-type creature on Abair Road in Whitehall, NY. This event set off a firestorm of publicity and has become a landmark case that has withstood the test of time. Brian encountered this creature just 30 feet in front of him, in his spotlight, with his pistol pointed directly at it, but he did not shoot. In “Abair Road, The True Story,” Brian shares the events that took place that night along with a great deal of information that has never been shared before.</p> <p><strong>Check out the book:</strong> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Abair-Road-True-Story-Gosselin/dp/1983903019/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1517158289&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=Brian+Gosselin+bigfoot" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Abair Road The True Story</strong></a></p> <p> </p> <p>Will also be welcoming Greg who shares an encounter from his childhood.</p> <p> </p> <p>Our final guest tonight is Christopher Noel. Christopher Noel is a Burlington, Vermont-based Sasquatch researcher. Noel brings to his study an academic tone, and rightly so. For two decades, this Yale philosophy graduate taught at the Vermont College of Fine Arts.</p> <p>Chris writes "We need a radically new approach to Sasquatch research. For much too long, we have stereotyped our next of kin, certain that they must confine themselves only to the most remote wilderness, occasionally sneaking up to campsites just long enough to scare the hell out of us before withdrawing once again to the far corners of the forest. Incorrect. Increasingly, evidence is pointing a different way, toward an intimate proximity between our two species."</p> <p><strong>We will be discussing Chris's new book:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Next-Kin-Door-Sasquatch-Stones/dp/154696536X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1517077497&sr=1-1&keywords=next+of+kin+next+door" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Next of Kin Next Door: How to Find Sasquatch a Stone's Throw Away</strong></a></p> <p> </p>]]></description>

In “Abair Road, The True Story,” Brian shares the events that took place that night along with a great deal of information that has never been shared before.</p> <p>Check out the book: <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Abair-Road-True-Story-Gosselin/dp/1983903019/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1517158289&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=Brian+Gosselin+bigfoot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abair Road The True Story</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Will also be welcoming Greg who shares an encounter from his childhood.</p> <p> </p> <p>Our final guest tonight is Christopher Noel. Christopher Noel is a Burlington, Vermont-based Sasquatch researcher. Noel brings to his study an academic tone, and rightly so. For two decades, this Yale philosophy graduate taught at the Vermont College of Fine Arts.</p> <p>Chris writes "We need a radically new approach to Sasquatch research. For much too long, we have stereotyped our next of kin, certain that they must confine themselves only to the most remote wilderness, occasionally sneaking up to campsites just long enough to scare the hell out of us before withdrawing once again to the far corners of the forest. Incorrect. Increasingly, evidence is pointing a different way, toward an intimate proximity between our two species."</p> <p>We will be discussing Chris's new book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Next-Kin-Door-Sasquatch-Stones/dp/154696536X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1517077497&sr=1-1&keywords=next+of+kin+next+door" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Next of Kin Next Door: How to Find Sasquatch a Stone's Throw Away</a></p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>John A. Bindernagel (born 1941 - January 18, 2018) was a wildlife biologist who sought evidence for Bigfoot since 1963. He published a book in 1998 entitled North America's Great Ape: the Sasquatch.</p> <p>Bindernagel grew up in Ontario, attended the University of Guelph, and received a PhD in Biology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He moved to British Columbia in 1975, largely because the region was a hot spot for Bigfoot sightings.</p> <p>I have invited many friends of the Doc to come on and talk about what John meant to them, and share their memories of him. I will also be playing some clips of past shows with John.</p> <p>Tonight I will be joined by Bob Gimlin, Russell Acord, Derek Randles, Ron Morehead, Paul Graves, Marc Myrsell, Thomas Sewid, Rictor Riolo, Shane Corson, and Todd and Diane Neiss. I know so many people wanted to come on and talk about John and I tried to fit in as many as possible.</p> <p>I think I can sum up the show tonight like this: John was an example of how to be a great human being. He always treated people with respect and was loved and admired by many.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Andrew who had a run in with a dogman back in the late 70’s in Maryland. I asked Andrew to come on the show and he has been reluctant but finally agreed and I am glad he did because he has one of the best encounters I have heard. Andrew said “My girlfriend and I were parked and a bunch of deer came running towards the car. The deer went passed and than we heard a thump on the car, almost like someone had hit the back of the car. Several weeks earlier my friends from the football team pulled a prank on us and  rocked the car, I went chasing after them. I thought it was my buddies messing with me so I jumped out of the car. I came face to face with this giant thing with a wolfs head. I had never seen or heard of such a thing. It was growling and drooling. It had red eyes, Wes this thing was evil.” I will also be speaking to Robert who is former Delta Force. Robert writes “I saw a Dogman a few months ago. I never would have believed it until we almost hit it while in our car driving north between Georgia and South Carolina late one night. I have traveled all over the world and I never would have believed it unless I saw it in-front of me. This creature was lite up in the car headlight. My girlfriend and I both saw this creature. I am very credible. I have no problem giving you my name as well as my military background. I was shocked when I saw this creature. It moved at an incredible speed.”</p>]]></description>

I know some people struggle this time of year so I hope the show takes your mind off things for a couple of hours. I will be posting the show tonight but it will not be up till later tonight, later than normal. Being that it is a longer show and the file size is much larger it takes twice as long to upload it to the site. Merry Christmas everyone! One of my guests for the Christmas show is Jim King. Jim “Bear” King of the Bigfoot Outlaws program had his first Bigfoot encounter as a child many years ago. Since that time Jim has been studying the creature at every opportunity. He has had numerous sightings and has enough stories regarding his experiences to fill many books. Bear wanted to come by and share what is new with him and wish everyone a Merry Christmas. One of my surprise guests for the Christmas Show is going to be Dr. John Bindernagel. I love having Dr. Bindernagel on the show. I spoke to him today and he wanted to share some of his recent research but John also said “The fans of Sasquatch Chronicles have some of the best questions I have ever been asked. Please ask your audience to feel free to ask questions and I will try to address them.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “I have never told this story to anyone. At the time it happened I was coming to the end of a messy divorce after a more than 20 year marriage. I truly felt if I said anything, those that cared about me, they would have thought I had cracked under the emotional stress of the time.In the spring of 2007 I was making my way out of a long term less than uplifting marriage. I had lived in the small town of Pinawa for more than 20 years at that point. It is located in the eastern region of Manitoba; it is rural, with a population at that time of about 1200 people. I had trained as a Veterinary Technician, and prior to marrying I had worked for the government vet clinic in the area, mostly a large animal practice. But because we were the government vet, at times we had to deal with wildlife matters, so I was not stranger to animal behavior. After I had children and was a full time mom, I also did some injured wildlife rehabilitation for the DNR, on limited bases. The local DNR supervisor for the area was a neighbour and a friend, and it was an unofficial position, helping him out at times, and giving my children a unique opportunity to interact with animals that otherwise would be off limits. I say all this because I feel it is important to stress that wildlife and animal behavior in general were something I was very familiar with. Bears were very much a part of everyday life from early spring till late fall. The town site, teams with an overflowing deer population. The large predators ( wolves, coyotes, and the occasional cougar) in the area seemed to have pressed the whitetail deer into the sanctuary of the town site. As well as the buffer zone that existed for the deer when hunting season was on, the town site became the haven for deer that it is still is to this day. The walking trails around the town site are superb. https://sasquatchchronicles.com  </p>]]></description>

I had trained as a Veterinary Technician, and prior to marrying I had worked for the government vet clinic in the area, mostly a large animal practice. But because we were the government vet, at times we had to deal with wildlife matters, so I was not stranger to animal behavior. After I had children and was a full time mom, I also did some injured wildlife rehabilitation for the DNR, on limited bases. The local DNR supervisor for the area was a neighbour and a friend, and it was an unofficial position, helping him out at times, and giving my children a unique opportunity to interact with animals that otherwise would be off limits. I say all this because I feel it is important to stress that wildlife and animal behavior in general were something I was very familiar with. Bears were very much a part of everyday life from early spring till late fall. The town site, teams with an overflowing deer population. The large predators ( wolves, coyotes, and the occasional cougar) in the area seemed to have pressed the whitetail deer into the sanctuary of the town site. As well as the buffer zone that existed for the deer when hunting season was on, the town site became the haven for deer that it is still is to this day. The walking trails around the town site are superb. https://sasquatchchronicles.com  </p>]]></content:encoded>

He said it reminded him of a “dirty old man.” Dallas goes on to say “It looked like a giant, dirty old man. He had no clothes on and he was very close to my tractor.” You will want to tune in for this one. I will return on Sunday for the members. I have a great show planned with a gentleman from Arizona and he will be sharing his encounters with us.   https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My favorite guest returns, Bob Gimlin. This is going to be a laid back show where I just let Bob speak. We will be discussing the time Bob and Roger Patterson found the Ape Canyon Cabin that was attack. A Ape Canyon is a gorge along the edge of the Plains of Abraham, on the southeast shoulder of Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington. The gorge narrows to as close as eight feet (2.5 m) at one point. The name alludes to a reported encounter with several “apemen” in 1924. I will also be asking Bob if he has ever seen anything strange in the woods, outside of Sasquatch. His answer might surprise you. He will also be giving us an update on the drama from the 50th anniversary of the Patterson/Gimlin film.   https://www.bobgimlin.net/</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I spoke to the witness today and it is probably one of the most fascinating conversation I have ever had. I think this witness is dealing with a lot of paranormal activity on his property and is seeing a lot of strange creatures including Sasquatch. I know this show might be beyond strange for most of my listeners but I have asked the witness to tell us everything that happen. A listener writes “Dear wes, I been listening to your show for a few weeks now, there seems to b a correlation between paranormal events and the appearance of bigfoot or dogman. I have never seen dog man but as for the rest of it I have seen plenty. Bigfoot is alive and well on my property and I hunt for it everyday trying to kill it, I have come very close to getting a shot at it but haven’t been able to pull it off, yet. Before bigfoot showed up I had an episode of demons on my property and was actually able to kill one, I know you hear this kind of stuff regularly so I decided to contact you and fill you in if your interested. I live in Texas and I know how the government tries to cover up such things and how they are always on the lookout for any new developments concerning bigfoot that’s why I have been silent about my experiences.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ron Morehead and Scott Nelson will be my guests on the show. We will be discussing Sasquatch and possible language. Author/Adventurist Ron Morehead, producer of the Sierra Sounds, has been known for decades for his world-wide research into the Bigfoot/Sasquatch phenomenon. To date, he comes closer than any other researcher to having a complete body of evidence. The Sierra Sounds are the only Bigfoot recordings that have been scientifically studied, time-tested, and accredited as genuine. Ron has documented his personal interactions with these giant beings and produced his story on a CD and also in a book, “Voices in the Wilderness.”   http://ronmorehead.com/   https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “Hi Wes! Been listening to the show for a few years now. I had an encounter in northern MN back in 2012 while guiding canoe expeditions on the boundary waters. Myself and my crew of 8 other boy scouts/scout masters had several consecutive days worth of encounters and we weren’t the only crew that did.” I spoke to Chuck and he and his crew of boy scouts endured several nights of encounters with a creature. He said “I heard what sounded like crying coming from the bush. I kept hearing what sounded like someone walking through our camp. I sleep under a tarp to keep dry. I could tell this thing was standing over me. I thought maybe it was a bear so I swiped my hand out and hit this thing in the chest. It felt like a hairy bodybuilders chest and this thing ran off. I think it is important to note that I am 6’2 and I tie my hammock up at eye level so when I hit this thing in the chest it had to be at least 8 feet tall. I didn’t really know what to think until later when one of the scout masters told me he got up to use the bathroom and while he was taking a squat this 9 foot tall gorilla ran past him.” Chuck talked about how they encountered this thing several nights in a row and it seemed to get more and more aggressive.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>"We started hearing a loud grunt. We could hear it walking in the tree line down about 30 feet away from us. We never saw it not at first. This lasted about 35 minutes on this trail. Then we stopped, we couldn't hear any birds, squirrels nothing. As we walked the trail got thicker and deeper in the woods. I stopped and waited for about 5 minutes looking around and listening. We heard nothing. I removed my machete and I told my GF to hold her knife in her hand. The one she had was only 6 inches long. It was better than nothing. I walked first with her hanging on with her left hand on my pack. As we walked through the thicket that was now almost as tall as us. We heard something walking through the trees and bush above us on our left. About 20 feet away. Then we heard a loud whistle to the right of us. She was almost in tears. I had the feeling of were not going home today. I was scared. All I knew was that I would try my best to protect my girl. Shortly after this happened we picked a nasty smell, like a wet dog and trash is the only way I can describe it. It was foul. We were trying to decide at this point if we should turn back but we knew we had gone in pretty far. We decided to keep walking through the bush."   https://sasquatchchronicles.com/  </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Erin who had an encounter in Washington State and Erin writes “I had a sighting years ago that was witnessed by many other people 30-50 maybe more, I have been researching a bit lately trying to find out if anyone from that day had posted the same sighting because how can you ever forget seeing bigfoot? My husband and I we are meeting my brother and his wife at a cabin in Gifford Pinchot NP (that is in the area of my sighting) in a few weeks hoping to get a chance sighting again, although I’m not sure that I want a face to face like I had before!” I spoke to Erin last night and she has one of the most interesting encounters I have ever heard. The encounter took place in the late 60’s and Erin was within feet of this creature. She describes several odd things that happened prior to seeing this creature and she was not the only one who saw it. Erin says “The eyes and face looked very human like. I think it was a male because it reminded me of a man. The body was covered in hair and he had this surprised look on his face. It never growled or showed it’s teeth it just had a look of curiosity and surprise. It scared me, I was in shock……”   https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. John A. Bindernagel has agreed to return to the show. I love talking John and when he shares all of his insight. I know he is a fan favorite. Check out John’s Youtube channel here. John A. Bindernagel (born 1941) is a wildlife biologist who has sought evidence for Bigfoot since 1963. He published a book in 1998 entitled North America’s Great Ape: the Sasquatch. Bindernagel grew up in Ontario, attended the University of Guelph, and received a PhD in Biology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He moved to British Columbia in 1975 largely because the region was a hot spot for Bigfoot sightings. Over the years, he has collected casts of tracks that he believes belongs to Bigfoot. He also claims to have heard the creature near Comox Lake in 1992, comparing its whooping sound to that of a chimpanzee. Bindernagel believes that the Bigfoot phenomena should receive more attention from serious scientists, but has remarked, “The evidence doesn’t get scrutinized objectively. We can’t bring the evidence to our colleagues because it’s perceived as tabloid.”   https://sasquatchchronicles.com/</p>]]></description>

He describes seeing a creature with twitchy eyes and with a large mouth, Q said it was breathing in and out like it was mad.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Marc Myrsell is a land surveyor and public aquarist in SW Washington and has apparently found his specialty in historical monster attack research. In SW Oregon over the course of 30 years, miners and hunters had numerous sightings and at times violent encounters with large, hair covered creatures in the hills, above Port Orford, resulting in the methodical killing of four men, whose murders are still unsolved. Marc will be analyzing the 1924 Ape Canyon, the Thompson Flat Monster Projects and the Butchertown Murders (1875-1905) to discuss historical document and field research techniques that are used for in-depth, detailed investigation of long standing episodes of the unexplained.</p> <p>Having spent his life researching and writing on unexplained historical events, he began in earnest with a fresh investigation of the 1924 Ape Canyon attack, culminating in the discovery of the actual cabin site in 2013, where the events took place. An incredible historical story with the latest details will be shared during this presentation, you will be glad you sat in on this one!</p>]]></description>

I met a researcher in 2010 when he lived in MS and we became friends.</p> <p>He took me to my first hotspot and proved to me BF existed. We got whooped at in a National forest from about 20 feet! Anyway, he moved but I kept going out there and started leaving fruit. Stupid I know NOW but I didn’t know enough back then to be scared. Once I went out there and left my money at home. But went to check on them anyway. The food had been taken out of the cooler so I set it upright and began the walk back to my car, it was about a mile walk.</p> <p>Halfway back I started hearing strange chimp like noises from where the cooler was back there. I started walking faster, then green pine cones started landing all around me so I started running to my car!</p> <p>Right before I got to it something right behind me sounded like a lion roar that morphed into a mad bull elephant and finally into a woman being murdered. It was so loud and powerful I fell down and puked. I got back up and got the hell outta there driving 50 miles back home.</p> <p>I told my girlfriend, she didn’t believe me and just said lets go to bed. It was about 1030. At about 1130 something began banging on the house. Happened 3 nights in a row. Ill be glad to tell you the whole damn story, regards”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be welcoming two guests to the show. Blake writes “I grew up in Mcnabb County in south Arkansas. I had an encounter there while hunting and have had two more encounters since then.”</p> <p>I spoke to Blake today and he talked about his first encounter he said “I heard what I thought was another hunter. This thing was walking up an incline coming right to me. As it got to the top of the hill I was expecting to see some hunters’ orange but this thing was all black and very large.</p> <p>It face and whole head was covered in hair and the only thing I saw was a human like nose sticking out. I must have stepped on a twig because this thing turned and huffed at me. As soon as it was looking at me I took off running. Everything is kind of a blur but when I stopped to catch my breath it became apparent that this thing was following me out from the side of the trail…”</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Eric, who writes “My name is Eric I would like to share my encounter story. I will give you a brief outline. We can discuss more if you’re interested. It happened in BC about 10 years ago in remote area east of the fraser river, north of Hope. A friend of mines family owns a logging company. My friend and I would go get equipment left behind.”</p> <p>I spoke to the witness and he said that him and his friend were camping one night and they heard strange vocalizations and had rocks thrown at them. They assumed it was people messing with them. Eric’s friend would get up with his gun and yell into the wood line telling whoever it was to stop or they were going to get shot.</p> <p>When the rocks continued to be thrown Eric’s friend got up and fired off a shot in the air and that is when this thing sounded like King Kong and was knocking tree’s over. The men decided to sleep in the truck. As soon as daylight came the men decided to leave and on the way out there was a tree that had been ripped out of the ground and placed across the road.</p> <p>The men got out of the truck and one kept the rifle while the other one cut the tree up.

I had an encounter there while hunting and have had two more encounters since then.”</p> <p>I spoke to Blake today and he talked about his first encounter he said “I heard what I thought was another hunter. This thing was walking up an incline coming right to me. As it got to the top of the hill I was expecting to see some hunters’ orange but this thing was all black and very large.</p> <p>It face and whole head was covered in hair and the only thing I saw was a human like nose sticking out. I must have stepped on a twig because this thing turned and huffed at me. As soon as it was looking at me I took off running. Everything is kind of a blur but when I stopped to catch my breath it became apparent that this thing was following me out from the side of the trail…”</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Eric, who writes “My name is Eric I would like to share my encounter story. I will give you a brief outline. We can discuss more if you’re interested. It happened in BC about 10 years ago in remote area east of the fraser river, north of Hope. A friend of mines family owns a logging company. My friend and I would go get equipment left behind.”</p> <p>I spoke to the witness and he said that him and his friend were camping one night and they heard strange vocalizations and had rocks thrown at them. They assumed it was people messing with them. Eric’s friend would get up with his gun and yell into the wood line telling whoever it was to stop or they were going to get shot.</p> <p>When the rocks continued to be thrown Eric’s friend got up and fired off a shot in the air and that is when this thing sounded like King Kong and was knocking tree’s over. The men decided to sleep in the truck. As soon as daylight came the men decided to leave and on the way out there was a tree that had been ripped out of the ground and placed across the road.</p> <p>The men got out of the truck and one kept the rifle while the other one cut the tree up. The men noticed two large figures up in the wood line watching them.</p> <p>Later they told the father who owns the logging company and he shrugged his shoulders and said “yeah those things happen…..”</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be speaking to Nick who was driving in Montana, and he and his wife saw one of these creatures on the side of the road. Nick will go into the full encounter and what he saw. </p> <p>Also I will be having return guest Derrill from <a href= "https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep293-throwing-rocks/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">SC EP:293 Throwing Rocks</a> on the show. He will be giving us an update on the picture taken (shown <a href= "https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep343-sasquatch-encounters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>). Derrill writes "My stepdaughter took this pic of red eyes staring in at her while at her aunts house. She told me that she woke up around 2am and saw two red eyes staring in at her. She heard no sounds but she did say that it blinked at her several times before it went away. I went over there to ck out the house and the bedroom window is over 6.5 feet in the side of the house. So what was ever looking in was at least 7' tall! This window is about 20' away from small creek that has lots of tree cover. I will include pics of the window, the bank, and the tree cover. This is in York county near York city in PA. What do you think? Bigfoot, or dogman? With the glowing red eyes I go for the latter. This house is at the end of a street and there are no streetlights, so at 2am it's really, really dark outside. Let me know what you think"</p> <p>I will be also welcoming back to the show Brenda Harris. Brenda investigates encounters around the reservation in New Mexico and will be sharing with us some updates and encounters. The photos Brenda and I discuss can be found on the episode page of our website <a href= "https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep343-sasquatch-encounters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I have been posting John’s videos to the website every chance I get.</p> <p>John writes “As a wildlife biologist, I have been studying the sasquatch (or bigfoot) for just over 50 years. For the past 25 years, the main subject of my wildlife research has been the scrutiny of evidence which appears to affirm the sasquatch as an existing mammal. During this period, I found this evidence to be not only compelling, but eventually conclusive in supporting the sasquatch as an existing North American mammal.”</p> <p>Be sure to subscribe to his YouTube channel. <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdUsSJgC8-0I1dIliI4yAJA" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to check it out.</a></p> <p>John A. Bindernagel is a wildlife biologist who has sought evidence for Bigfoot since 1963.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A hunter discusses his encounter in Colorado. As the two men slept in their tent something walked up and smacked the tent three times.</p> <p>Here is a portion of the encounter as the third hunter returned to camp and the men were sitting around the fire: “My view of Matt had in the background the tent and a row of trees ten yards beyond it. Daylight was still hanging on, but would slide into dusk within thirty minutes. As I stared at Matt’s face while hearing him elaborate, bipedal movement of a grey form caught my eye. Usually when I see something grey in the forest, it’s what we deer hunters seek.</p> <p>Immediately my eyes left Matt’s and locked onto a large, broad-backed figure slipping through the trees about 30 yards away. It traveled from right to left, and seemed to be going away from where our tent stood. It was very tall, and its light grey hair was clearly visible. Its hair was all one short length, starting at the top of its head and continuing without break down its neck onto its massive shoulders and back. Seeing its V-shaped physique struck me unusual because normally people up there on the mountain don’t go around shirtless. We wear either vests or jackets while hunting in the high country. This being wore nothing. It was quartering away as it moved between the lodgepole pine trunks, so I never saw its face.</p> <p>When Matt saw my eyes shift away from his, my head cocked to the side for a better view around him. He stopped talking, and swung around to see what I was looking at. The creature I saw walked upright, unlike the horizontal body orientation a deer or elk would have. It was exactly the same shade of grey as a mature timber buck, which probably helped draw my eye to it. “What the…?”, I muttered. It continued to pass between several trees that were spaced about five feet apart..."</p>]]></description>

As a SCUBA diver, he swam with the hammerhead sharks, has been filmed in Mexico’s Pacific Ocean riding the backs of giant manta rays, and been a safety diver for the filming of Right whales in Patagonia.</p> <p>As a private pilot, Ron has flown his own aircraft from the Alaskan bush to the Costa Rican jungle. Besides travelling to the ancient Mayan civilizations in the Yucatan, he has also flown into a remote jungle area of Chiapas (Southern Mexico) on an anonymous Mayan discovery expedition. What he saw was thought to be one of the last remaining strong-holds of the Mayan people. He has ventured into Western Nepal’s Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve to help assess the tiger population, explored the jungles of Bardiya on elephants, and been in the wilderness of Siberia looking for evidence of the Russian Yeti. He has made two trips in South America exploring the enigmatic structures and the non-human remains of the pre-Inca people.</p> <p>Over the years Ron has been interviewed by several radio programs and has been televised by the BBC and other learning channels. He was a guest speaker at the Darwin Museum in Moscow (Russia) and for years he has given presentations at symposiums and conferences about his Bigfoot/Sasquatch experiences.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “I had drawn an area in Fall Creek Falls state park. Once again it was bow season. I knew a little about the area I was going to hunt. The deer in this area was massive and not accustom to being hunted.</p> <p>I got to my area before sunrise and was heading up my tree. I started hearing this sound in the woods. It sounded like one of those old Samurai movies. I could hear two men making this sound. I turned around in my stand trying to find the location it was coming from. While turning I made some noise with my stand and the chatter stopped. I waited for what seemed like an eternity. Then I heard something coming around the trail I had come in on. Thinking this was a hunter I turned on my flashlight and called out. Everything got quite. Then I heard them step off the trail. One to the left and one to the right. I called out again and once more it got real silent. With daylight approaching I advised them I had drawn this area I let them know if I was in the wrong could they please advise me. Nothing, not a sound.</p> <p>Now I am getting mad. Wanting to hunt and now someone messing with me.</p> <p>I started climbing out of the tree. While climbing I could hear the one to left moving towards me and the other moving back toward the trail. When I got to the ground I was expecting to see someone waiting to explain the mix up. Unhooking my stand I scanned the area with my flashlight. I advised them I was going to the ranger station to sort this out.</p> <p>When I got to the trail It sounded like they were standing just off the trail. I heard one of them mumble something and that is when I went off on them. I was yelling and cussing them. After my rant I turned around and headed toward my truck. I could hear them following behind me. I turned once more and yelled some more. This time when I turned to head out one of them threw a rock at me. The rock did not hit me but landed very close. I continued out the trail and they continued to follow. Tossing rocks and sticks at me. When I got to the truck I was very mad. I started the truck then spun out several times. I started honking the horn and flashing my lights. I was acting like a child but I thought if I could not hunt this area neither were they. As I left one of them threw a rock that hit the back off my truck.</p> <p>When I got to the ranger station I explained what happened. They took me to a different area.</p> <p>I did not think nothing of these events until a few months ago. While listening to your show I heard a sound that made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck. It was that Samurai sound. The events of that day and the earlier event came back to me. A sick feeling came over me.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be welcoming Kevin to the show who wrote, "I had an encounter that was exactly like one of your other guests. When I heard his story I almost fell off my chair.”</p> <p>I spoke to Kevin yesterday and he said, “I had the exact same encounter as one of your previous guests, it happened in the exact same location as his in fact I played the encounter for family and friends. My family and friends have always laughed at me and when I played the encounter nobody was laughing. My encounter happened several years ago and where your guest describes being escorted out, that is exactly what happen to me. This thing paced me out knocking down everything in its way and when I would stop it would stop when I would continue it would continue. As your guest was describing the location I knew every detail in fact where he describes the creature stopping as he came out of the wood line is exactly where it stopped when it was chasing me.”</p> <p>I will be also welcoming Timothy Renner to the show. Tim writes "I just published my second book which is called Bigfoot in Pennsylvania: A History of Wild-Men, Gorillas, and Other Hairy Monsters in the Keystone State. It is all historical accounts from the 1830s through the 1920s which I have compiled from old newspaper articles.</p> <p>In this way, it is kind of like Sasquatch Chronicles in that it's just filled with encounters. I have added some commentary at the end of each chapter - but this mostly is my reasoning as to why I think the "wild man" in an article is referring to a bigfoot creature (for instance if the "wild-man" is 8 ft tall and covered in hair). Throughout the early 1920s there was a wave of sightings in PA - many of them quite aggressive - with multiple attacks on people, livestock, and cars noted in the articles. Many behaviors are noted throughout the articles which I recognized from being an avid listener of SC.</p> <p>I know you don't often have authors on - but I figured I would at least let you know the book is 'out there' and let you decide.</p> <p>All the best"</p> <p> </p> <p>Check out Timothy's book <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/dp/154551397X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1493934153&sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a> and his website, Strange Familiars, <a href="https://www.strangefamiliars.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>.</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

It is all historical accounts from the 1830s through the 1920s which I have compiled from old newspaper articles.</p> <p>In this way, it is kind of like Sasquatch Chronicles in that it's just filled with encounters. I have added some commentary at the end of each chapter - but this mostly is my reasoning as to why I think the "wild man" in an article is referring to a bigfoot creature (for instance if the "wild-man" is 8 ft tall and covered in hair). Throughout the early 1920s there was a wave of sightings in PA - many of them quite aggressive - with multiple attacks on people, livestock, and cars noted in the articles. Many behaviors are noted throughout the articles which I recognized from being an avid listener of SC.</p> <p>I know you don't often have authors on - but I figured I would at least let you know the book is 'out there' and let you decide.</p> <p>All the best"</p> <p> </p> <p>Check out Timothy's book <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/dp/154551397X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1493934153&sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a> and his website, Strange Familiars, <a href="https://www.strangefamiliars.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “Hey Wes I just wanted to start out by saying that I’m a huge fan of the show.I wanted to share a possible encounter my dad and I had back in ’99. We live in Southern California and decided to go camping in a remote area of the San Bernardino mountains. I was around 15 or 16 at the time. I don’t know where or how my dad found this place but it was out in the middle of nowhere, the place is called Paiute Canyon and it’s near Lytle Creek, anyway we got to the camp site and set up and were already finished with dinner and we’re just enjoying the sights from the campfire and we heard a very loud howl coming from our left.</p> <p>The howl was a good deal away from us and was coming from the entrance to the canyon (there’s only one way in and one way out of this canyon which kind of resembles a horseshoe) and was very similar to the Ohio howls. At the time both my dad and I had never heard anything like that in the woods before. Whatever it was vocalized a few times and seemed to be getting closer. We kept wondering what the hell it was and decided to load up the guns. After the guns were all loaded up we were back at the campfire when we heard another vocalization (still from our left side) and then we heard a response vocalization coming from our rear right side. The response was more of a whoop. This kinda got us on our toes and pretty alert as to what was going on around us."</p> <p>I will also be welcoming Bob Gimlin and Russell Acord to the show to talk about some new events coming up and to discuss the International Bigfoot Conference. Get your tickets now at <a href= "http://www.internationalbigfootconference.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.internationalbigfootconference.com</a>.</p> <p>My final guest will be sharing an encounter with a very strange creature about 10 years ago. After speaking with the witness, I am fascinated with her encounter. She said that the creature's body reminded her of the creature with the gas mask on the Pink Floyd The Wall, except the head was different. But the way the creature was sitting and how it’s body appeared was very much like the picture posted HERE on our site (just remove the head).</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be welcoming Blane Hajicek to the show. Blane has appeared on MonsterQuest. Apart from being a part time editor and camera grip, his father Doug Hajicek producer of MonsterQuest, has invited him on several research expeditions involving Sasquatch in northern Ontario.</p> <p> </p> <p>In 2007 During the filming of “Sasquatch Attack,” the cabin, in which he was staying, was attacked by something unknown. A year later Blane and his father went back to do more research in the same location, this time without the camera crew. During the second trip to Ontario’s Snelgrove Lake, the cabin was once again attacked. These experiences have opened his eyes to the existence of a large primate living in North America.</p> <p> </p> <p>Blane will be sharing with us an encounter he had a couple of years ago when he came within 30 feet of two of these creatures. Blane said “I never really believed in these creatures existing up until the Snellgrove lake incident and since then I have had a curiosity that has pushed me to look for answers. During the Snellgrove lake incident I never saw what was throwing rocks but years later I got a really good look at two of these creatures. I am still searching for answers.”</p> <p> </p> <p>I will also be welcoming Preston to the show. Preston was hunting during his encounter. Preston says “I was hunting when I saw a deer. The deer passed by me and minutes later the deer came running back towards me. I thought for sure I would see an elk chasing it and when I looked up I saw this gorilla looking creature coming from the direction the deer had come from. This thing stopped and looked at me and than continued on the direction it was heading. I only saw it for a couple seconds but those couple seconds changed my life.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener from Ontario, Canada writes “Hi Wes, I had a very bizarre situation when I was 15. I have never told anyone before but after listening to you for the last month I think I can tell you.</p> <p>It’s a crazy story I will give you the outline if you are interested you can let me know. I am in Ontario and this happened in a village in southwestern ont. my parents found god and thought I was to adventurous so moved me to the middle of nowhere. I have grown up surrounded byweird happenings. I found out a few years ago that my great great grandmother was full Ojibwa so weird gifts I have now make sense. I have always been connected to animals so the country was not bad.</p> <p>We had an old barn that we did not use but to park the car in. Where the animals were kept at one time you had to go down a ladder which was broken or threw a door you had to climb down broken up old stone stairs. My parents like I said we’re constantly praying and stuff so I would hide in the barn. It was late fall but the snow was falling early. I was in the hay loft and I heard a noise which was weird because we had no animals. I came down the later on to the main floor seen nothing. I sensed something there. I heard a noise under me. I am a curious person. I went around to the steep steps and seen the door open it was a split door and they were both open. The damn door was very hard to open because of the age. I could not get it a quarter of the way open it was wide open.</p> <p>I went to the door and peeked around it. It was still filled with hay from the previous tenants. Underneath the hay this massive blob was there. I was worried one of the neighbors horses was hurt so went a little closer and it uncovered its head. Which was pointed away from me and grunted like a gorilla does when it sends out a warning. I don’t know why but I said sorry and backed away. Went in the house and that was it. I was freaked and my parents did not believe in that stuff. They said that was the devil playing games. So I said nothing. Whenever I went to hide in the loft i would bang my feet if I heard a huff I would leave. This went on for a few months. I always noticed the farmers always bringing the animals in at night which I thought was weird.</p> <p>One day we were suppose to get a blizzard a bad one. For some reason I was thinking about the big ape. I did not really know what Bigfoot was. I thought it was a big ape. It always closed the big door when it left. So I figured if it starts snowing it could not get in so I got the door open and I threw fruit and vegetables in and left. The blizzard came and in the end my brother and I climbed out my bedroom window to dig out the doors. We were stuck for a week. After the storm I peeked around to see if my buddy was stuck but the top part of the door was open and there was a huge path to the forest. I could not get to it because of the snow was so high. I did not hear it again till early summer.</p> <p>It was our first long weekend and I had an argument with my parents and it was dark we were surrounded by bush and I would walk into town during the day but this was first time at night. I knew there was wild farm dogs. I was walking down the main road and I heard one of those dogs coming from the bush. I was scared because there was no houses around. I all of a sudden heard A big boom from a tree falling then there was the dog growling and I could see it’s eyes. It was moving towards me. All of a sudden there was a growl that shook me. And the dog stopped and turned. There was another growl and a Big Bang I seen its eyes it was about 7 feet. The dog ran and I walked off shaking in my shoes.</p> <p>A month latter I was out wondering and a man in a totally black truck pulled up and introduced himself as a neighbor which I knew he was not. He started ask questions about big bears. I played stupid. Then a week later I was outside at night smoking and I heard gunfire it was not any shot gun either. My mom came running outside and asked where the noise came from. I knew they killed it. So I got on the bus and asked where the war was I was mad. One girl looked at another girl looked at me said a bear got in a barn. So to push it I said I hope you called and reported it. I said it against the law not to. That night I was out walking and my so called neighbor pulled up and started chatting at me and he said oh sorry to disturb your family. I said I hope you have your rocket launchers registered. He just looked at me. I have a smart mouth which he reminded me of. I smiled and said yup. He said we had a big bear in the barn. I said sure it was not a monkey. His face went stone cold. He scared me so I laughed and said no I understand you have to protect your family and your animals. I said I would have done the same thing. He nodded at me and smiled and he said good answer. Have a good day and drove off. Freaked me out.”</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A listener from Ontario, Canada writes “Hi Wes, I had a very bizarre situation when I was 15. I have never told anyone before but after listening to you for the last month I think I can tell you.</p> <p>It’s a crazy story I will give you the outline if you are interested you can let me know. I am in Ontario and this happened in a village in southwestern ont. my parents found god and thought I was to adventurous so moved me to the middle of nowhere. I have grown up surrounded byweird happenings. I found out a few years ago that my great great grandmother was full Ojibwa so weird gifts I have now make sense. I have always been connected to animals so the country was not bad.</p> <p>We had an old barn that we did not use but to park the car in. Where the animals were kept at one time you had to go down a ladder which was broken or threw a door you had to climb down broken up old stone stairs. My parents like I said we’re constantly praying and stuff so I would hide in the barn. It was late fall but the snow was falling early. I was in the hay loft and I heard a noise which was weird because we had no animals. I came down the later on to the main floor seen nothing. I sensed something there. I heard a noise under me. I am a curious person. I went around to the steep steps and seen the door open it was a split door and they were both open. The damn door was very hard to open because of the age. I could not get it a quarter of the way open it was wide open.</p> <p>I went to the door and peeked around it. It was still filled with hay from the previous tenants. Underneath the hay this massive blob was there. I was worried one of the neighbors horses was hurt so went a little closer and it uncovered its head. Which was pointed away from me and grunted like a gorilla does when it sends out a warning. I don’t know why but I said sorry and backed away. Went in the house and that was it. I was freaked and my parents did not believe in that stuff. They said that was the devil playing games. So I said nothing. Whenever I went to hide in the loft i would bang my feet if I heard a huff I would leave. This went on for a few months. I always noticed the farmers always bringing the animals in at night which I thought was weird.</p> <p>One day we were suppose to get a blizzard a bad one. For some reason I was thinking about the big ape. I did not really know what Bigfoot was. I thought it was a big ape. It always closed the big door when it left. So I figured if it starts snowing it could not get in so I got the door open and I threw fruit and vegetables in and left. The blizzard came and in the end my brother and I climbed out my bedroom window to dig out the doors. We were stuck for a week. After the storm I peeked around to see if my buddy was stuck but the top part of the door was open and there was a huge path to the forest. I could not get to it because of the snow was so high. I did not hear it again till early summer.</p> <p>It was our first long weekend and I had an argument with my parents and it was dark we were surrounded by bush and I would walk into town during the day but this was first time at night. I knew there was wild farm dogs. I was walking down the main road and I heard one of those dogs coming from the bush. I was scared because there was no houses around. I all of a sudden heard A big boom from a tree falling then there was the dog growling and I could see it’s eyes. It was moving towards me. All of a sudden there was a growl that shook me. And the dog stopped and turned. There was another growl and a Big Bang I seen its eyes it was about 7 feet.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Graves joins us to discuss the trackway that was found near Sunnyslope, WA a few weeks ago. Paul will be sharing what he found during his investigation, and there is more to the story... Paul will also be sharing with us other encounters he has investigated and some of the audio he has captured.</p> <p>Paul writes, "I live in eastern Washington state and have been researching Sasquatch since 1988. On Monday, February 13th, 2017 I answered an early morning knock on my front door. It was Roy Bianchi, an acquaintance I had met a few years back through the construction trade (I own a concrete business).</p> <p>He was excited and said he wanted to show me something. He produced his cell phone and showed me photos of tracks he found on Friday, February 10th behind a new subdivision built on former orchard land. Roy is also a lifelong outdoorsman, and he had never seen tracks like these before. Upon first glance at the photos, I knew I had to go see the trackway. Previously, on Thursday, February 9th, roughly 8 inches of snow had fallen. The next morning, Roy and a coworker had to plow the construction area and discovered the trackway. The tracks were most likely made at night during the snowstorm, because when they were discovered, they were partially filled in with snow. After a third coworker examined the tracks, he suggested they should get hold of me (I am well known in this town as a sasquatch researcher).</p> <p>When I arrived on site there were five people already present, including the home builder, my research colleague Josh Lawrence, and a reporter for the Wenatchee World newspaper. With the exception of the reporter, each and every one of us are hunters and trackers with many years of experience, and we were all equally baffled by these prints. There was nearly 2 feet of snow on the ground, with a thin crust of ice on top that made walking very difficult. I am a trained tracker and spend a lot of time in the winter on snowshoes, and there was no indication of an animal bounding or hopping, nor animal tracks present inside of the prints.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be welcoming several guests to the show tonight who have encountered Sasquatch, including Shawn who writes “Hello Wes, I’ve been very reluctant to share my encounter with people due to the fact that people may think I am lying to them, or looking for attention.</p> <p>After listening to your show every single night for the past year, I still have not heard any encounters quite like mine. I’d rather tell you this over the phone, but I’ll give you a brief summary via email.</p> <p>A few years back, I was living in a rural area called Burnt Ranch, about 22 miles east of Willow Creek CA off of highway 299. The time was about 830 pm give or take a little, the sun was starting to set behind the ridge line. I was driving behind another truck about 6 or 7 miles past Salyer CA headed home on 299 when all of a sudden a huge creature literally jumped from a hillside and landed on the road, the truck in front of me literally slammed on his breaks in attempt to avoid a collision with what I thought was a bear at first glimpse. I also had to slam on my breaks to avoid rear ending the truck in front of me. I had a perfect view of the whole encounter. As the creature landed on the road, I saw it turn its head and looked right at us.</p> <p>This thing reacted so fast, it was so fast….I’ve never seen anything so powerful and agile…anyways, it looked right at us as it landed on the road and at that moment this thing stood up on 2 feet, bent down like a human would who is just about to perform a backflip, and made the most incredible jump into the air, it jumped backwards and stretched its body out in full extension, as it stretched its arms above its head, I could see its whole body in full detail, at this moment I knew I was not looking at a bear..."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coonbo will be stopping by tonight to talk about infrasound and Sasquatch behavior.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Linda, and Linda writes, “Hi Wes, I live in Midland county, MI but I am from Oklahoma. My mom is from there and my dad is from MI. They met when he was in the Airforce,so I am an airforce brat. Every summer my family would drive to Michigan in July for family vacation. I have a lot of cousins I would get to see and our family would go to the UP for camping and fishing.</p> <p>In the summer of what I think was 1978, I was at my aunt and stepuncles house in rural midland county. Our parents had all left the house to go out for a drive and us kids were in the back yard looking for something to do. My cousins were excited to let me know they had a minibike. So we all decided to take turns on it and drive back into the woods,on a trail that goes through there. After a couple of them took turns,my step cousin Kathy and I went together,she drove and I was on the back.</p> <p>We got going along this trail and we drove into this clearing that was a sandy turnaround that went to the left in a circle,and back out the trail. Well when we got into this turnaround,straight ahead above some blueberry bushes, was a big dark brown/black head of a creature that had huge round dark eyes and it was staring at us, not moving. Well I guess Kathy saw it the same time I did,because she turned the bike over on us,I burned my leg on the muffler.</p> <p>We didn’t say anything,just grabbed up the bike and took off out of there. When we got back I asked her if she saw what I saw,and she stated:Yes but I don’t want to talk about it: She went in the house then and I didn’t ride that bike either again. None of the other kids mentioned anything about seeing anything that day…..So now we are all older and have all talked about this and I found out that both my cousins saw that thing and also with a neighbor kid,when they saw it picking apples off a tree out in a field.</p> <p>When I saw it that day on the minibike,it had a large kind of flattened nose,big eyes,no hair,at least not what I could see, on its face. It had dark hair or fur on its head,the bushes that summer were about 6ft 2 inches,and this thing was a full head taller than the top of the hushes. I have pics that I took that day with my new kodak 110 pocket camera my mom had bought me for Christmas but the pics don’t tell me which year it was, but I believe it was 1978. Of course I didn’t have my camera on me when I got on the bike and probably would not have took a pic anyway as I was in shock and at the time did not realize what I had seen.”</p>]]></description>

It had dark hair or fur on its head,the bushes that summer were about 6ft 2 inches,and this thing was a full head taller than the top of the hushes. I have pics that I took that day with my new kodak 110 pocket camera my mom had bought me for Christmas but the pics don’t tell me which year it was, but I believe it was 1978. Of course I didn’t have my camera on me when I got on the bike and probably would not have took a pic anyway as I was in shock and at the time did not realize what I had seen.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be welcoming two guests to the show. Mike writes: “Small mountain town outside of Tahlequah Oklahoma. Driving back from town like I had always done when all of the sudden I got a flat tire and forced my jeep up the road a mile and a quarter of a mile in on the entrance. I didn’t want to walk back I didn’t want to stop the jeep.</p> <p>I later created a lot of damage to the rim and tire. It wasn’t but a few hours after that we were sitting in the back room. I do believe we were intentionally flattened because the damage was consistent with sidewall issue. A newer Goodyear tire that I had for several months. What I seen was a large man like creature looking at us from the back window of a trailer home my now ex resided with her family. It was large about 8-10 ft tall shoulders were at bare minimum of 3feet wide I wouldn’t say it was bigger then that.</p> <p>The hair was a combination of yellow and grey matted type of fur at the base and long actual blond hair coming off of that. The face was human like, a bigger and wider version of a mans face however the major difference was the width of the mouth. The width of the mouth reminded me of a “cymbal monkey toy” from the movie toy Story 3.</p> <p>The lips were thin and reached were out cheeks would be at. That’s the best I have to describe the mouth. Which was the feature that came to me as looking monkey like but mostly man-like. I noticed the lips would go from resting together to a wooing pucker and back. No noise or sounds. This thing had a wide and flattish nose with some freckles on either side of the bridge of the nose. Between the cheekbone and the bridge . Eyes were large almond shape and dark and with an occasional blink. I stared at it for about 15 seconds from inside the back bedroom and the window up until I convinced myself and my then girlfriend at the time, that I was seeing something that wasn’t real or thought I somehow imagined what I had seen was manifested as a thought. It was a very odd feeling. It doesn’t exist but it’s right here. She began freaking out and wanted the window shut and locked and had me go throughout the house to check the window and doors and grabbing the shotgun from her parents closet. We locked up the house and went to bed.”</p> <p>I will also be welcoming Remee to the show and she writes “Hi, I have a friend who follows Sasquatch chronicles and suggested I contact you with my encounter/sighting story.</p> <p>And after listening to other people’s stories on podcast I feel more at ease in sharing my encounter/sighting as I’m used to people I tell just dismissing it and writing to off as nothing. The encounter/sighting was in the mid to late 90’s while driving in northern Manitoba, Canada on a 2 lane highway surrounded by nothing but a sea of pine tree forest on both sides.</p> <p>It was late at night and I was sitting with my dad keeping him awake while we drove to visit family up north, when all of a sudden in the headlights there was a Sasquatch that came running upright out of the ditch and across the road right in front of us. It was a very quick and used its arms to almost propel itself out of the ditch and across the road. It only took the Sasquatch 2 strides to clear the road. And once it was on the other side of the road it stopped for a split second, standing upright and just stared right at me while we were still driving towards it. Then it ran down the ditch into the darkness still upright and was gone.</p> <p>However, I’m not sure where you sit with the belief of people having empathetic abilities but I have these and get gut feelings of other people, animals and nature’s feelings and I just know things that I shouldn’t sometimes. So in the instance when the Sasquatch stopped and stared at me I felt a great sadness, but like a loss or separation from another and a kind of lonely frantic ness almost like a driven search out of a panic. I also felt the Sasquatch’s mentality was what we would equate to that of a late teen early adult years and that it was a highly intelligent male. I remember his eyes the most they were large and dark but had a soft sad/ driven/ frantic panic kind of feel. I really didn’t feel he was any kind of threat or that he would want to be. He was very tall and had really long arms. It almost looked like a cross between a gorilla because of the arms and some of the facial features like the dark eyes and the flat wide nose and a brown/ grizzly bear because of the body being covered in a brown/black colour short hair and the butt being big like a bear, except the head had long hair. The Sasquatch was very muscular and had hands and feet like people but much larger and the skin looked thicker and like a grey colour. Honestly this Sasquatch to me was a beautiful being..."</p>]]></description>

I’m a big fan of your show if you would be interested in interviewing me I’d love to come on.”</p> <p>Here is the report: “In 1974 I was 12 yrs. old visiting my sister M and her family in Davie FL with my cousin A who was 15 at the time. One night we were sleeping on a pull out couch in the sitting room. When we smelled something like a skunk only worse, we asked my sister what it was she said it was the Skunk Ape and he comes around in the hottest summers. We didn’t believe her so we asked our friends and they said it was real.</p> <p>One night while we were sleeping we seen a huge shadow come across the picture window. Then it turned looked at itself and let out a blood curdling scream that scared us half to death. Then it turned and walked to the side of the house and we followed it by going in the side bathroom. There it squatted down to eat a wild watermelon then it went to the back of the house to a man made lake, squatted down and drank some water. A few nights later the beast attacked a wild horse in its coral but the horse got away by jumping over the coral and ran off into the pasture.</p> <p>The rancher came out and took a few shots at the beast but it got away. When the horse came back it had finger prints on its hind quarters, not scratches but finger marks. A few nights later the beast came back and killed a farmer’s bull. The farmer took a few shots at the beast but missed it. At the same time my sister and her husband J were coming home from a night out and the sheriff and his deputy were on patrol. We jumped into Joe’s car and followed the Deputy when the beast stepped out of the darkness and was hit by the police car..."</p>]]></description>

It was a little after 4 pm, I was watching a nice size buck making his way down a ditch toward my direction. The buck stop suddenly and was staring to his left (my right) looking toward a small food plot. I looked in time to see a bigfoot measuring 7′ to 7’6” walking into a thicket. It had reddish brown hair. Didn’t see the face but did see the right hand and fingers.</p> <p>The creature was probably about 45 yards away. The second time was in December 2011 I was hunting in the same place, just moved my stand on the other side of the ditch. It was about 3 pm. I just got in the stand and saw a deer running hard down the ditch then turned and headed my way. Right behind the deer probably 90 yards or so was a very large male bigfoot. I know he was male because I had a good long look at him through my scope.</p> <p>The deer had been run hard. It’s tongue was hanging out and was deep chest breathing, when the bigfoot got to were the deer turned to head my was be stopped and looked at me. He knew I was there and was not happy. He made a gesture showing that he was pissed. He probably stared at me for a good 30 to 40 seconds then turned and walked back the way he came. I think there may have been another bigfoot to a left ( the direction he was running the deer) because as the Bigfoot left I heard a deep rumbling growl from a thicket over a hundred yards way. I know this Bigfoot was a different one than the first one. The second one was grey/black and the face looked just like “patty”</p>]]></description>

Kris said “We thought it was some sort of strange monkey that got loose.” Kris owns a large farm in WV and talks about other encounters he has had with the creatures over the years. Kris says “One of the strangest things I have ever seen was a werewolf like creature that was walking towards my younger son while he played on the farm. I did not know what it was the only way I can describe it is it reminded me of a Hollywood werewolf, like you would see in the movies. As it approached my young son I went after it with my gun….”</p> <p>Check out Kris' website <a href="http://krisallen.com" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to David who heads the Independent Sasquatch Research Team based in Florida. David will discuss looking into a case featured here on Sasquatch Chronicles - <strong>SC EP:249 It had a look like “I’m going to kill you.”</strong> You might remember the episode: <em>Steve writes “I was completely frozen with fear I was 20 feet from the shoreline and this thing was about 10 feet in the tree line… I could not do anything except sit there and stare…. I watched it for what seemed to be forever but it was prob a minute as this thing was going nuts…. And as quick as it started it stopped, I was in the coast guard and went through several training and all but nothing could prepare me for what happened next…. I was at the point of fight or flight but there was no way I was gonna fight…. As I tried to gather my thoughts and pick up my jaw and figure out if I pissed myself or not …this palm branch moved to the side and I saw this …… Monster… Just staring at me.”</em></p> <p>The ISRT was established back in 2000 for researchers that want to work with a team of independent research people that are honest and hard working in the field.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “Back in 2013 at the house we use to live on more than one occasion I heard what sounded like huge rocks being slammed on the ground the last time I heard it I got my gun and a spotlight shined up on the hillside and it sounded like a bulldozer was coming down the hill I was expecting maybe a bear but it stopped before it came out of the wood line but I didn’t see anything. A few weeks after that I walked outside one night and heard very heavy footsteps like someone was running beside the house. Whoever this was had to be huge because I tried running through the yard to see if it sounded the same and wasn’t even close and I’m 6’5 300+ lbs. After that I was watching something about Bigfoot on TV and the guy was talking about hearing them run by him so I started doing a little research and found a video on YouTube called Trent vocalizations and as I watched it the hair stood up on the back of my neck I said holy $h*# I’ve heard that my whole life but I thought Bigfoot was a West coast thing. So in 2014 I was laid off from my job so we had to move to a different county in the first couple months we had someone smacking the house had someone messing with the screen in the bathroom window and when my girlfriend looked out the window she said it looked like someone with a hood on was standing there it was dark and she couldn’t see detail but this guy was at least 7’5. I’ve heard the most fu#@$ up owl scream a few times, I’ve heard rocks clanging together, I have audio that I sent to Jim bear king and he said it’s a Sasquatch there’s a lot more that’s happened if you’re interested.”</p>]]></description>

It very well could be that those who survived the onslaught of European settlement were those who took refuge in the most remote places on our continent, those very places that even today, remain nearly impossible to explore.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be welcoming two guests to the show. My first guest writes “I was all night fishing by myself at the same lake as the other times. It is my first sighting and I don’t know, it has really shaken me up. It was about 10:30 pm on Friday night . Dead calm, light fog but only on the water. It was fairly good visibility. I had my boat starting to go down the long channel on this “T” shaped lake. I heard a very deep gut type growl, but didn’t see anything. I pulled out my spot light which is 2,000,000 candle light power. It died in acouple of seconds. The growl was becoming more aggressive. I reached in my storage bin and pulled out my Taurus millennium pro pt111 9mm. I chambered a full metal jacket round and aimed it in the direction of the noise. This thing had been squatted down by a bush next to where 4 old boats are turned upside down. When it stood up it was massive.I could see it from the waist up. It started to move away from me but kept looking at me. I stepped on the trolling motor, turned the boat away from it to put more distance between us. I watched it the whole time. As I was going away, it turned, threw its arms in the air (yes arms) and charged about 10 feet or so. I spun the boat around and it violently threw its arms down. It was breathing so heavily it sounded like it was hyperventilating.  I still had my weapon aimed at it. I knew a 9mm wouldn’t do much with a chest shot, so I had it trained towards where its testicle may be. I couldn’t see them but was locked on to the general area.It let out a scream and stomped off. It continued to vocalize for 20 min or so as it left. I couldn’t make out much facial features except lighter skin on its face. It was black colored approx 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall. I would guess at least 600-700 lbs. Broad shoulders, its hands were down to its knees. I will also be speaking to Greg who had an interesting encounter in Washington State.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight we speak with Branden and Hazel, and they share with us what is going on around their property. Branden writes, “I found human like foot prints but it was not human. Finding these tracks bothered me so much I had the game warden come out to the property to look at them. He said it wasn’t human and it wasn’t a bear. The ground was so hard during that time of year it was next to impossible to leave an impression but this track went down 3 inches or more. Whatever left those tracks was heavy. Several weeks later I saw what left the track. This thing was black and huge. I could see it trying to hide and when it knew I was watching it, this thing got up and ran through the bushes like a truck, knocking over everything in its way. Hazel says “Late one night I went out to get something out of Branden’s truck and this thing was standing by the truck. It was about 8 feet tall and 1000 pounds. We have always heard whoops and whistles over the years but assumed it was the cattle ranches calling their cattle.”</p> <p>Jim Lansdale will be joining the show and share his thoughts on what is going on and around the property. He recently went out to research the property. Jim is one of the cast members on Killing Bigfoot on Destination America and team leader and co-founder of the GCBRO.</p> <p>Tom Sewid will also be stopping by to share a First Nation story with us about Sasquatch and the "Booger Boy."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Chris shares two encounters he had in Ohio. Chris writes "I’m Chris, from Ohio. Would first like to say I really enjoy your show. I’ve been listening for a good 6 months or more now. I look forward to it every week. I’v been considering writing in for a little while now. I have a couple of stories that may be interesting for your show. I will try to sum them up quickly so you can get an idea.</p> <p>The first is a short story that happened to me back in June of this year. I was up with a friend in Sleeping Bear Dunes Michigan. It is a national lakeshore along lake Michigan. We were up for a weekend camp trip. One morning we got up early to go check out this overlook. It was about 7am we were walking the trail to this overlook. There was rainy weather off and on so that morning it was really foggy.</p> <p>Everything was still and dead quiet. As we were on the trail, suddenly something large came crashing down through the tree tops about 20-25 yards from us. When the object hit the ground it had a deep thud signifying it was very heavy. A minute or two later I started to hear what sounded like (the closest comparison I can think of) small children basically chattering off in the distance, in the direction the heavy object seemed to have come from.</p> <p>Immediately I thought of everything I had heard on your show. It seemed to me to be an exact replay of things I’ve heard other guests talk about. I continued to hear the chatter as we walked on. We made it to the overlook, hung out for a while and then headed back to the car. As we passed the same area of the chattering, I could still hear it only much more faint this time and farther away. I never saw anything, never heard any other movement or anything else. That was it. I can’t confirm anything but all of this reminded me of many other people’s encounters on the show, even occurring in the same order as others..."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight Ed Brown joins the show to talk to myself and Woody about the International Bigfoot Conference.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Delvis who is from Texas. Delvis writes, "Hey there, Wes! Big fan of the show, I'm a new fan and have been listening for 2 months straight, everyday. I have an encounter of sorts. It happened back in the summer of 1995. I was 15 years old at the time, I'm 36 now and remember it like it was yesterday. Well, this one night I had a buddy of mine come over, we wanted to rent some video games and movies so I asked my mom if I could borrow the car and head out. She said no and I had a fit, blew a gasket teenage style. I stormed out of the house and walked down the street to cool down. I didn't even bother telling my friend either, I just left. I walked down to the end of the street to where the street lamps didn't shine. I took a seat right at the middle of the street and put my head down. At that time my old neighborhood was right next to a corn field, and the rest of the lots were filled with overgrown dry, tall grass and an abundance of mesquite trees. We also had an old meat market that had closed down some years before and was now just an empty vandalized building. The meat market was located on the opposite side of the block and therefore my street was on the backside of the property."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be speaking to Phil who was out hunting over 10 years ago in Minnesota when he came across an unknown creature. Phil writes, “It was all black and I was shocked how fast it was moving, I have never seen something on two legs run like this thing ran. It ran behind a tree and then came out to look at me...”</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Jacob who was out driving at night with his girlfriend, and on the side of the road stood two of these creatures. Jacob says, “There was a tall one that stood about 7 feet tall and a smaller one that stood about 5 feet tall. They appeared to have no neck and were proportioned like a football player with shoulder pads on. I was shocked when I saw them."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Mark who is from Southern California and had an encounter over a year ago. Mark moved to Washington state and went out with a friend to try hunting for the first time east of Seattle, Washington. I know the area well, and have recently received many reports from this area.</p> <p>Mark saw a creature who stood up and looked directly at him, and had a great description of what he saw. Mark says “I could not believe what I was looking at, I never believed in this before and didn’t care about the topic.”</p> <p>The men decided to go to the area where he saw the creature, and they found where the creature had been laying down, as well as large, human-like tracks. Mark and his friend have returned to the area almost every weekend for the last year and have had other encounters with the creatures. Mark says “I have just become obsessed with this, I feel like I need answers.”</p> <p>Mark invited wildlife biologist, John Bindernagel out to the area and John was so impressed he gave Mark a plot watcher to set up. Mark has sent me some of the evidence that he has collected, and has also sent the Olympic Project his audio to have it reviewed. Mark says “We have seen the creatures on several occasions and I am working on getting some clear video of them, I have recorded strange chatter, whoops, screams, roars and yells.”</p> <p>He was able to capture them on video as the creature was ducking down between two trees and sent me the still frames from that video. Mark says “I want to gather all of the evidence and work on getting them better on film before I release it to the public.”</p> <p>Tonight Mark shares with us the encounters he has had in this area and even an encounter where he was charged by one.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mike Wooley will be my guest tonight and he will be talking about his movie that is now available, and retelling his terrifying encounter with two Sasquatch creatures while he was hunting. That day changed his life, and Mike opens up how the encounter had a negative impact on his life.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Ben who writes “I’m not sure where to start, but here goes. I’m 37. I’m from middle Tennessee.</p> <p>After reading and listening to probably thousands of accounts over the past 3 or 4 years, and listening to your shows for a few months, I think I may be ready to share my experiences.</p> <p>To say I grew up in the woods doesn’t quite cut it. I have always preferred the company of trees over people. I was in my element in nature. I WAS the woods. It wasn’t uncommon for me to spend days, weeks, or even months out by myself. I loved it.</p> <p>As a kid I would often hear or feel things that just didn’t fit. I would basically laugh it away or just ignore it. I KNEW what was out there and Bigfoot never entered my mind. Even when I saw what could only have been a young one when I was about 14. In the open on an old dirt road not 10 feet from me. Still never thought Bigfoot.</p> <p>Even with all the stick and log structures that we knew “somebody” had to have made. The upside down trees. The rock stacks. The bare footprints. (Not overly large) The sounds. I don’t know how the connection was never made.</p> <p>Then comes 2004. I was screamed at twice by “something” just a few months apart. I was alone both times. The first time was during the day. As scary as it was I reasoned it away. The second time I was standing on a bridge in the middle of a very dark night. It ran by within a few feet of me and screamed again! Even though it was so dark that I couldn’t actually see it, I could feel the bridge shake with each step. I couldn’t explain it this time. I have barely been back in the woods since that night.</p> <p>There is much more to the story and many more things I remember from back when. I haven’t told many people about this stuff, not really sure where I would even start. Like I said, I never made the connection to Sasquatch until maybe 4 years ago."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes “I have been a logger for the past 34 years, and on this day in January of 2002 I was driving into one of our logging jobs on the Oregon Coast. There were two empty log trucks sitting on the landing and one loaded on heading out so I needed to find a spot to get out of the way. Since I was kind of needing to go to the bathroom I decided to drive up a spur road to be out of the loaded trucks way and also take care of my “business”. I took a short hike into the timber and proceeded to “squat” it had been dark and rainy all day and at this particular moment the sun broke through the clouds for a few seconds, and a column of sunlight came through the canopy of tree tops. The column of light hit on a spot that I thought was a rotten stump. But then I realized it wasn’t a stump but a creature covered in reddish brown hair also squatting down almost as if to be trying to hide from me. When it realized I had spotted it, it stood straight up and took off walking towards the ridge top. I was also spooked and jumped up and ran back to my rig as quickly as possible. Went many years without telling anyone about it. But the older I get the less I care what anyone else thinks.”</p> <p>I will also be welcoming two other witnesses to the show and one of the witnesses talks about lights in the woods he saw around his cabin.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The witness we welcome to the show tonight was out in the forest late one night when he had an encounter. Here is a small portion of his message: "It felt like SUCH a long time just standing there waiting for something to happen. Then I heard a car. It was somewhere behind me. I didn’t even think about it I just remember I turned started running toward the sound of the car. As soon as I turned I saw headlights driving down the canyon road. I remember running so fast I was afraid of tripping on something and I knew that if I fell that… that would be it. I remember kicking my knees up to my chest as I ran to make sure I didn’t trip. Honestly all I thought about when I was running was PLEASE GOD let this car see me. I started yelling at the top of my lungs and bolting towards the car. I’ve never ran faster in my life. I came close to the road but not seeing the hill down towards the road. I completely lost my balance and fell down the hill towards the road. I remember a pop in my collar when I hit the road. I got up just thinking that that thing was right behind me. The car had already driven past but I started running down the road. I knew I had broken something, (my collar bone) I kept running and running praying that thing didn’t come grab me. I never stopped. I finally got a car to pass again and I stopped it. It was a woman and a man. They asked if I was alright. I was so exhausted that I basically collapsed. They took me to the little ranger station. I really just am trying to get this off my chest and hopefully get some closure or something. I don’t know. I just wanted to write in and tell my account cause it sounds like you all take this very seriously and also have had experiences as well. Thank you for your time and I appreciate your professionalism on the show about this.”</p>]]></description>

You might be surprised to hear what happen to these guys when they returned. Steve also shares what his friend told him about these creatures and how they handle encounter reports.

I watched it for what seemed to be forever but it was prob a minute as this thing was going nuts…. And as quick as it started it stopped, I was in the coast guard and went through several training and all but nothing could prepare me for what happened next…. I was at the point of fight or flight but there was no way I was gonna fight….

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be speaking with two brothers. One of the brothers says “Over the years we hunted this property in Indiana, it was a great place to hunt. The only downside to hunting this land is you would feel like you were being watched all of the time. After killing a deer we would get screamed at by something and it would shake us up. We were paced out of the woods several times by something. This thing would break branches and stomp its feet. Sometimes we would make a kill and follow the blood trail to where we could tell the animal bleed out and died but the deer would just vanish. Our deer vanished several times, it was like something picked it up and took off with it. So many things happened out on this property, we would hear what sounded like people talking but could not make out what they were saying. One time I got out of my tree stand and went to find these people talking but there was no one there. We would have strange tree structures place under our tree stands, sometimes huge trees would be placed and leaning on our tree stands. So many odd things but if you do not believe in bigfoot and the land was so good to hunt…..I think we just looked the other way and passed off a lot of things as just being strange. We even found tracks of what looked like large human feet in the mud. It was not until recently we started listening to the show and now a lot of things are starting to add up…”</p> <p>Visit the episode page on our website to see the track casting <a href= "https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep252-hear-nothing-see-nothing-know-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A couple of college kids take off to the woods to look for Sasquatch. After several hours of having fun, making calls and hitting tree’s a visitor shows up. I speak with Justin and he was with the group the night of the encounter. Justin was not sure if he wanted to come on the air and talk about the encounter.</p> <p>He says “I always believed this creature was out there but I never expected to see one, in fact the night we were “looking” for Bigfoot was more or less just a night hanging out with friends and having fun. A lot changed after that night.</p> <p>Here is a portion of the encounter: “I kept scanning and I didn’t see anything. I asked my buddy to hold my flashlight so I could hop back down from the rock safely.</p> <p>I looked up one last time as I was getting down from the rock and that’s when I saw it. A flash, so fast I could barely catch all of it. Just a glimpse but it was enough to put my heart in my throat and all the air in my lungs to leave. It was walking (fast) from one tree the next one over. It was covered in hair, long arm swinging behind it. I could see the butt, thick back, long legs; I could actually make out what I thought was maybe skin underneath some of the hair.</p> <p>There were parts that were hairier than others. especially it’s head and shoulders. I thought I may have seen an ear but it was too fast to tell (it was small on this things head. I never saw the face that was already behind the tree along with most of the body. Just the back, butt, leg, some of the torso, and arm is mainly what At that point I was scared. I couldn’t really believe what I had just seen and it was still there…behind that tree we all had our lights on this tree. So what do we do?”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A Law Enforcement Officer writes “Hey Wes, I will make this as short as possible. I have a video form a trail cam.</p> <p>The video is not conclusive as it doesn’t show the face. Here is the history of the video. I am a 20+ year Law Enforcement Officer, three of which were done as a Game Warden. I received this video from a collage of mine. He was assigned to a federal task force working gorilla grown Marijuana.</p> <p>This group would go into remote areas of Northern California and set trail cams in an attempt to catch the growers on film.. This particular trail cam was 27 miles back in the Sequoia National Forest, not accessible by vehicles only ATV then foot. He retrieved the trail cam and found the attached video. He did not know what to do with it as he was afraid of repercussions etc. I openly speak about the subject and my beliefs and another officer referred him to me and he provided me the video. I only ask we discuss what to release about the video before sharing if you decide to.</p> <p>I also have experienced events, i.e. tree knocks, footsteps, and extreme fear for unexplained reason. I have also found a few footprints.”</p> <p> </p> <p>I spoke to the Law Enforcement Officer today and he said that trail cam appeared to be ripped off of the tree and this creature had buried it in leaves. He said the cameras are in such remote locations that they are only set to record 5-10 clips so that guys do not have to go out constantly to replace SD cards. They setup the cameras to bust drug trafficking.</p> <p>The officer did not make any claims as to what it is but he served as a game warden for many years and says “it is not a bear... this thing ripped the trail cam off of the tree and started putting leaves over it."</p> <p> </p> <p>To see the trail cam video, visit the episode page on our website <a href= "https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep246-law-enforcement-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>.</p>]]></description>

I have been looking for the old episode...</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Steven who will be sharing with us some of the encounters he has put together on his new website <a href="http://www.lonestar-ape.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">www.lonestar-ape.com</a></p> <p>If you get a chance check it out!</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be speaking to three witnesses tonight. The first witness writes “On April 3, 2016 my daughters 27 year old friend of 15 years & I were leaving Fair Grove MO around 9:30 p.m. heading south on Hwy 65 to Springfield MO. 4 miles south of Fair Grove around mile marker 60 on the west side of the Highway in the drop of the side of the road something came into the sight of my headlights. At that time I drove a 1999 Grand Marquis. What we saw next was huge. It was facing away from the road toward the ridge. It’s head was looking down. We saw huge shoulders about 4 to 5 feet wide. It’s right arm was as big as a man’s thigh, a well built man. It’s waist went in like it’s shoulders were the top of a V and the waist a solid bottom of a V. It probably weighed about 800 lbs. I would say. It’s skin was charcoal gray and it had scarce hair a tan to auburn color, like it had mange or something. I said to Tina “What is that?” she said “I don’t know but it is huge.” We repeated that to each other about 3 times. Then I asked “Should we stop?” She said “No, I’m going to pee myself.” I asked “Should we turn around and go back?” She said “No really I’m going to pee myself.” I then told her to call my father who lives in Fair Grove and we were telling him about it.”</p> <p>I had the opportunity to speak to the witness' father and he shared with me his own encounter when he was younger.</p> <p>My final guest shares with us encounters that his family had back in the 1950’s.</p>]]></description>

I had a hiking pack on my back and my friends had gotten ahead of me on the trail so I decided to take a break, drink some water and then catch up with my friends.</p> <p>I heard some movement in the bushes below me and I did not really think much of it. I unsnapped my hiking pack from around my waist. I heard it rush towards me and as I started to turn to look at what I assumed was a bear…the next thing I know, I’m in the air and hitting a tree….I am now on my belly. I was confused and when I lifted my head up, all I saw was hairy legs and huge feet. This thing was standing over me and than it screamed/roared at me. I thought I was going to die. I tried to look up at it and it screamed/roared at me again.I noticed the creature was breathing heavy and rocking from side to side. I heard the bushes below me rustle and the creature was focused on the noise….that’s when I looked up and saw it’s face….I….I am not sure what these things are but it was strange...

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Spoke to a hunter yesterday that had two encounters over the years with these creatures. The first encounter he had was out hunting in Idaho. He noticed an elk running in his direction. What concerned the hunter was something must have been chasing the elk. The hunter says, “I looked up and the elk changed directions and started heading right at me, the elk ran right passed me like it could careless I was there, confused I watched it pass by and then turned back around to see this very large creature giving chase come to a complete stop. It had a rock in its hand, I had never seen anything like this before. We stared at each other for what seemed like forever and what happened next I will never forget….”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes: “Hey, I just started to listen to the show after having a sighting behind my house in east Texas. I moved in this place 2 months ago.</p> <p>I hear them often not yelling or anything like that. I did hear knocking in the front of the house, tree breaking and I found tree structures. There are lots of deer in the area and I have a drainage creek behind my house. So I think they may have been hunting here. No one lives in the house for a year before I bought it.</p> <p>This last Sunday I heard my dog in the woods and it sounded like it was got hurt. I ran out of the house and there was my dog sitting in the front and nothing was wrong. I think that the Bigfoot made that sound to get me or the dogs in the woods. Latter that night my wife was on the porch and heard something banging around and the heard tree branches braking on the other side of the yard. She came and got me I didn’t here anything but she said it had to be two of them.</p> <p>I also saw a print that might be from Bigfoot. It was 12″ long 6″ wide. The Bigfoot was about 7′ tall was at twilight so it looked like a dark shadow very upright with a round head and big shoulders no neck, long legs. I didn’t notice the arms. I am wondering if they could be watching us and may harm us. I’m doing my best to give them there space. Thanks for your time. If you have any insight let me know thanks”</p> <p>I will also be welcoming Duke to the show. Duke stops by to discuss his conspiracy theories and info on past insider shows.</p>]]></description>

There are lots of deer in the area and I have a drainage creek behind my house. So I think they may have been hunting here. No one lives in the house for a year before I bought it.</p> <p>This last Sunday I heard my dog in the woods and it sounded like it was got hurt. I ran out of the house and there was my dog sitting in the front and nothing was wrong. I think that the Bigfoot made that sound to get me or the dogs in the woods. Latter that night my wife was on the porch and heard something banging around and the heard tree branches braking on the other side of the yard. She came and got me I didn’t here anything but she said it had to be two of them.</p> <p>I also saw a print that might be from Bigfoot. It was 12″ long 6″ wide. The Bigfoot was about 7′ tall was at twilight so it looked like a dark shadow very upright with a round head and big shoulders no neck, long legs. I didn’t notice the arms. I am wondering if they could be watching us and may harm us. I’m doing my best to give them there space. Thanks for your time. If you have any insight let me know thanks”</p> <p>I will also be welcoming Duke to the show. Duke stops by to discuss his conspiracy theories and info on past insider shows.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Very interesting encounter tonight, I spoke with the witness and his impression of the creature was it was trying to warn him to go away because something was coming down the hill. He could hear something large and breaking branches on the hill at the time he ran into the creature.</p> <p>He writes, “It was very early in the morning, maybe 1 or 2 am, day 3 of a five day backpacking trip, and I got out of my tent to relieve myself. I walked ten or 15 feet to go behind a tree, when I felt dizzy and had a strange urge to walk up the hill from our campsite. I had walked maybe a hundred yards or so up the trail, when I saw something squatted down in the trail about fifty feet from me. It had one fist on the ground and was looking at me intently. I noticed then, that even squatted down, it was as tall as I was (5 foot 8 ). It was at this point I realized I wasn’t looking at a person, but I felt frozen to the spot and didn’t want to make a run for it. We stayed this way for a few seconds, then I heard something big crashing down the slope towards us. The creature looked in that direction, looked back at me, made some sort of a grunt/guttural yell at me. When it yelled, it felt like it was telling me, get the hell out of here, something bad’s coming down that hillside. It stood up and loped down the trail away from me, and I made my run for it to the campsite. I sat by the fire with my hunting knife in my hand, jumping at the slightest noise, till morning. The next two days of the hike I didn’t say a word to anyone, and I’ve only told my longtime girlfriend and one good buddy about it since. Wes, what do you think it was i saw? What do you think was coming down the hill? Do you think I was in danger?”</p> <p>My second guest was out for hike with his kids and he heard wood knocks around him and his kids. Several times he called out to whoever was making the noises but did not get a reply. Being ex-military he said that it appeared to be an L-pattern trap and whatever was making these noises were closing on his position really fast,too fast to by human. He said several weeks later he was in the area and it had snowed and he found these large footprints in the snow all in a straight line. He said a lot of strange things happen in this area and shares with the us everything that has been going on.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's a double hitter this weekend! SC EP:211 is coming! I am in the process of uploading it to the site. Here is EP:210 with Dan Baker who describes an encounter while investigating a property.</p> <p>Dan Baker will be my guest, and will be sharing with us his personal encounter. Dan writes “I was a 12 year old boy in 1967 when Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin made the historic film of “Patty” in Bluff Creek California. I always sat with my mom and dad in the evenings to watch the news. One evening, I saw that epic film of a large, hairy creature walking away from the camera. That was the film that sparked a lifelong interest in bigfoot. Over the years, I watched as many films and documentaries as I could and read about as much. The Internet allowed me to further my research, in some areas but I needed to start getting into the field, which I did along with my wife, Sue. On June, 6, 2013, I finally had a night time sighting through my night vision in Carroll County, Ohio. Soon after that, I began researching anthropology, paleoanthropology, and primatology in an effort to piece together possibilities of just what these creatures might be. Studying early hominids and great apes has given me a better understanding of bipedalism as well as an idea of how it works. I’m constantly exploring possibilities.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A witness contacted me and says he was hunting with a friend and they were being followed most of the night. They were unsure of what was pacing and following them. As the two hunters were leaving the area, they both turned around and saw a 7-8 foot tall creature looking around a tree at them. The creature did not flinch when they had their lights on him. The witness describes the creature’s face looking tired of like it had down syndrome. One of the hunters wanted to run but the men remained calm and slowly backed off and walk out. The witness who was in front said his friend screamed and bolted past him. He said that the creature had grabbed his backup light that was hanging on a cord and shook it.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be speaking to Hunter who was face to face with a Sasquatch. Hunter says “My window was about 7 feet off of the ground and my bed is right next to the window. As I was in bed I had this feeling of something watching me. I looked over and we were inches from each other, separated by glass. The eyes had a reddish color to them and it’s expression never changed, it just had a blank stare. The only thing moving was the creatures eyes looking me over. I thought a gorilla was loose but the more I stared at this creature in fear the more I realized, this was no gorilla. I can give you a very clear description of the face, eyes, ears, mouth and even what little of a neck it had. This thing was huge! I thought these things were in the Pacific Northwest but not Ohio!” I will also be speaking to another witness who had an encounter with a Devil Dog (Dogman). He says “I writing cause I heard your interview you did with Chris Jerchio. Now I would not call my self a huge believer of Sasquatch but I was more curious than anything so I gave it a listen. But when you started talking about the “devil dog” it struck a cord."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be welcoming two guests on. My first guest is from Washington state. When he was a child he got on his bike along with other neighborhood kids and started riding to a friends house. His friend had called him and said that “the bear is back and looking in the windows.” The boys wanted to see this bear and as they were riding up the road they came across this “bear.” He said this man-like creature ran across the road in front of them and retreated into the wood line. The boys were unsure what it was but it was heading towards their fort in the woods so the boys got off their bikes and gave chase. My guest was one of the oldest boys and said that he caught up with this thing and it turned to look back at him and that is when he realized it was not a man or bear. He had no idea what he was looking at, he started screaming at the other boys to turn around and go back…..</p> <p>My second guest writes “I saw Bigfoot along with my friend and two daughters on our way to Georgia from Arizona. It was around 2:00 a.m. coming around a curvy mountainous road in Tennessee.</p> <p>We were only traveling about 20 mph around a sharp upgraded curve and boom, here stepping over a guardrail was a least 7 1/2 foot tall blackish greyish huge long armed hairy thing carrying a black trash bag which probably came from a campsite or something.</p> <p>His arms hung low to his knees, he stopped like a deer caught in our bright headlights, he was as tall if not taller than our Chevy van. He stared straight at us and we were looking at him. We were only like 25 feet from him. Saw him clear as day. My oldest daughter came to the front of the van after she heard me and my friend freaking out and said Mom, is that a gorilla?!</p> <p>He stood there at least 35 40 seconds before he proceeds to cross the road, stepped over the other guardrail and headed down in the woods. I had a camera and a video camera within reach but we were in such shock I didn’t even think to pick them up and use them. All I know is I stared at this thing long enough to know what I and my family saw. I will never forget it. I kick myself in the ass all the time for not clicking a picture. The car that came up behind us as we were stopped, well, I’m sure they saw it too.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I welcome Ronnie to the show, and Ronnie writes, “I came from the city and moved in with my mother in law who lived out in the country. In this area of Washington State it is very remote. One night I heard a creature breathing outside of my window.</p> <p>I assumed it was a bear until it walked past the window. It walked over to my mother in laws window which was next to mine. My mother in law snores like a chainsaw at night and the creature mimicked her snoring as I went to the window to get a look at this thing the floor creaked. The creature turned and looked at me and growled. It was huge, the largest thing I have ever seen. I fell backwards and stayed in the corner of the room until the sun came up.</p> <p>Looking back now I know this thing was around the property, I would go out to feed the horses and the horses would be acting strange and I had a weird sense I was being watched. At night I would watch TV and always felt like something was watching me. I started closing the shades on the windows. After my encounter I know what it was and I moved out within 48 hours. I am telling you Wes this thing looked like a gorilla on steroids standing straight up”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Kyle writes "As we approached we heard a really loud “huff” and again we froze. We both had our heads on a swivel looking for this “bear”. That’s when at about 30 yards away I saw a huge dark creature standing upright pulling the bamboo aside to peek through. I brought it to the attention of my brother and we both stood there in amazement. We saw what looked a lot like a man. I would say it was between 7.5-8.5 feet tall, black brown hair covering all of the body that was visible to us. The shoulders were as wide as the tailgate of my pickup truck, I mean just tremendous. We also noticed that there was a musky smell reminiscent of a buck during the rut. The forehead had little to no hair on it and the skin was a grayish color. We both saw this creature blink it’s eyes and for whatever reason, I feel like that’s the only thing I was able to focus on was its eyes the eyes were set deep in the skull and almost looked black. I mustered the courage to take a step forward and this thing took off like a dragster. Ive never heard any animal tear through the woods like this thing did. I’ve had trouble recounting all the details but I’m going to see my brother this weekend and we are going to compare notes as to what we both witnessed."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I welcome Jeremy to the show. He was recently out on expedition in East Texas and talks about his experience. Jeremy had a piece of concrete thrown at him in the middle of the night and then was roared at. He will be sharing this along with a short sighting he had while he was down there.</p> <p>I will be also welcoming Robert to the show. Robert talks about an Appalachian Trail encounter with “tall brown man.” The witness and his son were hiking and decided to stay in a shelter along the Appalachian trail when they encounter a strange creature the witness says “It was NOT a bear or a man.”</p> <p>My final guest had a scary night hiking into a remote location. Ben talks about seeing the creature outside of his tent and being harassed all night by several creatures. The witness writes “Wes, I had an experience last year that left no doubt in my mind as to the existence of Sasquatch. I told my dad about it and he said I should check out your show, he started listening after being screamed at in Idaho by an animal that he had never heard before and with a powerful set of lungs. I had a previous encounter the same year but was in denial about the whole thing. Its a pretty hard thing to wrap your head around…. The latter of the two experiences happened in a national park in Nevada while on a backpacking trip with a friend. The experience lasted around three hours starting at two in the morning. Ive never felt that kind of terror in all my life, it was like the primal fear of being hunted, there was more than one. There hasn’t been to many nights since that it hasn’t been in my thoughts as I try to go to sleep. I’m not a skittish guy and have logged more time in the woods than most people my age, thirty six by the way. I’ve been up close and personal with most of the big game animals of North America. My dad is a wild life artist and avid outdoors man and I was home schooled giving me the opportunity to spend countless hours in the back woods bow hunting, backpacking and exploring ect… I have never heard or seen anything like this before. I feel like it would help if i could talk about it with some one that knows the kind of fear that come’s along with running into to these things at close range. If you want get in touch with me and hear what happened I would love talk with you! you’ve got a great show and I’m sure that you have helped a lot of people by giving them a safe place to share stories that would other wise never be heard.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Earlier in the week I posted a video of strange lights in the woods. Woody returns to the show to talk about what we experienced that night. To see the video, visit the episode page on our website <a href= "https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep191-do-not-chase-strange-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>.</p> <p>I also welcome Seth to the show who shares with us two experiences he has had with Sasquatch.</p> <p>My final guest of the night is Steve, and Steve writes, “I was visiting our family house in St. Étienne de Bolton, Quebec, Canada. There is a creek behind house. My cousin (probably around 8 or 9 at the time) and me (around 13) walked down to Creek like we always did when we went up there. We got within eye sight of creel and we both froze. There was this grayish white monstrous sized thing sitting at the waters edge. At first I would of sworn it was an elderly thin polar bear. Obviously couldn’t be a polar pear, or a grey gorilla much like the movie congo. As soon as it moved it’s head the slightest bit I shoved my cousin in front of me up the hill and we ran back to the house. I told my parents that we saw a giant dog, polar bear, gorilla, thing and they basically said, it was probably a big dog like our neighbors. It definitely wasn’t a dog, or polar bear. The thing I remember the most are it’s shoulders. They were bony and decrepit. That’s the only way I can describe it. It was like I was looking at the back and shoulders of a very large and hairy 95 year old man. That’s it. It was a very quick sighting but I’ll never forget it.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I speak to Cory who is from Texas and went on a commercial hunting trip in Canada. Cory had several strange things happen while he was on this hunting trip. He writes, “After I arrived in Canada and was out in the middle of no where I heard tree knocks. It went on for along time. I asked the trip organizer what the noise was and he insisted it might have been a moose. Things progressed on this trip and I heard a very very violent vocal. I have never heard anything like this before. It sounded like King Kong killing something, the creature was tearing apart something. The creature soon circled around my tree stand, I finally backed out of there slowly. I talked to the trip organizer and I am not sure if he knew about these creatures and they were bad for his “paid” hunting trips or if he truly had no idea. This brought back memories of growing up on the family farm in Texas. We had a lot of strange things go on and around that property. My sister even saw what she describes as a “very large monkey walking on two feet back into the tree line. As a child I saw the creature on the property."</p>]]></description>

Joe is a skilled hunter and trapper and shares his encounter with us when he was deep in the Adirondack’s Joe writes ” I have been a hunter and trapper my whole life. I have ran into every wildlife known to man in that area but what I ran into that night changed my life. I was in a very remote location, so remote that I spent all day kayaking to get into my spot. I thought the first night was bad hearing something bang on tree’s most of the night but the following night was much worse. This “thing” was around my camp most of the night and when it roared at me I was terrified. Wes I have never heard anything like this before, it roared at me like a lion and was shaking the bushes like an ape would do. I prayed for daylight. The next morning I found human like tracks that were 15 inches long next to my tent. I had to leave. There is so much more to the story but it was scary…"</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My brother Woody joins me on the show tonight to talk about what we experienced up at Yacolt on Christmas night. I hope everyone enjoys tonight's show. I have a video shot and I am working on editing it and posting it to the site.</p> <p>I also will be speaking to Jean who is from Washington and had an encounter a few years back. Jean writes “I’ve been listening to your show for about a year now. What drew me to it came from looking up information about Bigfoot on the net and I ran across your show. My family also listens as well. After a bit of discussion off and on about telling someone what happened to us, my family was in agreement that I could contact you. In 2004, we went camping with a couple other families at Chambers Lake on Ft. Lewis over the Memorial Day weekend. There was eight people all together and three dogs. Where we were camping was by the lake but actually in a picnic area, because all the designated sites had already been occupied when we arrived. We were all tent camping. Anyway, when we were setting up camp, we noticed that one of the cement picnic tables was smash, like some sort of ordinance had hit it a while back. we thought it was strange but just used the other table instead. Our dog we tethered to the broken picnic table. This was a Friday. In the early evening we all heard some strange sounds, and asked another camper about it, and he told us that he thought someone was training dogs near by, it didn’t sound like that to us, but we accepted the answer he gave.</p> <p>So we were camping and having fun. No one was drunk, a few of us had small kids to tend to, and we were just camping. When night was starting to come we started a fire. We were talking for several hours and everything was fine. A while later some went to their tents for the night, I and three others continued talking around the campfire. Then we heard something strange. Across from our campsite was a gravel road, and beyond that was a huge field of scotch broom. A good six feet tall. We started to hear a sound like the scotch broom was whipping around. A few times we stopped talking, the noise stopped, and we continued talking. And BTW, we are noisy campers.</p> <p>Then it got loud in the scotch broom field again. This time we stopped talking and listened, and it kept coming closer it sounded to us. The guy across from the fire from me stood up from his lawn chair, also at that moment we heard a pounce on the gravel road. He said, “Jeanie, what is that?” I heard a second pounce on the gravel and stood up out of my chair and turned around. That’s when I saw it. But only for a moment.</p> <p>By the time I saw it, it was on our side of the road and was dipping into the trees next to where we were camped. It was Tall. Dark. I didn’t see hair, but the others said they did, but what I noticed was that the back of its head was higher than the front. I just saw its profile as it ran. And it ran fast.</p> <p>We stood there stunned and silent, I think we were in shock. Then my dog started going crazy, trying to choke himself to get away from it and to us. Then we screamed, men and women, and my dog was still trying to get away. Let me tell you one thing about my dog, he was an Alfa male. He didn’t get buffaloed by anything. But this thing he was scared shitless of. And we could hear that it was close to him because we could hear branches and stuff snapping, really close by. My husband came out of our tent. He told us to shine the flashlight near the dog, we were all too scared to. We simply did not want to see that again. Then one of the other men came over and helped him free our dog.</p> <p>Everyone was up at this point and started asking us what happened. We told them. My husband said it was just probably some army ranger running around in a guilly suit. None of us thought that was a very good explanation, but that’s the one we went with. Then one of our friends said that her dog started doing something strange right before my dog went nut. She said her dog was trying to dig a hole under their tent. Then we all realized that one dog was unaccounted for. We found her burrowed under a truck. We stayed up long while then went to our tents.</p> <p>The next day was fine. During the day. But one thing odd that did happen was that some people were riding horses near us, all our dogs barked and tried to chase the horses, but the guy in the guilly suit, they wanted nothing to with. That we remarked about.( Now it is Saturday.) Then as it started to get dusk, we hear some strange screams. Kind of like a woman. But not quite. Kind of confusing to describe, but it sounded like she was in distress. The men took off running from our campsite and into the scotch broom where the screams were coming from. In there, they ran into other campers who had done the same thing. They never found the screaming women.</p> <p>Then when it was getting dark, we lit a big fire, and kept it stoked, burning bright. Nothing happened for several hours, so we went to our tents. Then about a half hour later one of our friends started complaining that they could hear heavy feet tromping in back of their tent. Everyone got up, pulled the tent stakes up on that tent and pulled it in closer to the rest of ours.</p> <p>The next morning, Sunday, we packed up and left even before eating. We had a permit to stay until Monday, but we had had enough. Oddly none of us talked about it until about a month and a half later, when we did, we all described what we saw and realized we saw a Bigfoot. and we believe that first night that it might have been trying to eat my dog. It’s just a feeling that we all have. The following summer, 2005, Chambers Lake was closed for camping, because of a supposed bear encounter. We don’t think it was a bear.</p> <p>So then we started camping out at Lewis Lake, also on Ft. Lewis, but not very far from Chambers. Everything was fine the first few years, but two summers ago strange things started happening out their also. One night my daughter and son in law heard heavy foot steps around the back of their tent. My son also heard that from the tent he was in. No one looked because they were afraid to. Also on that trip my granddaughter and her friend found two deer sculls not too far in the tree line in back of our campsite. That was odd we all thought. Then last summer we were camping at Lewis Lake again. There was our party, 11 of us, and across the lake from us looked like a family of 4, then on the other side of the lake between us and the small family was a bunch of boy scouts camping. Not too far from our campsite we found not large, but pretty big foot prints in some mud. What was odd about the prints is that they were wide feet. Very wide feet. I would love to see the shoes that would fit those.</p> <p> </p> <p>Later that night, after dark, we started hearing whooping sounds in the woods in back of us. Then we heard some whooping it sounded like over by where the boy scouts were. At first it was whooping between our camp and the boys scouts. But it sounded like an echo so there was some distance. Then it started in behind where the family of 4 were right across the lake from us. But pretty close to them. That family drove off and left their tent and the fire still lit in the middle of the night. I don’t think we are going back to Lewis Lake anymore."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I speak to two guests. My first guest is Josh who was riding on some ATV’s with his family when they came across a strange creature that was watching them. Josh and his brother were on the trail riding their ATV’s when Josh’s brother stopped ahead of him. Josh said “As I came around the corner my younger brother was stopped and was pointing so I stopped and looked and that is when we saw it…"</p> <p>I also speak to Eric who had probably who had some very interesting encounters, Eric writes:</p> <p>My first experience occurred in either summer 1993 or 1994. I simply cannot recall the specific date any longer. My friends from high school and I went to Cave River Valley near Campbellsburg, IN, which at the time was privately owned (it is now a state-owned natural area). We stopped by the owner’s house, paid for a few nights of camping and received the key to get past the iron ranger blocking property access. The property was magnificent. The upper section of the property was about 60 feet above the valley floor and had two camping areas. The valley was wide and covered in sparse grass and hard packed dirt along with an old log cabin. A creek ran through the valley. There were also several caves – River Cave, Endless Cave, Dorsey’s Cave. We spent the first day setting up camp near the park entrance and exploring the caves. Nothing odd or strange was noticed.</p> <p>We started cooking dinner over the campfire at nightfall and enjoying a couple of beers apiece. After dinner, we were all sitting in chairs around the campfire and heard the clear sounds of footsteps coming up the hillside to our east. This hill was a *<strong>very</strong>* steep grade. The footfalls were consistent and sounded like someone walking normally. All of us turned around and watched, expecting someone to crest the hill. The footfalls stopped at the top of the hill. We waited a few seconds and began calling out to this “person” in a friendly manner. We waited a few more seconds and began to get nervous. No one had any weapons – if this is a hermit who wants us out of here, we have no way to defend ourselves. Then we heard this “person” take off running in the brush and deeper into the woods. We could follow the path taken aurally, leading to the north and away from us. Whoever was running out there did not slow down, make any effort to be quiet and was moving very quickly. The runner got to a point about 500 feet away from us and the sounds stopped. Once we all got our wits about us and discussed what had just happened, two of us (myself and my friend who was 6’ and 300 lbs.) decided to investigate. We began walking towards where we last heard the runner and stopped at the edge of the firelight. My friend went to the west and started moving north on the dirt road and I headed directly towards the last location of the running sounds in the woods. I may have taken 5 steps when an ear-splitting scream erupted from the darkness.</p> <p>While I am no Les Stroud, I am not unfamiliar with the woods, animal sounds and the general cacophony of nighttime in the forest. I’ve heard all manner of animals scream – foxes, rabbits, owls, coyotes. All of them make sounds far louder and stranger than you’d expect. However, even when close by, I’d categorize their sounds as startling but never (to me) ear-splittingly loud. This scream hurt my ears and made me back up. I could physically feel it. The scream sounded like a bizarre owl screech, but deeper, louder and powerful. The sound was very deep, almost rumbling, for about one second and then increased in volume and pitch for the next 5 seconds, ending as a paralyzing shriek. My friend ran back to camp instantly. I stood still and listened. I could hear whoever this was retreating into the forest to the point I could no longer hear them. I went back to camp, joked it was probably a bobcat or owl, and let it go.</p> <p>We spent the night sleeping in a van rather than tents. Everyone was freaked out but no one wanted to say it. It was pure comedy. By that time, we’d been drinking beer for a few hours and were drunk – no two ways about it. We all passed out. About 3AM one of the guys woke up and screamed he’d seen a hairy arm reach in the van’s passenger window (all windows were open to cool off the interior and allow the horrible odors we were emitting to escape). He said it picked up all of our leftover food stacked on the seat and retreated. Everyone piled out to find the food missing and plates strewn about, with a path heading into the woods. I said he probably saw a raccoon. He didn’t say anything else and we went to sleep. The next morning, we did go over to the hill to look for tracks and found nothing. We went down the hill and tried to walk and run up it. None of us could do so without using handholds and stumbling every few steps. All of us were in good shape, young and played sports actively. We were perplexed but shrugged it off like the teenagers we were and went about our day. Everyone went home the following day.</p> <p>The next summer, three of us went back and camped in the valley. We spent the day exploring the log cabin (we did find two bedding areas inside, but no idea what made them), caves and trails. We went rock climbing. We had a great time. When we came back to where our cars were parked, one of the cars had been spun around and moved a good 20 feet away from where it had been parked. There were large scuff marks all over the ground, but no foot prints and no detail. We chalked it up to locals being jerks, though we’d neither seen nor heard anyone in the area. We then set up a 3 man tent, cooked dinner and sat in the cool creek water to relax. About 1AM or so, we all went to bed in the tent. Very shortly afterwards, both of my friends were snoring when I heard distinct footfalls above us at the top of the valley. I then heard the sound of something sliding down the valley wall. Each slide (4 in total that I recall) came with a several minute pause in between. It took a good 30 minutes or more for this sliding creature to reach the valley floor. Once at the valley floor, all was silent until I heard two distinct splashes in the creek (it would have taken me 4-5 steps to cross the creek). Whoever or whatever this was, it was now in our camp. I could hear occasional rustling sounds, followed by silence, then more rustling. Eventually a cooler was knocked over and dead silence filled the camp. It was then I realized I’d heard nothing but this creature making noise and the babbling of the creek for about an hour. I heard the footfalls leave the fire ring and circle our tent. The footfalls stopped directly behind my head. My heart was in my throat and I had my eyes closed. I distinctly remember thinking “F___ it” and opening my eyes and looking up through the rain fly. There was a massive head looking down at me. I could see no detail, eyeshine, hair or anything else. It was just a massive head. The moment I opened my eyes, the head moved backwards and out of view. I never heard it leave camp but did hear it climbing back up the valley wall. Once it left, the normal night sounds came back and the fear subsided. I stayed awake until one of my friends moved. I woke him up and told him what happened. It was my turn to be told I was dreaming or mistaken. I did check for footprints and sign the next day and could see the slide marks down the valley wall but nothing else. I don’t recall that we found anything missing. I tried to look in the rain fly like the head the night before. I would need to be about a half foot taller to do so comfortably. I am 5’9” and this person would have need to be at least 6’5” to look directly down at me. I could almost look straight down but had to lean on the tent to do so. Whoever the head belonged to, they were not leaning forward onto the tent. We stayed a couple more days without incident and then went home.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Jason who had an encounter a year ago in Kentucky. He says “We were out in this field and quite a distance away I saw what I thought was a big dog walking on all fours then it stood up. It was looking right at us and started throwing a tantrum. It threw it’s arms in the air and started waving them like it was frustrated. The creature then started pacing back and forth. It did not look like it was eating well. The creature then walked into the wood line and I thought it was gone. The creature stepped back out of the wood line and started picking up clumps of dirt and throwing it in our direction. The creature was not really that big, maybe 6 feet tall. Prior to all of this we found human-like tracks and just brushed it off as someone walking around without shoes on, which made no sense but if you do not believe in Sasquatch what other conclusion could you come to?”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Due to my grandmother passing away I am posting a replay of my show with Bob Garrett. I will be back tomorrow night posting some Members show. Look for that tomorrow night. I hate doing replays but I want to thank the audience for understanding.</p> <p>In Part Two of my discussion with Bob we talk about some of the behaviors that he witnessed from Sasquatch, as well as some of the stranger things he experienced while out in the woods. Sometimes fact is stranger than fiction. I discussed with Bob some witness reports on the show and get his take. Bob spent years living off of the land and in the mountains as a gold miner. We were chatting about a lot of things Sasquatch related, we were discussing past guests, I have had on the show to get his opinion on the creatures behavior. I told Bob “it would be great to do a show talking about encounters you had in the beginning, when you were mining and living off of the land, before you really knew about these creatures and behaviors you witnessed.” Bob shared with me some of the best encounters I have ever heard. Bob also shared with me encounters that other miners had in the area. Bob talked about how the Sasquatches in Colorado are different than the ones in Texas. We discussed not only the physical characteristics but also the behaviors between the two. I am still thinking about some of the stuff he shared with me. Some of the encounters might surprise you. Sometimes it is important to go back and discuss why you got into this field before the days of the online Bigfoot world.</p> <p>If you have had an encounter email me wes@sasquatchchronicles.com</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to my grandmother passing away I am posting a replay of my show with Bob Garrett. I will be back tomorrow night posting some Members show. Look for that tomorrow night. I hate doing replays but I want to thank the audience for understanding.</p> <p>In Part Two of my discussion with Bob we talk about some of the behaviors that he witnessed from Sasquatch, as well as some of the stranger things he experienced while out in the woods. Sometimes fact is stranger than fiction. I discussed with Bob some witness reports on the show and get his take. Bob spent years living off of the land and in the mountains as a gold miner. We were chatting about a lot of things Sasquatch related, we were discussing past guests, I have had on the show to get his opinion on the creatures behavior. I told Bob “it would be great to do a show talking about encounters you had in the beginning, when you were mining and living off of the land, before you really knew about these creatures and behaviors you witnessed.” Bob shared with me some of the best encounters I have ever heard. Bob also shared with me encounters that other miners had in the area. Bob talked about how the Sasquatches in Colorado are different than the ones in Texas. We discussed not only the physical characteristics but also the behaviors between the two. I am still thinking about some of the stuff he shared with me. Some of the encounters might surprise you.

There was so much damage, I just could not figure out why someone would do that. I heard some strange vocalizations and decided to head back to my 4-wheeler, when I got to the 4-wheeler it had been flipped over.I just left the 4-wheeler moments prior.</p> <p>I was able to flip my 4-wheeler back up and that is when the rock throwing started. I raced out of there. I told my father what happened and he told me that he had been chased out of that area by something big, black and on two legs.</p> <p>Years later I had a visual sighting and I was not the only person who saw it. It looked like a large gorilla on the hill. He just stood there and watched us, finally it turned and walked over the hill.....it was weird"</p> <p> </p> <p>Luke also joins the show and shares a very strange late night encounter.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A farmer (now deceased) who lived on Elkins Creek in Georgia called the police to report disturbances on his rural homestead. For several weeks, something had been frequenting his property. Strange noises were heard and eventually livestock and pet dogs went missing. Whatever it was would bang on the outside of his trailer in the dead of night.</p> <p>Eventually, the man had his barn door ripped off its hinges when something was apparently trying to raid his corncrib. He called the authorities once again to report the vandalism. A deputy named James P. Akin was dispatched to look into the matter. Deputy Akin suspected local moonshiners were trying to discourage the man from living at the property.</p> <p>The farmer told Deputy Akin that he knew what was doing the damage, and showed the officer five huge footprints along the banks of Elkins Creek. Though all five prints were clear, four of them were totally submerged in the water of the creek. One, however, was in the fine silt next to the water’s edge and was still in excellent condition.</p> <p>Tonight I speak with the now retired Deputy Jim Akin who will give us some real insight on what was going on the witness' property. Jim shares a lot of strange and creepy behavior the creature was doing on and around the farmer's property. At the time, Deputy Akin did not believe in Sasquatch and felt that if there was a 1% chance it was real, it was in the Pacific NW. He found it hard to believe that a creature like this may be alive and well in Pike County, Georgia...</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Zach who had an encounter in Lake County, Michigan. He did not believe in Sasquatch and came face to face with the creature just a few years ago. The hunter says “It was about 4:30pm and was starting to get dark, I was on top of this hill when I saw what I thought was a bear coming up the hill. The creature was on two legs and walking like a man. Immediately I knew it was not a bear. This creature was HUGE and was built like a bodybuilder. The creature made it up to the top of where I was at in like 6-8 steps and he smelled horrible. The creature started sniffing the air and we made eye contact, he looked right at me. He did not have any whites to his eyes it was more yellow almost like you would see in someone who has jaundice. The creature then turned and walked off in the opposite direction. My heart was pounding and I waited several minutes to make sure he was gone and I started to make my way back to my vehicle and that is when I heard a scream off in the distance. I have never heard anything like that before in my life. I got to my vehicle and started throwing up.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I speak with two guests. My first guest shares with us three separate incidents that happened to him. The first guest writes "Brown County State Park, east of Nashville, Indiana spring of 1990. I was operating a crane during a change-out at Otis Elevator in Bloomington, Indiana 7   12 hour shifts for 2 weeks.   My cousin was getting married in Columbus the next day and I was going to stay in Columbus, go to the wedding, then back to Otis for the last half of my shift. About 1-1:30 am I was coming to the entrance to the state park, in the middle of the road a guy was doing jumping jacks trying to get me to stop.  I pulled over, pulled out my Rugar 10-22 just in case and stepped out of the van. Something was on the north side of the road about 30 ft. up. This guy was scared to death, I jumped back in the van, unlocked the door and he dove in. We were being pelted with good size rocks. The guy had crapped his pants and I don't blame him.   In the rear view we could see the silhouette of this thing, it was big and pissed.   We stopped at the gas station about a mile east and he changed into a pair of sweats I had in the back.  We did not go back to check out what the thing was or if it was still there." I will also be speaking to Tony who is a truck driver and had an encounter while on the job. He will talk about some recent sightings that he just had and talks a little bit about his research. Tony saw a creature on two legs running a long the highway.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be speaking to Warren who is a tribal member from British Columbia. He was in the middle of nowhere on construction site and was working the night shift repairing the roads. He walked up to use the porta potty and thought one of his co-workers were walking up to scare him. He stepped out of the porta potty and hid in the bushes to get the jump on his co-worker when he jumped out to scare him he was face to face with a Sasquatch. Warren was just a few feet away from the creature. He said it vocalized at him in almost an irritated sound. It was a very cold night and he was so close he could see the hot air come out of its mouth. He describes the creatures eyes as having an amber color reflecting back from the moonlight. Warren said "I am 6'5 with my work boots on and this thing towered above me. We sat and looked at each other for what seemed like forever than the creature turned and walked away into the treeline. I heard it break a huge branch with its hands, I ran for my life." The encounter upset Warren so much that he quit that job the next day.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Norman who is from GA who had a daytime road crossing. He was heading home on a back country road when a Sasquatch crossed in front of him. Norman says "This thing only took 3 steps to get across a two lane highway."</p>]]></description>

Albert Ostman (died 1975) was a Canadian prospector who reported that he was abducted by a Sasquatch and held captive for six days. He stated that the event took place near Toba Inlet, British Columbia in 1924. On August 20, 1957, police magistrate A.M. Naismith wrote an affidavit which states "...I found Mr. Ostman to be a man of sixty-four years of age; in full possession of his mental faculties. Of pleasant manner and with a good sense of humor. I questioned Mr. Ostman thoroughly in reference to the story given by Mr. Green. I cross-examined him and used every means to endeavor to find a flaw in either his personality or his story, but could find neither..."Albert Ostman also signed a Solemn Declaration indicating that his account of the Sasquatch story was true under oath and by virtue of the Canadian Evidence Act.</p>]]></description>

The men were in a remote location in Colorado and were out shooting targets when a very large ape-like creature stepped out of the bushes and was growling, screaming and showing its teeth. David describes what the creature looked like and describes the bushes around him exploding with other creatures screaming at them. David took up a defensive position and started firing while his cousin ran back to get the truck. You will not want to miss this one. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>"I am a police officer and I had an encounter (an aggressive one ) as an 11 year old in 1994 inside the border of the smokey mountain national park. I was on a camping trip with my family and a group of friends consisting of 5 other boys and my younger sister and brother. We were hiking a trail (a rather remote difficult one as I recall) I was temporarily separated from the group to tie my shoes and as they rounded a bend in the trail I looked to my right (down hill) and observed what in my mind at the time was a HUGE gorilla standing only about 50 ft from me . When it observed me observing it it immediately bounded up hill and onto the trail ahead of me cutting me off. I cannot describe how terrified I was.In an attempt to get away my instinct and I don’t really know why was to go uphill and around to where I could yell down at my friends. I felt like if I stayed were I was I’d be killed! So began about a 3 hour ordeal in which I effectively was lost. People began to search for me. The whole time I walked along a ridge line above the trail occasionally hiding from this thing. The entire time it shadowed me. When I would stop it would stop . I did not have a “visual” of it most of the time and only actually saw it from the shoulders up 1 time after my initial sighting. I feel like it was attempting to “herd” me away from safety. I was finally able to walk back onto the trail after 3 hours but only after I heard it farther and farther away and above me. It was raining by this time and I was a total mess completely terrified and exhausted."</p> <p>If you have had an encounter email me wes@sasquatchchronicles.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>"I have a story in my past that I have never told except to my Dad and best friend, either of whom ever believed me until this week. My best childhood friend called me this week and said" Remember that weird story you told me about the Chewbacca Man? Well I believe you now buddy!" He had an encounter this past weekend in East Texas and for some reason he's a believer now! Let me explain. When I was about 11 years old. My Dad was a land developer in east Texas around Toledo Bend and Sam Rayburn Reservoir. He would buy lake side plots of land and get a surveyor to break it down and Dad would sell the lots. He developed a few campgrounds this way. I grew up in a small town in Deep east Texas around the Sabine and Angelina National Forest just above the Big Thicket. Every so often my Dad would go see the surveyor to discuss business. Mr. W, the surveyor had his office in a small building beside his house.The surveyors house was way outside of town down a FM road in the Sabine National forest. Dad would ask me to come along sometimes because the surveyor had a son about my age. The boy's name was Tommy James "TJ". He was really a couple of years younger than me but Dad just thought I would like to come along for the ride. Mr. W and my dad would discuss land and I would go play with TJ. At this time I think I was 11 and TJ was 9. TJ had a dirt pile in his back yard we usually played in. We were playing and TJ suddenly said " There's a Chewbacca man that lives down that trail there", pointing to a thin trail in the back left corner of his back yard. "Do you wanna see it?", TJ said. I said "Chewbacca lives back there?" "Yes" TJ said, "He's a Chewbacca man."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be speaking to Chris who was with the Indian tribal police for many years. Indian tribal police are peace officers hired by those Native American tribes which have a constitutional government on reservations, as opposed to hereditary chiefs. I spoke to him yesterday and he is going to come on the show and talk about some of the calls he received while on duty regarding Sasquatch. Chris still investigates reports today and is going to share some of those encounter stories as well.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to the father of the son who had an encounter just a few weeks ago. His son is still upset over the encounter below and who can blame him. The report goes as follows: "My 15 year old son and his friend had left the camp to head down to the lake. As they were standing by the lake they heard something come down off of the ridge-line, my son turned around and was about 30 feet away from what he describes as an ape. The boys came running into camp, both white as ghosts. My son and his friend demanded that we leave. They were both in shock and shaking. I was finally able to calm them down enough to have them explain what happen. The boys said as they turned around they saw this HUGE thing staring at them. My son said it was taller then the basketball player Lebron James. Its head was round like a watermelon, his nose was flat and wide. The jaw on the creature was really wide, It was built like a bodybuilder. The creature was massive and ape-like in appearance. The boys said this thing just stood there starring at them. What has me puzzled is we have seen bear, cougar and the normal wildlife but both boys said it was ape-like.They were both terrified and shaking. After seeing the boys reaction and how upset both boys still are I really think they saw something. My son says he doesn't want to ever go in the woods again and wishes he would have never seen it."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Some in the bigfoot community feel that Sasquatch are the Nephilim. I decided to do a show on the Nephilim which was SC EP:112. I feel like that show gave a clear picture of what the Nephilim were and how they did not fit into the Sasquatch topic. One of the topics in Gary's book was secret societies. I wanted to invite Gary back to the show to discuss this as we ran out of time in EP:112.</p> <p>I want to thank the audience for allowing me to go off of the Sasquatch topic to finish this discussion. I will return next week on topic of the Sasquatch.</p> <p>My guest tonight is Gary Wayne, author of "The Genesis 6 Conspiracy: How Secret Societies and the Descendants of Giants Plan to Enslave Humankind." There are giants among us, passing largely unnoticed, intent on carrying out a secret plan to enslave all humanity. They may not look like giants today, but their bloodlines extend all the way back to the Nephilim—the offspring of angels who mated with human women—described in Genesis 6 when giants roamed the land.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Rocky Elmore, a retired United States Border Patrol Agent, is our guest tonight, and he shared with me a scary Sasquatch encounter he was involved in. The agents were tracking illegal aliens coming across the border when the agents were told that a “large predator” was tracking them and the commander was watching this creature through the scope. A command was given that all agents were to return to their vehicles. Later he was told by his supervisor "I do not know what it was but it was bi-pedal,it walked like a man but was not a man and it was giant compared to the rest of the agents.....it was stalking you guys and matching you step for step." The Supervisor was afraid that this "thing" was going to harm the agents that's why he told everyone to return to their vehicles.</p> <p>Rocky also ran into some employees of The Bureau of Land Management in a very remote location. Rocky says "I came up on these employees who were with the The Bureau of Land Management. I asked if this was an area where Sasquatch can be found. I just had my encounter and I said it in a joking way so that they could not make fun of me. To my surprise one of them said......yes they are up here, we have been tracking a group from Otay Mountain down through the wilderness and we think they are traveling with younger ones because we found prints of a very small creature along with some very large prints."</p> <p>Rocky also talks about one of his supervisors along with 30-40 illegal aliens being chased up Otay Mountain by a "Monster." Rocky said the descriptions given match that of a Sasquatch. I also ask Rocky about some of the stranger things he has run into while out on patrol and he shared several stories.</p>]]></description>

To my surprise one of them said......yes they are up here, we have been tracking a group from Otay Mountain down through the wilderness and we think they are traveling with younger ones because we found prints of a very small creature along with some very large prints."</p> <p>Rocky also talks about one of his supervisors along with 30-40 illegal aliens being chased up Otay Mountain by a "Monster." Rocky said the descriptions given match that of a Sasquatch. I also ask Rocky about some of the stranger things he has run into while out on patrol and he shared several stories.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I will be speaking to Skip who is from Texas. He shares with us his encounter he had almost 28 years ago. He was at the river with his friend and they decided to pack up and head home. Skip was carrying items back to his car and as he walked up the hill away from the river he says “This big black thing that was covered in hair bursts out of the brush and I watch it run upright…like a man but WAY too fast to be a man. In one leap the creature jumps about 12 feet across the river. My friend walks up because she saw it too and say who…..what….was that?!” Skip is a pastor in Texas and this encounter has always stuck with him.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Jack McCarty who is the author of “<a href= "http://www.amazon.com/Bigfoot-Evidence-I-Cannot-Deny-ebook/dp/B00JVZES9O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440863540&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=JACK+MCCARTY+BIGFOOT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bigfoot Evidence – I Cannot Deny It</a>.” Jack writes “Twenty-three years ago I saw my first Bigfoot footprint in the woods. Ever since then I have studied additional evidence and documented it with photographs and journals. This book is a compilation of my experiences in the forests where Bigfoot lives.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My first guest tonight is Jay. As you listen to tonight’s show take note of the apparent tool use that was reported by the witness. Jay who reported seeing a Sasquatch for almost 45min from his hunting blind, witnessed Sasquatch using a rock to bang on trees and listening for small animals. He also watched the creature use a stick to dig for grubs or smaller insects to eat. Jay’s encounter like others you hear on the show are a major contrast to people who will tell you that Sasquatch has special powers like cloaking and mind speaking. He witnessed what he thought was a bear that ended up being a Sasquatch. The animal got up from sleeping, grabbed a rock and banged on a tree then pushed the tree over to retrieve either a possum or a raccoon. It then smashed the small animal into the tree in order to kill it. The Sasquatch took a bite of the small animal and tore the skin off before consuming it. Jay says “I thought it was an escaped ape from the zoo but as I sat and watched it from my hunting blind, I realized this was no escaped ape from the zoo this was something different…it was man-like but it wasn’t a man…I have never seen anything like this before…”</p> <p>My second guest tonight is Kim who is from Washington State. Imagine moving into a property and while out enjoying the country air, sitting on your porch you see a large ape-like creature running on two legs, crossing right in front of you. The area where the encounter took place has a long history of sightings. I am planning to visit the property to take a look around. When I do I will report back.</p>]]></description>

We were chatting about a lot of things Sasquatch related, we were discussing past guests, I have had on the show to get his opinion on the creatures behavior. I told Bob “it would be great to do a show talking about encounters you had in the beginning, when you were mining and living off of the land, before you really knew about these creatures and behaviors you witnessed.”</p> <p>Bob shared with me some of the best encounters I have ever heard. Bob also shared with me encounters that other miners had in the area. Bob talked about how the Sasquatches in Colorado are different then the ones in Texas. We discussed not only the physical characteristics but also the behaviors between the two. I am still thinking about some of the stuff he shared with me. Some of the encounters might surprise you. Sometimes it is important to go back and discuss why you got into this field before the days of the online Bigfoot world. Join me this Sunday as I sit down and chat with Bob, you will not be disappointed.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Bauman story comes from President Theodore Roosevelt's 1892 book, "The Wilderness Hunter," which describes an encounter between an ape-man and a young frontiersman named Bauman. According to Roosevelt, Bauman and his partner were trapping along a remote stretch of Montana's Wisdom River sometime in the mid-19th century. After building a lean-to and making camp in what seemed like an ideal spot for game, the two men began setting their traps. When they returned, they found their packs had been rummaged and their shanty torn down. Undaunted, the men set about reconstructing their wilderness abode.</p> <p>That night, Bauman was awakened by the sound of rustling and the foul stench of a wild beast. He immediately rose up and fired a shot, and then heard something tearing off through the woods. He and his partner were unnerved by this and decided to abandon the camp at the first light of dawn.</p> <p>Come morning, the two split up so that Bauman could gather the traps while his partner made camp downriver. Sadly, both would not make it home alive. When Bauman arrived at the new campsite, he found his partner sprawled on the ground with his necked snapped and a set of bite marks on his throat. He knew at once that the menacing forest beast was responsible, according to the story. The horrific sight sent him running — rifle in hand — never to return to the spot again. By the time he told his story to Roosevelt, Bauman was a very old man.</p> <p>Tonight I speak to Brian who had a very up close and personal encounter with a Sasquatch as a child. He talks about one of these creatures walking up on him and his friend in the middle of the night, Brian states "It had yellow eyeshine and the hands were like a catchers mitt..."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My guest is Dustin from Missouri and he has had a lot of strange things going on around his property. He has been stalked while hunting by “something” walking bi-pedal. He talks about a time he killed an deer, pulled the gut pile out and ran back to his house to get something and upon returning his gut pile was gone. Dustin stated “I was only gone for 15min max…the gut pile had been picked up and something walked off with it.” Dustin said everything changed the night he saw the creature, he says “it was like a huge hairy bodybuilder……it was pinned down when I saw it and it was almost like it didn’t know if it should run or fight…it had sharp jerky motions, kid of reminded me of a crackhead” Dustin said prior to this sighting he assumed they were a bunch of drunk homeless guys on his property because they would come up and slap the house in the middle of the night. Dustin said “I heard them one night right before they slapped the house and it sounded like a big guy who had a deep voice but was mumbling, I could not make out what he was saying.” Dustin lives in a very rural area, his driveway alone is a quarter of a mile long.</p> <p>Dustin has given up hunting which was a great passion of his, he says “I have never seen anything like this, some things you cannot unsee.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>College instructor Mitchel Townsend reported on his research paper which he believes proves that a Bigfoot-like creature resides in the Mount St. Helens area of Washington state. In 2013, he came upon a stack of deer bones, and noticed they had giant teeth marks notched into them– the markings did not fit any predator profile and were too large to have been made by humans. Further, large footprints with a length of 16 inches were found near the bones. Extrapolating the teeth and footprint measurements, Townsend concluded that the creature is around 8 ½ feet tall, with a wide stride. Mitchel was recently on Coast to Coast talking about his research.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Blake who is a researching in Texas and talks about how he really did not believe in this creature but has always had an interest. All of that changed when he had one vocalize at him. He shares with us his encounter.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I released part one of my interview with Bobby Hamilton, here is part two of my interview.</p> <p>Bobby Hamilton grew up in Garrison and Jacksonville and said he has had encounters with Sasquatch. Hamilton said his first one started in the winter when he was four years-old. “I’m walking in the bedroom with my head down and I hear something scratch the screen and I look up and there is this apish looking thing with an evil grin, because I could see teeth, and it was motioning with his hand for me to come to the window,” Hamilton said. Hamilton believes East Texas is the perfect sport for sightings of the primate because of the wooded areas to hide in and the abundance of fresh water.</p> <p>Hamilton also said he believes the public will soon start seeing more sightings. “We are having more encounters with these things coming up to people’s houses and killing their livestock,” Because their environment is being torn down,” Hamilton said. Bobby Hamilton is a co-founder of the GCBRO. Now a days Bobby spends his free time researching and investigating reports of aggressive Sasquatch’s harassing locals. The GCBRO wants to harvest a body so that they can present real evidence to science and prove that in fact this creature does exists.</p>]]></description>

He never once thought Sasquatch until he stumbled across it by accident. He was within several feet of the creature and he describes it as a gray color and very large. The face has been imprinted in his brain. He talks about the strange things going on around his property and a discussion he had with one of his neighbors. It is interesting to note that the previous renter like to shoot at anything that moved in the woods. The landlord and the neighbor said that the previous renter like to take pop shots into the woods from his back deck until one day he just left in a panic. The landlord had to fix up the property because there was damage inside and out of the home. Inside of the home looked like someone very tall smashed his fist into the ceiling.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I will be speaking with two witnesses, one is a tracker from Canada and has spent many years working in the forest. He was replanting trees and was dropped in to a location by helicopter. He came across some human-like tracks but they were not human. Several years later he came across tracks that looked just like the ones he had seen before so he decided to follow them. He saw movement in the wood line and thought it was a grizzly bear but it was walking on two legs. When he got too close, it whistled in the opposite direction from him and that’s when he decided it was time to go.</p> <p>My second guest had two encounters, one when he was a child and the other encounter was just a few years ago. The more recent encounter involves a shooting incident. The men thought they were shooting a bear until it stood up. The witness describes gorilla like behavior from the creature.</p> <p>I will also be discussing the police officer incident in Texas.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My guest tonight is Carol from New Hampshire, she did not believe in Bigfoot. She has lived on her property for 20 years and noticed a lot of strange activity over the years. While living alone she witnesses “something” looking in her bedroom window.</p> <p>She describes in full detail what she saw, she said that she was scared and looked away from the window and when she looked back it was gone.</p> <p>Years later her child came screaming out of that room saying “there was a monster tapping on the window” assuming it was over imagination of a child she thought nothing of it. Her daughter would continue to say “it” was tapping on her window. It was not until Carol experienced the creature tapping on a window that she realized something was going on. Carol thought she was going crazy and went to talk to her neighbors. Her neighbors have their property lit up with flood lights at night. The husband said that “something” keeps tapping on their windows at night and items from their yard keep coming up missing. Carol commented to her neighbors “maybe it was a bear?” to which the husband replied “It was no bear.” The wife said that she has seen “it” late at night, when she is pulling into their driveway.</p> <p>Carol realized that she is not crazy and that they have Sasquatch in New Hampshire. She shares with us some of the strange encounters and experienced that she has witnessed over the years.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Some in the bigfoot community feel that Sasquatch are the Nephilim. I decided to do a show on the Nephilim. Once we have a clear picture of what the Nephilim were we can look at the facts and decide if it fits into the Sasquatch topic.</p> <p>My guest tonight is Gary Wayne, author of "The Genesis 6 Conspiracy: How Secret Societies and the Descendants of Giants Plan to Enslave Humankind." There are giants among us, passing largely unnoticed, intent on carrying out a secret plan to enslave all humanity. They may not look like giants today, but their bloodlines extend all the way back to the Nephilim—the offspring of angels who mated with human women—described in Genesis 6 when giants roamed the land. Gary Wayne, author of The Genesis 6 Conspiracy: How Secret Societies and the Descendants of Giants Plan to Enslave Humankind, details the role of modern-day Nephilim in Satan’s plan to install the Antichrist at the End of Days.</p> <p>When God cast the angel Lucifer and his followers out of heaven, Lucifer set into motion a scheme to ensure the Nephilim survived. Why? Because from the bloodlines of these Nephilim the Antichrist will come. To keep his plan alive, Satan has enlisted the loyalty of secret societies such as the Freemasons, the Templars, and the Rosicrucians to conspire in teaching a theology and a history of the world that is contrary to the biblical one.</p> <p>The Bible, along with many other ancient sources, clearly records the existence of giants. Wayne provides copious citations from many society insiders, along with extensive Bible references, other religious references, and historical material to bolster his contention. What he uncovers will astonish you.</p> <p>Click <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/The-Genesis-Conspiracy-Societies-Descendants/dp/1632692902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a> to check out Gary's book "The Genesis 6 Conspiracy: How Secret Societies and the Descendants of Giants Plan to Enslave Humankind"</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Many encounters with Sasquatch happen so fast, it leaves people thinking “What was that?”</p> <p>One of the encounters on Sunday will be with a witness who saw one run across the road, jump and clear a 6 foot embankment. The witness and her husband were shocked by the size of the creature. The witness describes how the creature moved on all fours and the “hair” on the body.</p> <p>The second witness writes “My boyfriend and I were living about 10 miles east of Huntsville, Texas on a private property with three lakes in the Big Thicket. One night my boyfriend asked me to go get his wallet out of my truck that was parked just below the deck. I immediately had a very uneasy feeling like never before??? I asked him to go instead. He said he would stand on the deck and watch since he did not have his shoes on. I have never been afraid of the dark since it was around 9PM. I finally agreed and walked down to my truck. As my hand grabbed the door, the truck began to vibrate and shake like a 7.2 earthquake!! I was immediately paralyzed but managed to let out a blood curtailing scream as I saw a giant hairy blob jump out of the back of my truck. It seemed to fly all the way across the railroad tracks. This creature filled the entire bed of the truck and I was about one foot from it! My eyes were looking but my body was frozen. I never thought Bigfoot or Sasquatch. We thought it may have been a bear but there were never any sightings of bears there although my boyfriend had mentioned he had tossed his left over hamburger in the bed. We looked for tracks but I explained to my boyfriend that it seems to fly all the way across the railroad tracks landing on the other side.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes, “I still have a hard time understanding what happened to me. I was charged after being hit with a baseball sized rock, after I fell down by my truck it came over the bed of my truck I was able to pull my pistol and shot it over the left eye and it ran away but continued to throw rocks. My encounter is much more than I can write in an email……”</p> <p>I spoke to the gentleman this morning and he has agreed to come on the show. I find him to be a very credible witness and some of the behaviors he describes I have heard first hand but have not talked about on the show. He was hunting and a rock hit him in the chest, the witness describes how the creature threw the rock which is very interesting because I have heard this “off the air” several times. He caught sight of the creature and ran for his truck. When he got to his truck he threw his rifle in the back and dropped his keys. The witness was upset, shaking and fell to the ground. The creature cleared a distance of 75 yards in a matter of seconds and was now on the other side of his truck. The creature came over the bed of his truck and was within a few feet of him. He describes in detail what it looked like. He said the creature kept screaming at him and was moving closer. He pulled out his pistol and shot it right above its left eye. The caliber he was using was not enough to penetrate the skull but he knows he hit it. He said that the creature let out another scream and ran off. He was able to get into his truck and drive off. As he was driving a soccer ball sized rock hit the rear panel of his truck. As you can imagine the witness still struggles with what happened to him to this day.</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I speak with Randy Harrington, and he had one of the best close-up encounters you’ll ever hear. After setting up a fake camp site to attract Bigfoot, Harrington hid in his truck. When the creatures stepped out of the woods and approached the site, it decided to check out the vehicle where Harrington was hiding with his video camera and a handgun. He said he heard and saw the creatures rummaging through stuff in the back of the truck.</p> <p>Randy has been studying the behavior of these creatures for many years and has put together a picture of what they do and why. I have to say a lot of what Randy theorizes about their behavior makes a lot of sense. Randy will also be giving us an update on the Falcon Project.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My guest tonight is “MT” from Washington State. He was a school teacher for many years and always worked for the state wildlife services before he was fired for coming forward with his encounter. He says, “I made the mistake of telling some of my co-workers about my encounter, I was fired afterwards without any reason and was blackballed from the industry...”</p> <p>MT goes on to explain what he saw... “When I had my close up sighting of the bigfoot that was over 11 feet tall up near Mt. Rainier National Park, just west of Ashford, Washington, you could see the muscles bulging beneath the short fur covering as the creature reached up to move the branch from in front of its face as it walked into the woods… also, that the creature was truly of gigantic stature. If you saw the movie Prometheus with the gigantic humanoid aliens, my Bigfoot was about the same build. It was nothing but muscle and hair.</p> <p>I tell people that it resembled a silver back gorilla crossed with an Olympic athlete (summer track events), crossed with a giant. It looked like a tall person crossing the road… and the arms were not down almost to the knees like a lot of people say… it had the perfect human proportions a tall athletic man… except for the huge hump of muscles across the shoulders behind the head, and that the ear seemed to be in the wrong location on the side of the head for a human and looked more like where it would be on a big silver back gorilla.”</p> <p> </p> <p>If you have had an encounter and would like to be on the show, send me an email at wes@sasquatchchronicles.com.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I speak to a professional game hunter with over 40 years of experience in tracking and hunting wildlife. David said, "I was trying out a new call to call in a predator and I saw what looked like a bear coming in on four legs about 400 yards out. It was coming right to me. At about 200 yards I realized this was not a bear, at 100 yards this thing stopped, smelled the air and stood up on two legs....I focused on it with my scope...I have a very detailed description on what I saw and I am not sure this was a Bigfoot I think it was something else.."</p> <p>I also will be speaking to a gentleman who grow up around a property that had many strange encounters. He says that the family would find dead animals around the property like a bobcat that had been ripped in half. He would find strange tracks. One night they found out what was making the tracks and killing the local wildlife when a creature came to his back door. The same night the mother had an encounter on her way home from work.</p> <p>My last guest is Tara, who had two separate encounters but the one that has stuck with her is when she was at her husband's grandparents' for the weekend. She was taking a bath when she noticed a figure watching her from the window. She thought it was her husband playing a joke but soon realized it was NOT her husband and that the window where she saw the figure was 8 feet off of the ground.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the late 1960’s a creature simply known as the “Abominable Chicken Man” had been reported on a farm west of Oklahoma City near El Reno. According to the Oklahoma Journal, a farmer found the door to his chicken coop ripped off and lying on the ground. On the surface of the door and inside the coop itself were strange hand prints about seven inches long and five inches wide. When he saw that several of his chickens had disappeared without a trace, he called the local state game ranger. The door was shipped to zoologist Lawrence Curtis, director of the Oklahoma City Zoo. After a study that included comparisons with the hand and paw prints of human beings, apes, monkeys, bears and other animals, Curtis confessed his bafflement. “I don’t know what this is,” he said. “It resembles a gorilla but it’s more like a man.” According to Curtis the creature’s thumb crooks inward as if deformed or injured.</p> <p>I will be speaking with a law enforcement officer who has had his own run ins with Sasquatch. He says in several parts of Oklahoma, the locals still call this creature the Chicken Man because of the incident that took place back in the 1960’s and 70’s. It is interesting how around the U.S. everyone calls this creature Bigfoot or Sasquatch, but in the Midwest and in the South the locals who have been seeing these creatures for a long time give them names based on what they observe them doing, like “Corn Man”, “Chicken Man”, “Night Stalker” and “Wild Man”. The list goes on and on with local names. The Chicken Man Incident is an interesting case because so much physical evidence was left behind and was examined. Locals in the area would report seeing a large upright orangutan like creature harassing and killing their livestock.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I speak with several witnesses who had encounters with Sasquatch. One of the topics tonight is lights in the forest. What are people seeing? What is being described? While I do not think the lights and bigfoot are related, it is interesting to note what people are seeing. The first witness is Mike who talks about his fish coming up missing and then seeing a creature step out of the forest to look at him.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Patterson–Gimlin film is a famous short motion picture of an unidentified subject the film makers purported to be a "Bigfoot", that was supposedly filmed on October 20, 1967, by Roger Patterson and Robert "Bob" Gimlin on Bluff Creek, a tributary of the Klamath River about 25 road miles north-west of Orleans, California. The film has been subjected to many attempts both to debunk and authenticate it.</p> <p>Both Patterson and Gimlin have always insisted they encountered and filmed a real Bigfoot, not a man in a costume. Patterson died of cancer in 1972. Patterson's friend, Gimlin, has always denied being involved in any part of a hoax with Patterson. Gimlin mostly avoided publicly discussing the subject from at least the early 1970s until about 2003. Tonight we will discuss the events around the film and what lead up to the famous encounter.</p>]]></description>

The children were playing and Mo looked up to see a figure just outside of the treeline watching them. When the creature and Mo made eye contact the creature then backed up into the brush. Mo, terrified for their safety, quickly left the area with his kids. This day has haunted him since. Mo continues to look for the creature he saw that day.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Happy Holidays everyone! This week we have a two-part show. We have an "insider" who will be coming on to share his encounter and knowledge of some government emails he came across between the U.S. Department of the Interior and The Bureau of Land Management. I have asked him to change his story about how he acquired the emails because I want to keep him as a contact. He will share as much as he can without giving away his identity. No it's not Mr. Black, a lot of what he has to say is shocking. The first part of the show will focus on a property he lived on where this creature was killing everything it could, and the harassment towards his family that followed. This is part one of the interview!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bigfoot witness-turned-researcher, Todd M. Neiss, has been an active investigator for more than 20 years. Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, he grew up hearing of these legendary creatures, alternately known as Bigfoot or Sasquatch, but gave it little credibility beyond that of Native American lore or a good old-fashioned campfire tale designed to frighten young campers.</p> <p>All of that changed for Todd in the spring of 1993.</p> <p>As a Sergeant in the Army's 1249th Combat Engineer Battalion, he came face to face with three of the elusive beasts in the temperate rain forest of Oregon's Coast Range while conducting high-explosives training. His sighting was independently corroborated by three fellow soldiers who also witnessed the creatures.</p> <p>We will also include an interview with an aggressive Sasquatch a man had in Colorado. This encounter borders just short of an attack.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Shane Corson, Woody and I sit down and interview Dr. John A. Bindernagel. Dr. Bindernagel is a wildlife biologist who has sought evidence for Bigfoot since 1963. He published a book in 1998 entitled "North America's Great Ape: the Sasquatch." Dr. Bindernagel grew up in Ontario, attended the University of Guelph and received a PhD in Biology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He moved to British Columbia in 1975 largely because the region was a hot spot for Bigfoot sightings. Over the years, he has collected casts of tracks that he believes belongs to Bigfoot. He also claims to have heard the creature near Comox Lake in 1992, comparing its whooping sound to that of a chimpanzee. Bindernagel believes that the Bigfoot phenomena should receive more attention from serious scientists, but has remarked, "The evidence doesn't get scrutinized objectively. We can't bring the evidence to our colleagues because it's perceived as tabloid."</p> <p>We also interview Peter Byrne who has led the life most of us can only dream about. Share his many adventures in India with tiger, elephant, and leopard, and see how a fortuitous championing of a member of the ruling elite of Nepal during a bar brawl prompted Peter to move to Nepal and become a professional hunter there. Move with him to Nepal where he was, for years, the only authorized professional hunter to operate in that country. In the unspoiled wilderness of the White Grass Plains area of Nepal, where there were virtually no roads and the natives did not even know the name of the capital of the country.</p> <p>The final interview was with Rhettman A. Mullis, Jr., PhD-ABD, CAF, MHP (USA), Academic and Field Researcher, Founder and Lead Researcher for "Sasquatch Investigations and Research: Bigfoot and Bigfootology," and Contributing Writer and Editor: Bigfootology.</p>]]></description>

After the scream from behind us I had made the fire real big and after about an hour of it circling us we started running out of the two day supply of wood we had collected so I had to get more. My oldest when telling the story of him holding the flash light for me thinks its very funny to tell how scared I was that I brought back a whole dead tree to burn in the fire. I did too, I had kept the fire raging about five feet in the air the whole time and a shotgun in my lap. By about three hours I had made a couple of runs around us and pulled back large dead trees to burn and I am not going to lie I was scared as hell with this thing circling us like it was...."</p> <p> </p> <p>The account goes on to describe "Jibber/Chatter" and the creature returning with several other creatures.</p> <p>The night isn't over yet... it has barely begun...</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes, "It was getting dark and grandma was cleaning up dinner and she called us to stop playing and come in close to the camper-trailer. Grandpa came running around the truck and he was screaming and yelling for us to get in side. Grandpa was moving fast, I have never seen him move like that before. He ran into the camper came out with his shotgun, and he jumped out of the camper, cocked his gun, screamed to my Grandma to get us in the camper, and lock the door. I do believe Grandma saw what Grandpa was yelling about. She garbed us and threw us in the camper then put us in the back of the camper on the top bunk and covered us up with a blanket. well that is where the screaming came in because what ever it was it grabbed our camper right where me and my sister were and it was screaming and we were screaming. It was only inches from us but above us and we could hear it screaming in our chest, we stayed under the blanket. It started to push us over or push us into the lake. The camper started to move forward as it was rocking back and forth and it was grandpa driving us out of there and saving us. I do believe it was trying to hold on the the camper as we pulled away. Grandpa was driving quite fast to get out of the area. It took for ever to get out of there it was a long dirt road. When we got to the small store He got out called for help and Grandpa told the men that were there what had happened to us and he showed them the camper and the two hand prints where it was hanging on to us as we pulled away. we left everything there grandma did not want to go back and get our stuff we just went home."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>"Back in 2009 I was a sergeant over the K9 unit which consisted of five handler/dog. (location removed) is about five hours away from (location removed) and the two guys were allowed to drive home on Friday nights to spend time with their families on the weekends. They each were issued a Chevrolet Tahoe to patrol and carry each of their dogs. When they are away from (location removed), their radios don't hit the radio tower, but they can still speak to each other car to car, so long they are in close proximity to each other. One Friday night during the six week school they were driving home when the lead officer said something large and black ran towards the side of his Tahoe from the shoulder/ditch area and he thought it was gonna strike the side of the Tahoe but it suddenly cut sharply and started pacing his unit for a short distance as it ran along side him. He said it was on all fours but was no cow or horse, but was as large as one. He soon outran it, and called on the radio to the officer that was following closely behind him and asked him "what was that?!" the trailing officer replied "I don't know!" and although it was strange they didn't get a good look at it and both laughed it off. They only know for sure that it wasn't a horse or a bull. I asked them how fast they were going and the lead officer said "we were hauling ass trying to get home, 80-85 mph, it was late at night already!" this happened on a deserted stretch of highway between (location removed) and (location removed), lots of deer. Neither officer works for us anymore, but the lead officer is my best friend now and is a sergeant at a nearby agency, the other officer is now a narcotics agent for another nearby agency. "</p>]]></description>

"There came a smell on the wind that we knew well. We had smelled it many times. We had a Sasquatch near by. I could hear some moving around behind the camp. It was coming closer to us! But that was ok, we had this happen before. There was a row of eight to ten inches round pines right next to my right side. Those pines began to shake as something was coming through them right at me! The screams were making my ears ring. I saw huge hands coming right for my head and so I dropped to one knee and put my shotgun in this enraged Sasquatches middle. I was about to shoot this thing, but it backed off quickly"  </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener contacted the show to share several creepy Sasquatch encounters his family had on their farm. Here is a small portion of what he wrote "My grandparents had gotten a small house and lived outside of town.They used a camper as a chicken coup and had a massive, and I mean massive guard dog. It had a large chain attached to the camper to protect the chickens. My uncle claims he felt something wasn't right, he just felt very, very scared. When out of nowhere, everyone smelled a horrible skunk like odor and the dog went berserk. The dog was barking up a storm and just went crazy.  About seven minutes or so after the dog had started barking, this massive, loud, bone shattering cry woke all the kids up and scared the life out of my grandmother. It's hard to describe this sound according to my father and his siblings it was like a semi roar, that was deep at first but got higher in pitch a sound no human could make, and it was very long, vocally speaking. The dog was so scared that it yelped and went under the camper. There was a dead silence, but everyone allegedly heard the dog's chain being forced against the concrete/ground, as if being pulled out from under the camper.  The next morning, the family went outside to look around and what they saw really tore them up. The dog was gone, all that was left was the skin of it's back and all of the chickens were gone too. I personally believe it was a family group that attacked the house. Because my uncle, aunt and grandmother saw one staring at them all within seconds of each other, at different spots of the house. I think the house was surrounded, as well as multiple ones carrying off all the chickens and the dog."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener wrote the show "My friends and I were chased out of the woods by one when we were twelve. This happened in Georgia, in 1974. We were back in the swampy, sandy creek bottom, and were going to make a fort out of the bamboo that grew there. The first thing that happened is that the woods got completely silent - the birds and tree frogs had stopped their chirping. Then we heard a branch snap about 20 yards behind us in the dense brush. We thought to ourselves, what if some crazy guy with a knife was about to off us all, so we started to file out of there, when we heard this wild animal scream behind us, and could hear the footfalls running towards us. None of us ( about five of us ) saw it because we all tore out of there as fast as we could. We had to run up this ridge and follow it out to the subdivision. We got back over to our culdesac, and discussed what it was that chased us out. We had seen The Legend of Boggy Creek a year before, so I guess that's why we settled on Bigfoot as the likely explanation. To make a long story short, in the next four months ( this happened in February ) we got to see one adult, about a seven footer and two juveniles, all three of which came up behind our houses on the culdesac , each on a separate occasion. I would love to chat with you guys about all my experiences and about the subject in general."</p> <p>We will also be talking to Justin Steely, director of the new film "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2623946/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">Hunting the Legend</a>"</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Wynn who is Native American and lives in western Montana describes many encounters they had with what they call the "Hairy Man" on the reservation including a savage attack on a tribal member. Wynn writes "I live on a reservation and the population of Native American to White/other is about 50/50. My father is a tribal member and my mother is not.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A listener wrote the show who has had several experiences around Yacolt Mountain AKA Muppet Mountain. He says, "I have just recently found this broadcast and it is terrific. I have been listening to the older shows now, recent ones to say. I think it was in number 10 you mentioned the woman hiker that vanished in the Gifford. I wanted to share that I too have seen many things out there and I have been to the forest at least once every 2 months. I have seen many large signs about this woman who "Disappeared". If I had to bet the farm, I think you know what I think, too..The summer of 2009 I accidently ran into one of these mountain men. I say accident because When I am out I am in complete Camo and face paint and such. I was wearking wooldland digital camo and walking down a road at about 3 pm. I walked right up to this this by chance and it was about 20 feet from me. I am unsure but something tells me it could not see me?. Since I was in all digital camo and blended right in. It was odd because once it seen me and I seen it we both froze.Too its right was the shoulder of the road and a 8 foot hill leading up into the forest, it turned and in on leap, jump?., Hop?. it was up that 8 foot hill and crashing through the forest busting all sorts of trees and the like.I was not afraid but more shocked by what had happend.This brief information may not interest you, but I assure you he is up there certainly and I think that woman who went missing was in my opinion abducted and wont be seen of every again. I think they got her. Where she was camped was about 5 miles from where I seen the one creature..and pelvey creek is just as close."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My Bigfoot Encounter - Lon Strickler I was fly-fishing for redeye and smallmouth bass on the south branch of the Patapsco River approximately 1 mile downstream from Rt.32 near Sykesville, Maryland. After a few minutes or so, I heard the dog barking and growling. I figured that he stirred up a deer, but when I looked at the direction of the ruckus I noticed a dark hairy creature bobbing up and down in the thickets. I stopped fishing and moved closer to the riffles to get a better look and noticed that the dog stopped barking. Suddenly, I heard a loud yelp from the dog and the creature stood up. The best I could tell is that this “thing” was about 7-8 ft. tall and had dark matted hair. I could only see the body from the chest up because the rest of the body was obscured by the weeds and thickets. I stood completely still and could hear a series of “tick” sounds while observing this creature walk slowly through the thickets towards the woods. I started to follow it and in the meantime I noticed a strong musky scent that reminded me of fox urine.I had waders on so I could only move so fast in an attempt to get a better look at this creature. It simply moved too fast for me. I decided to go back to my car, drive into Sykesville and make an immediate report to the authorities.The local police told me to go back to the area and they would meet me there. The State Police officer told to get back in my car and leave immediately because they didn’t know how dangerous the situation was.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday we welcome researcher Bobby Woods and Jim Grant aka Bear to the show. Most in the Bigfoot community know me as Bear, but my real name is Jim Grant. I was raised as a country boy in Montgomery County, Mississippi. Now, I find myself spread out all over the South. I have personally known of BF since 1966 when a “booger” was outside me and my brother’s bedroom window, making strange cooing and clucking sounds.This caused an interest till this stage in my life. I guess you could say this was before the “Patterson” film came out in 1968. After a few more run-ins with our hairy friend, in 1975, I decided to attempt to study and learn the habits of our elusive friend. I have been doing this off and on for almost 35 years, with the last 10 being of the more serious nature.The aspect I find most interesting is the diversity of this creature between ecosystems from all across the South, including Oklahoma and Texas. This has pointed out to me that there are various differences, as the ecology makes this hominid seem different from region to region, but it is basically the same animal.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Possible Government Conspiracy to Cover Up Bigfoot’s Existence. Why Would Government Officials Want to Keep Bigfoot/Sasquatch a Secret? I do not think much of most conspiracy theory, but after studying Bigfoot for a while, I believe that the government is covering up the existence of this creature. In this episode we will discuss possible government coverup of Sasquatch and why. We will also be sharing an encounter with a hunter who says he shot one and than describes an odd government coverup of the shooting.I believe that the government has been studying Bigfoots for some time now. We have quite a bit of evidence along those lines. Bigfoot researchers searching in known areas are always running across government researchers of various types.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week we bring you an eye witness who shares her scary encounter with Sasquatch-.A listener wrote into the show - "I have had two experiences. One sighting and one crazy night of noises, both occurred in the northern part of the southern peninsula of Michigan. It is SO hard to explain to someone how the sound these guys make, just goes right THROUGH you, literally. And people just can't comprehend the body mass on these guys. When I had my sighting, I was in my car and I really thought this thing might try to cut me off and do....who knows what. It is a VERY scary feeling. This creature was so fast, it was mind boggling.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We will be discussing The 'Siege' at Honobia! Bigfoots had been harassing a family who lived deep in the sticks in Honobia, Oklahoma for some time. The family had planted a lot of Austrian snow peas, a crop that deer loved to eat, so deer congregated on their property. The family then hunted the deer for food, mostly by spotlighting at night. They stored deer meet in a freezer in a shed outdoors. The Bigfoots were coming around the house mostly at night, attacking the house with rocks, banging on windows and doors, screaming and yelling, stealing deer meat from the freezer, damaging property, and just in general raising Hell. These incidents took place at a rural homestead outside the town of Honobia, Oklahoma in January of 2000. Some BFRO contacts went to visit the family. They stayed overnight and were impressed. Weeks later television stations and newspapers in Oklahoma mentioned the incidents but never told the whole story. Mid January, 2000 The first message received by the BFRO, from the uncle of the Honobia family: "Too many incidents to mention here, please have someone contact us. This is no hoax and my brother is afraid for his family. This creature is getting bolder every time it returns. This thing is huge, walks upright, smells like a musky urine, burned hair type odor. He repeatedly comes back in the early morning hours after midnight and harasses them until just before dawn. It has on more than one occasion tried to enter their home. We don't know where to turn. Everyone thinks we are crazy when we mention it. Please, we don't know what to do but I do know that something needs to be done! There are stories we could tell that would make the hair stand on your neck..."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In EP:10 we bring you a hunters encounter with Sasquatch. A listener contacted the show and wanted to share his encounter with Sasquatch. The listener wrote us saying "I had an encounter years ago (1987) in Eastern Washington. It was a three day ordeal with a couple of witnesses. I didn't see them by choice, but was able to hear them "talk" to one another.Several years ago I spoke to an individual named John Berry who is now deceased, and gave him the details. He was the only person in the bigfoot community that I have spoke to about this. He was very interested in my encounter but I shied away from going further with the ordeal. I'm not looking for public attention and It seems that many of the bigfoot community lack integrity and shame and I just dont want anything to do with that circus environment. You mentioned an area in your interview with a couple of brothers, the Souixon area in Washington, this is an area that I have been hunting and camping in since the 70's. This is an area that I am very familiar with and that I often bowhunt alone for more than a week at a time. I am interested in knowing more about the activity in the area. I have never found a track but have seen a suspicious figure in the dense fog on the Squaw Butte Trail above Skookum Meadows. I cant be certain as to what I saw there and have filed as merely a unique log and branch combination. I sometimes feel the need to share my experience with a credible individual(s) and maybe get some insight to what I encountered."</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we bring you answers to some of the most asked questions regarding Bigfoot. We have a very special interview with John Green that we will be discussing. What is Sasquatch? Kill vs No Kill according to John Green and as always we will have encounters of the week! Join us every Sunday night as we will be discussing Bigfoot encounters and Bigfoot stories. William Jevning Woody and Wes will also be discussing Sasquatch behavior and encounters. We will be discussing recent encounters and older encounters. John Green first began investigating Sasquatch sightings and track finds in 1957 after meeting René Dahinden and the two researchers collaborated in interviewing witnesses and sharing information of alleged sightings. A year later Green was shown a series of 15" tracks crossing a sandbar beside Bluff Creek in California so deeply impressed as to indicate a weight many times that of any potential hoaxer. He has been trying ever since to establish what it is that makes the tracks. Green is also the only surviving person to have investigated the original Sasquatch tracks reported in Bluff Creek, California in the summer of 1958. As a renowned authority in the field, Green has appeared as a keynote speaker at all three of the major scientific Sasquatch symposia held so far. Green has authored several Sasquatch books, including Sasquatch: The Apes Among Us, still regarded as the single best book yet written on the subject. It has recently been re-issued, along with an updated combination of two earlier books, and is titled The Best of Sasquatch Bigfoot.</p>]]></description>
