		<description>One day in 2008, Michael Daugherty - CEO and owner of LabMD, a cancer detection lab - got a call from an executive of TiVera, a cybersecurity company. The caller said that a file containing private medical data of some 9000 of LabMD&#039;s patients has been discovered online. When Michael refused to pay for TiVersa&#039;s hefty &quot;consultation fee&quot;, it reported the incident to the FTC. This was the beginning of a ten-year-long legal battle that ultimately destroyed LabMD - but cost the Federal Agency dearly.</description>

		<description>Media companies probably get hacked no more than other, non-media oriented organizations such as hospitals, banks, etc. But these hacks are often more visible and more memorable because… well, media companies are more public facing by their very nature. How can these organizations be hacked, and why should we care about such attacks? Nate Nelson spoke with Joel Molinoff, former chief information risk officer for CBS Corporation, and Dan Vasile, former vice president of information security at Paramount. </description>

		<description>Authentication has come a long way since the 1980s or 90s. But when it comes to phone calls - we’re still in the Middle Ages. Vishing, or Voice Scams, are probably as old as the Telephone itself, yet it is still very easy to impersonate someone over the phone or spoof a phone call’s origin.
Rachel Tobac is a hacker and the CEO of SocialProof Security, where she helps people and companies keep their data safe by training and pen-testing them on social engineering risks. Rachel spoke with Nate Nelson, our Sr. producer, about Vishing: how common is it, where attackers get the information they need to impersonate someone from, and the many many psychological tricks they can employ to fool the person on the other side of the call.</description>

		<description>In any trading market, at any time in history, no matter where you are, the most important thing you can possess isn’t actually money, or influence, or anything like that. Knowledge -- in particular, knowing something before everybody else -- is far more valuable. Some traders are willing to go to great lengths to get it before anyone else. In some cases, they’ll apply great ingenuity to the problem - but in others, they’ll use manipulation -- hacking into these technologies to gain an unfair advantage, and make a fortune along the way.</description>

Can these models be hacked to gain access to the sensitive information they learned from their training data? </p>

		<description>Criminals, particularly cyber criminals, aren’t “good” people; in most cases, they do have their own personal boundaries. Every once in a while, you encounter a criminal who’s different. Someone who seems not to have limits at all. A ruthless person, for whom the goal truly justifies the means. Leo Kuvayev is that kind of a person - and that made him so successful as a cyber-criminal. But even a genius criminal can go just one step too far.</description>

Jeff Man, our guest today, was one of the first people at the NSA to make the transition from hardware to software, and he shares with us his experiences from that period.</description>

		<description>Working with the Secret Service, Albert Gonzalez was outstanding. He was such a good employee, in fact, that they had him do seminars, and speak at government conferences. At one point he met personally with the then Director of the Secret Service. Albert gave a presentation, and got to shake the man’s hand. 
It’s a remarkable redemption story, you’d have to say. There was just one caveat. You see, Albert Gonzalez went from stealing millions of credit cards to quarterbacking the largest cyber crime bust in U.S history. And then? He went back to the Dark Side.</description>

		<description>On Friday, May 7th, 2021, Colonial Pipeline suffered a cyberattack that forced the company to shut down its operations. As a result, gasoline outages were reported in many East Coast states. 
The entity behind the attack is a criminal group known as DarkSide. Nate Nelson, our Sr. producer, spoke with Assaf Dahan - Head of Threat Research at Cybereason - about the Colonial Pipeline attack: how &amp; why it happened, and its implications - both for the security of critical infrastructure in the US, and for the criminal underworld of Ransomware groups. That last one is particularly interesting, since it seems that the Colonial Pipeline attack has set off a somewhat unexpected trend on the dark web.</description>

<p>In March 2011, RSA was facing a terrible dilemma. An attacker siphoned data relating to SecureID, the company&#8217;s flagship product used by thousands of high-profile clients around the world &#8211; but it was unknown whether the attacker also stole the cryptographic key needed to decipher that data. Should the company disclose the breach, or keep it quiet in the hope that SecureID will remain safe?…<br>A special collaboration with Wired magazine, exposing &#8211; for the first time &#8211; the untold story behind one of the most dramatic hacks of all time.</p>

This reports triggered Operation GUNMAN: a complete removal &amp; de-bugging of *all* electronic devices in the US embassy in the USSR. This secretive operation resulted in a surprising discovery - and made the NSA what it is today.</description>

		<description>The Great Firewall is just mind-bogglingly big, repressing freedom of speech and information for over 800 million Chinese internet users every year. The Great Firewall is so big that it’s worth asking: how did the Chinese manage to build it in the first place? 20 years ago, our info-sec technology was much less advanced than it is today. China was a second-rate technology power, not even comparable to their position today. Most of all: a firewall, like the one they proposed, had never existed before--or, for that matter, since. How, then, did they pull it off?</description>

		<description>On August 1st, 2017, Bitcoin forked. But it wasn&#039;t the SegWit2x fork everyone was talking about - It was a different fork, supported by a coalition of miners who, in doing what they were doing, were essentially ditching SegWit2x in favor of their own scaling solution. What happened here? Who betrayed SegWit2x?</description>

But just under the surface, the network was teetering on the verge of collapse. Technical problems that were just nuisances when the community was small now became glaring and potentially lethal. Debates among tight communities of knowledgeable users and developers ballooned into full-on internet wars. Factions hardened. Heroes became enemies of the people.</description>

They were being accused of crimes they may not have committed, based on evidence that largely did not exist. The conspiracies around them seemed unfair at best, malicious at worst. But there’s another side to this story, of course. Huawei didn’t end up on people’s radars for no reason. They’ve earned their notoriety.</description>

Ultimately, though, every path that begins with ToTok ends with one very rich and powerful man at the heart of the Emirati state. His name is Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan.</description>

		<description>Over the past two years, the internet has been inundated with celebrity Deep Fake videos of all kinds: Obama, Putin, and Trump deliver speeches they never gave, Gal Gadot &quot;stars” in a porn video, and professional comedians such as Bill Hader eerily turn into the people they impersonate, like Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

What all of these videos have in common is that they were mostly created by amateur developers or small startups with tight budgets - but their quality is surprisingly good, and in some cases as good as what the biggest movie studios were able to produce with huge budgets just a few years ago. 



So what happened in the last five years, that turned special effects from being the exclusive domain of industry experts - into something a 14-year-old can create more or less at the touch of a button? Like the top end of a floating glacier, Deep Fakes are by and large only the visible product of a fascinating - and much deeper - technological revolution in the field of artificial intelligence. As we shall soon see, this revolution has the potential to put some very powerful tools in the hands of both attackers and defenders in the world of cyber-security.</description>

<p>Graham Cluley tells about his entry into the world of security. There are stories aplenty in this interview- Graham tells of how he turned from a young student writing video games for donations, to a programmer for one of Europe&#8217;s leading anti-virus solutions in the early 90&#8217;s, and sheds a ton of light on the malware industry in some of its earliest days.</p>
<p>Pair this interview with Episode 2- The Dark Avenger, for a comprehensive&nbsp;view of the virus (and anti-virus) writing scene of the early 90&#8217;s.</p>
