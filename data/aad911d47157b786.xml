      <title>American Resistance: The World in a K-Cup</title>
      <description>Each federal employee takes an oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic,” but none had imagined that enemy might be the Commander-in-Chief. With the presidency of Donald Trump, a fault line between the president and vital forces within his government was established. Those who honored their oath of office, their obligation to the Constitution, were wary of the president and they in turn were not trusted and occasionally fired and replaced with loyalists.
DSR Host David Rothkopf's latest book, American Resistance is the first book to chronicle the unprecedented role so many in the government were forced to play and the consequences of their actions during the Trump administration. David discusses the stories and people in the book with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University and Ed Luce of the Financial Times.

      <title>From The Silo: Twitter's Dynamic Duo: My funny, profanity laced, insightful conversation with Rick Wilson and Molly Jong-Fast</title>
      <description>Originally Aired: February 15, 2019
They're twitter's dynamic duo: he's the peanut butter to her jelly, the Mickey to her Minnie, the Batman to...you get the point. These two guests are hilarious and when you bring them together on this podcast, THEY ARE FIRE. You'd think that leading GOP strategist Rick Wilson and liberal writer Molly Jong-Fast would have nothing in common, but you're wrong. They have two very important things in common; they hate Trump and they love our country. In this podcast we talked about twitter trolls (Molly LOVES them) the best nickname ever given to a shady Governor (thank you Rick) and guesses for 2020, along with a ton of other politichitchat.

      <title>From The Silo: The Trump Coup: A Week in Washington Like No Other</title>
      <description>Originally Aired: January 07, 2022
In the midst of a pandemic, with almost 4000 people dying every day, when the nation should be coming together, the President of the United States once again tore it asunder. Worse, what he did was mobilize the first violent coup attempt in US history on the back of his months long seditious efforts to nullify the November election and steal the sovereign power of American voters. As it happens, he also did it on a week when the Democratic Party secured control of the US Senate, another development with seismic consequences in Washington. We discuss these events and their meaning with former Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams advisor Karen Finney, election law specialist Rick Hasen, former Obama health policy advisor Dr. Kavita Patel and NYU Law Professor and co-editor of "Just Security" Ryan Goodman. It's an important deep dive into the meaning behind the events of an extraordinary week. Join us.

      <title>From the Silo: What Does Putin Most Desire?</title>
      <description>Originally Aired: 12/21/17

In David Rothkopf’s absence this week, Rosa Brooks hosts and reminds listeners that the Deep State Radio crew will soon be retreating into the bunker for some holiday eggnog, before resuming in the new year. The Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe argues that Putin is overrated, and the BBC’s Kim Ghattis and Kori Schake argue that the new US National Security Strategy is also overrated (and incoherent). Julia confesses that she has lost all hope, Kori lends her the Tiara of Optimism, and Kim describes Arab schadenfreude over #MeToo.

      <title>From the Silo: There's a Mountain of Evidence Against Trump &amp; His Coup Coconspirators.  But Will DoJ Do Anything About It?</title>
      <description>This episode originally aired on 8/6/21
Slowly, thanks to Congressional information requests and court cases, hard evidence is emerging about the way the former president and those close to him worked to steal the last election. You would think that would lead to grand juries being empaneled, indictments and convictions. But so far, nothing of the kind seems imminent from the Department of Justice and while Congress has on-going investigations real concrete progress seems distant. Where does that leave us? We discuss with Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution. It's a pretty tough discussion to hear...but you need to hear it.

      <title>Warning: Weak Sauce Ahead</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/warning-weak-sauce-ahead</link>
      <description>Earlier today, the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 to limit the ability of state and local governments to restrict guns outside the home. When asked about the decision, President Biden said, “I think it’s a bad decision, I’m disappointed.” Our panel consisting of Norm Ornstein, Dr. Kavita Patel and host, David Rothkopf called Biden's response, "weak sauce." They discuss this decision, another ruling by the Supreme Court limiting the ability to enforce Miranda Rights and what all this could mean for the 2022 midterms and beyond on the latest episode of Deep State Radio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/dont-look-now-the-democrats-can-win-in-november-heres-how</link>
      <description>There is a significant amount of doom and gloom in the air when it comes to Democrats chances in the midterms; inflation, baby formula shortages, the latest COVID surge, monkeypox, and the war in Ukraine to say nothing of historical trends are giving Democratic strategists nightmares. But on this episode, David Rothkopf, Kavita Patel, Simon Rosenberg of NDN, and EJ Dionne of the Washington Post provide some hope and advice for the path forward. What should we make of the primary elections on Tuesday? How should Democrats frame the issues facing Americans? Are the polls actually as bad as pundits are claiming?

      <title>Freezing Order: A Conversation with Bill Browder</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/freezing-order-a-conversation-with-bill-browder</link>
      <description>Bill Browder has been on a crusade against corruption in Russia since before he was labeled a "threat to national security" by Putin's regime. In his latest book, "Freezing Order: A True Story of Russian Money Laundering, State-Sponsored Murder,and Surviving Vladimir Putin's Wrath", Bill discusses the time period after the passage of the Magnitsky act and what else needs to be done to fight corruption in between stories of his real life being targeted by Putin and his oligarchs. David Rothkopf explores these issues as well as the chances of Putin's ouster, the impact of the war in Ukraine on the fight against corruption, and what more should be done in this thoughtful episode. Don't miss it.

      <title>The End of a Woman's Right to Choose: Part II, Constitutional and Legal Consequences</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/after-the-leak-is-the-supreme-court-in-disarray</link>
      <description>On Monday, Politico released a draft version of a decision written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe V. Wade. The leak of a draft decision is a huge break in the norms of the court as is the decision to overturn Roe. To discuss the fallout from this leak and what it means for the Supreme Court, David Rothkopf was joined by Dahlia Lithwick of Slate, Barb McQuade of the University of Michigan, and Steve Vladeck of the University of Texas. What was most significant about the draft decision? Where do we think the leak originated? Are there other potential precedent cases that could be overturned? The answer to these and other pressing questions on this thoughtful episode. Don't miss it!

      <title>What if Putin Uses a Nuke?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-if-putin-uses-a-nuke</link>
      <description>With the war in Ukraine going so poorly for Putin, could he be tempted to use nuclear weapons? David Rothkopf explores this question and how the West should respond with former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Doug Lute, David Sanger of the New York Times, Emma Belcher of the Ploughshares Fund, and Jon Wolfsthal of Global Zero. Would Putin use tactical nuclear weapons? How could the U.S. respond so that it is not too much and not too little? Will America fall into the trap of overspending on defense or will this be an opportunity to spend less smarter? The answers to all these questions and more in this thoughtful conversation. Join us!

      <title>Lessons from the Edge: A conversation with Ambassador Masha Yovanovitch</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/lessons-from-the-edge-a-conversation-with-ambassador-masha-y</link>
      <description>While the American people may have been introduced to Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in 2019 that is far from her whole story. In her new book "Lessons from the Edge: A Memoir" Ambassador Yovanovitch takes the read through her career and all the twists and turns that go with foreign service at a time where women were not thought to be up for the job. David Rothkopf speaks with her about drawing from her family's strength escaping oppression, the first impeachment of Donald Trump, and the ongoing war in Ukraine in this far-reaching conversation. Don't miss it!

      <description>Last week President Biden accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being a war criminal. It does not take much more than to turn on the TV to see the war crimes of the use of cluster bombs and the Russian military deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure but is it possible to bring Putin to justice? David Rothkopf grapples with this question with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Ryan Goodman of New York University, and Rebecca Hamilton of American University. How are cell phones changing the way war crime investigators collect evidence? What role can the U.S. play given that we are not a party to the court? What comes next in the investigation process? Find out on this thorough episode.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/a-look-behind-the-new-iron-curtain-how-russians-see-the-war-</link>
      <description>As Putin's war of choice in Ukraine continues, Russia is seeing major impacts domestically. The value of the Ruble dropped significantly following the invasion, Putin has cracked down on independent journalism, and sanctions are crippling the economy. To talk about the view from Moscow and the impact the war has had on Russians, David Rothkopf talked with Michael Weiss of New Lines Magazine and Jill Dougherty of Georgetown University. How is the war viewed in Russia? What impact will Putin's recent speech have? Do the protests in Russia matter? Find out the answer to these and other questions during this thoughtful conversation. Join us.

      <description>The west had long ignored warnings from Eastern European states about the continued threat posed by Russia. Now, that threat is impossible to ignore. David Rothkopf spoke with former President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves about the war in Ukraine, the Putin regime's anti-western bias, and the view from Eastern Europe. Is Russia's revanchism and foreign policy adventurism inherent to Russia or a result of its leaders? How concerned are the baltic states about the Russian threat now? What are the chances that Ukraine joins the EU and NATO? Find out the answer to these and other questions in this fascinating conversation. Join us.

      <title>How Putin Can Declare Victory Without Invading Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/how-putin-can-declare-victory-without-invading-ukraine</link>
      <description>Secretary of State Blinken laid out the administration's position on the situation in Ukraine at the United Nations. Russia has said that they might use military-technical means in Ukraine if their demands are not met. DSR Host David Rothkopf discussed the recent news in the ongoing crisis on the border of Ukraine with former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Douglas Lute, Theresa Fallon of the Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies, and David Sanger of the New York Times. How will the U.S. respond if Putin does something less than a full invasion? What can the U.S. do to deter Russia from pulling a stunt like this in the future? Will this create more burden sharing with America's European allies? Find out in this very timely conversation. Join us!

      <title>The State of the Case Against Donald J. Trump</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-state-of-the-case-against-donald-j-trump</link>
      <description>Every week it seems that more and more evidence of Donald Trump's attempts at election subversion are revealed but where is the Department of Justice in their investigations.  With some of the crimes outlined in the Mueller Report reaching their statute of limitations, swift action is necessary to preserve our democracy.  At this pivotal moment, DSR host David Rothkopf and co-host Kavita Patel talk with Richard Painter, former ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, and Randall Eliason, former AUSA and Chief of the Public Corruption/Government Fraud section at the DC US Attorney's Office about the path forward for bringing Trump to justice.  How do we know if Merrick Garland is moving fast enough?  What laws need to be adjusted to prevent corruption in the future?  Will Trump be charged with obstruction of justice.  All these questions and more are discussed in this timely conversation.  Join us.
In the bonus segment, David and Kavita are joined by Asha Rangappa of Yale University and Norm Eisen of the Brookings Institution to continue the conversation, determine the likelihood of a seditious conspiracy charge, and discuss the potential of prosecution at the state level.

      <title>Go Back to Where You Came From: A Conversation with Wajahat Ali</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/go-back-to-where-you-came-from-a-conversation-with-wajahat-a</link>
      <description>Wajahat Ali is a columnist, commentator and a wise, funny commentator on American politics and life. His latest book, "Go Back to Where You Came From" is a memoir of his experiences growing up a Muslim-American in the US both before and after 9/11. While the societal dysfunction he addresses is real, by illustrating it through his own story and that of his family, Ali brings it to life and, through all of it, never loses his sense of humor. Our conversation with him is, as a consequence, as engaging and vital as his book. Join us...then buy the book.

      <description>All eyes remain on the border between Ukraine and Russia as the conventional wisdom is that Russia is more likely than not further invade Ukraine. President Biden is considering sending thousands of troops into the region while other NATO allies have already begun moving weapons and soldiers into Eastern Europe. What lessons has the Biden administration learned from Obama's experience with Crimea? Are there any off-ramps left for Putin to deescalate? Will this situation ultimately strengthen NATO and perceptions of American power abroad? Deep State Radio host David Rothkopf speaks with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, and Evelyn Farkas former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia about these and other issues facing the United States and our Allies. Join us.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/white-house-whisperers-what-should-biden-do-in-2022</link>
      <description>It has been one year since the Biden administration came into office and was handed an economy in a tailspin, vaccines that were not available to the general public, and a democracy in dire straits. President Biden was able to get vaccines in arms and money in pockets but, given the recent legislative setbacks for Build Back Better and Voting Rights in the Senate, where does the administration go from here? DSR Host David Rothkopf discusses the future of the Biden agenda with Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institute, Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, and Simon Rosenberg of the New Democrat Network. Don't miss it.

      <title>Putin and Ukraine: Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/putin-and-ukraine-dont-let-the-sun-go-down-on-me</link>
      <description>On Monday, the United States and Russia spoke for hours in an attempt to forge a diplomatic end to Russian aggression towards Ukraine.  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that the talks resulted in "no progress" while Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman made it clear that "We're not to a point where we're ready to set down texts and begin to go back and forth."  To discuss the impact of these talks and what the future could look like, DSR host David Rothkopf spoke with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University. Will Russia further invade Ukraine?  What leverage does the United States have?  What is driving Putin to act this way? Find out the answers to these and other questions in this prescient conversation. 
In the bonus segment for members, David Rothkopf speaks with David Sanger about his recent reporting about the sanctions that the United States may impose if Russia moves forward with a full-scale invasion.

      <title>January 6th as You Have Never Seen it Before</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/january-6th-as-you-have-never-seen-it-before</link>
      <description>With time comes perspective and it is clear now that January 6th was not an isolated event. In fact, there are real dangers in perceiving it as one, dangers that could play to the interests of the coup plotters and against the long-term interests of U.S. democracy. We seek to reframe the events of that day and where they fit in the bigger picture with Yale University historian and noted author Joanne Freeman and University of Michigan Law School professor and former U.S. attorney Barb McQuade. We promise, it's not like any discussion January 6th you've heard before...and it's one you need to hear. Join us.

      <title>Best of DSR: FILIBUSTED: GETTING TO THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT’S WRONG WITH THE US SENATE</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/best-of-dsr-filibusted-getting-to-the-truth-about-whats-wron</link>
      <description>Senate “institutionalists” claim the filibuster is a traditional US Senate tool that produces compromise. Nope. It’s a tool that was almost never used during the first 200 years of US history. And when it was used it was almost always used to promote a racist agenda. And now that it is used more often, it is used to obstruct and give disproportionate power to Republicans. The first step to eliminating it is understanding it and that is why we talk to veteran Senate staffer Adam Jentleson, author of an important new book “Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy.” We discuss what has turned the U.S. Senate from “the world’s greatest deliberative body to the place legislation goes to die” and how to fix it. Don’t miss this timely conversation.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/best-of-dsr-trumps-failed-coup-attempt-how-bad-was-it-how-mu</link>
      <description>January 6, 2021 is a date few of us will ever forget. On that day, the president of the United States incited a mob to storm the U.S. Capitol. Five people died. Thousands more were terrorized. And now the nation holds its breath to see if the violence has been quelled or new chapters await. Donald Trump now seems certain to become the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice and to forever be seen as the author of a failed coup attempt against the government he had sworn to protect and defend. Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Kori Schake of AEI, Mieke Eoyang of Third Way and David Sanger of the New York Times join us to discuss the impact of the shocking events of the sixth and where we go from here.

      <description>The first episode of the Beltway Black Box series was a timely conversation on whether zero trust thinking represents a breakthrough in cyber-security, the hidden risks associated with it and how it is likely to impact companies and the government. Participating were an exceptional group of experts including: 


Dmitri Alperovitch, Co-Founder of CrowdStrike and Executive Chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator; 

Chase Cunningham, Chief Strategy Officer at Ericom Software;

Juliette Kayyem, Chair of the Homeland Security and Security and Global Health Projects at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government;

and David Sanger, Author of The Perfect Weapon and White House and National Security correspondent at the New York Times.


The conversation covers the genesis of ZTA adoption following cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure and the Biden Administration and congressional response to this change in security paradigm. The experts define ZTA in practical terms, frankly assess implementation hurdles in the private sector - including early adopter vs. laggard industries - and give actionable advice for private business and policy makers.

      <title>Do we see a very dim light at the end of the tunnel for voting rights?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/do-we-see-a-very-dim-light-at-then-end-of-the-tunnel-for-vot</link>
      <description>Former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows' text messages from January 6th were released by the January 6th commission and their contents revealed members of Congress and Fox News hosts begging Meadows to get Trump to make a statement.  In the courts, Judge Dabney Friedrich ruled that Jan. 6 cases invoking the law against corruptly obstructing an official proceeding has been properly invoked.  This opens to the door to bringing criminal charges against Meadows and potential Donald Trump.  Is this a turning point?  Will the January 6th insurrectionists finally be brought to justice?  Could Members of Congress who aided them be ejected from the Chamber?  David Rothkopf discusses these latest developments with Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute and Allison Gill of the Daily Beans and Mueller, She Wrote.
Last in the episode, the panel discusses the recent news that the Senate may be setting aside the Build Back Better legislation in favor of focusing on voting rights.  Will Democrats eliminate the filibuster to protect voting rights?  To find out the answers to these and other pressing questions join us!

      <title>A Conversation with ABC's Jon Karl About His Book "Betrayal: The Final Act of the Trump Show"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/a-conversation-with-abcs-jon-karl-about-his-book-betrayal-th</link>
      <description>Jon Karl's first interview with Donald Trump was 27 years ago. Looking back, he is surprised by how little Trump has changed. It's a striking observation when seen in light of the chaos and controversy of the final year of the Trump presidency. Karl's new book on that final year sheds new, often shocking light, not just on how Team Trump oversaw the mishandling of the COVID epidemic and later the cultivation of the Big Lie and an attempted coup against the United States government. It also, underscores the risks that a second Trump term could have brought with it...and might still bring. We have an in-depth conversation with Karl about the book, its revelations and his sense of whether or not Trump will be a viable candidate in 2024. Don't miss it.

      <description>The massive Russian troop build up along the border of Ukraine might be just posturing on the part of Russia's President Vladimir Putin designed to build support for him at home. Or it might be the prelude to a dangerously destabilizing invasion. Increasingly, intelligence reports are suggesting the latter. The options for the US and the West to stop Russia or to penalize it should it act are limited and as a consequence many experts are beginning to fear the worst may come to pass. We discuss with former Obama Administration Russia and Ukraine expert Evelyn Farkas and with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. Also discussed: the upcoming Democracy Summit. Don't miss it.

      <description>Martin Indyk, distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former Ambassador of the United States to Israel, and former U.S. special envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations has written a new book entitled "Master of the Game: Henry Kissinger and the Art of Middle East Diplomacy."  In the book, Ambassador Indyk examines how Henry Kissinger worked to ameliorate conflict in the Middle East rather than seek to impose peace.  An approach which, Ambassador Indyk asserts, proved to be largely successful.  David Rothkopf and Ambassador Indyk explore Kissinger's policy decisions, the impact he had on the Middle East, and grapple with his legacy in this can't miss conversation.

      <title>Bannon, Rittenhouse, and Arbery: What this week's cases tell us about justice in America today</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/bannon-rittenhouse-and-arbery</link>
      <description>Steve Bannon was indicted for contempt of Congress but currently remains free awaiting trial. Kyle Rittenhouse stood trial in front of a judge who is barely trying to conceal his pro-defendant bias and now we await the jury's decision. Also this week, alleged assailant Travis McMichael took the stand in an effort to defend his killing of Amaud Arbery. To understand this busy week, David Rothkopf and Kavita Patel do a deep dive with Harry Litman, former U.S. Attorney, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and host of the Talking Feds podcast. Is Merrick Garland being methodical or slow? Will America's proliferation of guns lead to more claims of self-defense? Is the judicial branch able to deliver justice? Find out in this can't miss conversation.

      <title>Is Putin Making a Terrible Miscalculation?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/is-putin-making-a-terrible-miscalculation</link>
      <description>Russian troops are building up along the Ukraine border. Russia's close ally Belarus has provoked a crisis on its European borders by directing refugee flows at its neighbors. Tensions are rising. Are the Russians counting on the US and our NATO allies to be reluctant to respond strongly? Do they not realize that the Biden team is much more inclined toward a tough stance toward Russia than the last two U.S. administrations? Will they go too far? We discuss with former US Ambassador to NATO and CEO of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs Ivo Daalder, Brookings Institution European scholar Constanze Stelzenmuller and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute.

      <title>Is America Too Dysfunctional to Remain a Superpower?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/is-america-too-dysfunctional-to-remain-a-superpower</link>
      <description>Gerald Seib wrote in a recent column in the Wall Street Journal that the greatest threat to American national security is our own divisions.  However, that isn't the only existential threat that the United States faces.  Russia and China are testing the United States's cyber defenses and Climate Changes continues to be a central focus as COP26 moves forward in Glasgow.  Can America have a strong foreign policy if there are such drastic changes between administrations?  How is the Biden administration pushing back against adversaries in cyberspace?  Are statements coming out of COP26 just "blah blah blah"? David Rothkopf discusses these and other issues with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, David Sanger of the New York Times, and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute.  You won't want to miss this illuminating conversation.

      <description>The Democrats had a bad night on Tuesday as Glenn Youngkin won the governorship in Virginia and Phil Murphy was barely able to hang on in New Jersey. However, what those results mean remains very unclear. Did Congress's failure to pass the Build Back Better agenda lead to apathy amongst the party faithful? Do Democrats need better candidates? Was this just a thermostatic turn against the party in power? What should the Democrats do to correct course before the midterms? David Rothkopf and Kavita Patel work through these and other questions facing Democratic leaders in the run up to 2022 and 2024 with David Corn of Mother Jones and Jonathan Alter of MSNBC.

David Rothkopf and Kavita Patel work through these and other questions facing Democratic leaders in the run up to 2022 and 2024 with David Corn of Mother Jones and Jonathan Alter of MSNBC.

      <title>Biden in Europe: Give Credit Where it is Due...and Let's Acknowledge Where More Can Be Done</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/biden-in-europe-give-credit-where-it-is-dueand-lets-acknowle</link>
      <description>President Biden is on his second international trip. He started this weekend at the G20 in Rome and is now in Glasgow for the COP26. The trip has already proven productive with President Biden advancing the global corporate minimum tax and striking a new US-EU Steel and Aluminum trade deal. He smoothed over relations with France. And made it clear the US wants to lead on climate. But what more should be done? What more can be done given US domestic politics? David Rothkopf discusses the near and long-term implications of these meetings with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Rosa Brooks of the Georgetown University Law Center, and Ben Pauker of Politico. You won't want to miss it.

      <title>Only the Rich Can Play: A Conversation with David Wessel</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/only-the-rich-can-play-a-conversation-with-david-wessel</link>
      <description>Opportunity Zones sounded like a great idea, provide tax benefits for wealthy Americans to invest in 8,000 areas in the United States that don't receive enough investment and development and everyone wins. Unfortunately, as David Wessel describes in his new book "Only the Rich Can Play: How Washington Works in the New Gilded Age", the vast majority of the benefits of these zones went to the wealthy instead of the communities they were meant to help. This far ranging conversation hits on the roots of this policy failure as well as the latest plans from Democrats to tax billionaires and the global minimum tax on corporations championed by Janet Yellen.

      <description>As the Biden Administration shifts the focus of U.S. foreign policy to emerging issues and how America can lead in the century ahead, certain megapowers loom as complex threats. One is China. Another is Big Tech and how, if at all, its destabilizing and dangerous tendencies can be managed. Ed Luce of the Financial Times and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute discuss. And then we move on to an evaluation of Biden Administration foreign policy so far, the impact of Secretary Blinken's efforts to return diplomacy to centrality in our international relations and what can be done in the next couple years to do better. Join us.

      <title>America is Just Going to Have to Learn to Accept Good News</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/couching-our-policies-in-patriotism-with-representative-ro-k</link>
      <description>The Biden Administration, it seems, is on the verge of winning approval for its Build Back Better Package. If the deal is roughly as reported it will be between $1.5 and 2 trillion in fully paid for investments in America. Which means that in this year alone the Biden Administration will have overseen investments of $5 Trillion in the economy, the creation of 5 million jobs (more than the last three GOP administrations added up), distribution fo 200 million plus vaccines, significant economic growth, and much more. You wouldn't know it from reading the press or following social media, but understanding just how big and beneficial all this is may be key to Democratic victories in 2022 which will be essential to preserving democracy in the U.S. We discuss how we got here and how to frame these achievements going forward with California Representative Ro Khanna, the Washington Post's Greg Sargent and Dr. Kavita Patel, formerly of the Obama White House. Don't miss this crucial conversation.

      <title>There is Nothing for You Here: A Conversation with Fiona Hill</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/there-is-nothing-for-you-here-a-conversation-with-fiona-hill</link>
      <description>Fiona Hill may have risen to public prominence during Donald Trump's first impeachment but there is much more to her story than just her time in the White House. In her new book "There is Nothing for You Here: Finding Opportunity in the Twenty-First Century", she describes her journey from a coal-mining town in Northern England to studying in Moscow and ultimately to serving three different Presidents. Hill argues that expanding opportunity rather than clinging to the past is the only way to save democracy in America and elsewhere and that Putin and Trump are more alike than you may think. We discuss this fascinating new book with Fiona in a can't miss conversation. Join us.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/how-many-times-over</link>
      <description>America's nuclear weapons submarine fleet has the capability to produce something like 40,000 Hiroshimas. But it is just one leg in our nuclear forces. What possible reason, asks our guest Joe Cirincione of the Quincy Institute, for possessing that kind of destructive force? For giving the president sole authority to launch a first strike? We discuss these and other nuclear modernization choices facing the Biden Administration with Joe as well regulars David Sanger of the New York Times, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School. We also take time to reflect on the legacy of the late General Colin Powell. Join us.

      <title>Voter, Heal Thyself: A Conversation with Tom Nichols</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/voter-heal-thyself-a-conversation-with-tom-nichols</link>
      <description>Tom Nichols has become an essential voice for audiences trying to make sense of current trends in American politics. His book "The Death of Expertise" was a landmark volume offering key insights into why our society was faltering. His latest, "Our Own Worst Enemy" continues the journey. For those hoping for a magical solution, a white knight, a top down solution for American political dysfunction, this book will be frustrating but eye-opening. Nichols believes, rightly in our view, that the answer starts with each of us, with a civic minded populace remaking our political culture from the ground up. We discuss this new book with Tom in a conversation you won't want to miss.

      <title>Biden's Multi-Tiered China Policy is a Far Cry from Trump's</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/bidens-multi-tiered-china-policy-is-a-far-cry-from-trumps</link>
      <description>Trump China policy architect Peter Navarro was described by one of his colleagues as a "fucking sociopath." Trump China policy included looking the other way from human rights abuses, seeking trademarks for Ivanka's businesses and extreme Tweets. Biden's is evolving as something very very different--mature, multilayered and reflecting the complexity of the evolving relationship between the world's two major powers. We discuss the latest developments with David Sanger of the New York Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. We also discuss whether Sioux Falls, South Dakota exists or not and why that matters. Don't miss the latest Deep State Radio, the official podcast of the Deep State.

      <description>The Washington debate over whether and how much to invest in our infrastructure and our people has reached a telling and pivotal moment. We discuss the moment and where it is likely to lead with EJ Dionne of the Washington Post, Norm Ornstein of AEI and Dr. Kavita Patel, former of the Obama White House. Much hangs in the balance here and the real story is not coming out in the media or, often, out of the mouths of political leaders.

      <title>Europe and the Atlantic Alliance After Merkel: What Next?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/europe-and-the-atlantic-alliance-after-merkel-what-next</link>
      <description>Most Americans don't give much thought to German politics--and that's a good thing given that when we once did it was because those politics were a disaster. But with the departure of Germany's chancellor of the past 16 years, Angela Merkel, it is time we did. Germany is not only a vital ally but thanks in large part to Merkel's leadership, it is a global leader of significance. What comes next in our relationship--especially as the US continues to prioritize its pivot to Asia. We discuss with Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Kori Schake of AEI and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center. Join us.

      <description>Time after time, COVID has delivered worst case scenarios. So why, now, would we rely on our hope that those scenarios--new variants, failures of leadership, new outbreaks--will not occur? Will the holidays bring people back together? Or will they see a worsening situation? What should our leaders be doing that they're not? What should we be doing to take care of ourselves? We talk with Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Laurie Garrett and former senior Obama WH official and practicing physician Dr. Kavita Patel.

      <title>"8 Year-Old Assholes Cannot be Shamed": The Big National Security Scandal Nobody is Talking About</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/8-year-old-assholes-cannot-be-shamed-the-big-national-securi</link>
      <description>After 9/11, investigators concluded one of the factors that put America at risk was that only 57 percent of nominees for top national security positions had been confirmed by the Congress and were in place. Today, that number is just over 26 percent. Random holds on nominees for indefensibly political reasons are putting this country at risk. The two worst offenders? Senators Cruz and Hawley. We discuss this with expert Loren deJonge Schulman, VP for Research at the Partnership for Public Service as well as AEI's Kori Schake, the FT's Ed Luce and Georgetown Law's Rosa Brooks. We also discuss Kori's and Rosa's prominent opeds on the controversy surrounding General Mark Milley. Plus a little bit about French submarines. Don't miss it.

      <description>In the news recently, reports that General Mark Milley sought to counsel Chinese leaders in way that might avoid accidental conflict have caused controversy. Was Milley doing his duty? Or was he undermining his commander-in-chief? Similarly, it is reported that Vice President Mike Pence sought counsel from former Vice President Dan Quayle about whether he could or should follow through on President Trump's request that he Pence invalidate 2020 election results. Quayle stood up for principle and the law as Pence wavered. What does this tell us about the last administration? About the responsibility of public officials when confronted with an unfit president. We discuss with former Trump White House official Olivia Troye, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations. It's an important, timely and difficult conversation. Don't miss it.

      <title>How Do You Feel About the Urge to Surge?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/how-do-you-feel-about-the-urge-to-surge</link>
      <description>While Congress holds hearings questioning the Secretary of State about the conduct of America's exit from Afghanistan, it probably should also turn its attention to drawing the lessons of the 20 years of warfare, sacrifice and frustration that proceeded that exit. What might those lessons be? And what might come next for the Biden foreign policy team? We discuss with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University School of Law and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. Join us (if only to hear Kori declare what Kori would do if she had a nuclear weapon).

      <title>The Talibanization of the Supreme Court</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-talibanization-of-the-supreme-court</link>
      <description>The midnight decision of the Supreme Court that basically allowed a technicality to sweep aside the constitutional right to an abortion that has been a fact of American life for half a century bodes very ill for the future of that institution and for the country. When Justice Brett Kavanaugh is the philosophical center of the court, you know we have entered a dark chapter in our history. The majority represent not conservative but religious extremist views and this most recent decision will likely be followed by much worse. We discuss with Slate senior legal editor Dahlia Lithwick, former US attorney Barb McQuade and former senior Obama White House official Dr. Kavita Patel. Join us.

      <title>Here, Right Matters...or Does It?: A Conversation with Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/here-right-mattersor-does-it-a-conversation-with-lt-col-alex</link>
      <description>Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman knew when he went into the Trump White House to work on the National Security Council that he may be asked to do things that were "awful but lawful." As a serving army officer in those cases he would be obligated to follow the orders of the Commander-in-Chief. But he also knew there was a line that he would not cross. He would not follow an unlawful order, he would not help even the president break the law. As a result of his conscience--which drew directly on his military experience and prior to that on the values inculcated in him by his family--the course of history was altered. Imagine what might have happened had Donald Trump gotten the government of Ukraine to help him smear candidate Joe Biden? Where would we be now? We discuss Vindman's story--told in his excellent new book, "Here, Right Matters"--with him in this special edition of the podcast. It's a compelling, candid conversation. Don't miss it.

      <title>America's 2000 Yard Stare: Coping With Crises Closing in on All Sides</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/americas-2000-yard-stare-coping-with-crises-closing-in-on-al</link>
      <description>COVID. Wildfires in the west. Hurricanes in the Gulf and storms in the East. A women's right to choose under siege. A corrupted justice system. Economic inequality. Racial division. Democracy in the ICU. Any one of these crises would be a challenge for a generation. We face them all at once. The result is something like "the 2000 yard stare," the sign of a battle worn soldier unable to fight. But we must fight. The question is how. We discuss all this on a vitally important special edition of the podcast with guests Norm Ornstein of AEI, best-selling author and therapist Mary L. Trump, co-host former Obama White House senior official Dr. Kavita Patel and co-host David Rothkopf. Join us. It's time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.

      <description>A lot of books have been written about Donald Trump and the Trump years president. Few have evoked the almost surreal atmosphere of those years as well as "I Alone Can Fix It," the history of the last year of the administration from Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker. We sit down with Carol Leonnig to discuss the book and what it has led her to conclude about the former president, those around him, their party and the state of American politics.

      <title>As We Approach the Afghanistan Deadline: Looking Back and Looking Ahead</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/as-we-approach-the-afghanistan-deadline-looking-back-and-loo</link>
      <description>It has been difficult to have a serious, balanced conversation about what the U.S. and this administration has done right in managing the exit from Afghanistan and what we have done wrong. That is a problem that has plagued the U.S. for the entire 20 year period we have conducted the war and, in fact, it may be one of the reasons the outcome to that conflict has been so unsatisfactory. Nonetheless, on this episode we try to cover a range of views in a thoughtful and respectful way. Our guests are Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations, Stephen Wertheim of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School. Please join us.

      <title>Why Did Trump Turn Away Our Afghan Allies?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/why-did-trump-turn-away-our-afghan-allies</link>
      <description>The reason the crowds thronging the outskirts of the airport in Kabul were so large was in part due to a concerted effort--against the advice of many in his administration--by former President Trump and his aide Stephen Miller to block our Afghan allies (like allies in Iraq) from entering the United States. They shut down relevant visa programs. They created obstacle after obstacle. And they did so after being warned that such actions would put interpreters and others who assisted us at risk. That is the shocking fact revealed by former Trump official Olivia Troye in a special episode of Deep State Radio. Troye is joined in this episode by former top Obama White House official Dr. Kavita Patel and by Ryan Goodman of Just Security and NYU Law School. Don't miss it.

      <title>Rothkopf vs. the Washington Hivemind (a Reasonable Debate)</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/rothkopf-vs-the-washington-hivemind-a-reasonable-debate</link>
      <description>An episode in which we bring to life the debate that even the best of friends can have over the conduct of recent events in Afghanistan, their likely origins, and their likely consequences. Why are so many people so wrong about this when host David Rothkopf is so right? Where does Rothkopf get his courage? And why do the producers let Rothkopf write these podcast summaries when either Ed Luce or Rosa Brooks, who are really the stars of the episode, would have described it so much better and so differently. Listen in and see.

      <title>Afghanistan Special Report: Where Do We Go from Here and What Lessons Can We Draw?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/afghanistan-special-report-where-do-we-go-from-here-and-what</link>
      <description>The heart-rending scenes from Kabul Airport are now seared into our collective consciousness. The 20 year war in Afghanistan has clearly come to a disastrous end. While that may have been inevitable, the current chaos has nonetheless come as a shock. What should the administration do now? How to help those they can and manage the situation going forward? And what lessons can we draw after a two-decade long, misguided intervention in Afghanistan that will certainly go down as one of the great foreign policy failures in U.S. history? We discuss with Harvard's Stephen Walt, AEI's Kori Schake and Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks. Don't miss this special episode.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/america-in-a-moment-of-grave-peril-a-conversation-with-heath</link>
      <description>We are at a watershed in our history. Some days it feels like justice and accountability are gaining ground and the outcome of this turning point may be a good one. On other days, the threats to our democracy grow and the very real possibility of a turn to authoritarianism in the US looms. There are echoes of this moment throughout our history. We turn to Boston College history professor and noted commentator Heather Cox Richardson to discuss recent developments and long-term historical perspectives. Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and Just Security and Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and formerly of the Obama White House lead the questioning and offer key comments of their own. Don't miss it.

      <title>The World is on Fire. Will We Have to Wait for a New Generation to Address the Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-world-is-on-fire-will-we-have-to-wait-for-a-new-generati</link>
      <description>The UN has put out a climate report that is devastating in its conclusions. They call it a "code red for humanity." Inaction, greed and ignorance have already irreparably damaged the planet. What do we do now? Are our leaders even capable of coping with the problem?

      <title>There's a Mountain of Evidence Against Trump &amp; His Coup Coconspirators.  But Will DoJ Do Anything About It?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/theres-a-mountain-of-evidence-against-trump-his-coup-coconsp</link>
      <description>Slowly, thanks to Congressional information requests and court cases, hard evidence is emerging about the way the former president and those close to him worked to steal the last election. You would think that would lead to grand juries being empaneled, indictments and convictions. But so far, nothing of the kind seems imminent from the Department of Justice and while Congress has on-going investigations real concrete progress seems distant. Where does that leave us? We discuss with Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution. It's a pretty tough discussion to hear...but you need to hear it.

      <title>We're Clueless Until We Overreact: America's Foreign Policy History in a Nutshell</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/were-clueless-until-we-overreact-americas-foreign-policy-his</link>
      <description>Face it, since George Washington, for all the glamor and intrigue the rest of the world may hold, Americans would pretty much like to be left out of it. Over the course of our history, that impulse has been magnified by the fact that often when we do find ourselves forced to be involved, we delay until we tend to overreact. Right now, America's interest in the rest of the world seems to be at a momentary low as we deal with pressing domestic issues. Which raises the question: Where will we overreact next? (See: China, People's Republic of) A lively and thought provoking conversation with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, David Sanger of the New York Times and host, David Rothkopf.

      <title>The End of an Era in US Foreign Policy: Is that a Good Thing?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-end-of-an-era-in-us-foreign-policy-is-that-a-good-thing</link>
      <description>With the decision by the Biden Administration to pull the last troops out of Afghanistan and the last combat troops out of Iraq, it marks the end to two decades of U.S. foreign policy in which the War on Terrorism and instability in the Middle East dominated policymakers attentions. Biden seeks to turn the page to 21st Century priorities like China, competitiveness, fixing what is broken at home and next generation threats like cyber. It seems reasonable not to mention long overdue. David Sanger of the New York Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School and Ed Luce of the Financial Times debate whether it is the right move and whether it is being done in the right way. Don't miss this lively and timely discussion.

      <title>Another Lost Decade for Latin America? </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/another-lost-decade-for-latin-america</link>
      <description>It is a paradox of international relations that U.S. neighbors in the Western Hemisphere have two primary complaints about U.S.
relations with the region. The first is that the U.S. does not pay enough attention to our neighbors. The second, which is often
the first, is that the U.S. pays too much attention to our neighbors. Once again, Latin America is reeling from a crisis, this one fueled by the 
COVID pandemic and some really bad leadership in key countries. And in smaller countries like Haiti and Cuba other kinds of unrest is
unfolding. What can and should the US do? What about the rest of the hemisphere? And what will the region's number one trading and investment partner,
China, do going forward? We discuss with Council on Foreign Relations Latin America expert Shannon O'Neil and Ed Luce of the
Financial Times. Don't miss this episode.

      <title>"Dying is Easy, Democracy is Hard"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/dying-is-easy-democracy-is-hard</link>
      <description>It is said that an old actor on his deathbed once said, "Dying is easy. Comedy is hard." Whether that actually happened or not, the foreign policy equivalent may be "Invading a country is easy. Turning it into a democracy is hard." The US discovers this on the regular...and each time it is as though it had never happened before. We discuss with regard to Afghanistan...and many other instances. And if modern day Americans did not have enough evidence all around us to remind us of how tough it it is to establish and maintain a democracy, we suggest that perhaps you could have asked John Hanson, first president of the United States. Join Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School and host, David Rothkopf, for this lively and entertaining discussion.

      <description>Estimates now say 900,000 Americans died as a consequence of the COVID pandemic. But estimates suggest 40-90 percent of those deaths could have been avoided if the Trump Administration acted more swiftly, more effectively or more in concert with the advice of scientists. A new book dives deep into what happened behind the scenes in the administration and on this episode, we talk with one of the authors, Yasmeen Abutaleb. Join Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School, Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and host David Rothkopf for a discussion of this new best-seller, "Nightmare Scenario--Inside the Trump Administration's Response to the Pandemic that Changed History."

      <title>A Rhyme of History</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/a-rhyme-of-history</link>
      <description>The U.S. was questioning its ability to lead the world. The structures of the global economy seemed outdated. There were deep tensions between those who sought to put America first and those who recognized the future of US growth lay in the global economy. It sounds a lot like today. But it was 1971. In a brilliant new book, former Yale School of Management Dean and top U.S. government official Jeffrey E. Garten describes how over one weekend the leaders of the Nixon Administration got together and set a new course for the U.S. and the world economy. The resonances with today are unmistakable and the lessons are essential. We discuss with former U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Robert Hormats, Financial Times columnist Rana Foroohar and Garten. Don't miss this special episode of the podcast.

      <title>Is the Secret Objective of US Foreign Policy to be Just Tough Enough Not to Have to Do Anything?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/is-the-secret-objective-of-us-foreign-policy-to-be-just-toug</link>
      <description>There are many rumblings of a new Cold War brewing between the US and China. But the governments in Washington and Beijing both seem to be most focused on domestic political issues and maintaining power. Which might suggest that much of the ratcheting up of toughness between them is performative. Especially as a large global coalition is emerging that holds common views toward how China must behave to engage on the world stage in the leadership role it seeks. David Sanger of the New York Times, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center discuss. Join us.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/on-the-cusp-of-autocracy</link>
      <description>The threats to democracy in the US are building. The response is to call for new laws that first will require changes in the rules of the Senate. If we can get those changes, we should. But what if we can't? What is plan B? How do we avoid locking in changes to our system from which there is no recovery? Will holding Trump and Trumpists accountable for their abuses be any part of that. We discuss with democracy expert Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and formerly of the Obama White House and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security." It's a sobering but essential listen.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/deep-state-exclusive-the-very-first-podcast-of-2025</link>
      <description>To celebrate the fourth anniversary of Deep State Radio (which is to say something like 750 podcasts and a growing audience throughout), we have convened our inner circle of experts, our regular Deep State family, for a look four years from now. As you might expect, we have optimism, pessimism, realism, idealism, and a host of other flavors of outlook from which you can choose. It is the right way to celebrate the past four years and--especially--our deep gratitude to each and every Deep State nerd out there who has helped make the podcast and all of its spin-offs such a success. Don't miss it. And...thank you everybody! We look forward to the next four years!

      <title>Nearly Six Months After an Attempted Coup, We Have More Questions than Answers, More Evasion than Accountability</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/nearly-six-months-after-an-attempted-coup-we-have-more-quest</link>
      <description>Listening to FBI Director Christopher Wray before the Congress this week and last, his answers were long and yet achieved a kind of studied vacuousness. There was no there there. No substantive. No sense of responsibility for clear intelligence failures. No sense that we were getting to the root causes of the event. No sense that those really responsible for it will be brought to justice. And for all the reasons there was no sense that we will be able to avoid other such events in the future. Former FBI agent Frank Figliuzzi believes we won't. Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and his co-host David Rothkopf speak to Figliuzzi and former US attorney Barb McQuade about the questions Wray and others need to be asked...and answer. Join us for a substantive and disturbing conversation.

      <title>Perhaps It's Not Quite Time to Give Up on Our System of Justice</title>

      <description>The lack of accountability for Donald Trump and his cronies for the January 6th insurrection, for the serial obstruction of justice identified by the Mueller investigation, for his alleged fraud at the helm of the Trump Organization, for his efforts to intimidate state election officials in the wake of the 2020 election, for his serial sexual abuse cases...and for so much more...is deeply frustrating. Sometimes it feels as though he has gamed the system and will never be brought to justice. Allison Gill, host of the Daily Beans podcast, is a student of these cases and she counsels patience. We discuss what's next in these cases and on another front where she has been a courageous leader, sexual abuse in the military, with AG on this special edition of Deep State Radio. Don't miss it.

      <description>Terrorism expert Gina Ligon tells Jeanne Meserve that the Biden administration’s initiative on domestic extremism represents a ‘sea change’ in policy but doesn’t address the root causes of populist violence. Israeli counterterrorism dramas do, an American ex-pat writer in Jerusalem tells Jeff Stein, because so many involved have served in spy units.

      <title>A Far Cry from Helsinki: Biden and Putin to Set "Guardrails" and Manage Expectations</title>

      <description>When Vladimir Putin sits down with Joe Biden, both men will be well familiar with each other and Putin will have no illusions that he can toy with the new American president like he could with the last one. Joe Biden has been working at a high level in US foreign policy since 1973 (when Leonid Brezhnev was General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.) As Biden's Europe trip has demonstrated this past week, he is a savvy foreign policy professional who knows how to pull the levers of diplomacy behind the scenes. If not every speech is a barn burner, the results so far outstrip those of all his recent predecessors in their first years in office. We discuss the Putin meeting with David Sanger of the New York Times, who is traveling with the president, and Evelyn Farkas, former senior Obama Administration official and Russia specialist.

      <title>Is There a Future for the Democratic Party?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/is-there-a-future-for-the-democratic-party</link>
      <description>With Republicans variously arguing that vaccines make people magnetic and that the Forest Service should be able to reroute the Moon's orbit, you'd think the party would be headed for a bad end. Add in the corruption and the traitors and the insurrections and it is baffling there still is a GOP. Yet, that said, many observers are predicting the GOP will win the House and Senate in next year's midterm elections. If that happens, you can expect columns the morning after asking whether the party that stood up for truth and the rule of law has a future. We discuss this and what the Dems should do about it with James Hohmann of the Washington Post, Dr, Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and the Obama White House and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security." Don't miss this. Although you may want an adult beverage at hand while you listen.

        <![CDATA[<p>With Republicans variously arguing that vaccines make people magnetic and that the Forest Service should be able to reroute the Moon's orbit, you'd think the party would be headed for a bad end. Add in the corruption and the traitors and the insurrections and it is baffling there still is a GOP. Yet, that said, many observers are predicting the GOP will win the House and Senate in next year's midterm elections. If that happens, you can expect columns the morning after asking whether the party that stood up for truth and the rule of law has a future. We discuss this and what the Dems should do about it with James Hohmann of the Washington Post, Dr, Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and the Obama White House and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security." Don't miss this. Although you may want an adult beverage at hand while you listen. </p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Let's Make Diplomacy Boring Again</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/lets-make-diplomacy-boring-again</link>
      <description>Joe Biden is off to Europe. He will meet with Allies and with Vladimir Putin. Under Trump, that was a formula for headlines and disaster. Under all presidents such trips produce fraught analyses seeking to identify presidential doctrines and historic deliverables. But most of diplomacy is blocking and tackling. And much of it best done out of sight of the public. We discuss the upcoming trip with Atlantic columnist Tom Nichols, AEI's Kori Schake and Georgetown Law's Rosa Brooks and we come to the conclusion that "Biden Returns Home After Uneventful Trip" might be the best outcome of all. We also discuss what might be the tougher upcoming diplomatic trip in the next few days, that of Kamala Harris to Mexico and Central America. Don't miss it.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/cyber-counterpunch</link>
      <description>On this special edition of SpyTalk, co-host Jeanne Meserve speaks with William Evanina, former Director of the United States National Counterintelligence and Security Center about the recent spate of ransomware attacks. Evanina says President Biden should threaten to pull out of the upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that the US should demonstrate it is willing and able to shut down Russian infrastructure.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/this-is-a-song-about-disappointment</link>
      <description>The Democrats keep bending over backwards to "do what's right" or "preserve bipartisanship." Republicans meanwhile have made it clear they have no interest in doing what's right or bipartisanship. Is the Democratic strategy a way to get to enough votes to reform the filibuster and thereby thwart GOP efforts to gut democracy? Or is it the old story of Lucy, Charlie Brown and the football. The weeks ahead will reveal the truth. In the eyes of Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne, a moment of truth lies ahead. Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School and Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and the Obama White House join the discussion. Don't miss it.

      <description>Many are rightly focused on the importance of 2024's presidential elections and the midterms in 2022. But if we do not stop GOP efforts at voter suppression this year...which means ending the filibuster this year...and we don't create accountability for Trump Administration abuses, we will set in motion inevitable defeats not just for Democrats but for American democracy in the years ahead. We discuss with the American Enterprise Institute's Norm Ornstein, Brookings scholar Dr. Kavita Patel and co-editor of Just Security and Professor at NYU Law School Ryan Goodman. Don't miss it.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/americas-message-to-the-middle-east-were-broken-and-our-focu</link>
      <description>We've come to the end of another violent cycle between Israelis and Palestinians. Generally, the Biden Administration has gotten good grades for a policy that balanced active, behind the scenes efforts to bring the violence to a quick close with a desire not to get side-tracked from their main agenda items here at home. Where do we go from here? What did the crisis tell us is now different between Israelis and Palestinians? About American attitudes toward both sides? We discuss with well-known Middle East experts and commentators Rula Jebreal and Aaron David Miller and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute plus Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School. Also: Thoughts on how the US and the world should react to the shocking seizure of a journalist from a transiting Ryan Air jet by Belarus. Don't miss it.

      <title>How Do You Say "We Are Being Attacked by Radicals Who Want to Destroy Democracy" in a Way that Will Make People Care?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/how-do-you-say-we-are-being-attacked-by-radicals-who-want-to</link>
      <description>This week, the vast majority of Republicans on Capitol Hill sought to block a bipartisan commission that would investigate the attack that took place on January 6th and the factors leading up to it. Some even portrayed the attackers as the victims or as just a bunch of tourists visiting a national monument. It would have been shocking if it were not so commonplace. So the question becomes, do enough Americans even care about preserving our system of government to protect it? And if not, how can a sufficient number be motivated to care? We discuss with Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of Just Security and a professor at NYU Law School. It's an important discussion. Don't miss it.

      <title>When of the Two Most Likely Solutions One is Impossible and the other is Even Less Likely, What Then?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/when-of-the-two-most-likely-solutions-one-is-impossible-and-</link>
      <description>The past two weeks have revealed that the Israel-Palestine conflict remains far from a solution. Indeed, of the two most likely solutions discussed--a two-state "solution" or a one-state "solution"--both seem impossible. But the problem is a real one with profound human consequences in Israel and Palestine and great resonance in the US (often for the wrong reasons). We discuss the situation and our options with one of the most thoughtful observers and voices on these issues in the U.S., Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J-Street. Don't miss this thoughtful conversation on a complex and confounding problem.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/has-the-cia-lost-its-grip-on-the-middle-east</link>
      <description>CIA clandestine services veteran and longtime Middle East hand Marc Polymeropoulos tells Jeff Stein that the CIA no longer prizes regional expertise, instead opting for spy corps “generalists” who can be shifted from region to region. In this Special Edition of the SpyTalk podcast, Polymeropoulos laments the passing of Charlie Seidel, who he calls the CIA’s “last great Arabist.”

      <description>The Biden Administration is working hard to maintain a fairly traditional front for US-Israel relations during the current crisis. Which is to say they are essentially following the playbook the Obama Administration would have followed (Trump's bromance with Bibi was an outlier). But times are changing, the views of Democrats are changing, the generational outlook is changing, and don't forget Bibi's bromance with Trump which did not help matters. We discuss what could trigger a change with former top Israeli diplomat and foreign policy specialist Alon Pinkas, the American Enterprise Institute's Kori Schake and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School. Don't miss it.

      <title>What's Cooking in the Laboratories of Democracy</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/whats-cooking-in-the-laboratories-of-democracy</link>
      <description>It was Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis who popularized the phrase "states are laboratories of democracy." That has never been clearer than at this moment when some of the most important innovation in governing is coming from states...and some folks, notably on the right, are working on experiments that may end up crippling democracy or even killing it. To get a sense of what is going on at the state level in US politics, we take a look at one bellwether state, Virginia, through the eyes of one of its most promising political leaders, current gubernatorial candidate State Senator Jennifer McClellan. Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and formerly of the Obama White House and host David Rothkopf discuss with Senator McClellan some of the key issues in US politics today from voting rights to justice reform to child care and education. Don't miss it.

      <description>In the fourth edition of the SpyTalk podcast, former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen talks with co-host Jeanne Meserve about combatting “psychological warfare” disinformation attacks from Russia, China, Iran and even Venezuela, and former top CIA analyst Mathew Burrows tells her that US intelligence is so busy coping with immediate threats they “can’t see the forest for the trees.” Leading off the show, Jeff Stein talks with Janis Shinwari, an Afghan interpreter for US intelligence units, who says thousands of his comrades are terrified about being left behind and murdered by the Taliban when US forces leave in September.

      <description>The US could be back in the Iran nuclear accord by the end of the month. There are plenty of hurdles to that, of course, but it is not impossible. And if not by then, then perhaps it will happen by Fall. We discuss why that is likely to be a good thing with the Quincy Institute's Joe Cirincione, the American Enterprise Institute's Kori Schake, and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School. We also discuss violence in Israel, the challenges the situation there poses for the Biden team and...the future of the Italian monarchy. Which is how we got to the Instagram discussion in the first place. Don't miss it.

      <title>The Woman Who Invented Ronald Reagan</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-woman-who-invented-ronald-reagan</link>
      <description>Ronald Reagan would not have been president nor would he have enjoyed the successes he had as a politician without the active role played by his wife, Nancy. Often underestimated, sometimes the subject of gossipy slights, this woman was really one of the principle architects of a watershed presidency, among the very top advisors in an era in which some of the others including Washington titans like James Baker and George Bush. Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty has written what is already being hailed as the definitive biography of the former first lady, "The Triumph of Nancy Reagan." The book itself is a triumph and offers a vital insight into a watershed moment in modern American history. It also is rich with color including from the golden age of Hollywood. We discuss all that in a special one-on-one conversation with the author that you won't want to miss. Join us.

      <title>How Do We Get from Here to Accountability?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/how-do-we-get-from-here-to-accountability</link>
      <description>In an important ruling this week, Judge Amy Berman Jackson wrote a scathing assessment of the Barr Department of Justice's efforts to rationalize their handling of the serial obstruction of justice within the Trump Administration. This may have been another significant step toward getting some accountability for the last administration's serial abuses. The decision came in a case brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). We are joined by CREW president Noah Bookbinder and our regulars, NYU Law Professor and co-editor of Just Security Ryan Goodman and former senior Obama White House official and former Senate staffer Dr. Kavita Patel to discuss how, if ever, we might get from where we are toward bringing Trump and his associates to true justice. It's an important discussion that you won't want to miss. Join us.

      <title>Is this Just Indian Summer for Democracy in America?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/is-this-just-indian-summer-for-democracy-in-america</link>
      <description>Joe Biden is doing a remarkable job. Public support for Biden's bold economic initiatives is exceptionally high. But there are warning signs about what may be around the next bend in American politics. The GOP is punishing those in its ranks who dared to speak the truth. The most extreme actors on the right seem to have the best prospects. Republicans are posed to do well in the 2022 mid-terms. And if that happens, will this moment be seen as a momentary return to sanity before we continue the Trumpian slide to neo-fascism? Do threats to democracy elsewhere in the world, such as India, forebode ill as well? We discuss with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Max Boot of the Washington Post and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. Pour yourself a stiff drink and tune in.

      <title>A Stake Through the Heart of Reaganomics</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/a-stake-through-the-heart-of-reaganomics</link>
      <description>We are in the middle of an economic sea-change in the United States. The prevailing views of the past 40 years--call them Reaganomics or neo-liberalism or the Washington Consensus--are being pushed aside. The inequality they left in their wake are being addressed by new policies that focus on investing in the middle class and the most vulnerable. The leader of this revolution is not some young firebrand but a seasoned figure of the Washington establishment, President Joe Biden. We discuss his bold economic vision and its potential consequences with Ed Luce and Rana Foroohar of the Financial Times. It's a great, provocative discussion. Don' miss it.

      <title>Biden Gives the Most Kennedy-esque Rooseveltian Speech in History</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/biden-gives-the-most-kennedy-esque-rooseveltian-speech-in-hi</link>
      <description>Joe Biden spoke to a joint session of Congress and outlined an economic plan that exceeds in scope anything we have seen nearly a century. It was specific, doable, and would be paid for simply by restoring taxes to levels they were at past periods of American prosperity and growth. He framed it as not just urgent from a domestic perspective but critical to "winning the 21st Century", to our competition with China. Is it realistic? How will it become law? How will the GOP respond? What are the political consequences? (And what are the consequences of this weeks' raid on Rudy Giuliani's Upper East Side of Manhattan apartment?). We discuss with Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security." Don't miss it.

      <description>In the wake of the Derek Chauvin verdict, while there was a consensus that a degree of justice was achieved, that a massive job of work remained to end the long history of systemic racism in US law enforcement and throughout society. The question is how do we get there from here? Will government have the courage to stand up to special interests and produce the kind of real structural change that is necessary? Or will this issue be punted and produce further tragedies, abuses and social division? We discuss with former US attorney and host of the "Talking Feds" podcast Harry Litman and Dr. Kavita Patel, former senior official in the Obama White House. Join us.

      <title>A Tale of Two COVIDS</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/a-tale-of-two-covids</link>
      <description>On the one hand, America's vaccine roll out is making great progress. On the other, in the last week COVID cases are on the rise in 38 states. On the one hand, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are working remarkably well. On the other hand, Astra Zeneca and perhaps Johnson and Johnson not so much. (Or maybe the government is over-reacting to a very tiny number of problem cases with the J&amp;J vaccine.) On the one hand we know more about the disease. On the other hand it keeps changing and about a third of us just don't want to know the science. Where does this lead? We discuss with Pulitzer Prize-winner Laurie Garrett, former senior Obama health specialist Dr. Kavita Patel and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School. Also: A special conversation about latest revelations about Trump and Russia and the Biden team's response.

      <title>"The GOP Thinks of Politics Like Pro Wrestling"--A Conversation with Rep. Eric Swalwell</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-gop-thinks-of-politics-is-like-pro-wrestling-a-conversat</link>
      <description>Rep. Eric Swalwell of California has emerged as one of the most important voices in the Democratic Party. From his presidential campaign to his work during last year's impeachment hearings, he has stood out for both tough-mindedness and clarity. As the son and brother of police officers, he has strong views on how we need to reform policing in America in the wake of the abuses we have seen, especially in communities of color. This ties to his activism on the issue of gun control. We discuss both as well as his views on the Matt Gaetz scandal, the GOP's race to the bottom, the best strategy for a Democratic Party that must expand its margins in the Senate and House in 2022 and accountability for the Trump administration. Don't miss this insight-rich conversation.

      <description>The ancient Aztecs referred to the headache and misery following drunken debauchery as the "curse of 400 rabbits." Presidents need to try to avoid policies that produce similar reactions. So far the Biden Administration has been deft at doing so. Where might they go wrong? And what domestic policy priorities should they pursue to strengthen the US internationally? We discuss with Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School. Don't miss the conversation...which includes a special report from the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in Billings, Montana.

      <title>It's Not Too Early to Predict What Biden Era Politics Will Be Like</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/its-not-too-early-to-predict-what-biden-era-politics-will-be</link>
      <description>By this time during the presidency of the former guy, his national security advisor had been booted, the Muslim ban had been tried and Comey was days from getting fired. We also knew that the GOP was simply not going to do anything about even the worst things Trump was doing. So it's not too early to make some prognostications about about the political weather we can expect in the Biden Era. The bad news is, we already know the GOP is still Trump's GOP, obstructionist at best, anti-democratic, racist, corrupt and traitorous at worst. The good news is that so far, Joe Biden has managed to by-pass the Beltway and win bi-partisan support by listening to the American people and giving them the kind of programs and change the majority of them have long supported. Will this continue? What could result in a course change? We discuss with Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Washington Post, Dr. Kavita Patel, former Obama White House official and practicing physician and Ryan Goodman, NYU Law professor and co-editor of "Just Security." Join us.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/things-are-going-pretty-wellmaybe-its-time-to-start-worrying</link>
      <description>It is a matter of conventional wisdom nearly everywhere that the Biden Administration is off to a strong start. Which, life on this planet being what it is, leads us to ask, what could go wrong? Will Russia's saber-rattling in Ukraine turn into something worse? What about China's regarding Taiwan? Are there any good options in either case for Biden &amp; Co. What about the pandemic? We're doing better in the US but the rest of the world is being rocked by new problems. Could that drag us backward? Our regulars, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and David Sanger of the New York Times join us to discuss. Don't miss it.

      <description>Too much of world history is written by men about men for men. The result is that cultural biases of a male-centric world are reinforced. But another consequence is that the vitally important stories about heroic women who are shaping our communities an our futures go unnoticed. Gayle Tzemach Lemmon, author of the Daughters of Kobani, is addressing this shortcoming with powerful books telling the story of remarkable women across the greater Middle East. We discuss with her the future of the US in the region, the future of women in the region and how average American can make a difference in resetting our priorities. Don't miss it.

      <title>Kibbitizpalooza: Advice for the Biden Administration as they Roll Out Their Policies</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/kibbitizpalooza-advice-for-the-biden-administration-as-they-</link>
      <description>While we are only two months into the new administration (and it is getting good marks for those two months) it is never too early to start kibbitzing about how to do better. Can we go too far in direct our economic attention inward? What old policy positions can we let go of? How do we fix our defense planning and spending? Is there anything we can teach Europe to help them with their troubled vaccination roll outs? Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School offer their thoughts on areas we can do even better...and then they turn their attention to the great American infrastructure songbook. Don't miss it.

      <title>When Can We Go To War and Who Decides?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/when-can-we-go-to-war-and-who-decides</link>
      <description>Few decisions a government can make are more consequential than deciding when the use of force is warranted. In the US a debate has raged for decades about how much latitude a president should have in making such decisions and what role Congress should play. Legal contortionism has turned congressional authorizations for the use of force in one circumstance into blank permissions slips still cited by president decades later. This week, the Congress has begun to reconsider these profoundly important issues and we are joined by experts Steve Pomper, formerly of the Obama NSC, and Oona Hathaway, professor at Yale Law School, as well as regular co-host Ryan Goodman, co-editor of Just Security and professor at NYU Law School for a discussion on what changes are needed and which are possible. Don't miss it.

      <title>Ah, So This is What Having an Actual, Thought Out, Professional Foreign Policy Feels Like</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/ah-so-this-is-what-having-an-actual-thought-out-professional</link>
      <description>After four years of policy by Tweet that sometimes felt as if it were driven more by the indigestion of the Tweeter than by any connection to US interests, the Biden Administration has ushered in a striking change. Last week's US-China meetings in Anchorage, were acrimonious at times but appropriately so for a complex relationship and there seemed to be a clear method to the US approach. That was born out early this week when the US imposed meaningful sanctions on China for its abuses of the Uyghurs...in conjunction with our closest allies. We discuss where this and other recent developments lead with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and David Sanger of the New York Times. Don't miss it.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/is-filibuster-reform-now-more-likely-than-not</link>
      <description>Mitch McConnell has become so effective as an obstructionist force and the GOP has been so disciplined in their support of him, that he has left the Democrats with no alternative but to consider some form of filibuster reform. Even those who have opposed such steps in the past are now showing some signs of warming to some form of the idea. We discuss in a Q&amp;A with American Enterprise Institute emeritus scholar and one of the leading experts on this issue, Norm Ornstein. Join us for this important conversation.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-challenges-will-the-us-face-in-the-post-covid-world</link>
      <description>There are encouraging signs that the US will slowly begin to return to post-COVID normalcy by this summer or fall. Wall Street predictions for the economy for the third and fourth quarters of 2021 are rosy. What if that actually happens? What priorities will be next for the Biden Administration? What challenges may emerge worldwide that may draw its attention? We discuss with David Sanger of the NY Times, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law and author of the new book, Tangled Up in Blue. Don't miss it.

      <description>Yes, you heard that right. We've come to 50 days into the Biden presidency and things are actually working, getting better, Spring is in the air, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Admittedly, there's plenty of ways that despite the best efforts of the president and despite passage of the massive American Rescue Plan that we can screw this up. But who knows, we might not. Right? We discuss with Dr. Kavita Patel, former top official in the Obama White House and practicing physician, and with Ryan Goodman, professor at NYU Law School and co-editor of the Just Security website. Join us. It's not all bad news for a change.

      <title>"A Foreign Policy for the American People"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/a-foreign-policy-for-the-american-people</link>
      <description>Last week Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered a speech outlining the priorities of Biden-Harris Administration foreign policy. It differed from past such speeches in focus, tone and objectives. It described an approach in which, in the words of Blinken, the distinctions between foreign and domestic policy have "fallen away." It was also showed more humility and awareness that America had much work to do to repair our own democracy, immigration policies, and relationships around the world if we are to be successful. We discuss the speech and its implications with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations. We also begin with some observations on International Women's Day. Don't miss it.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/washington-got-you-pissed-off-us-too</link>
      <description>Weren't we supposed to get a break from being angry at DC? At the political inanity? The recklessness? The law breaking with impunity? Sure its the same old people being inane and reckless and breaking the law but even with Democrats in charge in the White House and in both houses of Congress, progress is painfully hard to come by, setbacks are frequent, Republicans seem disciplined and Democrats can't get together around core ideas. Or can they? Are there glimmers of hope? Patterns or opportunities that should trigger a little more optimism? We discuss with Greg Sargent of the Washington Post, Dr. Kavita Patel, of the Brookings Institution and formerly of the Obama White House and Ryan Goodman, professor at NYU Law School and co-editor of "Just Security." Join us. You might feel better.

      <description>ISIS was as unstoppable as their beliefs and actions were unconscionable when they arrived in Kobani. But there they were defeated by a force that not only outfought them on the battlefield but simultaneously obliterated their eleventh century ideology of the suppression and abuse of women. It was an army led in part by women, featuring fierce, capable women fighters many of whom just months earlier could hardly have imagined the circumstances that led to their triumph. Subsequently, the women of the Kurdish Women's Protection Units went on to many other victories and to win the admiration of military leaders and advocates of women's empowerment worldwide. Their story has been captured by best-selling author Gayle Tzemach Lemmon in a new book, "The Daughters of Kobani: A Story of Rebellion, Courage and Justice." It is an inspiring book, an important book and hopefully a book that will help change America's woefully bad policies toward the Kurds. We discuss it and those policies with Lemmon in a special edition of the podcast. Don't miss it.

      <title>Not an Enemy, Not Quite an Ally: America's Reset with Saudi Arabia...and the Middle East</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/not-an-enemy-not-quite-an-ally-americas-reset-with-saudi-ara</link>
      <description>Last week, the Biden Administration released the official conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was behind the brutal murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. It also detailed a host of measures to penalize the Saudis. Critics were unhappy there were no direct penalties for MBS. But the administration made it clear to the Saudis that the free ride they were getting with Donald Trump was over. Importantly, it all appeared to be part of a well-thought out broader Middle East policy that has regional analysts commenting that not only is Biden no Trump, he's also learned the lessons of the Obama years and is approaching things differently--in a good way. We discuss with Kim Ghattas, author of Black Wave: Saudi Arabia, Iran and the Forty-Year Rivalry That Unraveled Culture, Religion and Collective Memory in the Middle East, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and David Sanger of the NY Times. Join us.

      <title>The Accountability Conundrum: How Do We Form Commissions to Investigate 1/6 or COVID in the Current Political Environment?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-accountability-conundrum-how-do-we-form-commissions-to-i</link>
      <description>When the 9/11 Commission was formed in the wake of the Al Qaeda attacks on the US, the current was united in grief and anger but politically polarized and it was very difficult to find a path forward that would be credible and an effective driver of reform. But the divisions of the early 2000s were nothing compared to what we have today and the problem is compounded by the active culpability one political party has in both of the issues that demand investigation. So, how do we get to accountability today? We discuss this question with former 9/11 Commissioner, former Indiana congressman Tim Roemer as well as Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security" and Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and former senior Obama White House staffer. Join us.

      <description>The US has seen its influence plummet during the past four years as our president made everything including foreign policy about himself. That changed in an instant when Joe Biden was elected president, but now we must come to grips with the fact that in many areas our international and national security policies are woefully out of step with the times. Where should we go next on cyber policy, on nuclear policy, with China, with Russia, with our relations with the emerging world? We discuss with one of the most thoughtful and intelligent members of the United States Congress, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut. Don't miss his wide-ranging and insightful perspectives.

      <title>American Kompromat: Why Don't Americans Care More that Trump was a Russian Asset?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/american-kompromat-why-dont-americans-care-more-that-trump-w</link>

      <description>The Biden foreign policy and national security teams arrived to choruses of praise for the experience of the members and their general positions. That said a van full of orangutans would have been greeted as an improvement to Trump &amp; his motley crew. But what are the potential areas in which they will face challenges? And what does the world have in store for them that may change the calculus whether they want it to or not? We try to answer these questions on an episode featuring Harvard University's Steve Walt, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and author of the new book "Tangled Up in Blue," Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and David Sanger of the New York Times. Don't miss it.

      <title>On January 6, the Noose Was for Mike Pence...Now a Legal Noose Is Tightening Around Trump</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/on-january-6-the-noose-was-for-mike-pencenow-a-legal-noose-i</link>
      <description>While Trumpists may have celebrated that the disgraced former president was not convicted by the Senate and the Senators who voted to convict have been attacked for their show of conscience, the reality is that Trump's legal prospects are not good. Mitch McConnell, his one time ally, called for his prosecution. Multiple cases in which he is a target are under way--in NY, Atlanta, and Washington DC. A commission is being called to investigate the January 6th insurgency. We discuss where these may lead and how the GOP may handle the consequences with former Trump Admin senior staffer Olivia Troye and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security." Don't miss it.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/when-is-an-open-and-shut-case-not-an-open-and-shut-case</link>
      <description>The House Impeachment managers proved beyond any reasonable doubt that Donald Trump incited an insurrection against the US government that resulted in six deaths over 140 injuries and profound damage to our democracy. Good as they were, we have to admit, it wasn't that tough to do because we all saw the events unfold. So, ensuring justice will be done should be easy, right? Not so fast. The Senate Kangaroo court you will remember from a year ago is back in session and most of the GOP simply do not care about facts or the law or the Constitution or the judgment of history. Which is why Trump will be acquitted. But...what then? What does it mean? Can other prosecutions follow? We discuss with former US Attorney Barb McQuade, NYU Law's Ryan Goodman and Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution. We also include an update on a bunch of breaking COVID news with Kavita. So...don't miss this episode.

      <description>The House Impeachment managers are meticulously making an irrefutable case against former President Trump and they are meeting very little resistance from Trump's almost comically inept defense team. But what then? What if the vast majority of GOP Senators vote to acquit? (As they will.) Where does the party go from here? What will the influence of the small but noticeable Sanity Caucus be going forward? We discuss with two noted, brilliant commentators, Max Boot of the Washington Post and David Frum of the Atlantic. They answer questions from host David Rothkopf and from an audience that joined the discussion as part of our new, weekly, "Ask the Blob" Webinar Series. Join us.

      <title>The Joyce of Cooking: Judicial Reform, Domestic Terrorism and How to Frost a Cake</title>

      <description>MSNBC legal analyst Joyce Vance joins the podcast this week, and we discuss highly unrelated topics such as pet chickens and how necessary judicial reforms can create a more equitable legal system. Vance’s straight talk on the future of the Department of Justice and how current laws can handle domestic terrorism offers hope for the future. Cake helps, and Joyce and Marissa make a British Bake-Off-worthy coffee-pecan layer cake with praline topping.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/in-search-of-the-republican-taliban-we-can-work-with</link>
      <description>Has the GOP lost its mind? Or is its embrace and defense of lunatics, violent extremists, traitors, sex offenders, racists and the highly corrupt a shrewd, carefully considered political strategy? How should Democrats respond? How do they get accountability for abuses when the GOP absolutely refuses to go along? How do they achieve progress on healing our wounds when the other party actively wants to deepen them? And what kind of role will President Biden play in all this? What has he already shown us? We discuss with Dr. Kavita Patel, former top health advisor in the Obama White House, Rosa Brooks, professor at Georgetown Law School and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of "Just Security" and professor at NYU Law School. It's a great wide ranging conversation that you won't want to miss. Join us.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/rays-of-hope-a-conversation-with-tom-friedman</link>
      <description>This is a complex moment for America and for the world. It is a far cry from the euphoria of the immediate post-Cold War, tech boom era. But there were foreshadowings we would grapple with today's problems and three-time Pulitzer Prize Winner, NY Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman identified them more than two decades ago in his book "The Lexus and the Olive Tree." We talk with Tom about how we got from then to now and where potential answers to the challenges we face may lie...including why Joe Biden may be precisely the man the world and the US need in the Oval Office right now. It's a must-listen conversation. Join us.

      <title>What Does the FBI Know That Congress Doesn't?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-does-the-fbi-know-that-congress-doesnt</link>
      <description>"The FBI Way" is a terrific new book from 25 year FBI veteran and MSNBC contributor Frank Figliuzzi. It details the values within the FBI that have enabled it to succeed so frequently in the past as well as discussing where mistakes have been made and how they have been remedied. The book is rich with stories many of which intersect with the headlines of the past few years. We discuss the book with Frank but also explore his views on the insurrection on Capitol Hill, on accountability, and on America's urgent need to pass a domestic terrorism law. It's a riveting discussion. Don't miss it.

      <description>Today’s episode features Kavita Patel, practicing physician and former health and economics policy advisor in the Obama Administration.

      <title>Was Trump's Coup Attempt on January 6th the Start of Something Much Worse?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/was-trumps-coup-attempt-on-january-6th-the-start-of-somethin</link>
      <description>While some may look at the Trump coup attempt on January 6th as the last desperate act of the disgraced former president to remain in power, it is already being seen among white supremacist groups as a long expected signal of an escalation in domestic unrest leading to a civil war they have long planned and hoped for. The fact that Trump is likely to go unpunished for leading the January 6th effort and the Republican Party is taking a strong stand against accountability for that assault may only make matters worse. We discuss the case for Trump's conviction by the Senate, how we got to the 6th and what it augurs for the future with Elizabeth Neumann, Director of the Republican Accountability Project and former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of "Just Security" and professor of law at NYU Law School. Don't miss this chilling conversation.

      <title>Filibusted: Getting to the Truth About What's Wrong with the US Senate</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/filibusted-getting-to-the-truth-about-whats-wrong-with-the-u</link>
      <description>Senate "institutionalists" claim the filibuster is a traditional US Senate tool that produces compromise. Nope. It's a tool that was almost never used during the first 200 years of US history. And when it was used it was almost always used to promote a racist agenda. And now that it is used more often, it is used to obstruct and give disproportionate power to Republicans. The first step to eliminating it is understanding it and that is why we talk to veteran Senate staffer Adam Jentleson, author of an important new book "Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy." We discuss what has turned the U.S. Senate from "the world's greatest deliberative body to the place legislation goes to die" and how to fix it. Don't miss this timely conversation.

      <title>Et Voila!  A New America Emerges Overnight!</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/et-voila-a-new-america-emerges-overnight</link>
      <description>The past four years have left deep scars in the United States. Damage has been done. So can a new administration come in and restore America's role in the world overnight? Just because it wants to? Just because it has experienced senior officials leading the way? Just because the new US president is a foreign policy expert? The short and perhaps somewhat surprising answer is...yes. Yes, the changes will be big, swift and the world is already starting to notice. We discuss the whys and whos and hows of this with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Tom Nichols of the US Naval War College and David Sanger of the New York Times. Don't miss this discussion that kicks off a new era in US history.

      <description>Today's episode features a conversation with therapist and author of Too Much and Never Enough, Mary L. Trump. We make brownies -- because if warm brownies were needed any week, this was surely it. Mary, a psychologist who specializes in trauma and psychopathology, shares new insights into why Donald will never concede, how our traumatized nation can heal, and what Donald’s parents would think of their son as President. Listen as Mary and Marissa uncover the surprising reason President Trump has such an affinity for Russia. Plus: A great recipe for gluten-free double-chocolate brownies.

      <title>Ask the Experts: How Do We Make January 6 a Positive Turning Point for America?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/ask-the-experts-how-do-we-make-january-6-a-positive-turning-</link>
      <description>We have never seen events like those that occurred on January 6. We have never had a president who posed the kind of threat to our security presented by Donald Trump. We are facing new challenges to our society and government associated with social media and widespread radicalization. How do we respond to these challenges? Who must be held accountable? We conducted a webinar with three experts--Asha Rangappa, former FBI Agent and currently a senior lecturer at Yale's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, Harry Litman, former US Attorney and Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of Just Security and professor at NYU Law School. Our listeners asked them questions. You'll be interested in their answers. Join us.

      <description>While Donald Trump richly deserved the two impeachments that have placed him in the history books, it is arguable that his greatest offenses and failures were associated with grotesque mismanagement of the COVID crisis. Where has that left us and what challenges does it present for the Biden Administration? We discuss with our two regular COVID experts Pultizer Prize winning author Laurie Garrett and former top Obama White House health policy advisor Dr. Kavita Patel. This is an essential listen. Join us.

      <title>The Trump Coup: A Week in Washington Like No Other</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-trump-coup-a-week-in-washington-like-no-other</link>
      <description>In the midst of a pandemic, with almost 4000 people dying every day, when the nation should be coming together, the President of the United States once again tore it asunder. Worse, what he did was mobilize the first violent coup attempt in US history on the back of his months long seditious efforts to nullify the November election and steal the sovereign power of American voters. As it happens, he also did it on a week when the Democratic Party secured control of the US Senate, another development with seismic consequences in Washington. We discuss these events and their meaning with former Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams advisor Karen Finney, election law specialist Rick Hasen, former Obama health policy advisor Dr. Kavita Patel and NYU Law Professor and co-editor of "Just Security" Ryan Goodman. It's an important deep dive into the meaning behind the events of an extraordinary week. Join us.

      <title>Too Famous: Stories and Baking with Kathy Griffin</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/too-famous-stories-and-baking-with-kathy-griffin</link>
      <description>Today's episode features a conversation with comedian Kathy Griffin. I tried to teach her to bake lemon bars and she tried to convince me she was too famous to have to know how to bake. But what she does do, brilliantly, is tell stories and the conversation we had while waiting for her lemon bars to come out of the oven is worth listening to. (The lemon bars are worth making too.)

      <title>Our Escalating Cyberwar with Russia: What Can Biden Do?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/our-escalating-cyberwar-with-russia-what-can-biden-do</link>
      <description>We have endured one of the most massive cyberattacks in history this year. While the US Secretary of State, Attorney General and the intelligence community attribute it to Russia, the president does not. When he has not been silent on it, he has been deflecting attention to the Chinese. All this means we can count on the Trump team doing very little in response to this attack. So the burden shifts to the incoming Biden team. They have no playbook to call upon as the Obama Administration also was not strong on these issues. A response is called for. What should it be? What will make us safer? We discuss with cyber experts David Sanger of the New York Times and Dmitri Alperovitch, former CTO of CrowdStrike. Don't miss this special edition.

      <title>American Democracy's Near Death Experience: How Do We Recover and Ensure It Doesn't Happen Again?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/american-democracys-near-death-experience-how-do-we-recover-</link>
      <description>Donald Trump sat in the Oval Office this weekend discussing whether to send in US troops to declare martial law and nullify a legitimate election. The idea was rebuffed. Perhaps it's the last we'll hear of it. But looking back at the past four years it is clear that we had a president with strongman aspirations and they were far more successful than many imagined possible in the US. How do we respond to that so our system does not face another near death experience like we've just been through? We discuss with Ruth Ben-Ghiat, author of "Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present," Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law Center and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute. Tune in for this thought provoking discussion.

      <title>Why Having the Most Diverse Cabinet in History Matters</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/why-having-the-most-diverse-cabinet-in-history-matters</link>
      <description>Joe Biden's cabinet will look more like America than any in our history. It will contain more women, more people of color, a wide range of ages, political perspectives and regional points of view. Does that matter? How? And what is still missing? We discuss and then we turn our attention to the latest developments in the COVID crisis, Trump's increasingly erratic behavior as his exit approaches and when, if ever, life may return to "normal." It's a conversation with our regulars Dr. Kavita Patel, former head of health policy in the Obama White House, and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of "Just Security" and professor at NYU Law School. You won't want to miss it.

      <description>No president has ever entered the job with more foreign policy experience than Joe Biden, who has been playing a role at the highest levels of U.S. international affairs since 1972. Nonetheless, the world continues to rapidly change and the new president will be quickly presented with challenges none of his predecessors have faced. We know what some of those are--from COVID to the challenge of succeeding a president who refuses to exit the office gracefully. But the world certainly has others in store. We discuss how Biden and his team will respond to them with someone in a unique position to know, long-time Biden advisor and friend Tom Donilon, who served as national security advisor to President Obama. Ed Luce of the Financial Times and host David Rothkopf pose the questions on this must listen special edition of DSR.

      <title>Can America Ever Lead Again?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/can-america-ever-lead-again</link>
      <description>Donald Trump was the worst president in US history. About that, at this point, there can be no doubt. One measure of the disaster he has been is the damage he has done to US foreign policy. Fortunately for the United States, the next president is coming into office with more foreign policy experience than any president since George H.W. Bush...and arguably considerably more than even Bush. And his first-rate team has long-experience with one another and are ready to hit the ground running as of day one. The question is: What should their priorities be? We discuss with former US Under Secretary of State Ambassador Nicholas Burns of Harvard's Kennedy School, Mieke Eoyang, who runs national security programs at the Third Way organization and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. Don't miss this thought-provoking and forward looking discussion.

      <title>Trump's Endgame: How Bad Can it Get?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/trumps-endgame-how-bad-can-it-get</link>
      <description>Despite his historic losing streak in the courts (not to mention his big election loss), Donald Trump continues to argue he was robbed. And many in his own party are supporting Trump's arguments and his baseless conspiracy theories. In fact the vast majority of Republicans now believe what is a complete fairy tale from a president who, whether he likes it or not, has just a few short weeks left in office. What is the significance of this extraordinary GOP unity around what amounts to nothing less than a coup attempt, an effort to disenfranchise millions of American voters simply because they did not support Trump. We discuss with NYU Law School's Ryan Goodman and former FBI special agent and senior lecturer at Yale's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs Asha Rangappa. Don't miss it.

      <title>The One in Which They Scare the Shit Out of You</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-one-in-which-they-scare-the-shit-out-of-you</link>
      <description>We are about to enter a period of national catastrophe unlike any we have ever seen, unlike the past year, unlike wars through which we have lived. Mass death during this time is preventable if you listen to scientists and use common sense. But half the country does not. They have embraced an 11th Century combination of superstition and ignorance and are condemning their relatives, their neighbors and their friends to death. Even with a vaccine and competent administration on the horizon, the next three months will be terrible and the crisis may linger into next summer. For all these reasons, listen to this special conversation with Dr. Kavita Patel, a practicing physician who is also a former top Obama White House health policy official, Laurie Garrett, Pulitzer Prize-winning expert on pandemics, and Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School. It is a conversation you will want to share with your family and friends.

      <description>We went from the bi-polar world to the uni-polar world to WTF. The question now is "What comes after WTF?" Is it a restoration? An attempt to squeeze out another few years of the American Century? Decline? More confusion? Or is it an effort to remake the international order in collaboration with other leading nations? We discuss with Quincy Institute co-founder and author of "Tomorrow the World" Stephen Wertheim, Georgetown University Law Center's Rosa Brooks, the American Enterprise Institute's Kori Schake and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. It is a conversation that goes to the heart of what's next in U.S. foreign and national security policy. Don't miss it.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/megashocker-a-normal-conversation-about-policy-and-politics</link>
      <description>We go where no one else dares: To imagine a Trumpless future, a normal American president doing normal American president-y things like making domestic and foreign policy, succeeding sometimes, faltering other times and doing his best for the American people. Yes, we bring together a great group of experts to have a discussion about what the Biden Administration is likely to look like, how it will differ from the Obama years, where successes are likely and where we have concerns. Joining the conversation are Harvard University's Stephen Walt, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs Ivo Daalder, former senior Obama White House staffer Dr. Kavita Patel and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security." It will transport you into a world you might not have thought you'd ever see again. Join us.

        <![CDATA[<p>We go where no one else dares: To imagine a Trumpless future, a normal American president doing normal American president-y things like making domestic and foreign policy, succeeding sometimes, faltering other times and doing his best for the American people. Yes, we bring together a great group of experts to have a discussion about what the Biden Administration is likely to look like, how it will differ from the Obama years, where successes are likely and where we have concerns. Joining the conversation are Harvard University's Stephen Walt, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs Ivo Daalder, former senior Obama White House staffer Dr. Kavita Patel and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security." It will transport you into a world you might not have thought you'd ever see again. Join us.</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>Pulitzer Prize-winner Tom Ricks, one of America's foremost journalists and authors, has a new book called "First Principles: What America's Founders Learned from the Greeks and Romans and How That Shaped Our Country" and it could not be more timely. It challenges many assumptions about the ideas leading to America's foundings and sheds light on many of the problems we are grappling with today. Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, and host David Rothkopf discuss with Ricks what led him to write the book and some of its surprising, stirring and most-thought provoking revelations. Join us.

      <description>Donald Trump's defeat is a watershed in modern U.S. history and a relief for so many of us that it may do permanent damage to the sales of Tums and headache medications. Which is a good thing. But, having said that, huge challenges remain for the US and the world. We discuss with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Ben Ehrenreich, award-winning author whose most recent article is "How Do You Know When Society is About to Fall Apart?" (Ben, by the way, is Rosa's brother!).

      <description>Someday soon Tuesday November 3 will end. It may not be for a few weeks. Our president seems to want to make sure it never ends...because when it does, likely, he will too. But someday it'll happen and we'll have to figure out what hit us and what's going to happen next. To tackle that big job, we have a special broadcast that will include an extraordinary array of commentators. During our first half we are joined by Max Boot of the Washington Post, David Sanger of the New York Times and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute. In our second half, we are joined by author Mary Trump, the FT's Ed Luce, former Hillary Clinton campaign spokesperson Karen Finney and the Third Way's Mieke Eoyang. They offer insights you won't hear anywhere else. Join us.

      <title>What to Do When Your Politics is as Broken as Ours?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-to-do-when-your-politics-is-as-broken-as-ours</link>
      <description>With Election Day looming this year, Americans began to shutter their windows, put up plywood on the storefronts and they watched National Guard troops rumble into their cities. What should be a celebration of democracy and possibilities is has gained an air of dread we've never seen in most of our lifetimes. That suggests that regardless of the election's outcome, we face much deeper problems in our society. How do we address those? We discuss with Nils Gilman of the Berggruen Institute, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute. Perhaps it is a time to ask some very fundamental questions. Please join us for this thought-provoking discussion.

      <title>Pray but Verify: Can We Trust Our Upcoming Elections?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/pray-but-verify-can-we-trust-our-upcoming-elections</link>
      <description>We all remember Russia's interference in the last election and we know they are back this time, joined, it seems, by the Iranians. But foreign threats are not the only challenges to election security or the reliability of our results next week. We have the potential for domestic hacking, the possibility of voter suppression, the absence of verifiable audits in 47 out of 50 states, the unreliability of some systems, the track record of some election oversight officials for fiddling the results (we're looking at you Georgia), stacked courts, and the public posture of the President and his team that are calling results into question even before they have occured. How do we know the results are real? How do we protect the process? We discuss with three people who have been actively considering these issues, election security analyst and lawyer, Jennifer Cohn, David Sanger of the New York Times, and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law Center. It's a discussion you should not miss. 
Correction: Jennifer mentioned Vermont as one of the states conducting risk limiting election audits but she meant to say Virginia.

      <title>Can We Get There From Here: The Precarious Path to "The Third Reconstruction"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/can-we-get-there-from-here-the-precarious-path-to-the-third-</link>
      <description>A Democratic victory in the 2020 elections is not a sure thing. As we have discussed on other episodes, the elections are fraught with risks. Further, once an election takes place, there are many ways that the President or his allies can try to cling to power. Only after there is a smooth transition and new leadership however, can the US turn to the business of effectively confronting our looming challenges associated with the pandemic, economic recovery and the climate crisis. Rising to those challenges could be a moment of great hope, even of rebirth, for the United States. We discuss how we get there from here with Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland), one of the very smartest members of the U.S. Congress, and with our regulars, Dr. Kavita Patel, former senior official in the Obama White House and Ryan Goodman, professor at NYU Law School and co-editor of "Just Security." Don't miss it.

      <title>And Now for Something Completely Different: Optimism.</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/and-now-for-something-completely-different-optimism</link>
      <description>We know, we know. This is no time for complacency. This is no time to minimize the challenges we face. This is no time to assume anything about the election or its aftermath. We must work hard and be on guard against abuses. But...what if things turn out as the polls suggest they might? What if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and a Democratic Senate and Congress win? Might government, dare we say it, become boring again? Might competency make us turn away from it all out of indifference? And might the experience of the Trump years and resistance to the threat he and the Trumpists have posed to democracy in America have positive consequences, have reminded us what we value in government and our leaders? Might it all have brought some of us closer together? We dare to discuss our guarded optimism in this moment with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Joe Cirincione of the Quincy Institute. Join us.

      <title>The Man Who Ran Washington</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-man-who-ran-washington</link>
      <description>In this special episode we discuss "The Man Who Ran Washington: The Life and Times of James A. Baker III," the landmark biography of one of the real titans of the Washington scene over the past half century, with its authors, New Yorker staff writer Susan Glasser and NY Times Chief White House Correspondent Peter Baker. The book is not only a compelling life story, it is also a lens via which to see the shift from the old Washington of "wise men" and deal-makers who knew how to compromise and valued competence to the manic, dysfunctional world of Donald Trump and scorched earth Republicans like Mitch McConnell. Join us for a deep dive into an important, large and complex life and how it impacts us all to this very day.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-view-from-inside-the-trump-white-house-it-aint-pretty</link>
      <description>Some of the most hard-hitting and shocking criticisms of Donald Trump have come from insiders in his administration. From Rex Tillerson’s calling his former boss a “fucking moron” to his former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats saying that having watched Trump up close the only conclusion he could draw was that the Russian’s had something on the president. Miles Taylor, former chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security, and Olivia Troye, a former top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence are among the most vocal former insiders turned critic. On this edition of Deep State Radio join them, NYU Law School Professor Ryan Goodman and former White House senior health advisor Dr. Kavita Patel to get a glimpse of the dysfunction up close. Join us.

      <title>The Most Successful Covert Operation Since the Trojan Horse...and It Wasn't So Covert</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-most-successful-covert-operation-since-the-trojan-horsea</link>
      <description>Russia has been trying to weaken the United States since the first days of the Cold War. But in that entire span of three-quarters of a century, even with the success of its spies and counter-espionage measures, it has never had a series of successes such as those it has enjoyed since 2016. As Tim Weiner, author of an important new book on Russia, "The Folly and the Glory," says, the reason for that is due to the fact that Russia has been actively and continuously aided and abetted by the occupant of the Oval Office, the president of the United States. On this special podcast, we discuss Tim's new book with General James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence, and Laura Rosenberger, former Obama NSC and State Department official who now heads the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund. No punches are pulled. This is a powerfully unsettling discussion and our experts predictions for the immediate future demand the attention of all of us. Tune in.

      <title>Will American Tear Itself Apart?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/will-american-tear-itself-apart</link>
      <description>One of our regulars, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, had an article in the Weekend FT called "Will America tear itself apart: The Supreme Court, 2020 elections and a looming constitutional crisis." It is an incisive look into a profoundly important set of challenges America faces in fixing elements of our constitutional system that are currently malfunctioning or a source of tension. Government by a super-empowered minority or "malaportionment" is one. The related problem of the electoral college is another. The politicization of our judiciary is a third. For this special deep dive into the ideas related to the article we are joined by Ed, governance expert Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute and, also from AEI, Kori Schake, the head of their foreign policy and national security programs. Join us for this important conversation.

      <title>From a Wannabe Authoritarian to the Perfect Weapon</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/from-a-wannabe-authoritarian-to-the-perfect-weapon</link>
      <description>Donald Trump has unleashed resources of his government to support his campaign against Joe Biden in a way that America would condemn were it the behavior of any foreign government. In fact, as David Sanger pointed out in a recent NY Times article, he has crossed lines that may damage America's standing for years to come. We discuss that article and a host of recent foreign policy developments with David as well as Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law Center and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute. Then, we get an exclusive preview with David of the upcoming HBO documentary based on his best-selling book "The Perfect Weapon." It's deeply relevant to politics today as well as to critical strategic choices any new president will have to make. Don't miss this wide-ranging and fascinating discussion.

      <description>The debate this week was a trainwreck inside a dog's breakfast wrapped in bad acid trip. It was, despite the best efforts of Joe Biden to discuss the issues, chaotic. But that's what President Trump wanted. Because it distracts from 200,000 dead from COVID, tens of millions unemployed and revelations about his taxes and his manifold failures as a business leader. We discuss those taxes, failings and the debate to get to core issues he was trying to avoid with our guests, NYU Law Professor Daniel Shaviro, journalist David Corn of Mother Jones and former senior Obama White House official, Dr. Kavita Patel.

      <title>Our Unfolding Democratic Emergency: The Red Lights are Already Flashing</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/our-unfolding-democratic-emergency-the-red-lights-are-alread</link>
      <description>The Constitutional rot of the past four years has set the stage for the corruption of our institutions and, equally importantly, for growing delegitimization of our government. This plays into the hands of a president who is ever more desperate to cling to power lest he lose his fortune and his freedom. This in turn has experts who are studying the preparations for the November 3 election to express deep concern that we may be heading into a period of profound crisis for our system, one that, should Trump prevail in undermining the will of the people could mean the collapse of our system and a the onset of a period of national chaos. This is not abstract. Critical, dangerous steps confirming this is the direction we are headed are already taking place. We discuss with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Barton Gellman, Rosa Brooks of the Georgetown Law Center and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. It is essential listening.

      <description>The President of the United States has deliberately raised questions about whether our democratic system will work properly while actively working to ensure it does not. From voting to the courts to the enforcement of our laws, our institutions seem more fragile and at risk than at any moment since the civil war. What does this mean for the remainder of this political campaign and its aftermath? We discuss with three of the smartest political observers we know, Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, Karen Finney, former spokesperson for Hillary Clinton, and David Frum of the Atlantic. Don't miss their wide-ranging and incisive conversation.

        <![CDATA[<p>The President of the United States has deliberately raised questions about whether our democratic system will work properly while actively working to ensure it does not. From voting to the courts to the enforcement of our laws, our institutions seem more fragile and at risk than at any moment since the civil war. What does this mean for the remainder of this political campaign and its aftermath? We discuss with three of the smartest political observers we know, Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, Karen Finney, former spokesperson for Hillary Clinton, and David Frum of the Atlantic. Don't miss their wide-ranging and incisive conversation.</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Have We Already Seen the October Surprise?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/have-we-already-seen-the-october-surprise</link>
      <description>Is a resurgent COVID the October Surprise? Is it the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Will it be the nomination and approval of a replacement for her prior to the election? Will it be the announcement of a vaccine? Or is it tied to the president's reluctance to guarantee a peaceful hand-over of power if he loses. We discuss these options and others with Mimi Rocah, candidate for Westchester, NY, District Attorney, Katie Barlow, attorney and journalist, and Dr. Kavita Patel, practicing physician and former senior Obama White House aide. Co-hosts Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and David Rothkopf of The DSR Network explore the implications of this week's developments on all these issues with our guests and the discussion is riveting. Join us.

      <description>Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a rarity in Washington, a true hero, one of those voices who would not be silenced by conventional wisdom or the zeitgeist or politics or the pushback of the powerful. Her loss therefore is not simply the loss of a dependably progressive viewpoint on America's highest court, it is of a true leader and individual of integrity at a moment when those are a rarity in Washington. The entire US government is, at this moment, suffering from a crisis of legitimacy from which it cannot recover without a new generation--and an army--of RBGs. We discuss with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Mieke Eoyang of the Third Way and Edward Luce of the Financial Times. Join us.

      <title>The Question That Looms Above the Trump Presidency</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-question-that-looms-above-the-trump-presidency</link>
      <description>Michael Schmidt's new book "Donald Trump v. The United States: Inside the Struggle to Stop a President" is one of the required reads of this moment in our history. It gets deep inside the effort to protect the president as the Russia investigation closed in around him. But it also underscores what that investigation did not uncover. Indeed the central question remains: What explains Trump's behavior toward Russia during the campaign in 2016 and ever since. We discuss the book and this question with Michael in a riveting one-on-one that you will not want to miss. Join us.

      <title>Donald Trump's "Avalanche of Outrageousness": The Perspectives of Peter Strzok</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/donald-trumps-avalanche-of-outrageousness-the-perspectives-o</link>
      <description>Peter Strzok is one of America's most respected, experienced counterintelligence specialists. His career at the FBI reads like a thriller and as a consequence, so does his new book "Compromised: Counterintelligence and the Threat of Donald J. Trump." At the center of course, is Strzok's role in the investigation of Trump, the controversy that led to his departure from the FBI and, most importantly, what he and his colleagues uncovered about Trump. In our conversation with Strzok, Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and David Rothkopf, explore the facts of the counterintel case against Trump and what threats loom for the US from Russian interference in this November's election. From Barr's abuses to the failings of Senate and IG investigations, this candid discussion should not be missed.

      <description>The divide between the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and centrists has dogged the party for years and hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016. Thanks to equal parts good planning, good will and the urgency of the threat America faces, that divide has been minimized this year with Biden working closely with progressive leaders like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and AOC. The question is: What will happen to progressive concerns should Biden become president? And how does the progressive agenda on defense, climate and other issues fit with the views of Americans of both parties. We discuss with former co-chair of the Bernie Sanders campaign, Representative Ro Khanna of California, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute. Join us for this wide ranging, thought provoking discussion.

      <title>Is There a Cure for What Ails the GOP?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/is-there-a-cure-for-what-ails-the-gop</link>
      <description>The Republican Party not only produced the corrupt, failed presidency of Donald Trump, but it has supported Trump at every turn. What is to be done with a party that embraces a president who is a traitor, a con man, a racist, a serial abuser of women? We sat down with two notable former Republicans, Washington Post columnist Max Boot and political scientist and commentator Tom Nichols to discuss what comes next for the GOP. Their answers suggest that a defeat of Donald Trump will not be enough to fix what is broken within the party. Indeed, one suggests it essential to vote against Republicans on every level on every ballot whereas the other warns it might require decades of defeats of this dysfunctional, dangerous incarnation of what was once the party of Lincoln. Join us for this thought-provoking conversation.

      <title>We are at 65 9/11s and Counting...Where Do We Go From Here?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/we-are-at-65-911s-and-countingwhere-do-we-go-from-here</link>
      <description>The two defining crises of the past 40 years in the US have been the 9/11 attacks and the COVID crisis. In both cases, government lies and bad government policies made matters much worse. In both cases, hundreds of thousands died as a result. The wars that resulted from 9/11 still fester. And as for the COVID crisis, we could see the number of dead in the US double before the end of the year...because the president is so resistant to doing what's right. With the publication of Bob Woodward's new book, all this is reframed and we discuss with two of America's leading experts, Pulitzer Prize-winner Laurie Garrett and former Obama WH senior health official Dr. Kavita Patel. Join co-hosts Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School and David Rothkopf for this vitally important episode.

      <title>While Trump Tries to Bury the Russia Story, Russia is Still Trying to Bury Us</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/while-trump-tries-to-bury-the-russia-story-russia-is-still-t</link>
      <description>As former U.S. Under Secretary of State Richard Stengel says during this special podcast, when he interviewed Putin several years ago, the Russian president cited the collapse of the USSR as the greatest tragedy of the past century. And, as Richard notes, Putin has been on the attack against what he perceives as those that brought Russia down ever since. This led to his support for Donald Trump in 2016 and once again, it leads him to support Trump again in 2020. And Trump is returning the favor, making it harder for Congress and the American people to know what Russia is up to, harder to defend against them and even spreading disinformation to minimize the Russian threat. We discuss the latest developments in this, one of the great stories of our time, with Stengel, a former managing editor of Time Magazine, Natasha Bertrand of Politico and Graham Brookie, Director and Managing Editor of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. Join co-hosts Ryan Goodman of Just Security and NYU Law School and David Rothkopf of the DSR Network, for this important, insight-rich episode.

      <title>The Worst Term We Can Think of For Trump...is a Second Term</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-worst-term-we-can-think-of-for-trumpis-a-second-term</link>
      <description>After the lawlessness and lies of the GOP convention it is clearer than ever that another term in office for Donald Trump would be devastating for democracy in America. And given the willingness of the GOP to violate the law and the fragility of political leads in times like these, you would have to be, in the words of our regular Rosa Brooks, deranged to think Trump might not achieve victory in November. We discuss that possibility, the conventions, yet another instance of police barbarism, further mishandling of the coronavirus crisis and more with Rosa, with former Obama White House official Dr. Kavita Patel and with NYU Law School's Ryan Goodman. Don't miss this thought-provoking if disturbing episode.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/foreign-policy-takes-a-holiday-welcome-to-campaign-season-20</link>
      <description>Every four years a heated debate occurs among foreign policy and national security nerds about why foreign policy and national security just don't seem to be so important in our presidential campaigns. But 2020 will be different right? After all, Russia attacked our last elections, a global pandemic and economic crisis has paralyzed the country, China is a rising threat...wherever you look there are big international issues of central concern. Everywhere you look, that is, except the political conventions last week and this week. Then...crickets. We discuss why with David Sanger of the New York Times and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute. Don't miss this episode.

      <title>The End of the Great Russia Hoax Hoax</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-end-of-the-great-russia-hoax-hoax</link>
      <description>There is one and only one major hoax associated with the relationship between Donald Trump and the Russian government during the 2016 elections. That's the hoax hoax, Trump's denials that he worked with Russian intelligence to get elected. This week's report from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence should finally set that hoax to rest. The bipartisan report not only documents in detail how closely Team Trump worked with the GRU, it also detailed many of the ways they sought to obstruct justice, hide evidence and impede investigators. We discuss the report with four experts: Natasha Bertrand of Politico, Michael Weiss of The Daily Beast, Josh Campbell of CNN and Susan Hennessey of Lawfare. And then, while we're at it, we discuss what the Russians are up to now since 2016 was such a big success for them. Don't miss it.

      <title>What Do the United States and Belarus Have in Common?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-do-the-united-states-and-belarus-have-in-common</link>
      <description>As many US observers watched brave Belarussians take to the streets to protest the rigged election engineered by their autocratic president, they wondered aloud on social media whether the US would soon be going through the same thing. We too have an autocratic president. He too depends on the support of Vladimir Putin. He too has no respect for democracy and is working to rig our upcoming elections. Anger is building among Americans, as well, and many worry that the next step after an unfair election will be taking to the streets. Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute discuss. Don't miss it.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-thomas-hobbes-did-on-his-summer-vacation</link>
      <description>We summarize a busy and disturbing week of world events with a bit of free-association between Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Kori Schake of AEI and David Sanger of the New York Times. It takes us from Bill Barr suggesting Democrats were adherents of French enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau to the reality that Barr is much more a Hobbesian to other Hobbesians from Minsk to Hong Kong to a president who can't handle the truth and an intelligence community and White House staff that seems scared to give it to him. And then from there we go to why as bad as COVID has been we're grateful for the opportunity to wear gym clothes most of the time. You won't want to miss any of it. Tune in now.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/we-are-in-the-worst-case-scenariowhats-next</link>
      <description>In this special Agenda 2021 episode, we bring together three of America's top expert commentators on the COVID crisis to discuss where we are in the crisis, what may impact it between now and the election and then what the first 100 days health policy priorities for a Joe Biden Administration ought to be. Pulitzer Prize Winner Laurie Garrett, former Baltimore Health Commissioner and practicing ER physician Dr. Leana Wen and former senior Obama health advisor and practicing physician Dr. Kavita Patel join for a hard-hitting assessment of why things are so bad, why they may get worse and why a Biden Administration will have to be bold in its response to undoing the damage their predecessors have done. Don't miss this crucial discussion.

      <title>Election 2020, What Could Go Wrong?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/election-2020-what-could-go-wrong</link>
      <description>America has had disputed election results in the past. 2016 comes to mind. So does 2000. So does 1876. But, in all these cases and with all the instances of trying to fiddle with democracy that have marked our history, there has never been a case where the President of the United States and his entire executive branch seemed so committed to rigging the election in their favor or, short of that, to throwing the election results into doubt. Whether it is seeking foreign intervention (again) or threatening to postpone the vote, creating false doubts around mail in ballots or working with the postal service to ensure as many ballots arrive too late to be counted as possible, via disinformation or voter suppression, our democratic processes are likely to be under siege this November. The questions we must grapple with are what might that look like and what is to be done about it. We are joined by a group that has recently participated in scenario exercises on just this subject. Our own Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University was one of the organizers and DSR regular Ed Luce of the FT was a participant. In addition to them, guests include Bill Kristol, editor-at-large of The Bulwark and Col. Lawrence Wilkerson of the College of William &amp; Mary. It's a vital discussion. Don't miss it.

      <title>Our Enemies are Laughing Now, Wait Until You See What a Second Trump Term Looks Like</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/our-enemies-are-laughing-now-wait-until-you-see-what-a-secon</link>
      <description>In Russia, they refer to Trump as being "theirs." In France, the president muses about how Europe should prepare for an America that is no longer an ally. In China, they know they are gaining with every setback the U.S. faces. But what if Trump is re-elected? What will it mean for the rule of law in America? Will Bill Barr be a kind of Prime Minister of a Trump Junta? Will it be the end for NATO and the international order? Might it mean the end for our domestic institutions? For the American experiment? The answer, in the eyes of our experts, is yes. Join Kori Schake of AEI, Ed Luce of the FT and Tom Nichols of the Naval War College and the Harvard Extension School for a discussion of the unthinkable tomorrow that could very well be right around the corner.

      <title>When it Comes to National Security, this Administration is "Holding a Gun to Our Own Heads and Threatening to Shoot"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/when-it-comes-to-national-security</link>
      <description>In a remarkable 50 year career in government that has seen him as Secretary of Defense, Director of the CIA, White House Chief of Staff, Director of the Office of Management and Budget and in Congressional leadership, Leon Panetta has seen it all. But, he tells us in an exclusive Agenda 2021 interview, he has never seen anything like the situation we're in now. We discuss Trump's COVID leadership failure, his kowtowing to Putin, his ignoring the threat posed by Russian bounties on US troops, and his weakening of NATO. Then we turn to the vital national security priorities that a Biden Administration must address come January--and they go far beyond merely undoing the damage Trump has done. This is a masterclass in government and policy from one of the great master public servants of our time. Do not miss it.

      <title>Preparing for the Next Trump-Barr Crime Wave: Stealing the Election</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/preparing-for-the-next-trump-barr-crime-wave</link>
      <description>Thanks to his trusty personal defense attorney Bill Barr and his defender in the Senate Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump has gotten away with betraying his country, enriching himself at the expense of the public, sidestepping national security rules, quashing his opponents and rewarding enemies of the US around the world. But, for now, we have to view that as water under the bridge. An election is coming up and everything Trump and Barr have said or done this week and over the past few weeks makes it clear that they will stop at nothing to win or to discredit a loss should it occur. They will suppress votes, make it harder to vote, send federal forces into Democratic cities, undermine the Post Office, issue reports targeting the Obama Administration, seek dirt from Ukraine on Joe Biden...and much, much more. We discuss where all this may lead with an amazing panel including former US Attorney Barb McQuade, counsel to House Impeachment Committee Norm Eisen, former US Attorney and creator and host of The Talking Feds podcast, Harry Litman and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and co-editor of "Just Security." Don't miss this vital discussion.

        <![CDATA[<p>Thanks to his trusty personal defense attorney Bill Barr and his defender in the Senate Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump has gotten away with betraying his country, enriching himself at the expense of the public, sidestepping national security rules, quashing his opponents and rewarding enemies of the US around the world. But, for now, we have to view that as water under the bridge. An election is coming up and everything Trump and Barr have said or done this week and over the past few weeks makes it clear that they will stop at nothing to win or to discredit a loss should it occur. They will suppress votes, make it harder to vote, send federal forces into Democratic cities, undermine the Post Office, issue reports targeting the Obama Administration, seek dirt from Ukraine on Joe Biden...and much, much more. We discuss where all this may lead with an amazing panel including former US Attorney Barb McQuade, counsel to House Impeachment Committee Norm Eisen, former US Attorney and creator and host of The Talking Feds podcast, Harry Litman and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and co-editor of "Just Security." Don't miss this vital discussion.</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>"The End of White Politics" is Now</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-end-of-white-politics-is-now</link>
      <description>Commentator and political pro Zerlina Maxwell's book "The End of White Politics" could not be better timed. It comes in the summer of BLM and COVID when America's racial inequities and their costs could not be clearer. But it also comes as America begins a 25 year transition to becoming a society in which whites are in the minority for the first time in our history. The GOP is seeking to play on the fear those changes instill in white America. Will Democrats step up to seize the moment and become the party that produces the transformational changes America's emerging majority demands? We discuss with Maxwell, one of the smartest observers of American politics and a woman with a vision for the future of American politics that must not be ignored. Don't miss it. (And buy her excellent book.)

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/donald-will-never-get-betterand-hes-only-going-to-get-worse</link>
      <description>No one has provided the insight into the pathologies that define Donald Trump and his presidency like Trump's niece, Mary L. Trump. Her book, "Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man" is a brilliantly written, harrowing tale of familial dysfunction and how it produced the most corrupt president in U.S. history. Join David Sanger of the New York Times and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center as they explore with Mary how we got where we are, why the president is so easily manipulated by foreign despots and how much worse things can yet become. From denying the election outcome to a second term in which he so unfettered that as Mary warns, it may well lead to the end of the American experiment. Essential listening. Download this episode now.

      <description>Viruses occur in nature. So do epidemics. But where most of the world's leading economies managed the COVID crisis well enough to control it? America under Trump made error after error. What went wrong? Who's to blame other than Trump? Where will this all lead? We discuss with experts Dr. Kavita Patel, former top Obama health advisor, Jeremy Konyndyk, also a former advisor on epidemics to the Obama Administration, David Sanger of the New York Times and co-host Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School. Don't miss this troubling analysis of how we got where we are and why it may get worse from here.

      <title>Are We About to Enter a New Era in Climate Policy?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/are-we-about-to-enter-a-new-era-in-climate-policy</link>
      <description>Any Democratic president would immediately work to reverse the damage that the Trump Administration has done to climate and environmental policies in the U.S. But there are signs that a Biden Administration may represent a major change on these policies even when contrasted with its Democratic predecessors. The climate crisis has worsened, a rising generation sees climate as a top priority, Biden has begun to listen carefully to green leaders from the progressive wing of the party and major, essential progress seems possible. We discuss the damage Trump has done and what that progress might look like in the latest edition of our Agenda 2021 series of conversations with two of the foremost climate, environmental and energy policy leaders in the Democratic Party, Carol Browner, who served as head of the EPA in the Clinton Administration and head of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Policy during the Obama Administration and David Sandalow who has served in top energy and environment related posts in the White House and at the State and Energy Departments. Don't miss this important conversation.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-is-the-world-capital-of-omnishambolic-clusterfuckery</link>
      <description>Some national governments are clusterfucks. Others are omnishambles. But a rare few are both. Is Donald Trump's America the capital of omnishambolic clusterfuckery? Boris Johnson's UK? Jair Bolsonaro's Brazil? Do really bad leaders like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi have a shot at topping this league table? And from what part of the world will come the big international story that shocks everyone in the run up to the US elections in November? Will the Russians make a move against Ukraine? Will tension rise in the Straits of Taiwan? Will Trump invade New York City. We discuss with Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and our old friend, recent Congressional candidate, Evelyn Farkas. Don't miss it.

Is Donald Trump's America the capital of omnishambolic clusterfuckery? Boris Johnson's UK? Jair Bolsonaro's Brazil? Do really bad leaders like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi have a shot at topping this league table? And from what part of the world will come the big international story that shocks everyone in the run up to the US elections in November? Will the Russians make a move against Ukraine? Will tension rise in the Straits of Taiwan? Will Trump invade New York City. We discuss with Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and our old friend, recent Congressional candidate, Evelyn Farkas. Don't miss it.</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>200,000 Dead by August?  Who Will Be Held Accountable for the Crimes Now Being Committed Against the American People?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/200000-dead-by-august-who-will-be-held-accountable-for-the-c</link>
      <description>The Trump Administration and its allies in key statehouses are suppressing vital data about the spread of COVID. Without that data,
tens of thousands of more Americans will die. Crimes are being committed. Who will be held responsible? And who, if anyone has a plan to get us out of this rapidly worsening situation? We discuss with Pultizer Prize-winning author Laurie Garrett and former Obama Administration White House advisor on health issues, Dr. Kavita Patel. The chilling implications of this discussion are important to understand for you, your family and for the entire U.S.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/if-the-president-were-a-military-officer-he-would-be-court-m</link>
      <description>Rep. Anthony Brown, (D-Maryland), Vice Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, with a distinguished military career behind him, joins our regulars to discuss how the military is responding to major challenges before it, from its need to address major diversity problems in its ranks to the current movement to rename military bases currently bearing the names of the Confederate leaders to the expanding Russian bounty scandal in Afghanistan. Brown has led the way on helping the military address its diversity needs--including promoting more women and people of color to being generals or admirals and reducing discrimination and mistreatment in the military justice system. He also states clearly on this podcast that if Trump were a military leader his dereliction of duty on the Afghan bounty matter would lead to his court-martial. Don't miss this discussion also featuring our regulars Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and Edward Luce of the Financial Times.

      <title>A Good Day for the Constitution, A Mixed Bag for Trump &amp; a Bad Day for Barr</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/a-good-day-for-the-constitution-a-mixed-bag-for-trump</link>
      <description>The Supreme Court rulings on Trump's taxes put a stake through the heart of the absurd idea that U.S. presidents had absolute immunity and underscored the right of states to prosecute a sitting president. While they left some avenues for further delay for Trump and his battery of lawyers, it is now clear that sooner or later prosecutors will have the chance to review the president's financial records and indictments seem very likely to follow. As for Barr, not only did he lose the immunity argument that has been central to his fallacious and dangerous notion of a unitary presidency, he also was called out for lying and thuggish tactics by former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman, a Trump appointee to the post. We discuss the meaning of all these developments with Mimi Rocah, a 16 year veteran of the SDNY and the presumptive Democratic nominee to be the next district attorney in Westchester, NY and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of "Just Security" and a professor at NYU Law School. Please join us.

      <description>This episode of our Agenda 2021 series is a one-on-one conversation with General James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence and prior to that Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. We discuss President Trump's pattern of placing Russian interests ahead of our own, his attacks on the foundations of our national security, why a second Trump term will be "like the first one on steroids," what a President Biden should do to repair the damage done by Trump and how to draw a new generation into service of our national security despite the damage done by "truth decay" in Washington. It is an absolutely riveting, essential podcast. Don't miss it.

      <title>We do not have a federal government</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/we-do-not-have-a-federal-government</link>
      <description>The most charitable interpretation of the events surrounding the Russian bounty scandal is that we have suffered a catastrophic breakdown in our policy processes. But the scandal likely reveals other, even larger, internal crises--a government wide set of leadership failures from COVID to the economy to social unrest to this national security scandal and, of course, the President's pattern of putting Russia before America in his thoughts and as the prime beneficiary of his actions. We discuss this extraordinarily disturbing series of events with former Trump Special Envoy and advisor to President's Obama, Bush and Clinton, Brett McGurk, former Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe Mark Hertling and Vice President for the Third Way's National Security Program Mieke Eoyang. Join co-hosts Ryan Goodman of Just Security and David Rothkopf for this special episode.

      <title>What's the Worst Thing About the Russian-Afghan Bounty on Allied Troops Scandal?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/whats-the-worst-thing-about-the-russian-afghan-bounty-on-all</link>
      <description>The Russian-Afghan bounty on allied troops scandal is rocking the White House. But it is actually many scandals in one. There is the scandal that Russia sought to pay to have US and allied forces killed, the scandal associated with the president's assertion he never heard about it, the scandal that exist if he did hear about it and didn't do anything about it, the compounding of that last scandal that occurs because he sought to reward the Russians in the wake of this news becoming known, and the scandal of keeping this information from the U.S. Congress. But as our panel--Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Kori Schake of AEI, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and David Sanger of the NY Times--point out, there is another scandal brewing. And that is that this entire matter may have no impact at all--politically, on Trump or, once again, on the Russians. (They have literally attacked Americans every way imaginable and have discovered that under Trump there are absolutely no consequences.) Don't miss this conversation on this big breaking story.

      <title>Justice Started Out Blind, But at the Moment that May be the Least of Her Problems</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/justice-started-out-blind</link>
      <description>Have we ever seen an Attorney General so contemptuous of the law? A Department of Justice so dedicated to promulgating injustice? A judiciary so full of political hacks and incompetents? The U.S. justice system is broken and few weeks have illustrated that quite so well as the one just passed--from the effort to oust the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York to a court ruling supporting the politically-motivated DoJ efforts to drop charges against Michael Flynn, from hearings revealing political bias and pressure with Main Justice to further revelations about Bill Barr's heavy hand in directing the police against peaceful protestors in Lafayette Park, it has been a profoundly disturbing week. We discuss it and what the summer may hold with three exceptional experts, former US Attorney Barb McQuade, former US Attorney Harry Litman and NYU Law Professor and co-editor of "Just Security" Ryan Goodman. Join us for an eye-opening discussion.

      <title>Nobel Prize Winner Joseph Stiglitz on the Way Out from the Crisis</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/nobel-prize-winner-joseph-stiglitz-on-the-way-out-from-the-c</link>
      <description>We face an extraordinary challenge--a massive economic crisis and a great public health crisis, each feeding into one another. Our government's response thus far has exacerbated both. To recover is going to require big ideas and bold execution from the next president of the United States. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz offers some of those ideas and thoughts on how a Biden Administration could make them a reality in the latest edition of our Agenda 2021 series. It is essential listening on issues from how to create millions of jobs to how to save our cities and states from an even greater crisis, from how to foster a green recovery to what lessons the G.I. Bill may offer for those thinking about the issue of reparations. Join us!

      <title>The Song of the Summer of 2020 is Likely to Be a Sad One</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-song-of-the-summer-of-2020-is-likely-to-be-a-sad-one</link>
      <description>To commemorate the beginning of summer, we take a look at the issues likely to dominate the headlines between now and Labor Day, from COVID to unrest in the streets, the economic crisis to potential cyberattacks, from foreign policy threats to the navel gazing of the narcissist-in-chief. We talk to Natasha Bertrand, national security correspondent for Politico, Chris Lu, former Cabinet Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Labor for President Obama and David Sanger of the New York Times to try to understand why the weeks just ahead are likely to be unsettling and for many Americans, a deepening crisis. You won't want to miss this insight-rich conversation.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-covid-prognosis-is-bleak</link>
      <description>Everywhere you go, you get the sense that people are "over" COVID...except the hospitals that are filling up across the country. In fact, the anti-science populism of some political leaders and the short-attention span of some in the media are combining to make the next six months of the COVID crisis look potentially more deadly and more challenging than the last six months. How bad can it get? What's to be done? We discussed with three of the country's leading experts: former Baltimore Public Health Commissioner, professor and practicing physician, Dr. Leana Wen, former Obama White House health advisor and practicing physician, Dr. Kavita Patel and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Laurie Garrett. You won't want to miss this.

      <description>John Bolton's book has Washington in a tizzy. Whether the rest of the country cares that much, whether anyone will see it as revelatory, whether it has any impact on the election and whether Bolton will ever see a penny of profit from it are all open questions. We discuss the book's aftershocks with David Sanger of the New York Times, Greg Sargent of the Washington Post and Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School. It's a special episode. Don't miss it.

      <title>Third Anniversary Episode: The Protests are America Healing</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/third-anniversary-episode-the-protests-are-america-healing</link>
      <description>In honor of three years of doing "Deep State Radio", the original gang of Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Kori Schake of AEI and David Sanger of the New York Times join host David Rothkopf for a discussion of the biggest stories that have taken place during the past three years that have not involved the president of the US. That's right--an entirely He Who Shall Not Be Named-free episode! Is the big story the end of China's ascendancy? The decline of the EU? The pandemic? Russia's return on its investments in destabilizing the West? Or...turning our focus back to the US...is it that the country is stronger than even the enemies within our borders, than even those who are in power right now? Are the protests a sign that America is healing, that we will triumph over He Who We Really and Truly Did Not Name Even Once During an Entire Episode? Tune in to find out.

      <title>Is This a “Break Glass in Emergency” Moment?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/is-this-a-break-glass-in-emergency-moment</link>
      <description>Donald Trump says he's never even heard of Brett McGurk, but that's what he says whenever he feels jilted. On today's episode of Deep State Radio, Rosa Brooks stands in for David Rothkopf as host, and DSR regulars Ryan Goodman and David Sanger are joined by Brett McGurk, who hurt Trump's feelings very badly when he resigned as Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL in late 2018. Rosa, Brett, David and Ryan talk about whether the last week has been a "break glass in emergency" moment for the nation's senior military leaders, whether everyone left in the Trump administration should resign en masse, and whether the US need an ROTC-type program for future diplomats. David admits to having a pet cow, Rosa defends the ugly chair in her Zoom background and admires Sebastian Gorka's leather vest, and Kori Schake's laugh is sorely missed. Don’t miss it!

      <title>The Top 5 Economic Steps a Biden Administration Should Take in 2021</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-top-5-economic-steps-a-biden-administration-should-take</link>
      <description>We are in a deep economic crisis today, the worst unemployment crisis since the Great Depression. While some recovery from the worst of the crisis is possible prior to the election, whomever takes office in 2021 will have major challenges before him. In this, the latest in our Agenda 2021 series of podcasts, we discuss how to tackle those challenges with the man who served as Chairman of Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisors, Harvard professor Jason Furman. Ed Luce of the Financial Times and host, David Rothkopf, pose questions concerning how we create the jobs we need, combat inequality, reimagine trade policy and more and Furman answers with the kind of clarity and specificity that is both rare and welcome at a moment like this one. Don't miss it.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/a-category-5-global-economic-hurricane-is-looming</link>
      <description>According to economist Ricardo Hausmann of Harvard's Kennedy School, the economic crisis triggered by the COVID pandemic is going to be very different from any we have faced in memory. It will be different in scope, in severity, in what it may demand of afflicted governments, and in what it will demand of the global financial system. It is a massive problem and observes Hausmann, one of the world's foremost development economists, we are ill-prepared to deal with it. We discuss the challenges with him and Edward Luce of the Financial Times, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law Center. Don't miss this thought-provoking conversation.

      <title>Lies, Damned Lies and Lies Trump Doesn't Even Realize Are Lies</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/lies-damned-lies-and-lies-trump-doesnt-even-realize-are-lies</link>
      <description>If Parson Weems, who wrote of little George Washington's inability to tell a lie, were to write the story of Donald Trump and the cherry tree, you can bet that the president-to-be would be portrayed as saying "I would never lie, Father, I'm the hugest truth teller there is. And nobody has done more for cherry trees than me." Lying is what Trump does. It is who he is. And this week we have seen how those lies could be twisted into a threat against democracy itself. We discuss the lies and this disturbing, potential turning point of a week with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School and with special guest Glenn Kessler, of the Washington Post, co-author of an important new book "Donald Trump and His Assault on Truth: The President's Falsehoods, Misleading Claims and Flat-Out Lies." Don't miss it.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-difference-will-an-election-make-democracy-and-human-ri</link>
      <description>There is no question that the Trump Administration has been a dramatic departure from past US Administrations on issues like democracy promotion, human rights and protecting press freedoms. Autocrats have been embraced. Press freedoms and free speech have been under siege here in the U.S. What would change if Joe Biden took office next January? In the second of our Agenda 2021 series, Amb. Derek Mitchell, President of the National Democratic Institute, Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America and author of the forthcoming Dare to Speak: Defending Free Speech for All (HarperCollins, July 2020) and Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch discuss global trends, and policy shifts they expect and that they would like to see. Don't miss this important discussion.

      <title>What Fresh Hell Is This? Or This? And What About This One Over Here?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-fresh-hell-is-this-or-this-and-what-about-this-one-over</link>
      <description>As if a public health catastrophe and an economic disaster were not enough, America is now rocked by the worst civil unrest in 50 years. And, to make matters worse, the president is...making matters worse. Wherever he can he is pouring gasoline onto the flames. Having declared the riots the result of the work of far-left "terrorists" Trump is seeking to militarize the racial, political and regional conflicts he has been fomenting since the first day of his campaign. Where does this lead? How do each of these crises intersect with one another? We discuss with Juliette Kayyem of the Harvard Kennedy School, Jeremy Konyndyk of the Center for Global Development, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. Worried about a long hot summer? This conversation will give you the chills.

      <title>The Crisis Enters a New Phase: Are We Making Progress or Simply Facing or Even Creating New Risks?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-crisis-enters-a-new-phase-are-we-making-progress-or-simp</link>
      <description>America is re-opening. Whether we should be or not is beside the point. It is happening. So the question becomes how do we manage that re-opening and what risks may be emerging that we are ill-prepared for? Some are public health risks? Some have to do with adapting to a new way of life. In addition, just as we face the greatest public health crisis in a century, we witness the scene of a police officer crushing a man's throat and killing him which forces us to address yet another dimension of all this--how can we trust our government to keep us safe? We discuss with Dr. Leana Wen, a practicing physician and former Health Commissioner of Baltimore, Dr. Kavita Patel, also a physician and former WH official during the Obama Administration and our regular co-host Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security." It is a sobering, incisive discussion. Don't miss it.

      <description>It is possible that in January 2021, America may welcome a president with more foreign policy experience than anyone who has assumed the office in more than three decades. That will be vitally important given the damage that Trump has done to our institutions, relationships and interests at home and abroad. In the first of our "Agenda 2021" series of podcasts exploring the priorities a new president ought to pursue, we speak with two distinguished American foreign policy leaders, both who have held the job of Deputy Secretary of State, Ambassador Bill Burns, president of the Carnegie Endowment and the top foreign policy advisor to the Biden campaign Tony Blinken. If you care about the future of America's role in the world, you won't want to miss this.

      <description>COVID has taken such a ghastly human and economic toll that people can speak of or think of little else. That's dangerous. Because opportunists and worse are seeking to take advantage of the fog of this moment to advance dangerous or unsavory agendas. From China moving against democracy in Hong Kong to Russia upping the ante in Libya, from Netanyahu planning illegal annexations of Palestinian territory to the US pulling out of important international treaties, serious risks are rising. Further Trump himself might use the crisis as an excuse to reschedule or suspend elections in the U.S. Far-fetched? We shouldn't count on it. Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, David Sanger of the New York Times and Joe Cirincione of the Ploughshares Fund join for this unsettling episode. Don't miss it.

      <title>Rosie the Riveter Would Have Worn a Mask--Trump Must Too</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/rosie-the-riveter-would-have-worn-a-mask-trump-must-too</link>
      <description>Donald Trump likes to talk a lot about being a wartime president. But wartime presidents lead by example and inspire the country to set aside politics to focus on a common goal. This week, Trump is headed to Michigan to view how the state went from being the arsenal of democracy in the 40s to the "arsenal of health" today. According to Rep. Debbie Dingell who represents Michigan's 12th Congressional District, factory workers will be watching closely as they know the right example and practices are key to opening factories and restoring their livelihoods. Dingell joins us for a special conversation about the crisis, the solution she thinks is required (infrastructure plays a big role), and how Trump is likely to fare in that key battleground state later this year. She's felt the brunt of this national disaster in very personal ways and her passion about the urgency of recovery is palpable throughout our conversation. Do not miss it.

      <title>You Think It's Bad Combatting a Pandemic with Leaders Who Don't Understand Science?  Just Wait.</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/you-think-its-bad-combatting-a-pandemic-with-leaders-who-don</link>
      <description>In many ways, one of the unexpected side-effects of the COVID pandemic has been a rapid acceleration of the application of new technologies and the adaptation to technology driven new realities. From the ubiquity of Zoom to tele-medicine, from a focus on biotech to living our lives and conducting our work remotely, we've been given a taste of the world to come. On the heels of these changes are coming transformational technologies associated with artificial intelligence, robotics and more. What demands might those make of our leaders in the future--from polices forces to the highest level policymakers? Peter W. Singer and August Cole describe that world in a riveting new novel that is based entirely on what's really going on in emerging technologies, "Burn-In: A Novel of the Real Robotic Revolution." Peter Singer joins Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute for a discussion about the book and about how it ties into both this moment in our history and our immediate future. Don't miss it.

      <title>Our Next Great National Challenge is to Rebuild Our Economy: Where Do We Begin?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/our-next-great-national-challenge-is-to-rebuild</link>
      <description>Almost 40 million Americans have lost their jobs in the past 8 weeks. That is a quarter of the workforce. We have never faced a crisis like this one. How we choose to rebuild will be the decision that will define us all in history's eyes. Gene Sperling was the top White House economic advisor for both President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama. He has written a book that addresses the core question that must precede the rebuilding: What is our goal? How will we measure success? His answer is that we must place human dignity at the center of our policy decisions. His book is called "On Economic Dignity" and he discusses it with Ed Luce of the Financial Times and host David Rothkopf. It is discussion that gets to the very core of who we are as a country and who we aspire to be. Don't miss it.

      <title>Kill the Body and the Head Will Fall</title>

      <description>In boxing, repeated body blows are seen as a way to bring down an adversary. We will soon see whether the repeated body blows the US economy and society have endured during this crisis will have the same effect on the Administration that is seen as having at the very least left the country undefended against them and that very likely exacerbated the impact of those blows. We discuss the state of the current crisis and its knock on effects with former US Deputy Labor Secretary Chris Lu, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Kori Schake of AEI and Ed Luce of the FT. Join us.

      <title>Do We Need a Marshall Plan for the United States America?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/do-we-need-a-marshall-plan-for-the-united-states-america</link>
      <description>With more than 33 million people claiming unemployment insurance in the past six weeks, 75,000 reported dead of COVID, 1.3 million reported infected with the disease and an unprecedented social crisis that now has 1 in 5 mothers of young children fearing they will be unable to provide their children with the food they need, the U.S. faces its worst domestic crisis since the Civil War. The government we have is actively seeking to deny the truth, undermine our institutions and cash in on the disaster. We discuss how we can respond with an exceptional panel including Congressman Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland), former Obama WH official and practicing physician Dr. Kavita Patel, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and Ryan Goodman, editor of "Just Security" and professor at NYU Law School.
It is a shocking moment and a vital conversation. Join us.

      <description>60,000 Americans are dead. 1 million are infected. And those are just the official numbers. 30 million are unemployed. And Jared Kushner declares "Success!" And Trump's approval rating rises. But the coronavirus pays no attention. The total dead is probably closer to 85,000. The total infected may be as high as 15 million. And we're just getting started. There are global and domestic waves to come. Does anyone--in either party--have a strategic plan to deal with this? We discuss with Pultizer Prize-winning science journalist Laurie Garrett, the FT's Ed Luce and Just Security Editor-in-Chief Ryan Goodman. It's a chilling, essential episode.

      <title>Is Kim Jong Un Dead or Collecting Shells at the Beach on His "Staycation"?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/is-kim-jong-un-dead-or-collecting-shells-at-the-beach-on-his</link>
      <description>Is Kim Jong Un dead? Chilling at the beach? Succumbing to an overdose of cheese? Will he fully recover? Or will he be succeeded by his sister? His uncle? His two year old son? We bring together three of the world's leading North Korea experts--Anna Fifield, author of "The Great Successor", the definitive biography of Kim and the Washington Post's Beijing Bureau Chief, former Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and the New York Times' David Sanger--to contemplate what's really going on and what it means. Also, they consider the rapidly declining U.S.-China relationship and what all this may mean for the US elections and beyond. It's a great discussion you won't want to miss. Join us.

      <title>Taking a Closer Look at that Oncoming Train</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/taking-a-closer-look-at-that-oncoming-train</link>
      <description>The President of the United States keeps talking about the light at the end of the tunnel. But even his top economic advisors don't expect the economic aftershocks of this crisis to end for 18 months or more. Those shocks will be severe, throwing the whole world into depression, perhaps 195 million people to unemployment, 130 million people to severe food insecurity, raising the possibility of famine in 55 countries, and generally creating negative global and US national economic and social conditions that no person alive has ever seen. All of those will in turn have massive knock-on effects including the technological, the psychological and more. Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Ed Luce of the Financial Times discuss, providing a rare long-term perspective in this moment dominated by daily headlines and uncertainty. Don't miss it.

      <title>What Do We Do in Lieu of a President?: The View from the Medical and the Political Front Lines</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-do-we-do-in-lieu-of-a-president-the-view-from-the-medic</link>
      <description>As Angela Merkel observed this week, we are just in the first stages of this crisis. As many Americans have observed, we would be better off if we had a leader like Angela Merkel. But we don't. And we won't until January at the earliest. So what can we practically do to save lives and protect each other? We turn to Dr. Craig Spencer, Dr. Kavita Patel, Ed Luce and Ryan Goodman to discuss our options and it is a discussion you can't afford to miss. Clear perspectives from the medical front lines and the political front lines that are essential at this moment in time.

      <title>Is Trump a Man or a Mouse?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/is-trump-a-man-or-a-mouse</link>
      <description>Trump is a wannabe authoritarian who has consistently abused the power of his office and sought to place himself above the law. Trump is also a president who, when faced with a crisis, failed to use the resources of the U.S. government to help the American people. As it turns out, both things are true...but the question is, as we enter the next phase of this crisis and the run up to the election, which Trump will show up? The aspiring tyrant or the quivering mouse? We discuss with Juliette Kayyem and Stephen Walt of Harvard's Kennedy School, with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and with Kori Schake of AEI. Don't miss it.

      <title>The Upside of the Apocalypse</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-upside-of-the-apocalypse</link>
      <description>While we are making some headway on flattening the curve when it comes to coronavirus in some parts of the US, it is clear the one curve that will not be flattened is the president's learning curve. The timeline of this debacle reveals a resistance to knowledge and an inability to acknowledge much less even learn from mistakes that hasn't wavered. So what do we do? The stakes are too high to wait for a leadership miracle that will never come. We discuss the problem and possible solutions with an extraordinary panel including former Baltimore Commissioner of Public Health, professor and emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen, Atlantic columnist David Frum, Washington Post columnist Max Boot and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and co-editor of Just Security. Don't miss it.

        <![CDATA[<p>While we are making some headway on flattening the curve when it comes to coronavirus in some parts of the US, it is clear the one curve that will not be flattened is the president's learning curve. The timeline of this debacle reveals a resistance to knowledge and an inability to acknowledge much less even learn from mistakes that hasn't wavered. So what do we do? The stakes are too high to wait for a leadership miracle that will never come. We discuss the problem and possible solutions with an extraordinary panel including former Baltimore Commissioner of Public Health, professor and emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen, Atlantic columnist David Frum, Washington Post columnist Max Boot and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and co-editor of Just Security. Don't miss it.</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>The World Will Never Be the Same--But How Will It Be Different?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-world-will-never-be-the-same-but-how-will-it-be-differen</link>
      <description>As we anticipate months more of lockdown and efforts at recovery, at further tragic loss of life and catastrophic economic dislocation, it is clear that we are living through an era-defining event. Such events typically shape the outlook of generations and lead to shifts in priorities, program, and even the distribution of wealth and power in society. What will the consequences of this era's upheaval be? We speak with the Center for Global Development's Jeremy Konyndyk, the American Enterprise Institute's Kori Schake, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law and Edward Luce of the Financial Times to discuss. We also cover whether there is any cause for optimism in recent news and what caveats should be added to hopes for an early return to "normalcy." A great discussion. Please join us.

      <title>Will Democracy Be COVID-19's Most Consequential Victim?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/will-democracy-be-covid-19s-most-consequential-victim</link>
      <description>One of the surest ways to get fired in the Trump Administration is to speak the truth. Ask Captain Brett Crozier. Or just place your duty to the country ahead of your loyalty to Donald Trump. Ask former Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson...and so many others. This is not just disturbing behavior it is death by a thousand cuts to democracy and the current COVID crisis is giving Trump and Co. cover to continue their attack on our system. They're not alone however, from Hungary to India, wannabe authoritarians are undermining democratic protections and imposing their will on the people...and no one is pushing back, especially not Donald Trump's USA. So not only is the health of our family and friends at risk, so to is the health of the systems upon which we depend to protect our freedoms. Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and David Sanger of the New York Times discuss. Don't miss this podcast.

      <title>A Health Crisis Wrapped in an Economic Crisis Inside a Leadership Crisis</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/a-health-crisis-wrapped-in-an-economic-crisis-inside-a-leade</link>
      <description>America is just over 4% of the world's population but home to 25% of its COVID-19 cases. While European nations like Italy and Spain are wracked with the disease, Europeans typically do not have the added anxiety of trying to figure out how to pay for healthcare or worrying that their government will not support them if they lose their job. We congratulate ourselves on having the strongest economy in the world but are importing basic PPE supplies from China and Russia. Our fragility and our flaws are being revealed as never before. On this episode Dr. Leana Wen, former public health commissioner of Baltimore and an emergency room physician, Edward Luce of the Financial Times and co-host Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security" join host David Rothkopf to discuss and consider the whys of all this and where it will lead. An essential episode. Don't miss.

      <title>Do Our Leaders Morals Matter in a Crisis Like This?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/do-our-leaders-morals-matter-in-a-crisis-like-this</link>
      <description>Joe Nye, Harvard professor and formerly Dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, has a timely new book called "Do Morals Matter? Presidents and Foreign Policy from FDR to Trump" that serves as a jumping off point for our discussion of where we are in the current crisis, why we are here and what we can do better going forward. We have an exceptional group discussing these topics including Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, David Sanger of the New York Times and NY Congressional Candidate Evelyn Farkas. Special Bonus: In addition, this episode features a special one-on-one conversation with former USAID Administrator and former NSC official who was in the middle of the fight to contain ebola, Gayle Smith. It's the kind of in-depth perspectives on the global implications of the COVID-19 crisis you can only find at Deep State Radio. Join us.

      <description>While the debate about managing the pandemic has grown more rancorous in recent days as death tolls have climbed and states have lamented the unresponsiveness of the federal government, while on Capitol Hill the name calling has resumed, the virus is immune to politics. There is a right way and wrong way to manage a pandemic and the resulting economic and social crises it triggers. We discuss how to tell the difference and what lessons we should be learning and applying now with former Obama Admin. ebola czar Ron Klain, David Sanger of the New York Times, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School. You won't want to miss this urgently important discussion. Join us.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/weve-never-seen-anything-like-thisand-all-that-we-know-about</link>
      <description>The Coronavirus Crisis is the first 50 state natural disaster in American history. And while it is certainly not the first for which the federal response was lacking, it may be the worst overall response of an administration to a major crisis in our history. The lies continue. Public confidence continues to erode. Vital supplies from tests to masks to ventilators remain out of reach for many. Coordination is weak. Signs of corruption are brewing. And the President and his team seem to be learning precious little from their errors. So, what's working? Who's succeeding? What's the solution? And how much worse can this get. On this urgently important episode, we discuss with Juliette Kayyem of the Kennedy School at Harvard, Jeremy Konyndyk of the Center for Global Development, both crisis experts, and our own Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School. Don't miss it.

      <title>Flying Blind: Facing an Unprecedented Crisis In a Time of Complete Leadership Failure in Washington</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/flying-blind-facing-an-unprecedented-crisis-in-a-time-of-com</link>
      <description>There are countries and systems that are managing the COVID-19 crisis comparatively well. South Korea, which invested heavily and early in testing is one. Singapore, in the view of renowned infectious disease expert and Pulitzer Prize-winner Laurie Garrett, may be an even better one. Their testing is almost ubiquitous and trust in the government's handling of the crisis is rock solid. Garrett, Just Security's Ryan Goodman and host David Rothkopf discuss what we can learn from these success and compare them to the still disastrous situation in the U.S. (and the lunatic approach embraced by the government of the U.K.). From how much longer this social and economically disruptive crisis will go on to what the science is telling us right now, this is an essential discussion. Join us.

      <title>Lies, Damned Lies, Infodemics and The Trump Disinformation Machine</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/lies-damned-lies-infodemics-and-the-trump-disinformation-mac</link>
      <description>We don't raise an eyebrow when Trump lies. Most of his early lies were of little consequence, about his wealth or sexual prowess or intellect. But in recent weeks, in the midst of the first major International crisis the president has faced (that he did not himself create), we have seen those lies turned into potential weapons of mass destruction. By minimizing the consequences of a global pandemic, many can die, markets can lose faith in public officials, economies can falter. We discuss this disturbing, dangerous phenomenon with Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law and "Just Security." We also discuss how it is all a part of an effort by Trump to transform the entire US government into an engine of disinformation that is a grave threat to our national security. Don't miss this important episode.

      <title>Afghanistan! Syria! Coronavirus! Elections! What's Scariest?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/afghanistan-syria-coronavirus-elections-whats-scariest</link>
      <description>After 20 years, the US is trying its best to get out of Dodge in Afghanistan. Trouble is the not-quite-a-peace-deal announced over the weekend fell apart on Monday. The US got out of Syria and now that country is on the verge of what may be a new and horrific humanitarian crisis. By the end of the year, it seems, everyone everywhere may have coronavirus and we're only beginning to understand the consequences of that...or the lengths to which the Trump Administration will lie about what's happening. And the Democratic primaries are going through a massive upheaval...but the question is: Is anything becoming more clearer or is it just becoming clear how unclear everything is? We discuss with regulars Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and special guest Lt. Col. Larry Wilkerson of the College of William and Mary and former Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell. You really shouldn't miss a word of this.

      <title>What If Shattering Norms Was the Right Thing to Do, But We Shattered All the Wrong Ones?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-if-shattering-norms-was-the-right-thing-to-do</link>
      <description>Donald Trump has made narcissism the central organizing principle of his government. It used to be said institutions were the lengthened shadow of one man. In the case of the US government today it is the lengthened shadow of one man's psychopathology. Every decision, every action turns on whether Trump and those close to him feel it is good or bad for him personally. And half of America is cool with him shattering norms of law and good governance because they feel DC is broken and doesn't work for them and maybe shattered norms are the way to fix it. And with 40 years of inequality and increased power to the 1% who can blame them? The question is, did they pick the right norms to shatter? And is Trump really on their side? That's what campaign 2020 is going to come down to--but there's a twist. Some of the Dems want to preserve the norms that have screwed the majority of Americans for the past forty years as well. So...where's this all going to end up? We discuss with the Washington Post's Greg Sargent and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and Just Security. Don't miss it.

      <description>Donald Trump is remaking the U.S. government in ways that make you less safe, make our justice system less fair, put our democracy at greater risk. This past week we have seen manifold examples of the Trump method for putting down opposition, twisting the facts, suppressing intelligence, culling experts and independent thinkers and doing it all constantly to a devastating cumulative effect. Kori Schake of AEI, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law and Joe Cirincione of the Ploughshares Fund discuss this and why people may be seeing voters response to it in the primaries in the wrong light. Tune in to this timely and important episode.

      <title>We are in Uncharted Waters for the US National Security Community: What Next?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/we-are-in-uncharted-waters-for-the-us-national-security-comm</link>
      <description>Donald Trump is purging his cabinet of expertise and those who place loyalty to the Constitution above that to Trump personally. In the intelligence community, State Department, Justice Department, Department of Defense and the National Security Council we have seen an exodus of talent and a message delivered to all who remain that is positively chilling. Don't raise awareness of threats like Russian election interference because Trump does not want to hear it is just one example. Also: with breaking news out of Afghanistan and the deeply disturbing prognosis from Syria, international crises and potentially unsettling decisions loom as events that may color the 2020 campaign and impact further America's falling standing in the world. We discuss all these issues with one of America's pre-eminent national security thinkers and leaders, Michele Flournoy, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and co-founder and managing partner at WestExec Advisors. Flournoy is a likely leader in an incoming Democratic administration and her views are essential to understanding where America is going. Don't miss this conversation.

      <description>You may think that all Donald Trump thinks about is himself. Or his latest grift. Or cheeseburgers. But when you look at his recent behavior, it looks like even with impeachment behind him, our president saves most of his bandwidth for the land of Tchaikovsky, Putin and borscht. He shoved aside his acting Director of National Intelligence in a fit of pique over a Congressional briefing from a top IC official saying Russia was planning to interfere in the 2020 elections and do so, again, on Trump's behalf. He put in the DNI's place an acting official with no intelligence background but who might be loyal and help cover Russia's tracks. In a London court this week, lawyers for Julian Assange said Trump, through an intermediary, offered Assange a pardon if he would deny Russian involvement in 2016. Roger Stone got 40 months in prison for, according to the sentencing judge, covering up for Trump--and now, it is suspected, Trump is planning to reward Stone with a pardon. Meanwhile the AG is overseeing an investigation into the intelligence community's past Russia investigations. In short, Trump is sending a message loud and clear to all--he welcomes Russia's help and will protect them and he will penalize those who get in the way. We discuss with Third Way's Mieke Eoyang, Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks and David Sanger of the New York Times. Don't miss it.

      <title>The Democratic Party Death Wish: Why? Why? Why?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-democratic-party-death-wish-why-why-why</link>
      <description>It would seem like 2020 would be offering a great opportunity for Democrats what with the president being historical unpopular and perhaps the most corrupt and worst president in U.S. history. But still, Democrats will be Democrats and even with urgency and opportunity looming large, they seem dedicated to the idea of blowing their chances sky high. We discuss how they are doing that and speculate as to why and where all this will lead. Is it already Bernie vs. Bloomberg in the main event? Where might that lead come convention time? And how would the world view a Bloomberg or a Sanders presidency? Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law Center and host David Rothkopf discuss, lament and discuss some more. Join them!

      <title>Utter Madness: Trump &amp; the World Fail in the Face of a Potential Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/utter-madness-trump-the-world-fail-in-the-face-of-a-potentia</link>
      <description>Coronavirus has a new name: Covid-19. It has infected over 50,000 people and taken over 1,000 lives. But the crisis may be just beginning. And the response of governments from China to the United States may be only be making its potential toll worse. We speak with Pulitzer Prize winning science writer, Laurie Garrett, one of the world's preeminent experts on global public health issues about just how bad the situation is and about some of the most egregious missteps of our leaders to date. We also discuss the fact that as of right now there are multiple serious epidemics occurring simultaneously placing the global health system under unprecedented stress--a situation we could have prepared for but did not. Essential listening.

      <title>America's Election Year Vulnerabilities: The Grim Outlook</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/americas-election-year-vulnerabilities-the-grim-outlook</link>
      <description>In 2016, Russia not only helped elect Donald Trump, they also assured Americans would never again be able to look at election results with the same trust they had in the past. If anything, actions by them, the Administration, other bad actors and incompetent administrators have raised unease about what we might expect in this year's election cycle. Beyond that, risks we have focused on in the past, like terrorism, might manifest themselves again--perhaps from dangerous, white supremacist sources. Are we prepared? We discuss with Juliette Kayyem of Harvard's Kennedy School, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School and David Sanger of the New York Times. Don't miss this episode.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/where-do-we-go-from-here-part-ii-lets-keep-fighting-edition</link>
      <description>With each day since Trump's sham acquittal ceremony, it has become clear that the president sees the outcome that was served up on a silver platter by the servile Senate GOP (with one exception) as the license to behave badly. Trump never disappoints those who expect the worst from him. We discuss where this leaves us with three of the great voices of the resistance--Sarah Kendzior and Andrea Chalupa of "Gaslit Nation" and AG from "Mueller She Wrote." They are, as you'd expect, great...and then we all announce the exciting launch of a major Washington event bringing together many of the very best podcasts for a kind DC PodCon. We call it Washington Today Forum but you can call it WTF for short. It will take place on May 21st at the Warner Theater in Washington, DC. Go to www.thedsrnetwork.com for more details and to reserve your tickets. You won't want to miss this.

      <title>How Bad Can it Get?: Don't Ask</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/how-bad-can-it-get-dont-ask</link>
      <description>If you thought Trump's acquittal by the Senate was the worst thing that could happen this week, you seem to be forgetting who you are dealing with. First, the Senate trial had much value and was, by any reasonable assessment, a net benefit for the country even despite the fact that it wasn't really a trial, was rigged and further empowered a bad president. But in rapid succession we had awards for racists, calls for retribution against the president's enemies, an announcement of Bill Barr further pressing his foot down on the throat of Justice and Trump giving one of the most unhinged and disturbing public performance of his presidency. We discuss what all this means and where it can lead with three of the best commentators out there, Maya Wiley of the New School and an MSNBC commentator, Tom Nichols of the Naval War College and author of "The Death of Expertise" and our own Ryan Goodman of Just Security and NYU Law School. You won't want to miss this. Essential listening.

      <title>Trump and "The Bomb": If He's the Most Dangerous President Ever, Why Isn't Anyone Talking About the Really Biggest Risks Re-election Will Bring?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/trump-and-the-bomb-if-hes-the-most-dangerous-president-ever</link>
      <description>If you read Fred Kaplan's new book "The Bomb" you will discover that despite the best efforts of some very qualified, competent presidents and their teams, we've come pretty close to blowing up the world a few times over the years. Now we have a president is none of those things. Indeed he's making the risk of global calamity greater with each passing day. So how come no one on the campaign trail is making this a central issue. We discuss with Kaplan, Kori Schake of AEI and, in Des Moines, Iowa, Ed Luce of the Financial Times. Don't you dare miss it.

      <title>Put Away Your Sweatpants!  The Jury of 100 Will Disappoint.  On to the Jury of 130 Million!</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/put-away-your-sweatpants-the-jury-of-100-will-disappoint</link>
      <description>The House Managers have done an extraordinary job in the Senate trial, led by the eloquence and brilliance of Adam Schiff. They have compellingly made the case that President Trump violated the law and his oath of office and should be removed from that office. But that's not going to happen. Because this trial was rigged from the outset. But does this story end here? Will the House Managers win their case in the court of public opinion? Will that translate into change and a debacle for the president's defenders in November. We discussed with two of the very best experts around, our own Ryan Goodman of Just Security and Asha Rangappa of the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University. It's a must-listen. Don't miss it.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/while-you-were-flipping-out-about-impeachment-armageddon-got</link>
      <description>The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists recently pushed its Doomsday Clock closer to "midnight" than it has ever been. They did this because nuclear safeguards are disappearing, risks are growing and because they include the risk of climate armageddon in their calculus. And you thought the impeachment and the death of American democracy was worrisome! Nuclear expert Jon Wolfsthal, Georgetown's Rosa Brooks, AEI's Kori Schake and the FT's Ed Luce join to discuss all this and answer the question: Who's the most odious member of the Trump Administration? (Who says we don't deal with the really hard questions?) Don't miss it.

      <title>Impeachment!  Primaries!  Elections!  What if none of it really matters?</title>

      <description>We're at one of the most fraught moments in American political history. The country is polarized. The president is going to trial. That president is one of the most polarizing figures the world has ever seen. And headlines scream of momentous events in the weeks ahead. Everybody's running a fever and maybe it's time to take two aspirin and call Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and David Sanger of the New York Times. Because they have just what this moment really calls for: perspective, the long view, even wisdom. This episode of Deep State Radio may not cure what ails you but it'll help you know what the problem really is...and in the end, that's the important thing, isn't it? Join us?

      <title>The Week in Trump: When Is a Trial Not a Trial, a Hoax Not a Hoax, and a Big Trade Deal Neither Big Nor a Trade Deal?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-week-in-trump-when-is-a-trial-not-a-trial-a-hoax-not-a-h</link>
      <description>As the Senate impeachment trial looms, Republicans seem not to understand what a trial is. They don't want witnesses. They don't want evidence. They especially don't want witnesses or facts that might further implicate the president in crimes. But if they seek no evidence do they also then accept the House's view of the facts as the final truth? Is their stirring defense of the president that they don't care that what he does was illegal rather than proving he didn't do it? We discuss with Mieke Eoyang of the Third Way. Then we turn to Trump's apparent view that if the accusations are a hoax then a fake trade deal can sufficiently distract from it to make it all go away. In fact, GOP counter-programming to the impeachment this week has been two trade deals--one with China and the USMCA. Why did they pick trade? Are these deals significant? And what is the future of trade for the U.S. We discuss with Fred Hochberg, former Eximbank Chairman and author of a great new book entitled "Trade is Not a Four Letter Word." Don't miss this special episode.

      <title>The Soleimani Killing Was the First Wag-the-Dog Episode of the Trump 2020 Campaign...Whose Dog Will Be Next?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-soleimani-killing-was-the-first-wag-the-dog-episode-of-t</link>
      <description>The president has no foreign policy expertise, no advisors, no morals, no scruples and he is in deep political hot water at home. So naturally, he wags the dog with an attack on Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. He does it in spite of international law. He lies about it. He doesn't think through the consequences. And he survives politically. So, now you know that as this year of ever-increasing pressure on the president progresses, he's bound to try it again. What dog will he wag next? And which of the issues raised by last week's attack will have the most enduring consequences. We discuss with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School and Kori Schake the head of the Foreign Policy and Defense program at the American Enterprise Institute...and it's not a discussion to miss.

      <title>Why the Impeachment Trial Might Be the High Point of Donald Trump's Year</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/why-the-impeachment-trial-might-be-the-high-point</link>
      <description>If and when Nancy Pelosi decides to sends the articles of impeachment to the Senate, the odds of a fair trial are slim to none. (Aw, who are we kidding? They're zero.) Trump will be acquitted. He will have a celebratory press conference and declare he has been exonerated, an end to the hoaxy witch hunt. But will his legal troubles stop there? What about as more details of his crimes are revealed? More cover ups take place and are revealed? Other trials reveal more evidence against the president and his men. We discuss with former US prosecutor Harry Litman, Just Security Editorial Director Kate Brannen and Just Security co-editor Ryan Goodman why things might go from bad to worse for Trump and why it could all go on for years. Also discussed: The aftershocks of Kate Brannen's scoop revealing the unredacted contents of communications on the Ukraine scandal that incriminates the president and reveals deep fissures within the Trump Administration. And: Can the president just go around knocking off any foreign leader he wants? Join us.

      <description>In the days since President Donald Trump ordered the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the presidents's spokespeople have taken to the airwaves to claim that we are safer with the Iranian who had the death of hundreds of Americans on his hands gone. But so far, things don't feel safer. The Iranian government--which has a global network of proxies at its disposal--promised revenge. It vowed to enrich uranium beyond limits set by the agreement struck during then Obama Administration. The Iraqi parliament voted to expel U.S. troops from that country and the U.S announced the beginning of its withdrawal. Oil prices moved upward. Russia, Iran, and ISIS stood poised to benefit from declining U.S. influence. To some, another Mideast war seemed inevitable. But is it? Will Iran prove to be the rational actor who calms then situation? Will Trump blink and actually seek the de-escalation his Secretary of State promised? Will divisions in the national security establishment have an impact? Kori Schake of AEI, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law and Joe Cirincione of the Ploughshares Fund discuss on an urgent, can't miss episode of Deep State Radio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/two-years-later-we-are-in-a-constitutional-crisis</link>
      <description>For Two Years, Rosa Brooks had remained optimistic that despite all that was happening in the Trump administration over the past three years, a full-on constitutional crisis could be avoided. That changed with our episode on October 11, 2019. In this Best of Deep State Radio episode, we’ve pieced together several of these discussions including what led Rosa to declare a constitutional crisis. Tune In.

      <description>In the last episode of not just 2019 but of the entire decade for Deep State Radio, we gather Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Stephen Walt of Harvard's Kennedy School, David Sanger of the New York Times and Ed Luce of the Financial Times to reflect on the ten years just past. We identify the big geopolitical trends from the rise of China (and Russia) to the spread of ethno-nationalism and the boom times for both demagogues and billionaires. The climate crisis got worse. So did inequality. Democracy teetered at the brink in America. And...egg nog anyone? Have a few drinks and settle in for a look back and what it means to all of us going forward. Happy Holidays from Deep State Radio!

      <title>Rep. Eric Swalwell: Don't Assume McConnell Holds the Winning Hand on the Shape of the Senate Trial</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/rep-eric-swalwell-dont-assume-mcconnell-holds-the-winning-ha</link>
      <description>During this special 20 minute conversation with one of the standout stars of the impeachment process, California Congressman Eric Swalwell, he parries the latest jibes from the White House against Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Majority in the House by noting that 70 percent of the American people want a fair trial in the Senate. For this reason, he argues, Americans should not jump to the conclusion that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will get his way and convene the kangaroo court he has promised he would deliver. Swalwell also discussed recent revelations about how Putin shaped Trump's Ukraine views and just what shape on-going investigations will have to take in 2020 to counter the on-going abuse of power by President Trump. You won't want to miss the breaking news, special edition of Deep State Radio.

      <title>The Republican Centipede: It's a Horror Movie, but for Whom?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-republican-centipede-its-a-horror-movie-but-for-whom</link>
      <description>In the wake of impeachment, all eyes turn to the Senate. Will delaying handing over the articles of impeachment buy the Democrats any leverage? Will buying time be enough with new bad news for Trump breaking daily--such as the report it was Putin who told him about Ukraine interference in 2016 or the magazine Christianity Today coming out for the president's removal from office? Or will the Senate sham trial come and go but these constant developments put the GOP in an ever weaker position. Many shoes are yet to drop. That's why we call it the Republican Centipede. (Well, at least that's one possible reason.) Join former US Attorney and MSNBC commentator Joyce White Vance and NYU Law and Just Security's Ryan Goodman for a do-not-miss episode on the week's biggest story.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/whats-worse-than-donald-trump-winning-re-election</link>
      <description>What if the history books record that Donald Trump was third American president to be impeached, but the first of those to be re-elected? It's not far-fetched. In fact, many folks think it's likely. And it's what happens after that that has them scared. We discuss in a great roundtable with the Washington Post's Greg Sargent, Georgetown Law's Rosa Brooks and NYU Law School's Ryan Goodman. You won't want to miss it.

      <title>How Will History View the Impeachment of Donald Trump?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/how-will-history-view-the-impeachment-of-donald-trump</link>
      <description>On this special episode of Deep State Radio, coinciding with the official beginning of the House Judiciary Committee's Impeachment Hearings, we discuss the case against Trump in the context of history. Our guests are impeachment historian Frank Bowman of the University of Missouri and Ryan Goodman, NYU Law School professor and co-editor at "Just Security." Are the Democrats making a mistake by focusing on bribery? Did the GOP make any good points in their counter-arguments as the hearings kicked off. Where do we go from here? Can Chief Justice Roberts keep the Senate trial from being a kangaroo court or do Senate rules hamstring him and is the outcome inevitable? It's a lively, vital discussion that is not to be missed. Join us.

      <title>There Are No Turning Points</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/there-are-no-turning-points</link>
      <description>With every flashing headline, every bright chyron claiming "breaking news" we expect our worlds are changing. In the current political atmosphere in the US those come fast and furious and leads pundits everywhere to regularly exclaim that we have reached a turning point. Well, we offer a different kind of pundit on Deep State Radio, people who speak their minds and don't march to the beat of everyone else's drummers, people like Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law Center and Max Bergmann of the Center for American Progress. And while much is happening all around us, it's not clear much will change, which is why Rosa asserts, "There are no turning points." We discuss. Which leads us to some of the biggest and most important stories in the world that are not getting enough attention. Join us.

      <title>What's Better Than Listening to Your Crazy Relatives Talk Politics?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/whats-better-than-listening-to-your-crazy-relatives-talk-pol</link>
      <description>Psssst. Put down that drumstick. Push back from the Thanksgiving table. You don't need any more of that pumpkin pie. (And we say that as your friend.) We have something better for you to do, in keeping with the spirit of the day and much less likely to drive you crazy than your relatives. Join us for Deep State Radio's special Thanksgiving feast featuring Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Kori Schake of IISS and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law in which they offer up all that they are thankful for. Guess who said she's thankful for Garanimals matching outfits. Guess who said she was thankful for the fact that we're not living in a full-on apocalypse. Guess who said he's thankful that American Thanksgiving is late in November so it pushes off the start of "Christmas bollocks." Tune in and hear these views and also somewhat more serious perspectives on what's going right in the world. (And if you can't pushback from the table...wear earbuds and listen to us during the meal! Enjoy!) Happy Thanksgiving from Deep State Radio.

      <description>The president of the United States, always searching for lower lows, has done profound damage to the military, our system of justice and America's standing in the world by pardoning war criminals from our own military. The risk at which this puts soldiers and civilians in the future is only matched by that which it poses to our entire nation as leaders without values or standards seek to institutionalize their corruption. Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Kori Schake of IISS and Ed Luce of the Financial Times discuss the moral crisis that may both underpin and exceed in danger the Constitutional Crisis that is garnering most of the headlines. Don't miss it.

      <description>Adam Schiff masterfully conducted impeachment hearings that made the case that Donald Trump sought to bribe and extort the president of Ukraine, using his official office to advance personal interests. The case is a lock. Except if facts don't matter. Or if you don't care. And that's the GOP position. And guess what comes next? Distractions and circuses and Bill Barr investigations into the origins of the Mueller Report and Lindsay Graham fishing expeditions on Hunter Biden and the High Court of noted champion of fairness in government Mitch McConnell. In other words, a shitshow wrapped in a goatfuck shrouded in a partisan perversion of justice. But don't guess at what's coming next, listen to former US attorney and commentator Harry Litman and NYU Law professor Ryan Goodman as they prepare you for the worst...and why to cling to hope. Tune in.

      <title>While the World Burns: Impeachment Week Ahead and Other Trumpian Catastrophes</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/while-the-world-burns-impeachment-week-ahead-and-other-trump</link>
      <description>This week promises to be a dramatic on the impeachment front. Is Gordon Sondland going to tell the truth (for the first time) or lie (again)? What about Lt. Col Vindman, Fiona Hill and the others to come? Will there be a game changer? And how will the president throw himself into the mix? More Tweets? More distractions? And speaking of distractions...is impeachment drawing our attention away from major unfolding global crises: in Hong Kong, with the Uighurs in China, in Iran, in Syria, in Latin America, with US-Israel policy? It could make your head spin if you didn't have the cool incisive wisdom of Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks and former NSC staffer and current CNN commentator Sam Vinograd to make sense of it all. And that's just what you have here on this not-to-be-missed episode of Deep State Radio.
We're extremely grateful to our sponsors, Mova Globes and Better Help.

      <title>What if the Facts on Impeachment Just Don't Matter?  </title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-if-the-facts-on-impeachment-just-dont-matter</link>
      <description>In Ohio today, one house of the legislature passed a law saying that if a student gets a science question wrong at school because it does not conform with his religious beliefs it can't be held against him. We have officially entered the post-fact world. That matters in the impeachment case because as the Democrats lay out a careful factual case, the GOP response is a tsunami of conspiracy theories, lies, nonsense, and distractions. And that might be all that's necessary to maintain the political balance that keeps Trump in office. Is there an antidote? Will the next rounds of hearings produce a game-changer? Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security" and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law Center discuss with host David Rothkopf. Join us for essential insights into this newest phase of the impeachment chapter...and the decline of Western Civilization.

      <title>Through the Lens of Ukraine: The Escalating Dangers of Trump Foreign Policy</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/through-the-lens-of-ukraine</link>
      <description>With all eyes on the impeachment hearings this week, we take a step back to reframe the discussion about Trump shake-down of the Ukrainian government in terms of the damage that was done to U.S. national security interests and those of our allies.  Congress voted money to Ukraine not as a gift, but to enable them to defend against an active invasion by Russia.  Withholding that money put lives and Ukraine’s stability at risk.  The case is just one illustration of a broader series of decisions by the Trump team that have put America and Americans in danger—from the green light given to the Turks to invade Syria thereby strengthening ISIS, Russia, Iran and the Syrians to seeking to cut a deal and leave Afghanistan to the Taliban, from bungling the North Korea negotiation to gift after gift after gift given to the Russians.  We discuss with Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the top Democratic foreign policy leaders and thinkers in Washington.  Don’t miss this special episode of DSR.

      <title>Let's Not Screw Up This Impeachment Thing, OK?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/lets-not-screw-up-this-impeachment-thing-ok</link>
      <description>Next week public hearings on impeachment will begin. Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, will make the case that Donald Trump sought to bribe a foreign official, one of the few high crimes and misdemeanors specified in the Constitution's article on impeachment. Republicans will argue he did not and will seek to derail the hearings or attack the witnesses. At stake is the future of the rule of law in America. We discuss with Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School and Kate Shaw of Cardozo Law School just how the case might best be made and what the pitfalls are likely to be. We also discuss the latest breaking news in the multiple current cases against Trump and his associates. And, we try to go inside the mind of Attorney General Bill Barr so you don't have to. Don't miss this important, insight-rich episode.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/it-can-happen-here</link>
      <description>Look around. Count the good and great political leaders in the world today. That didn't take long did it? Why not? What has happened? Where have all the leaders gone? Is that a sign of progress or decline? And where does it lead? To messy, ineffective governments--mere cattywampusness--or to something much, much worse? Kori Schake of IISS, Ed Luce of the FT and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law discuss and you do not want to miss their sweeping, penetrating, sobering conclusions. A must listen episode of DSR!

        <![CDATA[<p>Look around. Count the good and great political leaders in the world today. That didn't take long did it? Why not? What has happened? Where have all the leaders gone? Is that a sign of progress or decline? And where does it lead? To messy, ineffective governments--mere cattywampusness--or to something much, much worse? Kori Schake of IISS, Ed Luce of the FT and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law discuss and you do not want to miss their sweeping, penetrating, sobering conclusions. A must listen episode of DSR!</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Pelosi?  How Many Prosecutors Does She Have?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/pelosi-how-many-prosecutors-does-she-have</link>
      <description>Once, when presented with an argument that the Pope would appreciate it if he laid off persecuting Russian Catholics, Stalin responded, "The Pope? How many divisions does he have?" It may be that Trump-Barr-McConnell soulless brain's trust have muttered something similar about Democratic efforts to stop the lawless president. So long as Barr is unwilling to prosecute and views the Department of Justice as the private attorney's for Trump, they might as well be saying, "Pelosi? How many prosecutors does she have?" We discuss their strategy and how the House vote to proceed with impeachment changes the equation with two great experts, our regular co-host, Ryan Goodman, co-editor of "Just Security" and professor at NYU Law School and Barbara McQuade, former U.S. Attorney and professor at the University of Michigan Law School. It's just the kind of expertise you need to make sense of a crazy news week. Tune in.

      <title>Will Trump's Efforts to End "Forever Wars" End Up Undermining Lasting Peace?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/will-trumps-efforts-to-end-forever-wars-end-up-undermining-l</link>
      <description>Donald Trump has promoted a foreign policy that seeks to reverse or undermine many of the lasting tenets of post WWII U.S. foreign policy. He wants to retreat into a gated community nationalism that eschews international institutions, alliances, engagement, diplomacy and even the basics of sound coordinated foreign and national security policy at home. The risks are becoming clearer every day: in Syria, via trade wars and in the gains Trump has won...for our rivals, notably the Russians. We discuss how long it may take to recover and how we may get there with Tony Blinken, former Deputy Secretary of State under President Barack Obama and currently an advisor to the presidential campaign of Joe Biden. It is an important, thought-provoking conversation that you won't want to miss. Join us.

      <title>"No Need to Thank Us, America.  It's What We Do.": The Deep State Rides to the Rescue Again</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/no-need-to-thank-us-america-its-what-we-do-the-deep-state</link>
      <description>The not-so-secret secret of Trump foreign policy is that there is no policy. But the better kept secret is that we have one seeming policy from the President himself and then another, which is the effort of professionals in the government to keep the President from getting us all killed. It's not really the Deep State conspiracy whack jobs would have you believe in. It's the hidden check of our system: patriotic pros in our government who won't be corrupted by the corrupt or dumbed down by the dumb. Case in point: Syria. Another case in point: Ukraine. Join the great Rosa Brooks, the irreplaceable Kori Schake and the brilliant Ed Luce for another great, timely discussion on urgent issues--but maybe, just maybe this one won't leave you curled up under your bed.

      <title>King Me: How Trump and the DOJ Are Not Just Ignoring the Constitution But Trying to Undo the American Revolution</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/king-me-how-trump-and-the-doj-are-not-just-ignoring-the-cons</link>
      <description>This was the week the cracks began to show in Republican defenses of the indefensible. Oh sure, there were more distractions, shenanigans and lies. But between the abortive attempt to hold the G7 Meeting at Trump's not-so-nice, faltering Doral golf resort, new testimony in House impeachment inquiry that made the president's crimes clearer than ever before and the shocking case made by the president's lawyers that even if the president murdered someone he could not be indicted or even investigated, the Constitutional crisis deepened and Trump became harder to defend. Join our great guests Susan Hennessey of Lawfare, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and co-host Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School for an absolutely essential and chilling discussion of precisely where we are amid the cascading scandals of the Trump Era.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/trump-is-a-one-man-crime-waveand-what-do-the-dems-do-now</link>
      <description>From describing Trump's violations of the Constitution's foreign and domestic emoluments clauses as the Trump Administration's "original sin" to grappling with a Manhattan phone book-length list of presidential crimes, Representative Jamie Raskin of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees presents us with the current state of the impeachment efforts in the U.S. Congress. Raskin is one of Trump's most effective and thoughtful critics and his impassioned discussion of the president's serial abuses is must-listening. The second half of this episode is then the first in the series of behind-the-scenes powers in the Democratic Party and their views on how to achieve victory in 2020. Our guest is our friend and founding partner, Bernard Schwartz, a leading Dem donor and thought leader who brings to bear his decades of experience to frame the race ahead. Join us for two wide-ranging and illuminating conversations.

        <![CDATA[<p>From describing Trump's violations of the Constitution's foreign and domestic emoluments clauses as the Trump Administration's "original sin" to grappling with a Manhattan phone book-length list of presidential crimes, Representative Jamie Raskin of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees presents us with the current state of the impeachment efforts in the U.S. Congress. Raskin is one of Trump's most effective and thoughtful critics and his impassioned discussion of the president's serial abuses is must-listening. The second half of this episode is then the first in the series of behind-the-scenes powers in the Democratic Party and their views on how to achieve victory in 2020. Our guest is our friend and founding partner, Bernard Schwartz, a leading Dem donor and thought leader who brings to bear his decades of experience to frame the race ahead. Join us for two wide-ranging and illuminating conversations.</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/alas-poor-democracy-i-knew-him-horatio</link>
      <description>What if the problem is not Trump. Or Boris Johnson. Or the rest of the current occupants of the global leadership clown car?
What if the problem runs deeper? What if something about our societies is fundamentally broken? What if that is democracy? What if each election to come takes us further from old ideals and toward deeper dysfunction? Ok, so maybe it's not what you want to hear about when you're driving home or 
working out or doing whatever you do when you're listening to Deep State Radio. But it's what you NEED to hear. A sobering and thought-provoking conversation with Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks and the Financial Times' Ed Luce. Tune in.

      <description>It has been a few days of staggering incompetence, ignorance, corruption and betrayal from the Trump Administration. The Kurds were betrayed not once but twice, most recently by a sham deal that facilitates Turkish ethnic cleansing. The White House Chief of Staff admitting a quid pro quo in the Ukraine scandal while, at the same time, announcing that the US would host the next G7 meeting at a Trump resort in Florida. Trump senior officials were taking turns throwing each other under the bus. And momentum to remove the president from office was gaining momentum. It takes a great group to sort this all out and we have them: Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law, Rosa Brooks, of Georgetown Law (and, maybe, president of the Deep State) and Ed Luce of the Financial Times analyze, explicate, lament and commiserate with you our dear listeners. Tune in!

      <title>A Turning Point in the Impeachment Investigation: Is the End for Trump Nearing?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/a-turning-point-in-the-impeachment-investigation</link>
      <description>As every day brings new testimony from former members of the Trump Administration that confirms there was widespread acknowledgment that what the President and his agents were doing in Ukraine was wrong, new questions emerge. How much more testimony will be required before an impeachment vote will take place? What will be the scope of the charges brought? How will the Congress deal with the refusal of central players in this drama--like Rudy Giuliani--to comply with subpoenas? How is this all impacting our standing in the world? Join us for a one-on-one conversation with Congressman Jim Himes of Connectictut, one of the most thoughtful and prominent voices on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. It is on the news and you won't want to miss it.

      <description>Donald Trump gave the greenlight to a Turkish invasion of Syria that has already led to manifold calamities. We betrayed our Kurdish allies. They are already suffering atrocities and worse is likely ahead. We have thrown a lifeline to ISIS. We have strengthened Assad, Iran and Russia. And we are just a few days into this fiasco of failed foreign policy. Huge questions are raised by these events and we have an extraordinary panel to discuss them including Gen. Mark Hertling, former Commander of the US Army in Europe, Harvard Professor Stephen Walt, columnist and professor Joyce Karam and DSR regular David Sanger of the New York Times. It is essential listening. Join us.

        <![CDATA[<p>You've been waiting for it. You've been talking about it. You've been listening to our Rosa Brooks say we weren't there yet for a year now. But, finally, thanks to the really extraordinary rejection of basic Constitutional principles like separation of powers and the idea that Congress and the Executive are co-equal branches of government, we're there! We know because Rosa Brooks, of Georgetown Law School, and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security" say so on this special edition of Deep State Radio. Except perhaps it's not really a "baby" crisis. It's a big one and we discuss where it might go next on this pod. Don't miss it!</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>The Dangerous Consequences of the "Great and Unmatched Wisdom" of Donald Trump</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-dangerous-consequences-of-the-great-and-unmatched-wisdom</link>
      <description>Donald Trump has given the blessing of the U.S. to a Turkish invasion of Northern Syria that could lead to a humanitarian catastrophe for the Kurds, the alienation of an important ally, greater distrust among our other allies, and benefits for the Assad Regime, Iran and Russia. It has triggered a rare, bi-partisan chorus of condemnation of the president...and, within hours, military action on the Turkish-Syrian border. We are joined by a former U.S. Under Secretary of Defense Michele Flournoy, Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake of the IISS, and Ed Luce of the Financial Times to discuss this latest calamitous decision by Trump and its likely consequences. Don't miss this essential conversation.

      <description>The die is cast. Impeachment hearings are underway. The Trump presidency is in great (and well-deserved) peril. But, getting from where we are to an impeachment vote in the House and a conviction in the Senate will require a completely different tone and conduct from the Democratic leadership. And forestalling the end of the Trump presidency will require a change of pace from the White House. Edward Luce of the Financial Times and Mieke Eoyang, Vice President for National Security at the Third Way discuss and consider what is likely to happen next. Essential listening. Join us.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/have-we-turned-the-corner-on-impeachment</link>
      <description>A week ago a substantial majority of Americans opposed even an impeachment inquiry. Today, a majority of all Americans support such an inquiry and fully half support impeaching Trump outright. That's a massive swing that makes the support for impeaching Trump vastly greater than what it was at comparable moments for either Richard Nixon or Bill Clinton. How did we get here? Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund and Joe Cirincione of the Ploughshares Fund discuss, breaking down the latest developments and offering perspective you can find nowhere else. Tune in.

      <title>What Tiny 16 Year-Old Towers Over America's President?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/what-tiny-16-year-old-towers-over-americas-president</link>
      <description>The answer of course to the question posed in the title of this podcast is Greta Thunberg, the extraordinary young Scandinavian leader who has delivered the message that the climate crisis is real and urgent better than any world leader. America's president is a source of particular contempt for her as their recent passing encounter at the UN revealed. We discuss her impact, his impact, and the other big issues likely to be discussed in and around the UN General Assembly meetings this week in New York. Join Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School, Kori Schake of IISS and Max Bergmann of the Center for American Progress for a scintillating and timely discussion.

      <title>Donald Trump is the MRSA of Presidents: A Grave Threat Our System Can't Fight Off</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/donald-trump-is-the-mrsa-of-presidents-a-grave-threat-our-sy</link>
      <description>Our political system has built into it a kind of immune system to protect it from abuse and abusers. But just as how in life, bacteria develop that are resistant to drugs, so too in our system we have seen the emergence of a kind of threat that resists oversight, checks and balances and processes designed to keep us safe from corruption and tyranny. Donald Trump is just such a threat and recent revelations regarding how Trump's team sought to kill an investigation into suspect conversations he had with foreign leaders and further illustrations of Trumpworld's efforts to place the president above the law prove it. We discuss with the Washington Post's Greg Sargent, Amb. Ivo Daalder of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of "Just Security" and a professor at NYU Law School. It is an essential conversation. Don't miss it.

      <description>We're getting into the serious campaigning for president and so far it's fair to say foreign policy hasn't really been front and center. Or anywhere to speak of. Should it be? Does it matter? Would say, a war in the Middle East matter? Like if it started...real soon? Or what about future Russian interference in the election? Anything? We discuss with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School, Kori Schake of IISS and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Foundation. Join us.

      <title>Stand by For An Avalanche of Sh*t: Trump Foreign Policy Post-Bolton &amp; Pre-Election</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/stand-by-for-an-avalanche-of-sht-trump-foreign-policy-post-b</link>
      <description>John Bolton may not be National Security Advisor any more but it hardly matters because he wasn't actually ever really National Security Advisor to begin with. Trump never empowered him. Trump doesn't want advice. And that's why the NSC has withered and died. And that's why in the next year you can expect Trump to push for a bunch of very bad deals worldwide because he thinks it will help his election chances. Also: Impeachment heats up! Join us for a special, somewhat hair-raising conversation with two brilliant NSC veterans, Center for American Progress Vice President Kelly Magsamen and CNN Commentator Sam Vinograd plus our regular Thursday co-hosts, Ryan Goodman of "Just Security" and NYU Law School and David Rothkopf.

      <description>Today the House Judiciary Committee announced the new guidelines for its impeachment investigation. We are joined on this special edition of National Security Magazine by Representative Ted Lieu of California, a member of both the Judiciary and the Foreign Affairs Committees, who discusses where the investigation will go from here and shares his own view on the "mountains of evidence" pointing to the commission of multiple felonies by President Donald Trump. We also discuss the departure of National Security Advisor John Bolton and the Trump Administration's inexplicable fondness for President Vladimir Putin. Or maybe it is explicable. Join us and find out.

      <title>Summer's Over, Now Things are Really Going to Get Crazy</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/summers-over-now-things-are-really-going-to-get-crazy</link>
      <description>We bet you think that there was plenty of crazy to go around this summer and that you were as unsettled by each day's news as you could be. Nonsense. We live in Trump times where yesterday's inconceivable outrage is wrapping today's fish and we're on to something we didn't even have a word for yesterday. That's not just true in the US either. Britain is reeling from its worst democratic crisis in centuries. The Taliban were coming to visit Camp David until they were not. The CIA pulled an asset from Russia because they didn't trust...the US President. Congress is ramping up impeachment investigations. And for some reason Ivanka dressed like a lily pad when repping the US with the President of Colombia. And Labor Day is just past. We help you prepare with this great back-to-school edition of your favorite pod featuring Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, IISS's Kori Schake and the Financial Times Ed Luce. Join us!
This episode is brought to you by the Election Ride Home Podcast.  The Election Ride Home is a podcast dedicated to figuring out who that someone... or maybe even multiple someones... will end up being. Every day at 5pm eastern, veteran journalist and This American Life contributor Chris Higgins catches you up on what happened on the campaign trail. Who's up, who's down, what issues are getting traction, what do the polls say. It's a 15-20 minute show that keeps track of all the latest and summarizes it so you don't have to be nervously refreshing your web browser 12 times a day. It's like TLDR as a service. So, if you want to catch up on what you missed on your way home, search your podcast app and subscribe to the Election Ride Home podcast.  Listen here.

      <title>Four Minutes from Armageddon</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/four-minutes-from-armageddon</link>
      <description>If the president of the United States decides to launch a nuclear attack, our system is designed for him to be able to do so quickly and for virtually no one to be able to stop him. It takes four minutes from the moment he determines to do it until launch. This week, the president was revealed to have thought about using nuclear weapons against hurricanes and that wasn't the craziest thing he said or did. Joe Cirincione of the Ploughshares Fund and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law join David Rothkopf to discuss what protections may exist if the president has gone crazy. Tune in.

      <title>We Are Not Prepared for Today's Global Threats...or Tomorrow's</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/we-are-not-prepared-for-todays-global-threatsor-tomorrows</link>
      <description>In a far reaching and incisive conversation with Michael Morell, host of CBS News "Intelligence Matters" podcast and former Acting Director of Central Intelligence and Deputy Director of the CIA from 2010-2013, we discuss a world situation that in his view presents more challenges than any we have faced since World War II. However great the threats confronting us may be, they are however, compounded by problems we face at home: tension between the White House and the Intelligence Community, a political choice not to prepare for coming interference in our 2020 elections, a desire to minimize extremist threats overseas and policy choices that have exacerbated global unease. Further, our leaders and our next generation policymakers are ill-prepared to understand or deal with the emerging technologies that are remaking war, espionage, and international relations. This is an episode you won't want to miss.

      <title>Special End of Summer Collusionpalooza!!!</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/special-end-of-summer-collusionpalooza</link>
      <description>The collusion hits just keep on coming on Deep State Radio. We don't just have the 2016 oldies that made the Mueller Report so great (or so long, anyway), we've got the on-going collusion between the Trump Administration and Russian disinformation warriors (special shout out here to Attorney General Bill Barr) and that between Mitch McConnell and The Obstructors and their pals back in the land of borscht and bribes. And all that's to say nothing of what is sure to come as we approach the 2020 campaign. We've got it all plus: How America Could Screw Up the Next Election. With Ryan Goodman of Just Security and NYU Law School and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law Center, this is just the end of summer podcast you've been looking for!

      <title>Greenland, The 51st State</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/greenland-the-51st-state</link>
      <description>﻿In an obvious attempt to infuriate Puerto Rican statehood advocates, Donald Trump wants to buy Greenland. And if a few thousand Republicans would move up there (as they no doubt would to mine and drill the hell out of its every beautiful nook and cranny) then he would no doubt welcome it as a state. Come to think of it, if we can designate which Republicans move there, maybe everyone can get behind this idea. We discuss this surprising foreign policy gambit plus other slightly more serious ones--like China, Hong Kong and the collapse of the UK into teeny tiny pieces with Kori Schake of IISS and Ed Luce of the FT. Tune in.

      <description>General James Clapper was both the Director of National Intelligence and the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, one of the most distinguished intelligence leaders of the past several decades. We discuss with him where the Russia investigation is post-Mueller, the challenges for the intelligence community in the face of leadership upheaval and the risks associated with the upcoming election and his belief that it won't be just Russia interfering in our democracy next year. Tune in for this important conversation.

      <title>"This is the Best Time to Be Your Worst Selves"--Trump's Message to the World</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/this-is-the-best-time-to-be-your-worst-selves-trumps-message</link>
      <description>America is reeling from two more mass shootings. White nationalism and our gun pathology have combined with the encouragement of the White House to create tragedy upon tragedy and deeper divisions within our society. But the cost of the White House's combination of malevolence and ignorance is every bit as great overseas and even as America was mourning the shootings the world grew materially more dangerous. Over the past few days we have seen Chinese troops mass on the Hong Kong border, Greenland melt and the Amazon be laid waste by environmental rapists, the end of one of Regan's signature arms treaties and escalating nuclear risks in India, Pakistan, Iran and North Korea, more bloodshed in Syria, more political chaos in the UK, deepening market fears of trade and currency wars...and Trump's errors, ignorance and dark impulses have fed each and every one of these. And given his message to the world that now is the best time to be your worst self because the US, once a moral leader, will do nothing...it may even reward you...promises greater crises to come. We discuss with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School, Joe Cirincione of the Plowshare Fund and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund. Tune in.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/how-many-articles-of-impeachment-does-donald-trump-deserve</link>
      <description>Now that a majority of Democrats in the House of Representatives support an impeachment inquiry and the House has argued in court that such an inquiry is already under way, the question becomes where does it lead? How do you frame impeachment articles that best hold the president accountable for his crimes and how do you ensure that with or without a vote on impeachment, the inquiry does the most good for the country. Also: What happens after Trump leaves office? Should he be prosecuted or not? Former US Attorney and regular MSNBC commentator Joyce Vance and NYU Law School Professor Ryan Goodman, co-editor of "Just Security" join us for a very important discussion on one of the biggest issues of our time. Tune in.

      <description>Dan Coats was not a perfect Director of National Intelligence, but he was a good one, a truth-teller in an administration of slavering sycophants. He will be missed, especially since his replacement is another sycophant of the mouth-frothing variety and someone who will become a key part of a new Praetorian Guard surrounding Trump. Like Barr and McConnell he will place Trump and the GOP above national security at a moment of serious threats. It's not good. We discuss with our original Fab Four of experts Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, Ed Luce and David Sanger. Which of the four is John, Paul, George or Ringo? Tune in as we discuss and we also consider the rise in Trumpism worldwide, stirrings of people power movements and a summer that reminds us just how severe the climate crisis is.

      <title> Racism, Hatred and the Moment in American and World Politics</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/racism-hatred-and-the-moment-in-american-and-world-politics</link>
      <description>According to Jonathan Greenblatt, National Director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, this is a particular fraught moment in the long history of the politics of race and history in America and around the world. We talk to Greenblatt in a special, thought-provoking, wide-ranging interview that touches upon the President's attacks on the members of "The Squad," the perversity of turning accusations of anti-semitism into a racist cudgel, the institutionalization of hate in America and the global rise of ethnographies-nationalism. It is one of the most disturbing trends of our era and you should not miss this essential discussion of why we are here and where we are headed.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/and-now-for-something-even-more-stupid-and-dangerous-than-th</link>
      <description>As the great foreign policy scholar Dean Wormer of Faber College once said, "Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son." It's also no way to run a foreign policy. In fact, you don't even have to be fat or drunk for stupid to screw up a policy. This week has seen some really extraordinary cluelessness from the man who says his gut can steer US international affairs. And we discuss where it all might lead with Edward Luce of the Financial Times, Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund and Brian Klaas of University College, London. You could miss it. But then you wouldn't know what is about to go terrible wrong(er).

      <title>200 Podcast Episodes Later How Bad Have Things Gotten for America?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/200-podcast-episodes-later-how-bad-have-things-gotten-for-am</link>
      <description>It's not our fault. The month before DSR started Comey got fired, Mueller got hired, and we were off to the races with the Greatest Witch Hunt in History. Many witches later...and 200 podcasts later...we look back to ask: What has changed the most in America since we launched? Join Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Kori Schake of IISS, Christine Wormuth of the Rand Corporation and Ed Luce of the financial times for a special episode that makes up in sharp insights what it lacks in confetti and popping champagne corks!
Our 200th episode is brought to you by MOVA Globes. MOVA Globes turn all on their own, with or without a base, in any setting with ambient lighting. No batteries are needed and no sloppy cords to detract from your enjoyment. Each globe has a transparent outer shell made from carefully selected, high-quality acrylic. This external layer remains stationary while an internal one spins using advanced magnets for torque and solar cells to power the movement.

      <description>As part of our celebration of 200th episode, we had a special conversation with Lawrence O'Donnell, host of MSNBC's "The Last Word" and one of the keenest, most candid observers of Washington anywhere. We discuss with him how this moment is different from all others, the critical mistakes we may be making and why nonetheless, there may be reason for hope. Following that we then turn to former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman for a discussion of what to expect from next week's Mueller hearings and beyond. You won't want to miss either conversation. Join us...and then join next week for a 200th Episode special with the folks who got us here, our beloved regulars.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/ivankas-in-charge-everybody-nothing-to-worry-about</link>
      <description>When the special relationship starts coming apart at the seams because of an unfortunate outbreak of stating the obvious, who you gonna call? Ivanka! From the DMZ to world leader photo ops to Brexit, America's crown princess is at the helm. And if she's not available, her second in command, Jared, is always standing by. So, have a nice time at the beach folks. What could go wrong? Our friendly deep staters David Sanger of the New York Times, Kori Schake of IISS and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law all discuss and consider a couple of the areas--take Iran for example--where just maybe there still is something to worry about. Also: go US Women's National Team! And why does Kori have minstrels outside her window in Siena? All this and more in the latest podisode. Tune in!

      <description>Yes, our Constitution is not exactly working as planned. Yes, checks and balances are not checking or balancing. Yes, the president and his family are behaving like royals on the world stage. Yes, this July 4th might be seen to celebrate not the revolution to break away from one mad king but the ascension of another. But surely there are things to celebrate about America today, right? Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund discuss...and give you plenty to celebrate this holiday weekend. Tune in. And be patient. The good stuff starts right after we list all the things we have to worry about. Whoopee! Happy Fourth everybody!

      <title>It's a Great Time to Be a Nuke!</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/its-a-great-time-to-be-a-nuke</link>
      <description>President Trump became the first American president to enter North Korea. That's the good news. He also seems to be heading for a deal with North Korea that may freeze their nuclear arsenal at 20-60 warheads. That's not so good. It's not good because we will then reward Kim Jong Un for building that arsenal by lifting sanctions, we will get only nominal gains, like the shutdown of perhaps one aging nuclear facility, and because well...it's a deal with a country that has broken its last two nuclear deals with us. The Iranians are watching eagerly thinking, "We want one of those deals." So...maybe let's hold off on the celebrations of a breakthrough for a bit. David Sanger of the New York Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund discuss in an important, scary episode. Tune in!

      <title>Good Question for the Next Debate: Do You Have a Son-in-Law and Will He Control Your Foreign Policy?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/good-question-for-the-next-debate-do-you-have-a-son-in-law-a</link>
      <description>So, there was this war with Iran, remember? Then there wasn't. Then there were cyberattacks. But what did they do? And were they legal? And why did we do them? And isn't all this making another war in the Middle East more likely--whether Trump wants it or not? We start our conversation on this issues with a first-rate panel featuring Sharon Weinberger of Yahoo News, Ed Luce of the FT, David Sanger of the NY Times and Ryan Goodman of Just Security. And from there it's off to the Dem debates, the misunderstood nature of "red" states and how the Supreme Court of the United States may just have delivered a real blow to democracy. You don't want to miss this stellar episode of Deep State Radio.

      <title>50/50 in 2020: Why So Many Candidates are Pledging Gender Parity in National Security Leadership</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5050-in-2020-why-so-many-candidates-are-pledging-gender-pari</link>
      <description>From one perspective, this is not a particularly auspicious moment for women at the top ranks of the US government. There are fewer women in leadership roles in the Trump Administration and then, of course, there's the fact the president has been credibly accused of being a rapist. More than once. That said, there are also some very promising signs and one of the most exciting is a new initiative to ensure gender parity at the highest levels of our national security leadership in the next administration. It is called LCWINS and it has caught on with 15 campaigns already and we discuss why with three leaders of the initiative--our own Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Beverly Kirk of CSIS and our old friend Julie Smith, currently in residence at the Bosch Academy in Berlin. It's a great and timely discussion of an important issue. Please join us.

      <description>There's a lot we don't know about cyberwar. But that doesn't mean we can stop progress from happening while we figure it out. So, Russia attacks us, we attack back, escalation occurs and who knows, our officials may or may not tell the president because, you know, his fondness for Russia and his problems with polysyllabic words and so forth. That could be a problem, no? We discuss with Kori Schake of IISS, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law Center and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund...and believe us, you won't come away from this feeling all warm and comfy about where we are. Tune in.

      <title>America Loves Foreign Policy. No, Really...</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/america-loves-foreign-policy-no-really</link>
      <description>It is conventional wisdom that Americans want nothing to do with the world save for cheap imports and K-Pop music. Even New York Times columnists say so. But, the reality is far different. In fact, polling suggests the opposite is true. America's welcome foreign engagement and support our allies and alliances. We discuss what's true and what this may mean in the 2020 elections with Ivo Daalder, President of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Kori Schake of IISS, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund. Take that conventional wisdom!

      <itunes:summary>It is conventional wisdom that Americans want nothing to do with the world save for cheap imports and K-Pop music. Even New York Times columnists say so. But, the reality is far different. In fact, polling suggests the opposite is true. America's welcome foreign engagement and support our allies and alliances. We discuss what's true and what this may mean in the 2020 elections with Ivo Daalder, President of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Kori Schake of IISS, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund. Take that conventional wisdom!

      <title>R.I.P. "A Nation of Laws Not Men", 1780-2019</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/rip-a-nation-of-laws-not-men-1780-2019</link>
      <description>In 1780 John Adams wrote "For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be king; and there ought to be no other." It was in the Massachusetts Constitution that he was trying to enshrine the idea that the new U.S. would be "a nation of laws not men." It was a nice idea while it lasted. This week, as we discuss with Ben Wittes of Lawfare, Ryan Goodman of Just Security and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, that idea met a handful of new challenges that may amount to some of the toughest it has ever faced in the U.S. Now what? We discuss that--and the use of force in Iran--with our brilliant, engaging, insightful guests. Join us.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-great-successor-a-conversation-with-anna-fifield-on-her</link>
      <description>Anna Fifield, Beijing Bureau Chief of the Washington Post, has written an extraordinary new book providing never before available insights into North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. Deep State Radio regular's Kori Schake of IISS and David Sanger of the New York Times, join Anna for a discussion of the book, of Kim, of the current fragile state of U.S.-N.K. relations (and why a deal may yet happen before election day 2020). We also look at the fraught U.S.-China relationship and why tensions in the South China Sea might not be the most contentious flashpoint the two countries face. Tune in!

      <title>One on One with Prof. Lawrence Tribe: A Different Path Toward Impeachment</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/one-on-one-with-prof-lawrence-tribe-a-different-path-toward</link>
      <description>Impeachment has become a charged word in our national political debate. But the framers of our Constitution saw it as an essential tool in protecting the integrity of our government and the interests of the American people. Professor Lawrence Tribe, of Harvard Law School, is one of the country's leading constitutional scholars and he has recently written of a path forward the House of Representatives can follow that does not hold them hostage to the partisanship of the U.S. Senate. He draws on history and the Constitution itself to explain why undertaking such hearing now is essential and why the costs of failing to do so will be very high indeed. It's essential listening. Join us.

      <title>National Psychosis or Constitutional Rot, the Question Remains: Is there a Cure?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/national-psychosis-or-constitutional-rot-the-question-remain</link>
      <description>The disinformation war of the President, AG Barr and their associates is unlike any we have ever seen in US history...and this is a country that knows a thing or two about bullshit. But not only is the Team Trump effort more sweeping, but thanks to Barr, the administration is now trying to translate their alternative reality into an institutional outcome, blunting the efforts of the Congress to do oversight by simply arguing that they don't have authority or what they seek is irrelevant or that they are investigating the wrong crimes. It has stifled investigation for half a year and looks like it may largely negate Democratic efforts altogether. To figure out what the remedy might be, we have to understand the underlying issues and that's what we discuss with guests Greg Sargent of the Washington Post and Ryan Goodman of Just Security and NYU Law School. It's a powerful, thought-provoking and disturbing discussion. Don't miss it.

        <![CDATA[<p>The disinformation war of the President, AG Barr and their associates is unlike any we have ever seen in US history...and this is a country that knows a thing or two about bullshit. But not only is the Team Trump effort more sweeping, but thanks to Barr, the administration is now trying to translate their alternative reality into an institutional outcome, blunting the efforts of the Congress to do oversight by simply arguing that they don't have authority or what they seek is irrelevant or that they are investigating the wrong crimes. It has stifled investigation for half a year and looks like it may largely negate Democratic efforts altogether. To figure out what the remedy might be, we have to understand the underlying issues and that's what we discuss with guests Greg Sargent of the Washington Post and Ryan Goodman of Just Security and NYU Law School. It's a powerful, thought-provoking and disturbing discussion. Don't miss it.</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Balloons Over London: The Latest Dispatch from the Milkshake Wars</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/balloons-over-london-the-latest-dispatch-from-the-milkshake</link>
      <description>Much as the barrage balloons that used to float above London during the blitz were ominous reminders of dire impending threats, so too does the large inflatable Baby Trump that floats over London when the American president visits convey a foreboding message. Trump's trip, despite the pomp offered up by the Royal Family, has come with protests and much the same is expected when he arrives in Ireland and later this week in Europe. Does it suggest a deep or permanent rift in the trans-Atlantic relationship or something more temporary? Our regulars Rosa Brooks, David Sanger, Ed Luce and Evelyn Farkas discuss these and other big international issues of the week in a podcast that was lively but milkshake attack free. Join us!

      <description>Nada Bakos was a CIA targeter during the height of the War on Terror. She has just completed a compelling new book on her experiences on the ground in the Middle East, at the Agency and coping with the White House and other political leaders in Washington. It is not only a great read but it offers valuable insights that are relevant today re: Iran, terrorism, and how we view intelligence in the wake of Russia's attack on our democracy and the President's regular attacks on the intelligence community. Join host David Rothkopf, Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and "Just Security" and Nada Bakos for an urgent, compelling discussion.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-good-news-is-not-every-part-of-the-frog-has-been-boiled</link>
      <description>From the potential for abuse associated with indictments like those handed down in the case of Julian Assange to the potential for abuse in not handing down such indictments, from the president's continued bullying of his adversaries and those who might testify against him to the ever-growing list of court cases involving Donald Trump and his team, our system is being tested as never before. But there are some glimmers of hope such as signs the judiciary will stand up to the White House's assault on the rule of law and growing sentiment that further steps must be taken to hold Trump accountable. On this episode of DSR Live, our guests, Ryan Goodman of Just Security and NYU Law School and former prosecutor Mimi Rocah, a regular MSNBC commentator, discuss the good, the bad and the ugly of America's simmering political and legal crisis. Tune in for an in-depth discussion that could not be more timely.

      <description>Nigel Farage, who got one, certainly does? But who else does? Who might deserve a pumpkin pie? And, while we're at it, do you think that will stop the spread of right wing nuts like Farage? The news suggests no. So what's to be done? And...what about the other horrifying things that are going on around the world--wars, near-wars, unending-wars, trade wars? We discuss it all with a classic Deep State Radio line-up: Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Kori Schake of IISS, Ed Luce of the FT and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund. Tune in!

      <title>The Threat Is Not War With Iran, It's Right Here at Home</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-threat-is-not-war-with-iran-its-right-here-at-home</link>
      <description>Trump talks tough. But like most bullies, he shies away from any real fight. The problem is talking tough increases tensions and that raises the risk of accidental war (made more possible by the fact our National Security Advisor is a pyromaniac with a box of matches). But scary as all that is, more dangerous is what is happening at home--both in terms of the GOP war on our democracy, on women, on immigrants and on our every standard of decency and in terms of what has been a pretty sluggish response to it all by the Democrats in the Congress. What's next and why you should always have a basement full of non-perishable treats are what we discuss with DSR regular Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School and our friends from the Unredacted from DSR podcast, Philippe Reines, Molly Jong-Fast and Emily Brandwin. Tune in!

      <title>The Zebra Problem and Russiagate as the Original Sin of the Trump Administration</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-zebra-problem-and-russiagate-as-the-original-sin</link>
      <description>As one of our guests on this week's episode, Max Bergmann of the Center for American Progress pointed out, the Trump Administration presents the so-called "Zebra Problem." Zebra's stripes might not appear great camouflage against green or ground plains, but they are a very effective aid in helping individual zebras blend in against the backdrop of the herd, providing good protection against lions. The Trump equivalent is being responsible for so many crimes that they all tend to blur together--which may have the effect of lulling the public to inaction and keeping Trump &amp; Co. from ending up wearing stripes. That said, as Max and our other guest, Joe Cirincione of the Ploughshares Fund point out, another consequence of Trump's serial abuses is that while the Russia case may get the headlines, it may have been the least of the blows they have struck against America and American worldwide leadership. But look more closely and you will see that Trump-Russia touches almost all of Trump's dangerous international policies and our great discussion with these two explains why. Tune in for important perspectives that are seldom offered!

      <title>The President of the United States is a One Man Crime Wave</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-president-of-the-united-states-is-a-one-man-crime-wave</link>
      <description>The Speaker of the House and Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee have declared we are in a Constitutional Crisis. The White House has adopted a policy of "total stonewalling" denying any documents to any House committee to enable mandated oversight. The GOP is playing hardball knowing that whether they delay outcomes or prevent them outright they win. It's a war of attrition and if it gets them to a win in November 2020 it's a huge victory. They're enabling an imperial presidency via a political insurgency and they don't care whether the US or our system are weakened or our enemies empowered...so long as they win. So what's the Democratic Party opposition to do? We discuss with Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Washington Post and Ryan Goodman of Just Security. It's a helluva discussion. BYOB. You don't want to miss this one.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/constitutional-rot-part-twelve-how-much-of-this-can-we-take</link>
      <description>Where do we start? Trump renews his video bromance with Vladimir Putin and Putin smiles. Then they collude to agree they didn't collude. 800 prosecutors say Trump should be charged with multiple felony counts for obstruction and while they're at it, seem to suggest that Attorney General Bill Barr is a partisan hack. Trump is above the law and there may not be anything we can do about it. Crisis? Yes. But is it a Constitutional Crisis? And who cares? Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund to discuss with host, David Rothkopf. Join us!

        <![CDATA[<p>Where do we start? Trump renews his video bromance with Vladimir Putin and Putin smiles. Then they collude to agree they didn't collude. 800 prosecutors say Trump should be charged with multiple felony counts for obstruction and while they're at it, seem to suggest that Attorney General Bill Barr is a partisan hack. Trump is above the law and there may not be anything we can do about it. Crisis? Yes. But is it a Constitutional Crisis? And who cares? Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund to discuss with host, David Rothkopf. Join us!</p><br><p>Support us by supporting our sponsor: Blinkist is the only app that takes the best key takeaways, the need-to-know information from thousands of nonfiction books and condenses them down into just 15 minutes so you can read -or- listen to.

      <title>So Much for Conventional Wisdom, America Actually Seems to Care About Foreign Policy</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/so-much-for-conventional-wisdom-america-actually-seems-to-ca</link>
      <description>It has long been a foundational belief of political smarties everywhere that the average American does not give a hoot about foreign policy. But that, according to a new study from the Center for American Progress, is just not true. Maybe 20 percent don't give a hoot. And about 30 percent are nutty nationalists. But 50 percent are more in the internationalist vein which could have big implications for the 2020 elections. We discuss with CAP's Brian Katulis, Georgetown Law's Rosa Brooks and the German Marshall Fund's Evelyn Farkas. (And while we're at it, we throw in a little Iran, Israel, North Korea and Venezuela for good measure. Tune in!)

      <description>On this episode, our experts Edward Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law Center and Kori Schake of IISS reveal the secret and disturbingly advanced plans of Donald Trump to blow the international system that America helped create after World War II. It's farther along than you might think...and scary as can be. Which leads back to the one dominant question that arises while discussing Trump--is he evil or is he just really stupid? Rosa offers a compromise. Tune in to find out what it is.

      <title>The One In Which Kori Schake Shuts Down the Biden Campaign Before It Gets Started</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-one-in-which-kori-schake-shuts-down-the-biden-campaign-b</link>
      <description>It has been a busy week in foreign affairs even if you have been too glued to the Mueller Report, the White House Easter Egg roll and Game of Thrones to pay any attention. Ukraine elected a comedian with no government experience as president and while that was a triumph for democracy, well, now comes the hard part. The US ratcheted up tensions with Iran and we all know where that's going. North Korea tweaked the president with a test of a new weapons system. And...the Democratic presidential race got one candidate with a big foreign policy pedigree. But we must ask, does such a pedigree matter or is something else more important. Tune in to listen to Kori Schake slam home that answer in the midst of quotes from the "Far Side" and Walt Whitman and then to listen the German Marshall Fund's Laura Rosenberger, formerly Hillary Clinton's top foreign policy advisor, offer a perspective on what really matters in a candidate.

      <title>Remember the Part of the Mueller Report that Was About Being Attacked by a Foreign Enemy?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/remember-the-part-of-the-mueller-report-that-was-about-being</link>
      <description>No, the Mueller report was not about exoneration. No, it was not about politics. But one thing it was about at its inception was that the US had been attacked by a foreign enemy and we wanted to find out why. Presumably with the intent of stopping it. So...how come we're not doing that? And how come we're not more outraged that our government seems to think saving their own skin is more important than that, so important that they deem it essential to protect our attackers? We discuss with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Kori Schake of IISS, and Laura Rosenberger of the German Marshall Fund. This is important, don't miss it.

      <title>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Mueller Report</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-mueller-report</link>
      <description>We'll get some of the Mueller Report later this week. Or the Barr version of the Mueller Report. And it is certain to prove the president innocent...or guilty. Hot takes will fly. But as our guests Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School and Ed Luce of the Financial Times point out, we won't know for days what this version of the report means or what it's missing. So take a nap. Have a walk. Play with your kids. Celebrate Easter or Passover. Enjoy the weekend, you won't miss a thing if you skip Twitter for a few days (provided you listen to our episode). What's more, note our guests, the Mueller Report is probably the least of our problems. So...um...there's also that. Feel better yet?

        <![CDATA[<p>This week on “Washington for Beautiful People,” Emily’s special guest is a chef, entrepreneur, father, teacher, author, television host and the guy who eats all the strange shit….Andrew Zimmern. Andrew and Emily talk politics but dive into a discussion about social activism and surviving major life struggles. They also talk about St. Louis cuisine (yes, it’s good…ignore Bagelgate) and Emily gets shamed but then gets tips on how to perfect her key lime pie (hint, she’s been doing it ALL wrong.)</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Empty Posturing with Iran?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/empty-posturing-with-iran</link>
      <description>The US has designated Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization, the first time it has done so with a foreign military. Some see this as the ratcheting up of tensions and a prelude to war. Some see it as another gift to the re-election campaign of Bibi Netanyahu. And some, including our experts, see it primarily as more posturing from a blustering bully who doesn't want any real wars on his watch, he just wants to look tough. Kori Schake of IISS, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund discuss and consider where, if anywhere, we might nonetheless bumble into conflict. Tune in.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/another-fine-mess-the-country-is-full-but-the-administration</link>
      <description>According to the president, we have a crisis on our southern border. And we have national security threats from N. Korea to Venezuela to Iran. And yet, we don't have a Secretary of Defense, of the Air Force, a WH Chief of Staff, a UN Ambassador and well, anybody of consequence in any top job at the Department of Homeland Security. Which leaves everything to our president his slathering loyal assistant Igor...er, Stephen Miller. Which would make for a great horror movie but a lousy national security prognosis for the world's most powerful nation. Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, Evelyn Farkas and David Rothkopf discuss. Join us.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/who-is-americas-worst-allyand-can-joe-biden-make-everythin</link>
      <description>As we look toward 2020 will it matter that apparently the White House was handing out security clearances like candy on Halloween? Will Trump's horrible foreign policy matter? (Or will the ways he attempts to spin it as a yuge success?) And can Joe Biden save the day...or at least give us a soothing shoulder massage? (We joke because we love. Ok, we're ambivalent. But we joke anyway.). Join Kori Schake of IISS, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School and host, David Rothkopf of somewhere near's Joe's Pizzeria in New York City, for this latest episode of what we might call, if we were Donald Trump, your favorite podcast.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/sen-chris-murphy-from-the-middle-east-to-the-southern-border</link>
      <description>Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut has since entering the U.S. Senate in 2013 emerged as one of its leading voices on foreign policy and, especially on the issue of the War in Yemen, has become a voice of conscience that has led one of the rare instances of a bi-partisan pushback against Trump Administration policy. We discuss the current state of the US-Saudi relationship, Yemen, Iran, the Middle East, the possibility of future attacks by the Russians and others on our democratic institutions and the Trump-created crisis at the the Mexico border in a wide-ranging, provocative conversation. Join us.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/thats-a-pretty-putrid-pony-blanket-youve-got-there</link>
      <description>According to our Kori Schake of IISS, a military term for a strategy document is a "pony blanket." On this episode we do the unthinkable and discuss our "strategies" (and we use the term loosely) in the Americas at the moment--in Venezuela, on our border, with the countries of Central America and with some new regional leaders who are, let's face it, pretty awful. (You know who you are Jair and AMLO.). Join us as we spend a caliente episode south of the border with Kori, David Sanger of the New York Times and Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks.

      <title>Jump Down the Trash Shoot Flyboy: A Brexit Update</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/jump-down-the-trash-shoot-flyboy-a-brexit-update</link>
      <description>The current leadership in the UK may or may not be the worst since the low points of Plantagenet rule. Our experts Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Kori Schake of IISS, and Amanda Sloat of Brookings, consider this, the likelihood that a Robin Hood is likely to emerge to save the U.K. (hopefully not the Russell Crowe version) and what may be next in that country's mad march toward self-destruction. It's an important issue with deep ties to the Trump-Russia investigation, as well. Join us.

      <title>Natasha Bertrand: This Is Only the End of the Beginning of the Trump-Russia Saga</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/natasha-bertrand-this-is-only-the-end-of-the-beginning-of-th</link>
      <description>Few journalists have so distinguished themselves in their coverage of the Trump-Russia investigations as has Natasha Bertrand, staff writer for the Atlantic and analyst for NBC News. We discuss the recent developments in the case from the Barr letter purporting to summarize the Mueller Report to the storm of controversy it has generated. We explore prevailing misconceptions about the case and consider where it may go from here in a wide-ranging, in-depth and must-listen discussion. Tune in for one of the most useful overviews you will get of where this case stands right now--which may be at the brink of a Constitutional crisis.

      <description>Despite the pronouncements of the Trump Administration that the president has been fully exonerated (and those by his spokesperson that people who accused him are guilty of treason and should be put to death), let's not get ahead of ourselves. Especially about the death penalty for Trump critics part. That's a little close to home. We've still not seen the actual Mueller report, note our experts Rosa Brooks and Evelyn Farkas, and regardless of what it says, the president is still awash in corruptions, surrounded by thugs and the subject of many more investigations. So perhaps this latest "turning point" for Trump may not be much of a turning point at all. We discuss. So you should tune in.

      <title>Did I Forget to Mention, His Dad Worked for the CIA: A Conversation with Diedrich Bader</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/did-i-forget-to-mention-his-dad-worked-for-the-cia-a-convers</link>
      <description>Diedrich Bader was born in D.C, lived in Paris, Dad worked for the CIA (yup, that CIA) and he has an IMDB page that's longer than a CVS receipt. I think it's official, Diedrich Bader just claimed the title as the most interesting man in the world. Growing up, Bader's family's business was USG and as a result we had a lively, passionate, wide ranging conversation on what's working and what isn't working in Washington (hint: D.C. is broken y'all.) You know Bader as the scene stealer from Veep, Office Space, and American Housewife, but really get to know him on this podcast.

      <description>In this episode of Deep State Radio, David Rothkopf remains in an undisclosed location, and Rosa Brooks -- the Mike Pence of Deep State Radio (or maybe the Harry Truman?) -- again steps in as host. Rosa, Ed Luce and Heather Hurlburt wonder if the US college admissions scandal tells us something about global fears of class slippage and economic ruin, and the team does a round robin on issues in the news: Saudi kill teams, Syrian chaos, and the end of the Trum Kim Jung Un love affair.

      <description>In this episode of Deep State Radio, David Rothkopf takes a "vacation," and Rosa Brooks steps in as hostess with the mostest. Ed Luce tell listeners that the prospects of a brand new Brexit referendum are looking brighter in the United Kingdom, and outlines the options the British electorate should be offered: Stay, May, or D-Day. Also in this episode, Ed, Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and Heather Hurlburt examine the globalization of white nationalist terrorism, and ask what we would gain -- or lose -- if we start thinking of white nationalism terrorism as a global phenomenon paralleling Islamic extremist terrorism.

      <description>For a man who’s word means nothing and who never met a lie he didn’t like, it is hard to imagine how Donald Trump could produce something even more meaningless than the stream-of-consciousness Twitterized nonsense he offers up daily.  But there is one thing that qualifies and that is the President’s budget because with a Democratic House, there is zero chance his budget plan will be used for anything except lining Congressional hamster cages. Still, it gives some insight into what the president and his advisors are thinking.  And when it comes to national security and foreign policy what it tell us is…disturbing.  Kori Schake of IISS, Mieke Eoyang of the Third Way and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund discuss.  Join us!

        <![CDATA[<p>America and India are entering a rough patch in the relationship between the world’s two biggest democracies.  Trade issues are at the center of the current trouble but the problems go deeper.  And of course, we have seen disturbing tension between India and Pakistan recently.  Is this relationship getting the attention from the Trump Administration it deserves?  Is the attention its getting helping or hurting.  We speak with former US Ambassador to India Timothy Roemer about this and much more...including his perspectives as a former Congressman from Indiana about how the Democrats can win the middle of America and who can do it. You won't want to miss this great conversation with an exceptional American leader. Tune in.</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>Jared Kushner is in charge of the US relations with the Saudis (among others). How's that working for us? Is he the one giving the Saudis the thumbs up that they can abuse human rights to their hearts content without any consequences if they only accept his hare-brained scheme for Middle East Peace (which will never happen)? Is it time for a new approach? And what about the Congressional investigations into Trump? Bibi's indictment? Brexit? Ed Luce of the Financial Times and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School join host David Rothkopf to discuss all this and more. Essential listening. Join us!

      <description>David Sanger was in Hanoi for the failed negotiations between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. He recommends the food, the US approaches to the negotiation not so much. Apparently, leaving it to two megalomaniacal leaders who think they have the skill to land a deal that their negotiators weren't even close to is a bad idea. David discusses the trip and its consequences with Ed Luce of the Financial Times and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School.

      <title>Amb. Michael McFaul: The View from a Point In US-Russia Relations No One Could Have Envisioned</title>

      <description>Five years ago, the Russian invasion of Eastern Ukraine began. That was followed by the annexation of Crimea, US and European sanctions and, soon after, by stepped Russian efforts to undermine the leaders and parties in the West that were opposing him. Which of course, leads not just to Donald Trump but to Brexit and the rise of the right in Europe. It's a stunning turn of events...and events look like they're going to be turning just like this for some time to come. No one is better equipped to make sense of this and give us a perspective on where we are going than former U.S. Ambassador to Russia and professor at Stanford University Michael McFaul. It's a great, thoughtful and wide-ranging conversation. Please tune in

      <description>Craig's college fallback plan was to become a tv writer and when you're as talented and funny as he is, a TV writer is a great fallback plan. Signing with an agent while a senior in college (overachiever) he and his writing partner Carter Bays quickly found work writing for David Letterman and moved on to create the hit show How I Met Your Mother. Craig's path to success wasn't a Disney Movie, unless the hero marches in his High School band (Craig's description of his uniform is chef's kiss perfection). Now that we know how Ted met his wife, Craig is taking on new projects and speaking out against the Orange one. He also offers great marital advice on how to give feedback to your spouse

      <title> Please Stop the News!  It's Too Much!</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/please-stop-the-news-its-too-much</link>
      <description>Depending on your view of history and human life, the Michael Cohen circus on television this Wednesday was the third or fourth most important story of the day (that we know of). Certainly, a shooting war between two nuclear powers like India and Pakistan has got to rank first. And the possibility of a breakthrough between the US and North Korea might rank second (if it actually happens and it is not all for show). Global warming is probably always a bigger story. So we got Katie Phang, Joe Cirincione, and our own Rosa Brooks to cover them all (except global warming...but we'll get to that again soon). Tune in!

      <description>Sometimes the experts at Deep State Radio harbor a slight but noticeable skepticism about the foreign policy acumen of Donald Trump and the band of ignorant thugs around him. But in this episode, nuclear experts Joe Cirincione and Jeffrey Lewis and DSR’s own Rosa Brooks suffer an outbreak of optimism about Trump’s summit with his diminutive love, Kim Jong Un. Is it possible? Where will this lead? Tune in to find out!

      <title>Stephen Walt on Why Less is More in the Middle East and Where Donald Trump Has (Accidentally) Gotten It Right</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/stephen-walt-on-why-less-is-more-in-the-middle-east-and-wher</link>
      <description>Once upon a time Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer wrote a blockbuster book called "The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy." Deep State Radio Host David Rothkopf slammed it. But if you are tuning in to hear the two of them go at each other, you'll be disappointed. Rothkopf admits to Walt he felt his critique of the book was over the top and that Walt and Mearsheimer helped trigger an important conversation in the U.S. Then the two discuss the state of the US-Israel relationship today and why it is so ugly, the best approach for the U.S. in a changing Middle East and where the first two years of Trump foreign policy have left us. (We're still alive, so there's that.) Tune in for a lively, wide-ranging conversation.

      <title>That Time My Friend Turned Out To Be A Russian Spy: A Conversation with Elena Nico</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/that-time-my-friend-turned-out-to-be-a-russian-spy-a-convers</link>
      <description>Everyone has a story to tell and Elena Nicolaou has a helluva one. For years Elena and her family were close friends with Paul Erickson and his girlfriend Maria Butina...yes that Maria Butina. (The "alleged" Russian spy.) Elena details the relationship her family had with Paul and this red headed Russian girlfriend (who was half his age, but no judgement). Maria and Paul went to Disney World with Elena, Maria read Elena's palm and Paul texted Elena about Ariana Grande &amp; Pete Davidson's relationship. If this story seems crazy, wait until you hear it ALL. Tune in for the absolutely crazy and unbelievably true story of the family that befriended the Russian (ahem "alleged") spy.

      <title>What’s Worse Than America Failing Its Allies?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/whats-worse-than-america-failing-its-allies</link>
      <description>Donald Trump’s America has so alienated our traditional allies that when Mike Pence and Ivanka Trump went to the Munich Security Conference this past week, they were humiliated on more than one occasion by a clearly hostile crowd.  But our problem is not just that America is rejecting principles on which it has built its security for decades.  Our allies are faltering and facing deep problems of their own.  Brexit is the worst example.  But everywhere you look there are others.  That means we won’t just be able to hit reset when Trump leaves office (if he ever does).  We may need to start from scratch with new ideas about new alliances for a much changed world.  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law and Ed Luce of the FT discuss whether there are any signs of those new ideas being cooked up now…anywhere.  The answer is…well, let’s not spoil it for you.  But bring a stiff drink (or several) for this one.  Join us!

      <title>Traitors in Plain Sight</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/traitors-in-plain-sight</link>
      <description>In America today we face the shocking reality that there are traitors at the highest level of our government selling out our country.  What makes this more shocking is that depending on which party you are in, you see a different group of traitors.  Incivility is so five years ago.  We’re at the point where the goal is to send your opponents to jail.  That said—the case against one set of traitors is pretty evident on its face and the case against the other is pretty cuckoo. But where does it all lead?  Will it get worse?  Is Mueller the answer?  Or is focusing on fixing what really is broke in America the key.  Join Edward Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University and journalist Sarah Kendzior of the Gaslit Nation podcast for a rousing discussion of our unsettled moment in history.

        <![CDATA[<p>In America today we face the shocking reality that there are traitors at the highest level of our government selling out our country.  What makes this more shocking is that depending on which party you are in, you see a different group of traitors.  Incivility is so five years ago.  We’re at the point where the goal is to send your opponents to jail.  That said—the case against one set of traitors is pretty evident on its face and the case against the other is pretty cuckoo. But where does it all lead?  Will it get worse?  Is Mueller the answer?  Or is focusing on fixing what really is broke in America the key.  Join Edward Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University and journalist Sarah Kendzior of the Gaslit Nation podcast for a rousing discussion of our unsettled moment in history.</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Twitter's Dynamic Duo: My funny, profanity laced, insightful conversation with Rick Wilson and Molly Jong-Fast</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/twitters-dynamic-duo-my-funny-profanity-laced-insightful-con</link>
      <description>They're twitter's dynamic duo: he's the peanut butter to her jelly, the Mickey to her Minnie, the Batman to...you get the point. These two guests are hilarious and when you bring them together on this podcast, THEY ARE FIRE. You'd think that leading GOP strategist RickWilson and liberal writer Molly Jong-Fast would have nothing in common, but you're wrong. They have two very important things in common; they hate Trump and they love our country. In this podcast we talked about twitter trolls (Molly LOVES them) the best nickname ever given to a shady Governor (thank you Rick) and guesses for 2020, along with a ton of other politichitchat.

      <title>The Best American Conspiracy: A Conversation with Brad Meltzer</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/the-best-american-conspiracy-a-conversation-with-brad-meltze</link>
      <description>What if I told you I know this guy who counts U.S. Presidents as fans, has been on the New York Times Bestseller list (many times) &amp; created a tv show that featured a little known actor named Bradley Cooper. You'd say this sounds like a character from a novel and I'd say...you're close. It's author Brad Meltzer whose own life is as interesting as the characters he writes. In this fascinating chat, we talk about his meeting with Tony Mendez (the real CIA officer behind Argo) when he read to George Bush Sr before he passed away and why women make the best subjects for his books on role models.

You'd say this sounds like a character from a novel and I'd say...you're close. It's author Brad Meltzer whose own life is as interesting as the characters he writes. In this fascinating chat, we talk about his meeting with Tony Mendez (the real CIA officer behind Argo) when he read to George Bush Sr before he passed away and why women make the best subjects for his books on role models.</p><p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.</p><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Why Is Adam Schiff Making the President So Nervous?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/why-is-adam-schiff-making-the-president-so-nervous</link>
      <description>Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, is a soft-spoken, thoughtful man who does not at first glance seem to be the kind of person who might put a fright into the most powerful man in the world. But Schiff's announcement of his committee's scope for its investigation into Trump, his family and the financial ties and foreign influence that might have compromised them has sent Donald Trump into a fit of name-calling and personal attacks. Our exclusive conversation with Schiff reveals his new agenda, how his GOP predecessors running the committee may have fallen short...and why they may be targets of the investigation itself. Typically, for the Stanford and Harvard-educated Congressman from the LA-area, he also places the investigations into context even as he enumerate countries, organizations (the NRA) and people who may be in his sights. You won't want to miss a minute of this news-filled conversation. Tune in!

      <title>Rep. Ted Lieu: We are at the Beginning of a New Era in Congressional Foreign Affairs Oversight</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe42</link>
      <description>Congressman Ted Lieu of California, is one of the smartest, hardest working members of the U.S. Congress. A member of the Democratic Leadership, Lieu, brings an undergraduate degree in computer science from Stanford, a magna cum laude law degree from Georgetown where he edited the law review, a background as an Air Force J.A.G. officer, an on-going role as colonel in the Air Force reserve and extensive legislative experience in California to his current work on the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees.  He has been an outspoken critic of President Trump and his enablers in the U.S. Congress and is leading the new Democratic majority’s efforts to uncover the truth about Trump’s ties to the Russians, the Chinese, the Saudis and others who may have responded to the “For Sale” sign the president put up on the front lawn at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  He breaks news about the new oversight agenda of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and where he sees the multiple investigations into Team Trump heading.  He also outlines the positive agenda the Democrats in the House are advancing and the leadership strengths of both Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Kamala Harris, whose presidential candidacy he recently endorsed.

      <title>Tales in Wagging the Dog: I'll Trade You Roger Stone for Nicolas Maduro</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe43</link>
      <description>Roger Stone was very upset the FBI made his dog anxious when they raided his home.  He also was unhappy he did not have chance to put on a nice suit before being hauled in court.  On the other hand, who cares?  He's a big time sleaze and deserves everything he gets.  Meanwhile, no one deserves to be abused as the people of Venezuela have been first by Hugo Chavez and then by Nicolas Maduro.  So the U.S. is helping to lead a push to oust Maduro.What does that have to do with Stone?  Listen in to Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Kori Schake of IISS, David Sanger of the NY Times and Ed Luce of the Financial Times to learn the answer (if the title didn't give it away.)Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>John McLaughlin: "Truth Power" &amp; the Shifting Role of the Intelligence Community in the Age of Trump</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe46</link>
      <description>For more than 30 years, John McLaughlin has been one of the most thoughtful and trusted minds in the U.S. Intelligence Community rising to be Acting Director of Central Intelligence and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.  He sees no precedent for the period we are in, the threats we face both internally and externally nor the challenges these present for the intelligence community or the country.  From a new National Intelligence Strategy that directly challenges the president and his policies to the sweeping success Putin has had undercutting the West's alliances and our vulnerability to future such attacks, our conversation with him is bracing and essential listening.

      <description>Donald Trump has the figure and muscle tone of a baby whale but he moved through the MLK Memorial in Washington on Monday like Usain Bolt.  Traveling with the equally intolerant and odious Mike Pence, the U.S. president was in and out of the memorial in two minutes.  But he went.  Which our own Kori Schake says speaks to the power of norms in our society and is a good thing.  Even better, the rapidly accelerating role for diverse voices in American politics--a trend that gained a big boost with the November elections and another when Cardi B entered the government shutdown debate over the weekend.  Join Kori and guest Joe Cirincione for a discussion of these trends plus--next steps with North Korea on the latest DSR.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>Hostage Musicals, Rap Names and Twitter Trolls: A Conversation with Warren Leight</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe48</link>
      <description>After 300 rejection letters from local newspapers around the country, Warren Leight decided it was time to ditch his journalistic pursuits, and we're lucky he did. Warren has always had his thumb on America's political pulse merging the most topical issues into his work.  While he never found an audience for his feel good hostage musical comedy, he found critical acclaim writing/producing Law &amp; Order SVU.  His new "ripped from the headlines" show Law &amp; Order: Hate Crimes is poised to take deeper look into the issue. And most importantly we talked about Ice-T, Emily's rap name, twitter trolls and why people need to stop blaming him for Chris Meloni leaving SVU.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>Trump may be a disaster as a person and as a president.  But he may also be triggering a rebirth in American political thought and a flowering of new policy ideas.  The progressive branch of the Democratic Party is in the lead at the moment, but with so many areas demanding rethinking, the ferment may spread and we may all be the beneficiaries.  How?  Tune in to our discussion among Georgetown's Rosa Brooks, the Financial Times' Ed Luce, IISS's Kori Schake and the New York Times' David Sanger to discuss new ideas, why they're happening and why their may be a silver lining to the shit storm we are dealing with every day.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

But thanks to Donald Trump and recent revelations about the Russia probe, we may be getting to a point where even persnickety legal experts like our own Rosa Brooks acknowledge that America is on the verge of a constitutional crisis.  A big one.  The likes of which we haven't seen in decades.

      <title>Gen. Mark Hertling: The Nation May Need a Trump Every Once in a While...But for How Long?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe4b</link>
      <description>General Mark Hertling served for 37 years in the U.S. military, rising to become Commanding General of the U.S. Army Europe.  Since his retirement, he has become well-known as a commentator on television and on social media.  He discusses what went wrong between Trump and "his generals", the current level of dysfunction within the U.S. national security establishment, its impact on our allies, our security and morale in the military.  He also speculates as to whether or not, it may actually be helpful for the U.S. to have a president like Donald Trump every so often--in much the same way that a heart-attack may help a smoker give up cigarettes.

      <title>"A Cloud Hanging Over Our Country": 1 on 1 with Gen. James Clapper</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe56</link>
      <description>The latest edition of Deep State Radio's National Security Magazine offers up an in-depth interview with one of the most distinguished leaders the U.S. intelligence community has produced, General James Clapper.  Culminating his 54 year career in the military and intelligence communities with a six and a half year term as Director of National Intelligence, Clapper considers the current state of the relations between the intelligence community and the president as well as profound consequences of Russia's massive on-going efforts to interfere in America's democratic processes.  Clapper, author this year of Facts and Fears: Hard Truths from a Life in Intelligence, also discusses the efforts to brief Trump on Russia, the Mike Flynn case, the decision to pull out of Syria and other concessions to Vladimir Putin from Team Trump.  Tune in.  It's an engrossing and important discussion.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>Santa is not the only one who knows whether you have been naughty or nice.  The rest of the Deep State knows too.  And by the rest of the Deep State, we mean...yes, Santa is one of us.  Of course.  On this episode, using our intelligence assets on the North Pole and elsewhere we pluck some thorns from the Crown of Entropy and distribute them to the people, ideas and events of 2018 that most deserve them.  Join Kori Schake of IISS, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School, David Sanger of the New York Times and Ed Luce of the Financial Times for this year-end round-up unlike any other.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe58</link>
      <description>What does Trump, podcasts and Patti Lupone have in common: Jon Cryer. On Washington for Beautiful People Jon and Emily discuss Trump, twitter trolls, podcasting and (wait for it) Patti Lupone. While most people know Jon Cryer as Duckie from "Pretty in Pink" or Alan Harper from "Two and a Half Men" Cryer has always had an interest in our political system and criminal justice.  Since 2016, Cryer has used his voice to amplify important issues including criminal justice reform.  It was that interest that led him to host the popular podcast Addendum. And most importantly, Jon regales Emily with stories from musical theater and the one the only Patti Lupone.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>Is a Chasm Opening Up with the Gulf? (Obama Nostalgia May Soon Occur in the Unlikeliest of Places)</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe59</link>
      <description>The U.S. Senate, not recently known for its courage or willingness to stand up to President Donald Trump, sent the entire Trump Administration an acid rebuke on Thursday when it voted to stop funding for U.S. support of the War in Yemen and passed a resolution declaring that Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  At the same time, reports appeared that suggested it the Mueller probe will soon dig deeper into Gulf efforts to manipulate the Trump administration.  For Gulf allies who rejoiced when Barack Obama left office thinking that was a low point in the relationship, what's ahead will likely be much, much worse.  David Sanger of the New York Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund discuss with host David Rothkopf.

      <title>The Most Dangerous Moment in Half a Century: A Conversation with David Sanger</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe5a</link>
      <description>David Sanger of the New York Times discusses how the Trump Administration's decision to pull out of the INF Treaty because of Russian non-compliance may be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the unwinding of the foundational nuclear agreements of the past several decades.  He describes why the INF was widely regarded as a successful agreement and why the rise of new powers may make it hard to put back together again.  And then he discusses how its undoing might also lead to the end of the key ICBM-related treaty our countries have.  And for good measure we chat about the latest in Trump-Russia and the oddity of a president who can't seem to get anyone to accept what is often considered the second most powerful job in Washington.

      <title>She's Fierce, She's Funny and She Put Words in Obama's Mouth: A Conversation with Nell Scovell</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe5c</link>
      <description>When TV Writer Nell Scovell wrote her now famous tell all expose in Vanity Fair about the behind the scenes exploits at Late Night with David Letterman, some thought it would ruin her career. But, the essay--a critical moment on the path to our "Me Too" era-- didn't end her career, she thrived.  Nell went on to write jokes for President Obama at the White House Correspondence Dinner, for some of television's top comedies and she was the co-author of "Leaning In" with Sheryl Sandberg. On this episode of "Washington for Beautiful People," Nell and I chat about the WHCD, Michelle Wolff, Bernie Bros and Bernie's wrinkled suits, MeToo, toupees and dream 2020 candidates.

      <title>What Does the Life of George H.W. Bush Tell Us About Our Current Moment?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe5d</link>
      <description>We can debate the policy and personal successes and failures of George H.W. Bush but there is no question that his example stands in stark contrast to that of America's current president and many in the generation of political leaders around him.  The question is: Was Bush the last of a breed?  Did something change a quarter century ago when he left the presidency?  Did it change even earlier?  And are those changes--many that have produced today's disfunction--permanent or can our system reverse them?  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, attorney and former prosecutor Katie Phang and former CIA operative Emily Brandwin discuss.  Join us.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <itunes:summary>We can debate the policy and personal successes and failures of George H.W. Bush but there is no question that his example stands in stark contrast to that of America's current president and many in the generation of political leaders around him.  The question is: Was Bush the last of a breed?  Did something change a quarter century ago when he left the presidency?  Did it change even earlier?  And are those changes--many that have produced today's disfunction--permanent or can our system reverse them?  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, attorney and former prosecutor Katie Phang and former CIA operative Emily Brandwin discuss.

      <title>U.S. Foreign Policy in the Post Trump Era: A Conversation with Jake Sullivan</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe5e</link>
      <description>Relax.  Keep your champagne on ice.  Donald Trump is still president of the United States.  And his foreign policy--which is a crudely mixed cocktail of racism and greed with a twist of incompetence--is still what America is serving up to the world.  But that won't always be the case.  In fact a New Democratic House of Representatives may start changing some of it pretty soon.  Which begs the question, where do we go from here?  What about the tariffs and the transactionalism and the attacks on international institutions and the distrust of our allies and alliances is going to outlast Trump and what will change the day he leave the White House?  We discuss in a great and wide-ranging conversation with one of the Democratic Party's foremost foreign policy thought-leaders, former National Security Advisor to V.P. Joe Biden and chief advisor to the Hillary Clinton Campaign, Jake Sullivan.  You won't want to miss it.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe5f</link>
      <description>Tony liked ducks.  He was introspective enough to enter therapy.  He loved his family.  He had a code of ethics.  He even drank every so often.  He had a soul.  He was likable.  In short, he was everything our president is not.  But would you really prefer him as president to the current Gangster-in-Chief who tampers with witnesses in the open, praises the guts of lying co-conspirators and, well, has his own considerable history with the mob?  Edward Luce of the FT, attorney Katie Phang and host of Deep State Radio's "Washington for Beautiful People" Emily Brandwin discuss.  (And spoiler alert: They all prefer Tony.)

      <title>Special Exclusive: The Word is 'Betrayal': A Conversation with Rep. Eric Swalwell</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe61</link>
      <description>Responding to the reports of Michael Cohen's Trump Tower Moscow lies and guilty plea, the rising star Congressman from California, Rep. Eric Swalwell, reveals where the new Congress is likely to take investigations into Trump's business ties and their consequences when it assumes office in January.  He asserts the Congress will examine Trump Organization money laundering that his colleagues have reason to believe took place and that Mueller may not be exploring as closely.  He says instances of suspected lying to the Congress suppressed by Rep. Devin Nunes will be immediately forwarded to Mueller.  He suggests the president and his family's financial ties to Saudi Arabia are comparable to those with Russia and will get similar investigative treatment.  He does not hesitate to say collusion took place.  And he says he believes the word that best describes the president's actions is "betrayal"--selling out the American people to serve his own financial and political interests.  It is a news-making interview you won't want to miss--available exclusively on Deep State Radio.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe63</link>
      <description>When Donald Trump was presented with the overwhelming evidence of Russian interference in the US elections (of which he was Exhibit A) he said, "I don't believe it."  When presented with proof of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's role in ordering the murder of Jamal Khashoggi he said, "I don't believe it."  When presented with his own government's assessment of the catastrophic costs of climate change he said, you guessed it, "I don't believe it."  Who needs rose-colored glasses when you have your head that far up your own narcissism?  Is this a canny strategy or is Trump our Maroon-in-Chief?  Kori Schake offers Henry the IVth, Part 1 as one of her Tiara-of-Optimism worthy examples.  Mieke Eoyang and Emily Brandwin are not quite so sanguine but all discuss this phenomenon as well as Russia &amp; Ukraine, Brexit, our self-inflicted border crisis and more!

      <title>What's Next for the Axis of Assholes?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe64</link>
      <description>Trump has forged an indelible bond not with our allies nor with the American people (a majority of whom can't stand him) but with a group of really bad men worldwide who are not just evil, they're creeps.  Vlad.  Bibi.  Duterte.  And of course, now topping that list Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.  Trump's defense of MBS and his indefensible crimes--from murder to torture--and his and MBS's strategy has counted on the rest of the world not caring for long about those crimes.  But in Europe, governments are standing up to the Saudis and against the US position.  And soon this going gap, between most of the nations of the west and Trump and his Axis of Assholes, may be on display at the upcoming G20 meeting.  Kori Schake, Mieke Eoyang, Rula Jebreal and Emily Brandwin discuss what to expect from Trump, MBS and their not-so-nice friends.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>A Deep State Thanksgiving, Part Deux: Who and What We are Thankful For</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe65</link>
      <description>It's Thanksgiving weekend in the USA.  It's a warm, friendly, family holiday provided that a.) your family does not discuss politics, b.) your unhinged uncle does not drink too much and c.) the indoor deep-fryer does not burn the whole house down.  Maybe you'll go to a class reunion.  Those are always...terrible.  Or, alternatively, maybe you'll do what you did on prom night...stay home alone.  Except this time you'll have Rosa Brooks, Emily Brandwin and Maggie Feldman-Piltch to join you and they'll be talking about what's right with the world and what they're thankful for.  They will, that is, just as soon as they get their own awful high school experiences off their chests.  Join us!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>Who Will Be Prosecuted for the War Crimes in Yemen?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe67</link>
      <description>Yemen has become a humanitarian catastrophe on a scale of few others in the recent history of the planet.  14 million people live on the verge of famine.  Tens of thousands are dead.  And despite gestures in the direction of bringing the conflict to a close precious little progress has been made.  Who is culpable?  What is America's role?  Obama's during the early stages of the conflict?  Trump's now?  Our panel including former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Dafna Rand, Yahoo DC Bureau Chief Sharon Weinberger and Georgetown University Law School's Rosa Brooks discuss and consider what may happen next for the suffering people of Yemen.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe68</link>
      <description>Trump's Europe trip was a rare multi-tiered fiasco, a kind of mille feuille of fiascos, at which the disasters operated on many levels--his alienation of our allies, his insults to our troops, his vanity, his cozying up to villains, his fear of getting wet, his complete lack of understanding of how the world works.  In fact, it may be the worst overseas trip by any president ever...since Trump's Helsinki Summit.  Meanwhile, North Korea seems to be building more missile bases and everything else on the planet is worse off than it was two years ago.  So...that's bad.

      <title>Special Emergency Episode: From Sessions to Whitaker, How Low Can Trump Go?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe69</link>
      <description>There are constitutional reasons why Mathew Whitaker should not succeed Jeff Sessions as even the Acting Attorney General of the US.  There are legal reasons.  There are ethical reasons.  But none of these stopped Donald Trump from beginning the latest chapter in his effort to obstruct justice and contain the threats he feel Robert Mueller's investigation poses for him.  On this special episode Florida-based attorney and former prosecutor Katie Phang and Georgetown Law's Rosa Brooks join us to discuss this disturbing and dangerous if not quite shocking turn of events.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

On this special episode Florida-based attorney and former prosecutor Katie Phang and Georgetown Law's Rosa Brooks join us to discuss this disturbing and dangerous if not quite shocking turn of events.<p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.<br></p><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Could It Be the Election's Two Biggest Losers were Donald Trump and...Robert Mueller?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe6b</link>
      <description>Donald Trump said the mid-terms were a huge success (they weren't), that he did better than other presidents during their first mid-term elections (he didn't), that he had the touch of gold and only those who ran away from him suffered (not true).  On the other hand, he still has a job today and Jeff Sessions doesn't.  That's right, within hours of the election results coming in, the president flipped the script and started to put the squeeze on the Mueller investigation.  What does that mean for the immediate future, the rule of law in America, our general level of nausea and anxiety.  David Sanger of the NY Times, Mike Tomasky of the Daily Beast and Laura Rosenberger, former top campaign aide to Hillary Clinton join us to discuss.

      <description>The Kashoggi murder has rocked the Middle East.  The underlying crime was so horrific, its cover-up has been so pathetic and unpersuasive, and the position of the US administration has only compounded the outrage.  The question is: Will this change anything?  Our guests Stephen Walt, Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and Ed Luce discuss and then move on to considering what the deeper significance of the Trump Administration's decision to pull out of the INF Treaty with Russia might mean for the US, for Russia, for arms manufacturers, for China and for all the rest of us.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe70</link>
      <description>Harvard's Stephen Walt has written a timely book called "The Hell of Good Intentions: America's Foreign Policy Elite and the Decline of U.S. Primacy"...which is just exactly the kind of subject you would expect Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, and Ed Luce to want to discuss with Steve Walt given the hell of current events and the number of members of the U.S. foreign policy elite they know who are also declining.  Join us for a fascinating discussion about where America went wrong and what, if anything, we can do about it.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay, two of America's leading foreign policy experts have written an in-depth analysis of Donald Trump's tenure to date as president.  It is a withering critique, but more importantly it assesses not just how Trump's policy are a departure from three-quarters of a century of U.S. foreign policy ideas and ideals but what the consequences of the Trump presidency may be.

      <title>What Foreign Policy Shifts May Follow a Dem Victory in November?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe72</link>
      <description>While the Trump Administration may get much Trumpier with the personnel changes expected after Election Day, a Democratic victory on November 6th that brought them control of the House of Representatives is likely to create a check on Trump's impulses of a sort he has never had to deal with.  From Russia to the Middle East, the Democrats will be pushing for very different policies and countries that have cozied up to the president perhaps should expect a backlash...one that could get worse in 2020.  Also: A discussion of the influence of foreign money in the Washington Policy community.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe76</link>
      <description>Most of Deep State Radio’s cutting edge, youthful listeners are probably too young to remember the song the title references (“Mrs. Brown You Had a Lovely Daughter” by Herman’s Hermits).  But so were all of us at Deep State Radio.  We’re just very well educated.  No, seriously.  Except David. Who actually remembers it.  Poor old guy.  Anyway…the title refers to Donald Trump’s New-Improved-Yuge-Better-Than-Ever NAFTA which he has rebranded the USMCA (pronounced Us-Muck-Uh.)  But what it really is the old NAFTA with a new paint job.  Still, it’s better than a sharp stick in the eye (or the collapse of the old NAFTA). The only question is what does it mean for the future of US trade policy—especially with China and the EU.  Our panelists including the Financial Times’ Ed Luce, IISS’ Kori Schake, Georgetown University’s Rosa Brooks and the Atlantic Council’s Evelyn Farkas discuss.

      <description>The political furor around the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court may seem like pure domestic US politics, but the implications for America’s role in the world are serious.  Not only does the chaos in the US symptom send a disconcerting message to those who once emulated us and an inviting one to our enemies, but the politics behind the nomination hint at bigger issues to come.  America is growing more divided between less populated, less diverse “red” states that are disproportionately empowered by the US Constitution and the more diverse, less xenophobic, more urban “blue” states.  According to Rosa Brooks of our panel, the last time our structural imbalances were this great we had a civil war.  Are we on the precipice of greater unrest?  Rosa is joined by Kori Schake of IISS and Evelyn Farkas of the Atlantic Council for a discussion on this, America’s soft power of attraction…and the sweet and surprising attraction between Donald Trump and, his new love, Kim Jong-Un.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe79</link>
      <description>There are assholes everywhere you look these days, especially in positions of power.  The result is high assholery in our policies and our political debates which, frankly, is not only not good for us but it’s kind of hard to take.  When do we finally call an asshole an asshole and make sure the arc of history bends away from them.  Far away. On this episode of Deep State Radio Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University and David Rothkopf of an undisclosed location join in and look for answers…or just a tiny hint of sanity.

      <title>The Thing Most Foreign to US Foreign Policy is Anything Resembling a Policy</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe7b</link>
      <description>With a couple of recent good articles in The Atlantic, leading thinkers like Peter Beinart and Thomas Wright have begun to ask the critical question: "What's next for US foreign policy?"  Our experts Ed Luce of the Financial Times, David Sanger of the New York Times and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University go a step further and start with why we haven't really be able to zero in on a consensus on such policy since the end of the Cold War and then seek to frame some of the big questions we need to be asking in light of the big changes taking place all around us.  It's an important discussion.  Join us.  Also: Update on North Korea.  Why can't you get a good bagel in Washington?  And...the launch of the Deep State Radio Network website!!!!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>It's that time of day.  The sun is setting.  You're a little parched.  Maybe more than a little due to the fireball on the horizon.  What's just the right cocktail for the moment?  On this episode of Deep State Radio we speak with nuclear weapons specialist and amateur bartender Jeffrey Lewis about his new book "The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks on the United States."  We discuss the current state of affairs with North Korea (good for Kim, bad for Trump...oh, and all the rest of us too) and where it may lead.  And of course, just what is the right thing to drink when you're offering up your very last toast of the day.  Of any day.  Tune in!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>The release of Bob Woodward's book "Fear" and the recent anonymous oped in the New York Times claiming to be by a senior official who is mounting the resistance to Trump from within the administration raise important questions about what is the best way to stop the threat posed by an unfit president.  Our panel, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Mieke Eoyang of Third Way and Kori Schake of IISS offer an examination of what's right, what works and whether the two are in any way related.

      <title>Is That Thing Under John Bolton's Nose a Bugbear?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe7e</link>
      <description>Brick by brick the Trump team is not building a wall, it's dismantling the international order.  The latest move--an attack on the International Criminal Court by National Security Advisor John Bolton.  Should you care?  Isn't this just an inside baseball attack on some other acronym that probably doesn't work that well to begin with?  Or is it a signal of something more, something bigger, maybe even a watershed in international history?  To answer the question we hear from IISS's Kori Schake, Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks and Third Way's Mieke Eoyang.  Tune in for all that...and much more about Israel, Afghanistan, America, and bugbears.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>Every report out of the Trump White House tells the same story.  Whether it's the anonymous op-ed from a "senior Trump Administration official" in the New York Times or Bob Woodward's book "Fear" or the Omarosa book or the Wolff book or countless news reports--the president's unhinged, the people around him don't trust him, and some of them have decided to just by-pass the president and govern on their own, elections be damned.  Trump blames the Deep State.  But we know better!  On this emergency episode Rosa "Anonymous" Brooks, David "Anonymous" Sanger and Ed "Anonymous" Luce join us for the kind of fresh, terrifying analysis you can't get anywhere else and shouldn't try at home.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe80</link>
      <description>The White House is a shambles. The president is an object of ridicule among his closest aides. The Congress is looking the other way seeming to want to rush a Supreme Court nominee into office before the President is himself hustled before a judge.  But that's not the worst of it.  Dysfunction in Washington leads to big problems worldwide.  This week, our panel including commentator and analyst Rula Jebreal, Georgetown Law School's Rosa Brooks and the Financial Times' Ed Luce consider the latest in DC and one of the places where Trump policies are making a bad situation much much worse--the Middle East.

      <title>Crazytown: From a Nation of Laws to One of Pathologies</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe81</link>
      <description>In a brilliant bit of turnabout, John McCain's last act was to use his own funeral to bury Donald Trump.  By excluding him from the ceremonies and featuring leaders of both parties extolling values and virtues alien to Trump, McCain made an eloquent point. But will it have any lasting impact? Within just a couple of days the President was back Tweeting, his Supreme Court nominee was being rammed into office and a new book by Bob Woodward was dominating the headlines with new revelations of the president's unfitness to serve.  Join our panelists David Frum of the Atlantic, author of Trumpocracy, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University School of Law and Ed Luce of the Financial Times as they discuss a tumultuous few days in the nation's capital.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe82</link>
      <description>Donald Trump's track record as an international deal-maker is perfect.  He still has not made one major deal of any sort anywhere with anyone (except maybe with a nice gentleman in Moscow, but we'll leave that be for now.). He has undone a bunch of deals--from the Paris Accord to TPP to the Iran nuclear deal.  He has announced some deals that weren't really deals--from the "breakthrough" with North Korea to the "breakthrough with Europe" on trade to the "breakthrough" with Mexico on trade.  And he has also promised some deals that never materialized--from getting Mexico to build the wall to a Middle East peace agreement.  On this episode of Deep State Radio join David Sanger of the New York Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and Evelyn Farkas of the Atlantic Council as they discuss why Donald Trump may be the worst dealmaker in modern American presidential history.

      <title>Trump Message to NFL Players He Says are Disrespecting the Flag, “Hold My Beer.”</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe83</link>
      <description>Donald Trump has wrapped himself so tightly in the flag he could be America’s first July 4th mummy but while his true colors may be red white and blue it increasingly appears they may look more like the Russian flag than Old Glory.  First, he showed this when at a school appearance he was unable to color in a flag properly.  Next, despite all his attack on NFL-ers for disrespecting the flag, he broke the law to keep the flag over the White House flying at full-staff despite the death of beloved hero Senator John McCain.  Our experts David Sanger of the New York Times, Evelyn Farkas of the Atlantic Council and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University discuss McCain, Trump, patriotism, hypocrisy and coloring inside the lines.

        <![CDATA[Donald Trump has wrapped himself so tightly in the flag he could be America’s first July 4th mummy but while his true colors may be red white and blue it increasingly appears they may look more like the Russian flag than Old Glory.  First, he showed this when at a school appearance he was unable to color in a flag properly.  Next, despite all his attack on NFL-ers for disrespecting the flag, he broke the law to keep the flag over the White House flying at full-staff despite the death of beloved hero Senator John McCain.  Our experts David Sanger of the New York Times, Evelyn Farkas of the Atlantic Council and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University discuss McCain, Trump, patriotism, hypocrisy and coloring inside the lines.

      <title>Our Biggest Intelligence Problem is the President's Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe84</link>
      <description>While the intelligence and law enforcement communities reel from the president's attacks, Donald Trump has sent further signals that he expects personal loyalty above loyalty to the nation from all of his team across the whole of government.  He has even go so far as to trash the once hallowed concept of independence of the Fed. But it may be that the biggest problem affecting the government is not the president's impulse to suppress dissenting views but rather is his lack of intellectual curiosity and his professed skepticism of expertise.  It's not that he wants political loyal intelligence analysts, for example, it is that he wouldn't read what they wrote no matter what their political views were.  On this episode, veteran CIA analyst Nada Bakos, Georgetown's Rosa Brooks and the Financial Times Ed Luce, discuss--and Rosa follow's in the footsteps of a giant pre-historic chicken!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>Special Episode: Trumpocalypse Now</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe85</link>
      <description>This week in important Steven Tyler news, the Aerosmith front man demanded that Donald Trump stop playing his band's song "Livin' on the Edge" at their rallies.  And he makes a good point.  Trump is past that point and may want to consider more appropriate alternatives for upcoming rallies, like "I Fought the Law (And the Law Won)" or "Jailhouse Rock."  Certainly, that seemed to be the message prosecutors and jurors were sending this week as the Trump re-elect effort lost the votes of both Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen who will now, as convicted felons, never be able to vote in a federal election again.  What does this mean?  Where will it lead?  Is this the beginning of the end?  The end of the beginning?  What can we expect?  Our experts David Sanger of the New York Times, Katie Phang, an attorney and a legal analyst for NBC and MSNBC and Sharon Weinberger, DC Bureau Chief for Yahoo News answer these questions and more in this special limited collector's edition of Deep State Radio in which we also ask: Is Australia the only country in the world whose politics are more screwed up than America's?

      <title>It Was a Big Week for Authoritarianism in America</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe86</link>
      <description>As reports have come in of Russia escalating its attacks on American democracy, our President has hopped into action escalating his war against the people who are protecting us from the Russians.  Trump has begun a campaign of stripping security clearances from America's most experience national security officials in an effort to punish them for disloyalty.  Our experts, Susan Hennessey of Lawfare, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and Ed Luce of the Financial Times, discuss which of the effects of this misguided policy will be worse--chilling free expression, alienating the security community, reducing the expertise available to the government or just ushering in more authoritarianism.  But don't worry.  You don't have to choose.  All will be bad.  Also: we discuss the president's lawyers and why they may mean he needs more lawyers.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

It was, as might be expected, yuge.  Once again we will outspend China by four or five times and Russia by perhaps a dozen times.  Are we safer?  Does it matter that if we spend that much we can't have the schools, roads and health care system we need?

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe8c</link>
      <description>In the latest Deep State Radio our friends Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Kori Schake of IISS and Evelyn Farkas of the Atlantic Council offer secrets into how they remain so well-informed.  It all turns on fiction, apparently and those who remember what they read last will tell you what it was.  Then we turn to Trump, Italy's new prime minister, a whole slew of lies and misstatements from Trump and the gripping prospect of a US-Italy strategic alliance which should come in handy should elephants ever start coming over the Alps again.  Oh, and the decline of the West, again.  But from a new perspective.  What a great accompaniment for a summer barbecue.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>If only someone had told us that Trump has distrusted alliances and the international order his whole life, that he was close to Russia and Russians, that he was unhinged and wholly unqualified for the presidency!  If only we had known!  Maybe then we would not be inviting Vladimir Putin to come to the White House to give him a hero's welcome commemorating his successful 2016 election hack...just in time for the 2018 elections which all signs suggest he will try to hack again.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe8e</link>
      <description>A lonely old man wandering the White House late at night in his bathrobe, perhaps with a half-eaten McDonald's cheeseburger in his pocket gets angry at the world...so angry that he hits the ALL CAPS button on his cellphone and starts to Tweet out threats at a foreign nation.  "ALL CAPS?," says his target, "this means WAR!"  That's very nearly where we were this week when Donald Trump lashed out at Iran.  Was a clever distraction?  A mental misfire?  We may never know, but we know this: as long as the president can Tweet, none of us are really safe.  Our great panel including Loren DeJonge Schulman of of the Bombshell podcast, Kori Schake of IISS and Ed Luce of the Financial Times discuss this, playing politics with security clearances and the rest of the week's latest developments.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe8f</link>
      <description>As Richard Nixon might have said, "What are we going to do when we don't have Western Civilization to kick around any more?"  Things happen fast in this bad old world and a few years is a enough time for the wheels to come flying off the damn cart.  And if you don't get our point, that may have been a wheel that went flying by on Monday in Helsinki.  Our panel of IISS' Kori Schake, Georgetown Law School's Rosa Brooks, the Financial Times' Ed Luce and New Jersey's own David Rothkopf, contemplate where we go from here and why recent experiences with bedtime stories are not altogether comforting.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe90</link>
      <description>Donald Trump completed the most unsuccessful foreign trip of any president since Theodore Roosevelt, who took the first foreign trip, with a disastrous summit for the ages.  Critics on the right and left called it an embarrassment, a disaster, or worse.  And honestly, it was all that and more.  A turning point in the history of US foreign policy perhaps.  Our experts, Georgetown's Rosa Brooks, IISS' Kori Schake, the New York Times' David Sanger, and the Financial Times' Ed Luce, discuss...lament, wail, and generally gnash their teeth...but in constructive way.

Critics on the right and left called it an embarrassment, a disaster, or worse.  And honestly, it was all that and more.  A turning point in the history of US foreign policy perhaps.  Our experts, Georgetown's Rosa Brooks, IISS' Kori Schake, the New York Times' David Sanger, and the Financial Times' Ed Luce, discuss...lament, wail, and generally gnash their teeth...but in constructive way.

      <description>If, as Sarah Huckabee Sanders alleged, it was a lousy breakfast that had White House Chief of Staff squirm while President Donald Trump kicked off the NATO Summit with an attack on Germany, then someone needs to get a Denny's Grand Slam to Rosa Brooks, Julie Smith and Ed Luce pronto.  Because as our great panel looked back on Trump's NATO performance, they certainly did more than just shift uneasily in their chairs and purse their lips.  Join them for a discussion of what has already been one of Vladimir Putin's best weeks ever...and where things are as we prepare for the Helsinki love fest that will kick off the week ahead!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>With America's foreign policy savant, our president leaving the country this week it's easy to understand the fireworks and celebrations last week.  Now we get to share him with the rest of the world--including our NATO allies, the keepers of our special relationship with England, the patrons of a Trump resort in Scotland (ancestral home of his immigrant mother) and then with the main man in his life, Vladimir Putin.  Like US and UK politics at the moment, we can expect it all to be in the language of our own Ed Luce, shambolic, but who knows?  It may even be worse than that!  Ed, Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and host David Rothkopf discuss all that...while educating Ed about Moose and Squirrel.  Tune in!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>The GOP could win in November and maintain its hold on both houses of Congress.  Which Donald Trump would find encouraging.  And might lead him to be even more like...himself.  And that might lead his base to re-elect him.  And we could have six and a half more years of Trump.  So...what would that look like?  Is there enough box wine in the world to help you get through this?  Who knows?  It can be an experiment.  Join host David Rothkopf, Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and Joe Cirincione for an episode that is scary as shit.  Fun!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>Why is Big Brother Smiling?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe95</link>
      <description>At the end of the Cold War, the West triumphantly crowed that it was our open societies and the information revolution that ultimately defeated the USSR.  They lost because people deprived of information simply couldn't compete.  Now however, as we enter another stage of the information revolution, it may be that we celebrated yet another premature "mission accomplished" moment.  It is now possible that in the information-addicted world of today in which everyone is tethered to the Internet, the big winner may be Big Brother.  State dominated information systems may be entering their prime and freedom and privacy may be the victims.  David Sanger, author of the new book "The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage and Fear in the Cyber Age", Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Kori Schake of IISS and host, David Rothkopf join the discussion...which also explore recent spasms of ugly authoritarianism in the U.S.  Tune in.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>On this special episode of Deep State Radio we get a sneak peak at the latest work of our own David Sanger (who we share with the New York Times and his students at Harvard's Kennedy School).

Join David, Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks and IISS' Kori Schake for a discussion of one of the transformational issues of our time...and why the US is not prepared for the next big attack on our electoral system.<p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.<br></p><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>If It's Not Treason Then What Is It?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe97</link>
      <description>As Deep State Radio's resident Constitutional scholar (and Associate Dean of Georgetown Law School) Rosa Brooks explains, the legal threshold for designating behavior as treasonous is quite narrow.  But as she also points out, it would be up to Congress to define what was unacceptable in an impeachment hearing.  As evidence mounts that the Trump campaign was deeply entwined with Russia and the Trump Administration has been taking a straight Kremlin line on everything, we have clearly crossed the "this is not OK" threshold and we may be headed for something much more serious than that.  Rosa, Kori Schake, Evelyn Farkas and David Rothkopf discuss this issue and the state of America's alliances with a NATO Summit and a potential meeting in Europe with Vladimir Putin loom in the next several weeks.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe98</link>
      <description>Deep State Radio's own Kori Schake wrote an important piece about the current threat to the international order posed by the Trump Administration.  In this episode we discuss the article and just exactly how grievous the threat is and how we ought to characterize it.  This takes us from John Locke to John Winthrop to Stephen Miller...(and we hope that's the last time you ever see those three names in a sentence together.)  Join Kori, Rosa Brooks, Evelyn Farkas and David Rothkopf for the discussion.  But bring an adult beverage.

      <title>Is America No Longer the Good Guy?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe9a</link>
      <description>The U.S. has done plenty wrong in its history.  There are millions around the world that have been victims of flaws in U.S. foreign policy.  But since the early part of the 20th Century there has at least been a myth that Americans could cling to that we stood for what was right, for "the American way" and tried to shape the international system around those values.  Now, in a week, the U.S. has attacked its allies and friends and embraced one of the world's most brutal dictators.  Our president seems to be an amoral and corrupt man.  And the result may translate into the undoing both of our standing and the international order that has helped uphold it.  Our panelists Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Mieke Eoyang of the Third Way and Ed Luce of the Financial Times discuss how the tectonic events of the G7 and Singapore summits may impact how America is perceived...and how the world works...for many years to come.

      <title>An Idiot, A Russian Spy and a Racist Walk Into a Bar...</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe9b</link>
      <description>The recent round of primary elections in the US don't seem to show a groundswell of public indignation over the fact that the president of the United States has obstructed justice, is a pathological liar, is profoundly corrupt and is, at the very least, surrounded by people and family members who may well have conspired with the Russians to tip the scales in the last election.  So, that's a bummer.  But if that weren't enough, the president is now playing the North Korea nuclear summit not for its arms control or geopolitical value but as a card in helping to stave off a Democratic victory in November.  That's important to know, observe our experts, because...well, it means all the traditional foreign policy analysis you may hear will be completely irrelevant.  Sam Vinograd, Asha Rangappa, Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and David Sanger join to discuss this, Dennis Rodman, Seb Gorka and why Rudy Giuliani is driving Asha to drink and may offer Trump an inadequate counsel defense in the long run.

      <title>Episode 100!!!: Welcome to the Pax Trumpiana--How's That Working for You?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe9c</link>
      <description>On this, the historic, 100th episode of Deep State Radio (once called by Bridget Jones "the world's most important podcast") our usual band of troublemakers discuss just how much worse off the world is 100 podcasts later than it was we started.  Could it all have to do with the man one NPR commentator referred to as "an escaped monkey from a cocaine study?"  Which English monarch is most reminiscent of that monkey?  (Ethelred the Cokehead?) And what can we expect 100 episodes from now?  (The end of the euro? War with Iran? A Trump casino in Pyongyang?  President Nancy Pelosi?)  We not only answer all your questions but we announce a whole lot of ways we intend to show our love for Deep State Radio nerd nation...because we can't think of any other group of folks we'd rather spend the End Days with!

        <![CDATA[On this, the historic, 100th episode of Deep State Radio (once called by Bridget Jones "the world's most important podcast") our usual band of troublemakers discuss just how much worse off the world is 100 podcasts later than it was we started.  Could it all have to do with the man one NPR commentator referred to as "an escaped monkey from a cocaine study?"  Which English monarch is most reminiscent of that monkey?  (Ethelred the Cokehead?) And what can we expect 100 episodes from now?  (The end of the euro? War with Iran? A Trump casino in Pyongyang?  President Nancy Pelosi?)  We not only answer all your questions but we announce a whole lot of ways we intend to show our love for Deep State Radio nerd nation...because we can't think of any other group of folks we'd rather spend the End Days with!

      <description>Yes, this episode is about the rise of China and America's woeful unpreparedness for this epoch making event.

      <description>Their courtship will go down in history with those of Romeo &amp; Juliet, Tristan &amp; Isolde, and Goldman and Sachs.  Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un have had their spats to be sure...but what's a little pre-nuclear foreplay between true loves.  Now, all that is behind them it seems and we are heading for the steamy consummation of their relationship somewhere in Singapore...possibly, fittingly, in a a Sheldon Adelson-owned hotel room.  If only Shakespeare were alive today to offer up a sonnet, something to honor both of them.  Maybe something like Sonnet 29.  You know the one: "When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes..."  But don't despair.  Who needs Shakespeare when you have Ed Luce, Rosa Brooks and Anna Fifield of the Washington Post.  Tune in!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>Why is a Hippo the Emotional Support Animal We All Need</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfe9f</link>
      <description>The president's wife carries industrial strength disinfecting wipes wherever she goes because her man is a germaphobe.  But when it comes to the growing ebola outbreak in Africa, he seems anything but prepared.  (Pro tip for POTUS: The wipes won't help.). In fact, when it comes to the big crises that might come from left field--epidemics, climate crises, cyber attacks, and the like, Trump's America is even more unprepared than we usually are.  Which is why Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, Bonnie Jenkins and David Rothkopf end up discussing why it may be that in this day in age, we need bigger, better emotional support animals.  Like hippos.  Or maybe a dinosaur would be good.  And our silo accepts service animals.  So...come on down.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfea0</link>
      <description>One thing about the tough guys in the Trump Administration, when it comes to foreign policy they sure do have colorful fantasies.  Mike Pompeo's wish list for Iran is as far fetched as a fairy-tale but less likely to come to life.  In North Korea, the president's hopes and dreams are just as impossible.  But some of his advisors have imaginations that run to the dark side and are served by the president having wishes that will go unfulfilled.  Which is why these fantasies might have an unhappy ending.  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of IISS, and Bonnie Jenkins of WCAPS and Brookings join host David Rothkopf for a walk through the wonderland of Trump foreign policy.

The president of the US is a pig.  He is being played big time by a tubby millennial dictator who really may be the master of the art of the deal.  The U.S. Constitution ain't what it's cracked up to be.  And the NRA aren't just a murder lobby, they may be traitors too.  Hope you're having a nice Spring everybody!

      <title>Donald Trump Doubles Down on Foreign Policy: What Could Go Wrong?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfea2</link>
      <description>With boatloads of trouble at home and a Congress unlikely to actually do anything between now and the election, Donald Trump needs to come up with some way to distract from the Mueller investigation and his deepening legal woes.  Live Tweeting Fox &amp; Friends is obviously not doing the trick nor is The Rudy Show.  So why not blow up the Iran deal, open an embassy in Jerusalem and negotiate a nuclear deal with a guy who blew up his uncle with an anti-aircraft gun as an alternative?  What could go wrong--after all Javanka can handle Israel and John Bolton and Mike Pompeo can do the rest?  Our panel of David Sanger, Daniel Benjamin and Rosa Brooks discuss...and then head for the silos to wait it out until Trump decides to go back to beauty contests or something safer.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

Our panel of David Sanger, Daniel Benjamin and Rosa Brooks discuss...and then head for the silos to wait it out until Trump decides to go back to beauty contests or something safer.<p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.<br></p><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>True Dat: In the Post-Truth World of Trump the Best Liar Seems Like the Most Honest Man</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfea3</link>
      <description>The president lies.  He lies all the time.  He can't help but lie.  That's why his lawyers consider any move by Robert Mueller to be a perjury trap for Trump.  Because any question Mueller and his team will ask is certain to produce over-heated prevarication, deception, and deception presented on a bed of utter bullshit.  What does this mean for America?  For our democracy?  For our standing in the world?  Kori Schake, Rosa Brooks, Ed Luce and host David Rothkopf try to answer that question.  Through their tears.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfea4</link>
      <description>It's a mad whirl these days with more mad than whirl going on.  This week alone offers everything from the Iran deal (the one new NRA president Ollie North did back in the day) to the Iran deal (the one Donald Trump hates).  It offers a debate about the use of torture (re: the Gina Haspel confirmation hearings) as well as a debate about the use of torture (having to watch Rudy Giuliani on television 24-7 as he dissolves into a mental pudding.)  Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, Mieke Eoyang and Ed Luce discuss and offer lots of insights.  (Including, of course, Ed offering up the correct pronunciation of the word Lieutenant.  Or so he says.).

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfea5</link>
      <description>How are we supposed to concentrate on nuclear weapons dramas in the Middle East and the Koreas, new U.S. special forces deployments, Bibi Netanyahu doing his best Gallagher prop-comedy impression and all the other lunacy going on in the world with all the even more distracting lunacy going on in Washington?  Can a strong mastery of acronyms help?  Or is beer a better choice?  Ploughshares Fund’s Joe Cirincione, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and David Rothkopf go a little off the rails trying to figure out how to cope.  The best answer they came up with is to look at the whole Trump presidency as a historical belch. (Look away and pretend it didn’t happen.)

      <title>There is a Game of 3D Chess Going On--The Question is Can Any World Leaders Actually Play?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfea6</link>
      <description>Move are afoot--everywhere.  In the Koreas, North and South are posturing pre-negotiations while back in the U.S. the president is writing his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.  In the Middle East, Israel is working with the U.S. (and maybe the Saudis) to try to find a way to torpedo the Iran nuclear deal...and the Europeans are pushing hard in the other direction.  Somewhere between the two U.S. policy masterminds (one with a bushy mustache) are trying to figure out how to blow up one nuclear deal while striking another (so the president can start packing or his trip to Oslo to pick up his hardware).  Who is guiding these processes?  Could it be Sarah Huckabee Sanders through her mascara laden tears?  We discuss on this episode of Deep State Radio with David Sanger of the New York Times, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Kori Schake of IISS and host, David Rothkopf, lost in New Jersey.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

Perhaps new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo can start to make amends on his first trip as America's chief diplomat.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfea8</link>
      <description>With John Bolton loose in the West Wing, what will happen to US foreign policy? Deep State Radio's Rosa Brooks hosts in David Rothkopf's absence, joined by regulars Kori Schake of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and Ed Luce from the Financial Times, with a special guest appearance by Stanford University's Colin Kahl. Colin assures DSR listeners that Bolton's a nixer, not a fixer, and suggests we kiss the Iran nuclear deal goodbye. Ed and Kori wonder if there's any such thing as a Trump Whisperer, and contemplate the likely (non)-impact of French President Macron's visit to Washington. Rosa provides prophecies of doom and suggests that Trump's election was all Ed's fault. In this episode of Deep State Radio, the Ministry of Snark team covers the terrain from Mike Pompeo and Gina Haspel to prospects for progress on North Korea.

      <title>The "Stormy" Kim Illusion</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfea9</link>
      <description>When Donald Trump thinks about Kim Jong Un he sees Stormy Daniels.  At least he sees what he saw that night long ago with Ms. Daniels, which is something that he wanted very very much, that he needed to the exclusion of everything else.  He yearns for what Kim and Kim alone can give him.  And that is a taste of historical redemption, something that might change the narrative that even Trump can see is being written about him being the most corrupt and inept president in American history.  Which could lead to the master of the art of the deal getting taken in a negotiation.  Will it happen?  Will the mustachioed man at the president's side allow it?  We discuss this and the other usual mayhem with Rosa Brooks, Ed Luce and Sam Vinograd on this podisode.  Join us!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>Trump's Got 99 Problems But Too Much Respect for the Law Ain't One of Them...</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeaa</link>
      <description>The Syria strike was likely highly ineffective due to the fact that it was limited in impact, came without a long-term strategy or much likelihood of follow-up actions to end the use of chemical weapons or the wholesale slaughter of Syrians.  But wait, it gets worse: It was also an illegal strike by almost every measure.  But hey, that's not a bug it's a feature of the Trump approach to the presidency and life.  He's one of those people who sees the law as something only little people must deal with.  We discuss what that means for him, U.S. foreign policy, and this teetering presidency with Oona Hathaway of Yale Law School, Susan Hennessey of Lawfare, Kim Ghattas of the Carnegie Endowment and our own Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School.Tune in!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeab</link>
      <description>Every day in Trumpassic Era seems like a million years in geological time.  Sex scandals, echoes of old pee tapes, pending missile strikes in search of a strategy, waves of national security experts leaving the White House, the president calling the former FBI director a “lying slimebag”, the FBI director launching a book that is the most stunning attack by a top former official on a sitting president in memory…and the president, according to his staff, just sitting around fuming, eating and watching TV.  It’s a mad whirl and we’ve got it all right up to, but not including, the Khloe-Tristan cheating scandal.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeac</link>
      <description>John Bolton’s first day as National Security Advisor presents him with the kind of opportunities he has waited his entire life for—a choice between worsening relations and possible military action against Syria, Iran and North Korea.  Where will he succeed in making Trump’s terrible instincts worse?  Or is there a chance he might become in his new role a more responsible voice creating a constructive meaningful process that produces wise policy outcomes.  (Nah.  There isn’t a Tiara of Optimism big or powerful enough to expect that outcome.)  Join us as we discuss with the Angels of Doom—Rosa Brooks and Sam Vinograd, the reigning holder of the Tiara of Optimism, Kori Schake and the wise (and therefore pessimistic) Julie Smith.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>The day after Trump leaves office some things will change immediately (like a terrible management style or diplomacy via Twitter or bad relations with Mexico) and some things will take years to fix (like the institutions we have broken or repairing our standing as a reliable partner.). On this episode of Deep State Radio Kori Schake of the IISS, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kelly Magsamen of the Center for American Progress and host David Rothkopf discuss how America and the world should prepare for a moment that may be approaching faster than we think...but will get here sooner or later inevitably.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeae</link>
      <description>Perhaps its his fear of an impending Oprah candidacy but Donald Trump seems to be embracing her tactic of great generosity to her audience.  In his case, it is of course, the audience of one he covets most...the one in the Kremlin.  And so in this week's episode of Trump's reality television show he has decided--after attacking our neighbors to the South (Mexico), a big American company (Amazon), and the U.S. Department of Justice--to give a big reward to Putin by reportedly inviting him to a White House meeting.  This is the kind of reward presidents reserve only for special friends--and think of what Putin has done to deserve it.  Yes, Just think of it.  That's what our Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and special guest Kelly Magsamen from the Center for American Progress do on this episode of Deep State Radio.

      <description>It looks like the Trump-Kim Summit is a thing.  A real thing.  That’ll likely happen this Spring.  At least, all indicators were pointing in that direction following Kim Jong Un’s stealthy train trip from Pyongyang to Beijing this past week and the follow up announcement that meetings with Chinese leader Xi Jinping were productive and that Kim was willing to discuss the de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  Whatever that may mean.  We discuss the trip, the winners, the losers and how John Bolton’s mustache will fare at the negotiating table.  Also: a look at the latest news about Trump and Russia and whether it will actually take a revealing photo showing Trump’s full-body Russian mafia tattoo (a la “Eastern Promises”) to prove to the GOP leadership that Comrade T has all along been the star of “The Hunt for Orange November”, a sequel that we definitely did not need.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeb1</link>
      <description>He doesn't love democracy.  He is aging.  He, frankly, doesn't run with a very nice crowd.  Oh, and there are all those invasions and murders and all that spying and so on.  But Vladimir Putin has now won four elections to be Russia's president...and is two-for-two in major superpower elections in the past couple years.  Where can this lead...and what happens if Trump turns up the heat on his patron anytime soon?  Plus--what would be the consequences of ditching the Iran deal (as the U.S. now seems likely to do)?  For the Middle East?  For North Korea?  Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, Ed Luce and David Rothkopf discuss.  Join us.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>What's Worse Than a Constitutional Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeb2</link>
      <description>A recent article in the Atlantic echoed a discussion we had not too long on Deep State Radio about whether or not we are in a "constitutional crisis."  The conclusion was we face "rot" not a crisis right now.  But is that worse than a crisis because it inures us to a problem without motivating us to confront and change it?  And is there something worse, an underlying cultural crisis that threaten our society in even more grievous ways?  Kori Schake, Rosa Brooks, Ed Luce and David Rothkopf discuss.

      <title>Does Objective Truth Still Exist...and if it Does Can the G.O.P Survive?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeb3</link>
      <description>With so much focus on scandal, corruption, nuclear war, racism, isolationism, protectionism, and nationalism in the era of Trump, we sometimes lose site of the little things.  Like the future.  Or the urgent problems we have to solve.  Or the truth.  On this episode of Deep State Radio Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks, IISS Deputy Director General Kori Schake and Vice President for the National Security Program at Third Way Mieke Eoyang debate the people, processes and mind-sets that are our problem and what to do about them.  And they defend the idea of objective truth, even visiting for a bit with most famous ever Bishop of Cloyne, George Berkeley.  Fun? Right?

      <description>Every feel like you're living inside a washing machine in the middle of the spin cycle?  We hope it's not because you have a Tide pod in your mouth.  Instead, if you're like the typical Deep State Radio listener its because you have a fairly acute addiction to cable news and social media.  We'd cure it if we could.  But for now, the best we can do is help you manage it by talking about the very latest news including the Twitter-firing of Rex Tillerson and everything it triggered with a great group of experts including Ambassador Nicholas Burns of Harvard, Kori Schake of the IISS, Evelyn Farkas of the Atlantic Council and Ed Luce of the Financial Times.

      <title>In Improv (and Nuclear Negotiations), the Secret is to Always Say "Yes"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeb5</link>
      <description>It's an old rule of improv comedy that you have to play along with the premise you are presented with.  It's a rule apparently that the old show biz wannabe who is currently president of the United States took to heart last week when he jumped on North Korean dictatorial dumpling Kim Jong Un's invitation to have a sit down.  He said "yes" before he or anyone on his staff had the slightest idea about what that might mean.  And now the world has to figure out what to do with this new wrinkle.  Fortunately, Deep State Nerds have this episode with Third Way's Mieke Eoyang, The Alliance for Securing Democracy's Laura Rosenberger, IISS' Kori Schake and Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks.  It's a great one.  Don't miss it.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <itunes:summary>It's an old rule of improv comedy that you have to play along with the premise you are presented with.  It's a rule apparently that the old show biz wannabe who is currently president of the United States took to heart last week when he jumped on North Korean dictatorial dumpling Kim Jong Un's invitation to have a sit down.  He said "yes" before he or anyone on his staff had the slightest idea about what that might mean.  And now the world has to figure out what to do with this new wrinkle.  Fortunately, Deep State Nerds have this episode with Third Way's Mieke Eoyang, The Alliance for Securing Democracy's Laura Rosenberger, IISS' Kori Schake and Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks.

      <description>Russia scored its biggest recent victory in its on-going war against western democracies with the victories of the right wing in the recent Italian election.  It ranks right behind the Trump victory and the Brexit vote.  But the reality is some of what Russia is doing is winning and some of what is happening is just us losing.  We're making mistakes and often, not even making the minimum basic effort to protect ourselves.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeb7</link>
      <description>What's more screwed up in the White House--personnel or policy?  There's virtually no senior advisor to the President who hasn't left or been rumored to be on their way out.  (With the exception of Trump's Igor, Stephen Miller, who will be flattering his boss and promoting institutionalized racism until the very last day of the administration.)  There is almost no policy area where the policy approach has not been ill-considered and contradicted by someone in the administration.  Our experts including former Under Secretary of State Bob Hormats, David Sanger of the New York Times, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University discuss the latest developments in both areas--from the departure of Hope Hicks to some really really bad 1920's vintage trade policies.

      <description>Max Boot's great new book "The Road Not Taken" about American intelligence officer Edward Lansdale not only offers great insights into an intriguing character and a pivotal moment in American and modern world history, it is searingly relevant to today.  Would an expert like Lansdale even be heard today by a disconnected president who is trying to discredit the intelligence community?  Would the kind of carefully built expertise he accumulated be valued in a government that doesn't even care to have ambassadors in key outposts worldwide?  Max Boot joins Rosa Brooks of Georgetown and Deep State Radio host David Rothkopf for a discussion of the book and why its lessons are so important today.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeb9</link>
      <description>It is impossible to prove that Trump role model Tony Montana was actually speaking about former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort when he said, "this country was built on laundered money" but he might as well have been.  And it may be that the money laundered by Manafort ultimately brings him down...and possibly turns the tide against the president and his family.  Or perhaps they did their own money laundering.  It's too early to tell.  But that doesn't stop our experts Susan Hennessey of Lawfare, Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University from trying to figure out where we are in this mess with the latest indictments and maneuverings.

      <description>America's problems extend far beyond Russiagate.  In fact, they extend far beyond porn stars and having half the cabinet under investigation, failures in Puerto Rico and near nuclear war with North Korea.  They include unprecedented levels of overt corruption in the White House...but perhaps worse for a system that depends on checks and balances, they go further to the fact that no one in Congress seeks to call out or stop that corruption.  Or gun violence.  Or the war on science.  Or financial recklessness.  Or any of the other ills that currently plague the U.S.  How did we get here?  Who's to blame?  What's to be done?

      <description>The Mueller indictment charging 13 Russians for their efforts to illegally influence America's 2016 presidential election rocked Washington and sent shockwaves worldwide. The President of the U.S. tried to frame it as vindication because it did not point to his own personal collusion with the Russians (or that of any other U.S. individual).  But...as our experts Evelyn Farkas, Kori Schake and Ed Luce point out...we're just in the early days of this investigation and many more indictments are yet to come.

      <title>Olympic Update: What’s More Boring—Curling or Mike Pence?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfebc</link>
      <description>America has an unrealistic Korea policy (denuclearization) that it is not really pursuing that hard (what with not having an ambassador to South Korea, gutting the State Department and leaving it to Mike Pence who is actually not a human being but a not-so-lifelike cardboard cutout).  This might not work out so well, argue our experts like our Kori Schake, Rosa Brooks, David Sanger and Joe Cirincione.  We also discuss Syria and Iran.  Which also may not turn out so well.  So…get a drink, settle in to a comfortable chair, put a pillow over your head to muffle your screams…and join us!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>No Kittens Were Harmed In the Making of this Episode</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfebd</link>
      <description>We’ve had nuclear weapons for more than 70 years.  But we have never had a president quite as deranged as Donald Trump before and the result has made more people pay much closer attention to U.S. nuclear weapons policy than they did in recent years.  We bring together this week a great panel to discuss the Nuclear Posture Review, Trump and how to save the world including Joe Cirincione, Jeffrey Lewis, David Sanger, Kori Schake and Rosa Brooks.  One thought: implant the nuclear code in a kitten and make the president kill the kitten to get it before he can use the nuclear code.  Another: Bury the nuclear code in a 10 page long memo and thus rest assured this president will never find it.  Tune in!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

Fortunately, however, our experts at Deep State Radio, Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks, IISS' Kori Schake, the Atlantic Council's Evelyn Farkas and the FT's Ed Luce, have plenty of both and on this episode they put the memo in perspective...while also learning how to pronounce basic English vocabulary and learning a few words in New Jersey-ese.

      <description>Calm down.   We don’t mean “Trumpocalypse” as in the end of the world.  We mean it in the sense of the end of the Trump presidency.  Who knows, with some luck this could be Trump’s last State of the Union.  And that would be good on so many levels.  For example, as our experts Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and Ed Luce note, it would save us from having to listen to the inevitable tedious and misleading stories about how the U.S. president has become more presidential and is getting the hang of his job.  He’s not.  And listening to this episode of Deep State Radio will help you understand why…and why you should be thankful that the State of the Deep State is strong.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>Armageddon One of Those Silos Just As Soon As I Can</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfec2</link>
      <description>Contrary to what those outside the Deep State may think, the U.S. government has recently undergone an explosion of creativity.  Recently we have seen a National Security Strategy, a National Defense Strategy and a Nuclear Posture Review.  Some think these are just empty academic exercises. But others, like our guests the Atlantic Council’s Christine Wormuth, Georgetown’s Rosa Brooks and Kori Schake, soon to be of the IISS, see more.   They see divisions between senior officials.  They see a president who doesn’t know what any of these documents say or mean.  And, with a special eye on nukes, they see plenty of good reason to invest now in a used missile silo.

      <itunes:summary>Contrary to what those outside the Deep State may think, the U.S. government has recently undergone an explosion of creativity.  Recently we have seen a National Security Strategy, a National Defense Strategy and a Nuclear Posture Review.  Some think these are just empty academic exercises. But others, like our guests the Atlantic Council’s Christine Wormuth, Georgetown’s Rosa Brooks and Kori Schake, soon to be of the IISS, see more.   They see divisions between senior officials.  They see a president who doesn’t know what any of these documents say or mean.  And, with a special eye on nukes, they see plenty of good reason to invest now in a used missile silo.

      <title>The End of America, The Gaggingly Hubristic?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfec3</link>
      <description>Do you ever get the impression people are laughing at you, America?  More so recently?  It could just be your imaginations.  But in the view of our experts, Ambassador Nick Burns, Rosa Brooks and Kori Schake, the reason is all the actual laughter you are hearing from everywhere in the world.  The world’s view of America, as recent polls have shown, is at a low point.  The question is whether this is something new, a turning point, or we were always this funny (or flawed).

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfec5</link>
      <description>While the people of Hawaii were terrified by an errant alert indicating an incoming ballistic missile attack, the rest of the country remained frightened by what would happen even if there were not such an attack.  Judging from Donald Trump's plans for nuclear weapons and his temperament, of course, the risk of going without further such scares decreases daily.  On this episode of Deep State Radio, Kori Schake, Rosa Brooks, Ed Luce and David Sanger discuss why putting a couple books on your head won't improve your nuclear posture and, of course, shitholes.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfec6</link>
      <description>Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA and yet oddly, a former Congressman who still seems to be running for something, threw down the gauntlet to the true Deep State when he said that New York Times reporter and Deep State Radio stalwart got it wrong on how the CIA missed the sudden acceleration of North Korea's nuclear program.  Tune in to this episode to hear the man known to all as "David You're Exactly Right Sanger" responds.  Then join in for a wide ranging discussion of what happens to the world when America crawls into a hole and pretends its not there.  Featuring Mr. Sanger, Benjamin Pauker of Vox, Kori Schake en route to England and Evelyn Farkas of the Atlantic Council.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfec7</link>
      <description>Late at night in the office of Chief of Staff John Kelly.  The phone rings.  He picks it up and hears heavy breathing.  Then a raspy voice…could it be Bannon…could it be Wolff…says “Have you checked the President?”  Kelly lurches forward and grabs a secure line.  “Trace the call!”  Then, the chilling answer comes back.  The call is coming from inside the White House!!!  You think that’s a horror story?  Then you haven’t been reading the news.  Fortunately for you our special Deep State Radio guests have.  Join Lawfare’s Susan Hennessey, the NY Times David Sanger, the Atlantic Council’s Evelyn Farkas and our own soon-to-be relocating author-teacher-expert Kori Schake for an exploration through the terrifying underbrush of the past few days on our latest episode.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>It is Difficult to Make Predictions, Especially About the Future</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfec8</link>
      <description>Contrary to popular belief, according to quoteinvestigator.com, Sam Goldwyn did not utter the immortal line that is the title of this episode.  Nor did physicist Niels Bohr to whom it is also attributed.  Instead, the first person to offer it up was Danish pol Karl Kristien Steincke in his immortal work, "Farvel Og Tak", published in 1948.  Which serves as a useful reminder that if we can't even get the past right there is no way we are going to guess what's happening next.  Nonetheless, that won't stop the intrepid Deep State Radio panel of experts including Kori Schake, Rosa Brooks and David Sanger from trying.  Keep them company as they take us through what might happen in the year ahead.  And keep the box wine handy.  It's not pretty.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>What the F%#k Just Happened: Our Look Back at 2017</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfec9</link>
      <description>Is it over yet?  Can we come out of our basements now?  Is the worst year ever over?  Well...yes and no.  Yes, dear Deep State Radio nerds, you can come out of your basements.  It is 2018.  But no, the worst may not be over.  This week in two special episodes, we look back at the trends and unfinished business of 2017 in order to help us predict the catastrophes, screw-ups and near misses of 2018.  Oh, and the good stuff too, if there is any of that.  So join Team DSR--Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and David Sanger--to ring in the new year.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>What Does Putin Most Desire?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeca</link>
      <description>In David Rothkopf’s absence this week, Rosa Brooks hosts and reminds listeners that the Deep State Radio crew will soon be retreating into the bunker for some holiday eggnog, before resuming in the new year. The Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe argues that Putin is overrated, and the BBC’s Kim Ghattis and Kori Schake argue that the new US National Security Strategy is also overrated (and incoherent). Julia confesses that she has lost all hope, Kori lends her the Tiara of Optimism, and Kim describes Arab schadenfreude over #MeToo.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>With David Rothkopf away circling the globe this week on the Deep State Radio spy plane, Rosa Brooks and Kori Schake are joined by the Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe and the BBC’s Kim Ghattis. Joining in live from Beirut, Kim reveals that not everyone in the Lebanon is obsessed with US foreign policy, because most people are too busy snacking and getting ready for Christmas. Meanwhile, every single UN Security Council member state is snubbing the US over the Jerusalem resolution, and Iran is snickering on the sidelines.

      <title>Blame the Nerds</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfecc</link>
      <description>It's easy to blame the pols.  For the pols its easy to blame one another.  (Or if you are Roy Moore, who used to be a Senate candidate in the U.S., you can blame the sinners.  Or Mitch McConnell.  Or Sassy, the horse.  Take your pick). But when policies don't match the global situation and policy advisors don't have the courage to stand up to their bosses and countries like America end up with the White House heading one way (toward disaster) and the State Department heading another way (sometimes a different disaster), then who are you going to blame.  Is it the nerds?  Have the wonks let down America?  Have we lost the narrative and our spines at the same time? We ask Hisham Melhem, Kori Schake, David Sanger and Ed Luce.  Listen to what they have to say.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>As panelist Kori Schake recounts, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers once noted that if you staff an administration exclusively with "C" people you will get a "D" staff.  He never contemplated the situation we find ourselves in today.  As we in the Third Sub-basement of the Ministry of Snark contemplate the Flynn plea deal, the statements of Trump's lawyers, the foreign policy pronouncements of Jared Kushner and more events of the past week, we yearn for the days of "D" staff.  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of Stanford and David Sanger of the New York Times join for a cold hard look at some stone cold losers.

        <![CDATA[As panelist Kori Schake recounts, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers once noted that if you staff an administration exclusively with "C" people you will get a "D" staff.  He never contemplated the situation we find ourselves in today.  As we in the Third Sub-basement of the Ministry of Snark contemplate the Flynn plea deal, the statements of Trump's lawyers, the foreign policy pronouncements of Jared Kushner and more events of the past week, we yearn for the days of "D" staff.  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of Stanford and David Sanger of the New York Times join for a cold hard look at some stone cold losers.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfed0</link>
      <description>You would think that Deep State Radio would have a special celebration for our 50th podcast.  You probably imagined a giant blow out in silo somewhere with confetti and an interpretative reading of the Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo.  Well...that happened.  But you were invited.  You don't have the clearance.  Invitations were extended purely on a need-to-party-basis.  But if you need a consolation prize...listen to this; With Kori Schake of Stanford (calling in from Rome) and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown and Ed Luce of the Financial Times in our studio in the third sub-basement of the Ministry of Snark...discussing the good old days when Nazis were considered the bad guys.  Listen in.  Drink up.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>The Void: What is the Opposite of Foreign Policy?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfed1</link>
      <description>In Sochi, Russia, Iran and Turkey got together to divvy up parts of the Middle East.  It was eerily similar to a meeting 780 miles and 72 years earlier...in Yalta, where the allied powers met to discuss the face of post-War Europe.  But this time: no USA.  America was sidelined...as it has been worldwide since the beginning of this administration.  On this episode of Deep State Radio, Kori Schake of Stanford, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown and Ed Luce of the Financial Times discuss the consequences of the U.S. becoming just a spectator with regard to most key issues on the global stage...and who is stepping up to fill the void left by the U.S.  Also: as an added bonus...we discuss the royal wedding and Rosa and Ed's experiences with the Queen.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfed2</link>
      <description>What are Deep State Radio nerds thankful for this Thanksgiving?  We poll our experts and we get just the responses you would expect.  One said he is thankful we have not had a nuclear war with North Korea...yet.  Of course, many said they were grateful for Robert Mueller.  And while others mentioned being grateful for all the faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State themselves...almost all of our experts showed a lot of love all our Deep State Radio nerds.  Break out the box wine, pop a ear bud into your ear, and covertly  listen along instead of having to endure your crackpot relatives around the Thanksgiving table.  Happy Thanksgiving from all of us down here in the third sub-basement of the Ministry of Snark to all of you out there living the Twilight Zone reality  that has become our daily lives.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>You may think election meddling is as Russian as borscht but it is also as American as apple pie.  We have been doing it for years.  The question is do new technologies me more of the same or do they suggest entirely new threats, deeper threats that may make democracy harder and harder to protect?  And with an eye toward that future we have to ask: what tools do we need to protect ourselves, our institutions and our values?

      <description>With Trump just back from an Asia trip that ran the gamut of outcomes from negligible to awful, the question turns again to what's going on with U.S. foreign policy.  Specifically, we take a look at the gutting of the State Department and the president's pronouncement that "l'etat c'est moi."  (Was that him or Louis XIV?  I always get them confused. Suffice it to say it was someone whose tastes ran toward gold bathroom fixtures.)  We go there--with special guest, former Bush Administration Under Secretary of State and distinguished career foreign service officer Ambassador Nicholas Burns, Stanford's Kori Schake and Georgetown's Rosa Brooks.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfed5</link>
      <description>The President is returning from Asia.  He says it was the greatest trip there since Marco Polo.  His defenders note that he didn't start screwing up too badly until a few days in.  But then again, once he started screwing up...he really went to work flip flopping on trade with China, kissing up to Putin, insulting Kim Jong Un, making nice with the murderer who currently runs the Philippines, insulting the US intelligence community, watching as the nations of the region did TPP without the US and so much more.  Our panel of experts, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of Stanford and David Sanger of the New York Times discuss...and also take a deep dive into Sanger's recent reporting on the crisis at the National Security Agency.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfed6</link>
      <description>Robert Mueller is approaching the Trump investigation as one would approach the wrong-doing of a crime family.  And why not?  Money-laundering, lying to the Feds, and dealing with pretty unsavory characters are par for the course.  What is more, the architects of all this are another crime family, that of Vladimir Putin.  And some of the other regimes the Trumps like the best also seem to have embraced a style of governance that is more "Sopranos" than it is "Hamilton."  Is this new or the norm?  And...in a special discussion...we also explore how the abuse of power is especially hurting women in the national security community.  Join Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Susan Hennessey of Lawfare and Brookings, and Ed Luce of the Financial Times for this timely discussion.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>Trump Will Probably Not Defect to North Korea on His Asia Trip!</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfed8</link>
      <description>President Trump embarks on a 12 day, five nation trip to Asia at a moment he has never been weaker...and when the stakes are very high.  With a perilous situation in North Korea, simmering trade disputes and a newly ascendant and assertive China, the agenda will be full.  But will Trump have the ability to act?  Will he even be inclined to hold press conferences or will he fear all public questions will circle back to his problems back home?  Will the Chinese take advantage of his weak position?  Will the Russians?  How tempted will he be to stay away?  How will his exhaustion and discomfort at long trips away from his bed play into his tendency for out of control responses?  Our regulars Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and David Sanger offer the answer Deep State Radio nerds (and everyone else) needs.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

With the indictments of his campaign chairman and his deputy and the guilty plea of one of his campaign foreign policy advisors, Trump has not just sustained deep political wounds, he has also begun to see precisely how special counsel Robert Mueller intends to make his case against the president's team.

      <title>The Birth of Strategic Muddling Through</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfedc</link>
      <description>In this episode of Deep State Radio, a discussion about the state of the rudderless, visionless Middle East (and America's rudderless, visionless foreign policy) leads Rosa Brooks to frame that the core idea behind modern US foreign policy should be "strategic muddling through."  Our panel of Rosa, Kori Schake, MacKenize Eaglen, and host, David Rothkopf, discuss.  While all agree its how most of we who reside in the Deep State manage our personal lives, there is disagreement about the implications.  Good for China?  Good for Russia and Iran?  Bad for our Arab allies?  Maybe all of the above?  Or is it still, as Kori concludes, the best of all times to be an American?  Tune in and muddle through with us.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode of Deep State Radio, a discussion about the state of the rudderless, visionless Middle East (and America's rudderless, visionless foreign policy) leads Rosa Brooks to frame that the core idea behind modern US foreign policy should be "strategic muddling through."  Our panel of Rosa, Kori Schake, MacKenize Eaglen, and host, David Rothkopf, discuss.  While all agree its how most of we who reside in the Deep State manage our personal lives, there is disagreement about the implications.  Good for China?  Good for Russia and Iran?  Bad for our Arab allies?  Maybe all of the above?  Or is it still, as Kori concludes, the best of all times to be an American?

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfede</link>
      <description>In a recent interview with Forbes, President Trump said he didn't feel any obligation to honor deals struck by representatives of the United States during past administrations.  His track record shows this is one area in which he is not just talk. He withdrew from TPP and the Paris Accords, is renegotiating NAFTA and may blow it up, has speculated at pulling out of a trade deal with South Korea and is going to decertify Iran despite the fact that there are no grounds for it in the nuclear deal with that country, a move that not only. will jeopardize that deal but other negotiations worldwide.  What're the consequences of a world that no longer can take the most important player in the international system at its word?  Our panel including Kori Schake of Stanford, David Sanger of the New York Times, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and host David Rothkopf of the Washington Post discuss.

      <description>How did we get here?  How did we get to the Secretary of State calling the president a moron and the Republican Head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee saying he needed adult supervision and had us possibly heading for World War III?  Certainly Donald Trump had something to do with it?  But what about the rest of us?  Despite his whining is the media actually going too easy on him?  What about the political establishment?

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfee1</link>
      <description>Is the president playing three-dimensional chess with the world by constantly offering different policies with different tone and apparently different objectives from the rest of his team including his most senior cabinet members?  Are we all too limited to understand the giant intellect of this man who sees the universe with a sort of depth and clarity reserved for the Stephen Hawkings and Albert Einsteins of this world?  Or is he just nuts?  Or is he perhaps nuts and stupid?  Or could it be that he is nuts and stupid and incompetent and surrounded by a bunch of insipid enablers?  Our great panel including Politico's Susan Glasser, the German Marshall Fund's Laura Rosenberger, Stanford's Kori Schake and Georgetown's Rosa Brooks (and our host, David Rothkopf, columnist for the Washington Post) discuss, debate and shed light into very dark places.

      <title>The Only Discussion of the North Korea Situation You'll Ever Need</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfee3</link>
      <description>We could say a lot about this episode of Deep State Radio but there is really nothing more that needs to be said beyond the fact that this discussion featuring Pulitzer Prize-winning military historian and author of "Churchill &amp; Orwell: The Fight for Freedom" Tom Ricks, Stanford's Kori Schake, Georgetown's Rosa Brooks, the New York Times' David Sanger and host David Rothkopf, columnist for the Washington Post, is the best discussion of the rapidly deteriorating situation between the U.S. &amp; North Korea that you will hear anywhere.  Warning: It is also really really depressing and should only be listened to in the deepest reaches of your silo while drinking copious amounts of box wine.  (Yes, things have gotten much worse since our last such discussion...about a week ago.)Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>Will Donald Trump Despoil the UNGA Punchbowl?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfee5</link>
      <description>It's UNGA week, the big party for the world's leaders as they come to NYC for the opening of the UN General Assembly.  Of course, this year is marked by the fact that it's Donald Trump's first UNGA as president of the United States...and that could be the reason so many of the world's most important leaders are not attending.  But plenty of folks will be watching because Trump is, after all, Trump.  This week, David Sanger of the New York Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University and Kori Schake of Stanford University discuss what to expect from Trump and the UN meetings with regard to Iran, North Korea, and Nikki Haley's career prospects.

      <description>It's the one question everyone in the world has on their minds--other than will Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson really run for president in 2020.  And that is where will Johnson's predecessor as commander-in-chief, Donald Trump, engage in his first shooting war?  North Korea is seen as perhaps the most frightening candidate...but also, according to our experts, it is probably not the most likely.  Iran seems far more likely.  But what about Venezuela?  What about his next meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell?  Our intrepid gang of Deep State insiders--Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of Stanford, and David Sanger of the New York Times (and Harvard) consider our options.

      <title>9/11 Sixteen Years Later: Would Bin Laden View Trump as a Sign of His Mission's Success</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfee7</link>
      <description>Donald and Melania Trump presided over 9/11 remembrance ceremonies on Monday for the first time as president.  Trump seemed awkward and his language was stilted.  He does not do compassion well.  But Trump is not so far removed from 9/11 as you might think--despite his failure to donate from his charities to its victims or his need to resort to lies to pretend he was close to those victims.  No, he and his supporters who promote intolerance toward Muslims are producing precisely the outcome that Bin Laden sought and the fear that helps fuel their anger was exactly what Bin Laden was seeking to generate.  On this episode of Deep State. Radio, join Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of Stanford, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and host David Rothkopf of Union County, New Jersey, in a discussion of how we got where we are, how this resonates with tribalism worldwide, how we can fix it and why Rosa has such a sunny disposition.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfee8</link>
      <description>Donald Trump ends the DACA program. He tacitly supports white supremacists. He goes after Muslims. He wants a wall. He attacks the courts. He can’t get anything done but can’t stop talking about it. He’s a mess. But he’s not just our mess. When the guy who holds the job of “leader of the free world” cedes the moral high ground, is incompetent, and actively undermines our values and those of our allies, it has a big effect on the way the world works. Has the world reached the point where it has concluded Trump is incapable of global leadership and they are either waiting for his replacement or taking advantage of America’s newfound absence of influence? Is this where we will be for years to come? Our panelists, Rosa Brooks and Colin Kahl of Georgetown and Kori Schake of Stanford, discuss. And hijinx ensue.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>Donald Trump has taken establishing foolish redlines into the 21st Century with the use of social media.  In the case of North Korea, he is threatening devastating outcomes if they go one inch further…and then they do…and do it again…and he doesn’t act.  Is he all talk?  Or is he the irrational maniac he seems to be, the kind who could trigger a catastrophe on the Korean Peninsula?  Our loyal band of deep staters—Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and Colin Kahl—discuss and lament the current state of play of this most serious crisis of the young Trump administration.  Join them for this special back-to-school episode of Deep State Radio…and the most rational discussion of the North Korea crisis you will hear anywhere!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <title>Can Trump Be President After Charlottesville?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeeb</link>
      <description>Trump's racism and affinity for the worst sorts of right wing extremists poured forth defiantly in the wake of the unrest in Charlottesville.  The result was an avalanche of criticism and waves of defections from presidential advisory groups and companies supporting his resorts with events.  Is this a watershed?  Can Trump no longer perform even ceremonial roles as president?   And should his cabinet continue to cover for his glaring defects?   That's what Heather Hurlburt of New America, Stanford's Kori Schake, Georgetown's Rosa Brooks and host David Rothkopf discuss on this fun and sun-filled episode of Deep State Radio.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeec</link>
      <description>While you were busy fretting about Nazis and the sudden implosion of Donald J. Trump, the Deep State Radio team maintained its steady focus on nuclear apocalypse. With David still away in an undisclosed location, Rosa, Kori and special guests Jeffrey Lewis and Alice Hunt Friend wonder about Trump and the nuclear codes, and argue about whether military personnel have a duty to obey a presidential order to launch a preemptive nuclear strike, or a duty to disobey. Moving along, they ask whether the Iran deal is on the chopping block, when Japan and South Korea will demand nukes of their own, and why everyone seems to have lost interest in Pakistan.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeed</link>
      <description>It’s been a validating week for apocalypse watchers. On this episode of Deep State Radio, David hides in his hardened bunker while Rosa, Kori and guests Alice Hunt Friend and Jeffrey Lewis wonder what should scare us more, heavily armed white supremacists marching through Charlottesville, or the prospect of imminent war with North Korea? Jeffrey – a.k.a. Arms Control Wonk – explains North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, Rosa wonders if deterrence theory applies to Donald Trump, Alice argues that the moral arc of the universe is still bending towards justice, and several rhinestones fall off Kori’s tiara of optimism.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfeef</link>
      <description>What is the geopolitical significance of Putin's torso?  What do his exposed nipples say about Russia and its people.  Why is it absolutely vital that the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, never ever ever never sees Putin's fondness for exposing his naked chest as he did recently on a fishing expedition to Siberia as a challenge?  Why must America never see the First Torso?  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University and Julia Ioffe of The Atlantic join host David Rothkopf for an in-depth discussion of these and other issues regarding the US-Russia relationship today.  These other issues may also lead you to lose your appetite...but in a different way.  Tune in.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>Clearly the world has gone, in the words of one Deep State Radio listener nerd, "nuclear grade bonkers."  On this episode of the pod, Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, Julie Smith, and, host, David Rothkopf discuss the latest examples of this including the departure of the worst and shortest lived communications in White House history (with the best nickname...we won't miss you, Mooch) and they debate the prospects of former Secretary of Homeland Security, General John Kelly to bring order to this White House.  From there the conversation turns to a world in chaos and Rosa tries to wrestle the "tiara of optimism" away from Kori as Julie slowly bangs her head on the acoustic foam covered walls of our tiny studio in the third sub-basement of the Ministry of Snark.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfef2</link>
      <description>This week, Ben Wittes of Brookings and Lawfare and David Sanger of the New York Times chat with David Rothkopf about the global consequences of domestic scandals. The President continues to argue that Russia didn’t interfere with the 2016 U.S. elections -- how does this affect his relationship with the intelligence community, constituencies, and the world? At what point does Trump become a direct line of communication between Putin and the American people? We also discuss the policy process of the National Security Council and the President’s approach to nuclear negotiations with Iran and North Korea, with analysis from observations at the Aspen Ideas Festival.

Does David Sanger remember any of his college philosophy courses? On this episode, Stanford's Kori Schake, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, David Sanger of the New York Times, and David Rothkopf, who grew up in New Jersey, walk us through how Trump may have developed what pass for his philosophies and consider the nature and origins of the ideas that drive his world view.

      <description>On this episode of Deep State Radio, Lawfare managing editor Susan Hennessey, Georgetown Law School Associate Dean Rosa Brooks and perennially optimistic Stanford military historian Kori Schake take a good hard look at the good hard time some of America's leaders may be doing soon.  From recent revelations about Trump, Jr. and his secret meetings with a Russian lawyer to seek dirt on Hillary Clinton to the will of the U.S. Congress to seek justice, we leave no stomach unturned.

      <description>If you were playing in the Trump Division of a Fantasy Felony League, who would you pick in the draft to accumulate the most points for subpoenas, indictments, convictions, appeals, counts of perjury, lawyers, lawyer resignations, and/or denigrating “Godfather” movie references in the press?  Fredo (Don, Jr.)?  Jared?  Flynn?  Manafort?  Roger “Crazy Eyes” Stone?  Agent Orange himself?  Our experts including Georgetown’s Rosa Brooks and Colin Kahl, New America’s Heather Hurlburt and our host, David Rothkopf, debate and discuss the breaking news about America’s favorite crime family, the state of the investigation, next steps, and what this all means for the world.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfef8</link>
      <description>Rotten Tomatoes gives "National Lampoon's European Vacation" a score of 39 percent.  But if they had rated "Donald Trump's European Vacation" the score would have been a lot lower--especially if they were listening to our panel.  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of Stanford, Susan Hennessey of Lawfare and David Rothkopf of somewhere in New Jersey, join for a play-by-play breakdown of the president's trip, gaffes, missteps, and outrages.  Suffice it to say Chevy Chase would have done better...even the old, cranky, not-funny-anymore Chevy Chase of today.  Also explored on this episode: the very big idea of a Kori Schake-Graham Allison cage match over the use of the term "Thucydides Trap."  Deep State Radio Nerd heaven!

      <title>With Elites Like These No Wonder We Need the Deep State</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfef9</link>
      <description>On this second episode of Deep State Radio recorded in the sylvan beauty of Aspen, Colorado during the Ideas Festival, our regulars including Kori Schake of Stanford, David Sanger of the New York Times and Ed Luce of the Financial Times, explore a few of the top overheard high up in the Rockies.  Then they ponder the nature of elites at events like Aspen and why it might be that they seem a bit out of touch sometimes with the reality of the average person.  And if you think it's hypocritical for them to do that given that they were at Aspen or frequent events like it, forget it.  The Deep State Radio gang fly commercial.  On this episode we prove yet again that we are the people's elite. Pass the peanut butter and jelly canapés, please.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>In this report from the Aspen Ideas festival and other undisclosed but nonetheless elitist locations, the Deep State Radio gang--including Ed Luce and David Rothkopf in Aspen, David Sanger in Vermont and Kori Schake from Stanford--discuss readout from Aspen discussions, including notably David's panel encounter in which General David Petraeus argued that it was "immaterial" whether Trump was unfit to serve because the team around him was so darned good.  (Best he's ever seen, according to Petraeus.). If that isn't enough, Luce encountered a bear between champagne receptions and intense intellectual discussions.  Fun for all!

(And Rosa’s dog and Kori’s horse.)<p>Support this show <a href="http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio">http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio</a>.<br></p><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>16 Years Down, 50 to Go: An Update on the Changing Nature of the War on Terror</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cfefd</link>
      <description>Do low tech attacks on soft targets suggest a change in the nature of both the war on terror and how our societies express their political dysfunction? Or is the mayhem that drives the news daily more or less what we have always seen in the past? On this episode of Deep State Radio, Georgetown Law School’s Rosa Brooks, Stanford’s Kori Schake and CNAS’ Julie Smith try to get past the headlines and answer what’s new about the period we have entered and whether or not our leaders in the White House are doing anything to help. Or are they making it worse? You be the judge. Warning: Extra box wine may be required in this episode that is rated at only half a rhinestone tiara of optimism.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>On this episode of Deep State Radio, our regulars Kori Schake of Stanford, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown and host David Rothkopf are joined by former top White House national security aide Julie Smith.  The discussion focuses on the escalations and complications that are making virtually every flashpoint in the Middle East more dangerous, what the White House is (not) doing about it and why leaving it to the generals may or may not be a good idea.  They get there via the Battle of Waterloo and “Young Frankenstein.”  Naturally.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>In this episode of Deep State Radio our special guest Edward Luce of the Financial Times joins Georgetown's Rosa Brooks, Stanford's Kori Schake and the New York Times' David Sanger to discuss what's gone wrong in Anglo-American democracy, what's gone remarkably right in France, why Rosa is still in Canada, and why it may be that it's not just Trump that's contributed to the end of the Pax Americana...it may be his whole damn baby boom generation (and the missteps of all the Boomer presidents from Clinton to Bush to Obama to Trump.). Where this leads...and whether that might be a good thing are discussed and the whole thing leads Luce to use the word "parlous"--which elevates the discourse of Deep State Radio to new levels.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.

      <description>There's lots we don't know about how things are going to shake out in the small constellation of scandals that surround America's president.  But there is one thing that's clear.  The cloud Donald Trump wanted James Comey to help remove is not going away anytime soon.  Does this mean America's president is no longer the most powerful man in the world?  Is Trump the least influential American president since Hoover?  And has Rosa Brooks found a used Canadian missile silo?

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/deepstateradio/episodes/5c51ff9e4ac9bb705d1cff01</link>
      <description>America's Twitter-bomber-in-chief has caused plenty of mayhem during his wild ride through the first half year in the presidency, but he hasn't really been tested by a crisis.  On this episode, guests Rosa Brooks, Kori Shake and David Sanger discuss what clues deep staters might have gleaned about how the big guy might handle a terrorist attack or an international incident.  They also consider just how long lasting the damage of the Trump tenure might be to America's standing.  Which leads them right back to wondering about where to find a good used nuclear missile silo...and to a discussion of Kori's sparkling Tiara of Optimism.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.
