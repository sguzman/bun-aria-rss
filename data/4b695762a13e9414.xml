      <title>Borders Between Us</title>
      <description>Saidu Tejan-Thomas Jr. was born in Sierra Leone, and when he was eight years old, his mom brought him to live with her in the States. Then, when he was a teenager, his mom got sick and passed away. In the years since, Saidu has struggled with how distant he felt from his mom, often using poetry to work through his feelings. On this week's show, a beautiful story about the infinite gratitude--and resentment--we can feel for the parents who gave us everything.
Plus, an update about our podcast.
"Borders Between Us" was produced by Saidu Tejan-Thomas Jr. and Jay Allison for the public radio website transom.org. The story was made possible by funding from the National Endowment for the Arts.

      <title>The Life and Times of Reggie Ossé</title>
      <description>Brittany and Eric share a new episode of Mogul that's a tribute to the life and career of Reggie Ossé. Reggie hosted the first season of Mogul and he had a personality and a presence that was truly larger than life. A couple of months after completing the show, Reggie was diagnosed with colon cancer and he passed away in December of 2017. The folks at Mogul are going to tell you Reggie’s story — his early days growing up a hip-hop head in Brooklyn, his time as a lawyer representing legendary artists like Jay-Z and Dame Dash and his reinvention as Combat Jack, hip hop’s flagship podcaster.

      <title>Michael Twitty's Cooking Gene</title>
      <description>In our last conversation with Michael Twitty, the chef and culinary historian told us all about his “Southern Discomfort Tour.” The tour, which he wrote about in his book, “The Cooking Gene,” involved travelling the south and cooking on plantations using the same methods that his enslaved ancestors would have used. (He even did it dressed as they would have dressed.) Since our conversation, Michael has won two James Beard awards  — the Oscar’s of the food world! — for his book and food writing. In a follow-up to our original episode, Brittany calls Michael to hear all about what it was like to win the food world’s highest honor, his recent travels all over Africa, and his unfiltered opinions on collard greens.

      <title>You Don't Make Free People</title>
      <description>Each week this August, we’re updating some of our most thought-provoking episodes. This week: writer Casey Gerald reflects on what we lose when we buy into the promise of the American dream. We first talked to Casey about his book “There Will Be No Miracles Here,” back in November of 2018. At the end of the episode, there's a very special update from from Casey, including the realization that he was thinking about freedom, and how we get free, all wrong. We want to encourage you to discuss these episodes with friends and family, too, so we’ve put together a handy guide on how to organize your own podcast club. It’s like a book club, but for podcasts. Visit thenod.show/podcastclub for more info.
Recommendations from Casey:
Chani Nicholas workshops
"Awakening the Three Psychic Knots" meditation
"An Ecstatic Experience" by Ja'Tovia Gary

      <title>The Vindication of T-Pain</title>
      <description>Was T-Pain’s heavily autotuned music totally genius… or the death knell of hip-hop as we knew it? In this edition of Vindication Court, Brittany tries to convince Judge Eric that T-Pain’s use of autotune was not only artistically ambitious, but that it changed music forever-- for the better. But with autotune’s many detractors, this case won’t be an easy one. Will T-Pain’s spin on autotune finally get the recognition it deserves?

      <title>The Gamer Godfather You've Never Heard Of</title>
      <description>Video game consoles were super boring in the early days: you could only switch between a few basic, built-in games — no Super Mario Bros, Sonic the Hedgehog or Legend of Zelda. But that all changed thanks to the contributions of a man named Jerry Lawson. Brittany tells Eric the story of the man who helped make video gaming way more fun, paving the way for the video game industry as we know it today.

      <title>Black in Fashion</title>
      <description>In this week's BONUS, we have a conversation with Lindsay Peoples Wagner, Teen Vogue's newest editor-in-chief. Last summer, Wagner wrote Everywhere and Nowhere: What its really like to be black and work in fashion, where she interviewed more than 100 people about their experiences in the fashion industry. She talked about putting together that piece, and her own experiences in the fashion world with Molly Fischer, the host of Gimlet's newest podcast The Cut on Tuesdays. In this extended cut of their conversation, Wagner talks to Fischer about who has all the power in fashion, how hard it is to get your foot in the door, and the time one of her bosses asked her if her parents had been in slavery.

      <description>The Nod is off this week, but Brittany and Eric are still here to present Uncivil, Gimlet Media's newest show.

Jack and Chenjerai take on what you think you know about the Civil War, and connect what happened then to the political battlefield we’re living on right now.
