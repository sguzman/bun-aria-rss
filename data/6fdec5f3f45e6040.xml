   <media:description>The concept of psychedelic microdosing has exploded in recent years - in the media and culture. in the surging psychedelic business industry, and in scientific research labs at a variety of institutions.

People claim that microdosing can improve things such as mood, well-being, attention, problem solving, and creativity, as well as reduce depression and anxiety symptoms.

But does the scientific research support the claims that are so commonly made? 

How much of the effects can be attributed to positive expectations and the placebo response that these create?

Here I dive deep into the research to date exploring these questions.

   <media:description>This is the second video in my two part series on the serotonin 2A (aka 5-HT2A) receptor - the brain receptor most important for psychedelic drug effects!

Following up on my last video where I described this receptor's effects on the brain, here I dive into the latest theoretical perspectives on what this fascinating brain receptor does in terms of our thinking and behaviour - both with psychedelics and when activated outside the context of drugs.

*** After reflecting on the video - I wanted to add that additional events that could induce serotonin 2A activation could be major life events: a death of a loved one, the end of a break up, getting fired from a job, being extremely overwhelmed by stress related to work or family, etc. An interesting link here is between 2A activation and what some have called 'spiritual emergencies' or 'the dark night of the soul'.

The video's organization is inspired by the following paper:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881117725915

Enjoy!

   <media:description>This is the first video in my two part series on the serotonin 2A (aka 5-HT2A) receptor - the brain receptor most important for psychedelic drug effects!

In this video I go over: 

- the basics of how neurons communicate and what a brain receptor is (0:23)

- how psychedelics act as if they're serotonin (1:38)

- how we know that the serotonin 2A receptor is the most important for psychedelic effects (2:18)

- where this receptor located in the brain (2:55)

- what happens to the activity of neurons/groups of neurons when this receptor gets activated (4:28)

In Part 2 I will be going over theories on what this system might be responsible for (independent of psychedelics drugs), as well as why it might've evolved! Stay tuned for that soon.

   <media:description>Building on my previous video on the Entropic Brain Hypothesis, in this video I present the RElaxed Beliefs Under pSychedelics (REBUS) model of how psychedelics work.

This is the latest unified scientific model of psychedelic drug action, proposed by leading psychedelic neuroscientist Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris.

I dive into what exactly it proposes, on both a psychological and brain level, and provide all the background needed to get a grasp of it. 

As always, I do my best to make my videos accessible to a non-scientific audience, without sacrificing too much depth or nuance.

Enjoy!

The paper that proposed this model can be found here: https://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/71/3/316

   <media:description>This is a question that might surprise some. 

You might think, 'What? Of course it's necessary. How could it not be?&quot;

But this is a question that is earnestly being investigated and contemplated, both in the academic world and in industry.

It has great relevance - some people simply aren't ready for a psychedelic experience, or are not in a physical condition to risk a trip (for example think of older adults who have ongoing health concerns regarding their heart, etc.). If we were able to somehow create psychedelics that activated similar responses in the brain and produced positive benefits without the trip, that would be very useful in clinical settings.

In this video I dive into the main arguments on both sides of this question and come to what I think is a reasonable answer.

Drop a comment with any opinions on the matter, happy to hear them!

   <media:description>In this video, I go over The Entropic Brain Hypothesis of how psychedelic drugs affect the brain and mind. 

This theory was originally proposed by leading psychedelic neuroscientist Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris in his 2014 paper, available at: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00020/full

As always, I do my best to present the ideas in a way that anyone can understand, whether they have a scientific background or not!

This video is also preparation for my deep dive into Dr. Carhart-Harris's more recent theory, which integrates these ideas into a larger framework. This framework is called the RElaxed Beliefs under pSychedelics (REBUS) model. Look for a video on that in the near future!

   <media:description>Nowadays we hear a lot of claims being made about how psychedelics affect the default-mode network. 

These claims often unequivocally link the default mode network to ego-dissolution, and claim that disrupting the default mode network is central to the therapeutic effects of these drugs.

The thing is, however, the research doesn't really directly support either of these things...

Specifically, the two claims I critique and debunk in this video are:

(1) Default mode network disintegration = ego-dissolution

(2) Disrupting the DMN causes the brain to 'reset'

Hopefully this allows you to appreciate how we are really still in the infancy of psychedelic research and are only scratching the surface of our understanding.

   <media:description>In honour of our wonderful fungal comrades and the fact that 9/20 was this past weekend (9/20 is the magic mushroom version of cannabis' 4/20), here's a video going over all the main brain imaging findings with psilocybin (the active compound in magic mushrooms) over the past decade.

The video should be accessible to all, but if you have zero background in brain networks or the default mode network, I highly recommend watching my video 'fMRI Brain Networks in 10 minutes' prior to this one. Enjoy!

   <media:description>Brain networks such as the default-mode network are mentioned more and more and the media these days - but what exactly are these brain networks?

In this video, I start with the very basics of how functional brain imaging works and dive into the seven main brain networks that neuroscientists typically refer to. No neuroscience background needed!

What I describe in here is important foundational stuff for understanding the latest developments in psychedelic neuroscience, and for an understanding of brain function in general. This video is the first in my series on psychedelic neuroscience - much more to come!

   <media:description>Building on my recent video on what exactly ego death or ego dissolution might be, here I dive into the latest neuroscience findings on how it might work in the brain! 

As always, no prior scientific background is necessary to understand what I present.

Although this research is only in its early stages, this is some fascinating stuff and the findings more or less makes sense in relation to peoples' subjective experiences. 

Have you experienced ego-death and are looking to make more sense of it in a scientifically-grounded manner? Are you just curious about this fascinating aspect of the psychedelic experience? Then this video is for you!

   <media:description>The idea that psychedelics can induce 'ego death' or 'ego dissolution' has been getting more and more attention in the mainstream media these days. Especially after it was popularized in Michael Pollan's book 'How to Change Your Mind'.

Despite this, it is still unclear what exactly ego death is... Most descriptions are pretty vague and hand-wavy with respect to what exactly 'dies' or 'dissolves' in these experiences.

In this video I draw on the latest scientific and philosophical perspectives to give us a more precise understanding of what ego death experiences might actually consist of!

   <media:description>Having the right preparation for your trip is essential!

You need to really take stock of what is going on internally (in your mind and body) and externally (in your immediate environment). This can make or break your trip!

In psychedelic circles, these are often referred to as your 'set' and 'setting'.

In this video I dive deep into what set and setting are and give a bunch of tips for each to best ensure you have a positive expeirence!!
