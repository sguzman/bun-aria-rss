      <title>october 25: sit in for justice</title>
      <description>Getting arrested isn’t always a bad thing. As John Lewis so eloquently said, "Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America."

Sometimes it means that the laws are wrong and you’re fighting for civil rights. At least in the case of Martin Luther King Jr, who was sentenced to four months in jail on October 25th, 1960, after participating in a student protest at a department store in Atlanta. Maia talks about the arrest itself, as well as the student sit in protests writ large. We also get a music fact about Richard Nixon—yep, you read that right! Tune in to hear what it is.

      <title>october 15: the eye of the panther</title>
      <description>When you hear the phrase ‘Black Panther’ you probably think of the 2018 Marvel film with Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan. But actually, Black Panther has a greater significance in society than just being the definition to a movie. In another round of Civil Rights history, the Black Panther Party's purpose is to gain justice for Black Americans and other oppressed groups in the US. Maia shares just how important they are not only in progressing societal knowledge, but as well in educational knowledge. In addition to this, Maia reminds us of that one time when we all woke up with a new U2 album downloaded onto our Apple devices and who apologized for the unwarranted library addition.

      <title>october 13: isolation, underground style (with Sizzy Rocket)</title>
      <description>On each episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, we know that Maia digs into different history facts that happened on that specific day. But for today’s episode, let's just say that we are literally digging in. Back in 2010, 33 men experienced something like we are experiencing now: isolation. However, their isolation looked a little different than ours. Where we are stuck in our homes, these 33 men were stuck in a cave 2,300 feet underground with no way to communicate with the outside world. Yikes! You will not want to miss this episode of finding out what happened to these men and also hearing from our special guest Sizzy Rocket! Join this episode today and make sure you’re following along with the daily updates @365daysmxmtoon on all platforms.

      <title>october 5: the time the President went on tv</title>
      <description>Once upon a time, people used radios in order to consume music, news, weather reports, and even sporting events. The lack of having a visual to watch was made up with the story being created in the listeners mind. This all changed though when the integration of TVs were popularized in homes - specifically when it comes to political commentary. Now, viewers could see televised speeches and elections broadcasted in their living rooms; some good, some bad, and some very bad. On today’s episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia shares the first time the president went on TV. Along with this famous milestone, Maia as well shares the first of many milestones renowned artist Beyoncé created, starting with her nine-week run on the US singles chart with “Baby Boy”. Join this episode today and make sure you’re following along with the daily updates @365daysmxmtoon on all platforms.

      <title>october 4: up in the air (with Amy Allen)</title>
      <description>We all remember the history lesson about the Wright brothers, but may have forgotten why they are so important. Well, on today’s episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia shares their key invention that has transformed the way we travel: airplanes. As soon as the airplane was invented, things were looking up (get it?). Our way of transportation has majorly transformed because of the testing the Wright brothers did to ensure long lasting flight abilities; without planes, we would still be on boats traveling from country to country. As for our musical fact of the day, we have a special guest who you should definitely know about. She has co-written a number of incredible songs, including “Back To You” by Selena Gomez and “Adore You” by Harry Styles. Here she is today, talking about her 2018 release with Halsey - give it up for Amy Allen! Join this episode today and make sure you’re following along with the daily updates @365daysmxmtoon on all platforms.

      <title>october 2: on justice and the police (with Gia Woods)</title>
      <description>Being sworn into the Supreme Court is a major accomplishment to add to your resume of life. But for Thurgood Marshall, being sworn into the nation's highest court was not just a major achievement for himself, but a leading step forward in society. On this episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia reveals the reason why Thurgood Marshall is a pivotal character in our nation's history. He influenced not just those around him, but inspired a generation of individuals younger than him to step up and be courageous in their search for justice. In addition to this, Maia as well shares the story of a musical figure who is the voice behind the band’s biggest hits, like “Don’t Stand So Close to Me” and “Every Breath You Take.” You might not know him by his real name, but he sure does fly like a butterfly and sting like a bee. Join this episode today and make sure you’re following along with the daily updates @365daysmxmtoon on all platforms.

      <title>september 26: on gramophones and hip-hop rock</title>
      <description>Streaming services have revolutionized the way we listen to music. But before we had these platforms, how did we tune in? Let's rewind back before the radio, cassettes, or CDs, and take a look at the record player. In this episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia shares the history of how German immigrant Emile Berliner found inspiration to improve upon Thomas Edison’s invention of the phonograph. Berliner’s improvement became known as the gramophone, which we commonly call the record player. This was world changing for the music industry, creating accessibility for people all around the world to hear music that was available to them live. Speaking of the music industry, on this day the first hip hop group hit the Billboard Top 10 with their third album, which led them to be inducted into the Library of Congress. Join this episode today and make sure you’re following along with the daily updates @365daysmxmtoon on all platforms.

On this episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, we’ll hear about the journey that took Nintendo’s playing cards all the way to some of the most sought-after pieces of technology in the world. Also, Maia will clue us in on an absurd period of time when the world was convinced that musical legend Paul McCartney wasn’t who he said he was.

      <title>september 19: the untold history of emojis</title>
      <description>Wait...there existed a time before an emoji existed to convey every thought and emotion our brains could formulate? Who are we without :) and :(? On this episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia takes us back to a 1982 college message board to explore the roots of our favorite keyboard accessories. I mean c’mon, where else would the emoji be born if not amongst college students? For those of us missing live music, we’ll also be transported back to Central Park 1981 for the highest attended concert of its time (Hint: This iconic duo had no need for emojis in giving us all the feels on “Bridge Over Troubled Water”).
