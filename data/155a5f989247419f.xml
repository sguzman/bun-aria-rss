He grew up extremely sheltered but his dad would take him now and then to the night club he owned, the legendary Dublins, where Enny would buy drinks for the ladies and rub elbows with the stars - when he was 8! It was two totally different worlds. Enny’s dad gave him some parting advice and has never spoken to him again. Enny also shares a story about getting catfished by a girl he lost his virginity to and the trauma that came along with it. This was such a great episode!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My #HoneyDew this week is Joey Diaz! We ended Joey’s first episode at the age of nine and we pick up right where we left off. Joey talks about hustles he learned along the way, the abuse he suffered in Catholic school that led to fighting a nun, and a family that took him in and treated him like a son. One thing about Joey Diaz - he loves hard. This was emotional for him and seeing him shed tears made me love him even more. If you’re a fan of Joey’s you’ll love this episode.

His memory is incredible and his stories are so vivid. You can't sit down in one episode and get Joey's life story. This episode covers birth to age 9. I'll have him back again and we'll pick up right where we left off but when I tell you that the things Joey lived through and the things he did by age 9 are more than most adults have ever done in a lifetime, I'm not kidding. This episode is what the HoneyDew is all about. It's a must-listen and an instant classic!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My HoneyDew this week is Jessa Reed. Jessa’s story is unlike anything I’ve ever heard. By the age of 16 she had already lived a life that most people will never experience - bong hits at age six, addiction, abuse, being a teenage mom, death threats and severe meth addiction. Did I mention she died? Oh yeah, SHE DIED! It’s one hell of an episode! <a href="https://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My guest this week is Carlotta Wood. Carlotta is the first friend I made when I moved to California in 1997 and we've been friends ever since. I actually heard her before I saw her. When I told her I was going to use her voice some day, she looked at me like I was crazy. It took me a while, but 22 years later, she's the voice that introduces every episode of The HoneyDew. She’s not crazy about me using a picture of her with sunglasses but this pic is from a coupla years ago and it’s exactly what she looked like the first time I met her. I knew some of Carlotta's story but there's so much I didn't know. She opens up about everything from childhood trauma, being a teenage mom and dating a pastor that hid in her bushes. Carlotta has some stories! No matter what we talk about, no matter how deep it gets, we always find a way to laugh about it. Carlotta shared a quote I had never heard - "I'm glad I don't look like what I've been through." Man does that resonate!<br /> I hope you enjoy this episode.</p> <p><a href="http://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">http://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com</a></p>]]></description>
