                            <p><strong>Tehran acknowledges it had provided Moscow with a “small number” of UAVs but denies ever supplying missiles</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Iran has for the first time acknowledged it handed over military drones to Russia, claiming, however, that the shipments were completed before the Ukraine conflict broke out in late February. Tehran at the same time denied claims that it had provided Moscow with missiles.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said: <em>&ldquo;This fuss made by some Western countries, that Iran has provided missiles and drones to Russia to help the war in Ukraine - the missile part is completely wrong.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Iran&rsquo;s IRNA state news agency quoted the diplomat as having added that the <em>&ldquo;drone part is true, and we provided Russia with a small number of drones months before the Ukraine war.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Amirabdollahian also claimed that Tehran and Kiev had agreed two weeks ago to hold discussions on alleged instances of Russian troops using Iranian weapons. According to the minister, the Ukrainian delegation, however, pulled out of the planned meeting at the last minute.</p>
<p>The diplomat also gave assurances that Tehran would <em>&ldquo;not remain indifferent&rdquo;</em> if evidence was presented that proves the Russian military is using Iranian drones in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reuters reported that the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry had not immediately replied to a request for comment.</p>
<p>In early October, Russia launched a massive campaign of airstrikes targeting major Ukrainian cities, with particular emphasis on power plants and other critical infrastructure. These attacks involved missiles as well as so-called &lsquo;kamikaze&rsquo; drones.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian government claims the Russian military has been increasingly relying on Iranian-made Shahed-136 UAVs to conduct such strikes &ndash; which Moscow denies.</p>
<p>Kiev was making similar allegations about Tehran&rsquo;s alleged involvement as early as in September, with Ukraine downgrading its diplomatic relations with Iran later that month.</p>
<p>In mid-October, Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba proposed severing ties with the Islamic Republic altogether.</p>
<p>The EU and the UK were quick to side with Ukraine on the issue, and last month slapped additional punitive measures on the already heavily sanctioned Iran.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>To get back in power, Benjamin Netanyahu had to make a deal with a group known for promoting Jewish supremacy and segregation</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>As Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to form the next Israeli government, the ultranationalist Religious Zionism alliance celebrates its own rise to power, having gone from fringe to mainstream and to, possibly, the second most powerful group in government. This represents a loss for the administration of US President Joe Biden and will have wide-ranging consequences for Palestinians.</p>
<p>Israelis went to the ballot box for the fifth time in three years on Tuesday, paving the way towards<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-63459824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> another government headed by the Likud Party&rsquo;s Benjamin Netanyahu</a>. However, the return to power for the longest-serving Israeli Prime Minister, comes in large part thanks to the rise of the infamous ultra-nationalist alliance Religious Zionism, with which Netanyahu had signed an agreement promising government positions in exchange for support. Religious Zionism subsequently emerged as the third largest list elected to Israel&rsquo;s parliament, the Knesset. This means that Benjamin Netanyahu will be at the mercy of politicians that were once known as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/1/far-right-ben-gvir-emerge-as-key-player-in-israel-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fringe</a> and were labeled as a <em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-719982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">danger to Israel</a>&rdquo;</em> by the editor-in-chief of the Jerusalem Post.</p>

<p>The two most prominent figures from Religious Zionism are Itamar Ben-Gvir of the &lsquo;Jewish Power&rsquo; Party and Bezalel Smotrich of the &lsquo;National Union-Tkuma&rsquo; party. Itamar Ben-Gvir is a disciple of the ultranationalist extremist Meir Kahane, whose Kach Party was banned from running for a seat in the Knesset in 1988, for being &ldquo;manifestly racist,&rdquo; and which was later labeled a terrorist group by both Tel Aviv and Washington. Ben-Gvir took over the &lsquo;Jewish Power&rsquo; party from his colleague Ben-Zion Gopstein, who was also banned from running for the Knesset over racist remarks, and who currently heads the group known as Lehava, which advocates segregation and the prevention of mixed marriages between Jews and Arabs. Ben-Gvir has been prosecuted in Israel over 53 times, by his own admission, for the likes of backing a terrorist group, for <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel/ben-gvir-convicted-of-inciting-to-racism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inciting racism</a> and for <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20210515-itamar-ben-gvir-the-ultra-nationalist-accused-of-stirring-up-violence-in-jerusalem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">violence against Arabs</a>.</p>
<p>Bezalel Smotrich, on the other hand, has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-racism-idUSKCN0X3161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advocated the segregation of Arabs and Jews in maternity wards</a> and claims that God commands that <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Bayit-Yehudi-MK-causes-uproar-by-saying-God-commanded-Jews-not-to-sell-homes-to-Arabs-409241" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jews not sell their homes to Arabs</a>. Smotrich was labeled by a top UK Jewish body as promoting a <em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-uk-jewish-body-tells-visiting-far-right-mk-smotrich-to-get-back-on-a-plane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hate-provoking ideology</a>&rdquo;</em> and told to leave the United Kingdom, while on a tour of Jewish communities there. Likewise, Itamar Ben-Gvir&rsquo;s Jewish Power party was last year called <em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/24/racist-and-reprehensible-jewish-power-set-to-enter-israels-parliament" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">racist and reprehensible</a>&rdquo;</em> by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). The fact that publications like the Jerusalem Post call them <em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-720689" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fascistic</a>&rdquo;</em> and that vehemently pro-Israel groups in both the United States and United Kingdom have labeled these figures racist, gives an idea of just how divisive they are.</p>
<p>Both Smotrich and Ben-Gvir are eyeing high-ranking ministerial positions in any Netanyahu-led government, meaning that not only will the Religious Zionism alliance have the power to greatly influence the incoming government&rsquo;s policies, but will likely strive to be active players in the cabinet. <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll reassert ownership of this state,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/well-reassert-ownership-of-this-state-ben-gvir-vows-as-exit-polls-show-big-gains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said Ben-Gvir</a> in a speech after exit polls had shown large gains for Religious Zionism, which seeks to overhaul Israel&rsquo;s legal system and to deport Palestinian citizens of Israel if they display <em>&ldquo;<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/10/30/religious-zionism-israel-far-right-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disloyalty</a>&rdquo;</em> to the Jewish State. From a US perspective, a Biden administration official was said to have <a href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2022/09/29/us-concerned-with-far-right-mk-becoming-minister-in-future-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Israel Hayom news</a> that they were against the likes of Itamar Ben-Gvir becoming a minister in any Israeli government.</p>

<p>According to an analysis published in &lsquo;Foreign Policy&rsquo; and written by Shalom Lipner, who served the Israeli PM&rsquo;s office from 1990 to 2016, a majority win for the Netanyahu bloc would put him at the mercy of the ultranationalists of Religious Zionism and <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/10/31/netanyahu-israel-religious-zionism-israels-political-virtuoso-in-denial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could cause a schism between Tel Aviv and Washington</a>. Religious Zionism will also push for <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-elections/article-720785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other policy priorities</a>, including long-term prison sentences for illegal immigrants, as well as introducing the death penalty for Palestinian citizens of Israel that kill Jewish Israelis, and for revoking the citizenships of Palestinian-Israelis for throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli Jews. Another controversial policy position is the cancellation of a provision within the Law of Return for Jews, which currently entitles anyone with a Jewish grandparent to claim Israeli citizenship even if they aren&rsquo;t Jewish themselves. If this amendment to the Jewish Law of Return is adopted by the incoming government, it could greatly impact immigration to Israel from around the world and may cause a backlash from Jewish communities around the globe.</p>
<p>What has been largely glossed over, however, is how such an Israeli government would impact Palestinians in the Palestinian Authority (PA). Back in September, then Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1127551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke at the United Nations General Assembly</a>, entertaining the idea of a two-State solution, as did PA President Mahmoud Abbas and US President Joe Biden. Yair Lapid and then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz were both making a greater effort to strengthen the PA in the West Bank, in order to allow for it to confront the growing number of armed Palestinian groups in the occupied territory. If the Netanyahu-led far-right government that seems to be destined to rule is inaugurated, it is likely to flatly reject any talk of a two-State solution.</p>
<p>The problem for both the Palestinian Authority and Israel is that they both need each other in order to prevent the armed uprising in the West Bank from growing even further. If Mahmoud Abbas is snubbed by Netanyahu and the PA is put in a chokehold as a result of influence from Religious Zionism, the Palestinian Authority will be forced to either fight Israel or face a possible rebellion from within. Furthermore, if the PA cannot be effective against grassroots Palestinian movements, NGOs and newly-formed armed groups, then the Israeli army will be forced to do all the heavy lifting, which means escalation and even greater bloodshed. If we combine the policies which could be on the way for dealing with Palestinians under occupation, with the possible injustices that may be carried out against Palestinian citizens of Israel, the stage may well be set for a large-scale Palestinian uprising. Not only have the Israeli public voted in a radical right-wing government, but they may have just voted for a massive escalation of the Palestine-Israel conflict, too.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Imran Khan says he will resume his march on the capital after recovering from his injuries</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Protests over an alleged assassination attempt targeting Pakistan&rsquo;s former prime minister, Imran Khan, continued across the country for a second day on Friday.</p>
<p>Khan, who has been calling on supporters to take to the streets since being removed from power in a parliamentary vote in April, was attacked in the city of Wazirabad on Thursday.</p>
<p>Several shots were fired at the opposition politician as he waved to the crowd from a truck during his protest march toward the capital Islamabad. According to medics, two bullets hit the former PM in the leg, and the injuries are not life-threatening.</p>
<p>On Friday, Khan recorded a video address from hospital, telling his supporters and members of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party that the shooting had not affected his determination to seek an early election and demand the resignation of current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. <em>&ldquo;I will give a call to march on Islamabad once I get better,&rdquo;</em> he pledged.</p>
<p>The former prime minister has accused Sharif, along with Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and intelligence official Major-General Faisal Nasser, of trying to kill him, but has provided no evidence to back up his claim. Thursday&rsquo;s attack saw one person killed and 11 others injured, Khan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The military has called the accusations <em>&ldquo;baseless and irresponsible,&rdquo;</em> and the government has denied any involvement.</p>

<p>Khan&rsquo;s statement came as supporters were out on the streets, protesting for a second day.</p>
<p>Several major rallies took place in the Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area, with demonstrators carrying portraits of Khan and Pakistan&rsquo;s national flag, while chanting slogans including: <em>&ldquo;Announce a new election date.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Clashes broke out near the Faizabad Bridge in the capital, with riot police using tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd. Security forces said they were acting in response to protesters attacking officers with sticks and stones. <em>&ldquo;Many&rdquo;</em> demonstrators were arrested, according to the Dawn news outlet.</p>
<p>Videos on social media showed an angry crowd gathered after dark outside what was said to be the Pakistani army&rsquo;s headquarters in Rawalpindi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People also amassed at the spot where Khan was shot, and called for his march on the capital to be resumed immediately. <em>&ldquo;It cannot stop. People are very angry, it will become more intense,&rdquo;</em> one of the activists told Reuters.</p>
<p>In Lahore, the capital of the eastern state of Punjab, demonstrators set car tires on fire and blocked roads. Witnesses also saw rocks being hurled at the gates of the provincial governor&rsquo;s office, destroying security cameras and inflicting other damage.</p>
<p>Roads were also blocked in the northwestern city of Peshawar, while in the southern city of Karachi police used tear gas.</p>
<p>Khan, 70, is a former cricketer who served as Pakistan&rsquo;s prime minister from 2018 until his removal from office after a no-confidence vote in April this year.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Jordan Bardella becomes the first head of the right-wing party not from the Le Pen family</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>France&rsquo;s right-wing National Rally party has elected Jordan Bardella as president on a permanent basis, replacing Marine Le Pen, its long-time leader. The 27-year-old MEP won 85% of the vote, the party announced on Saturday at its congress in Paris.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bardella is the first National Rally president not to hail from the Le Pen family. He had served as acting president since July 2021, having taken over so that Le Pen could concentrate on her ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign. Bardella handily beat out rival Louis Aliot, mayor of Perpignan, who at 53 is almost twice his age, and who will remain Vice President of the party.</p>
<p>Involved with right-wing politics since he was a teenager, Bardella has presented himself as a &ldquo;<em>continuity candidate</em>,&rdquo; telling AFP that he looked forward to &ldquo;<em>building on the incredible legacy that Marine is handing over.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>During April&rsquo;s national election, Le Pen came the closest National Rally has ever gotten to the presidency, netting 41.5% of the vote to incumbent Emmanuel Macron&rsquo;s 58.6% in a run-off. The party won 89 seats in the lower House of Parliament two months later, a record number and ten times its previous showing, toppling Macron&rsquo;s Renaissance party from its majority.</p>
<p>Le Pen reassured the party congress she was &ldquo;<em>not leaving [the party] to take a holiday</em>,&rdquo; pledging to be &ldquo;<em>where the country needs me</em>,&rdquo; after Bardella&rsquo;s victory was announced. She is expected to make a fourth attempt at the Elysee Palace in 2027.</p>
<p>Since taking over from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, who co-founded the party as Front National 50 years ago, Le Pen has presided over a comprehensive party makeover, changing the group&rsquo;s name to dispel some of the more controversial associations with the elder Le Pen&rsquo;s politics and to attract younger members. National Rally&rsquo;s detractors nevertheless accuse its members of harboring racist and antisemitic sentiments, and even its vice president Aliot has argued the party should further soften its message to appeal to the mainstream right.&nbsp;</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>North Korea has launched at least four more projectiles, as massive US-South Korea military drills continue</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>North Korea fired four short-range ballistic missiles into the sea on Saturday, according to South Korea&rsquo;s Defense Ministry. The rockets are said to have flown some 130 kilometers, reaching an altitude of 20 kilometers.</p>
<p>The launches bring the total number of ballistic missile tests conducted by Pyongyang since Wednesday to 30. The heightened activities come as the US and South Korea continue their &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; aerial drills, which kicked off on Monday. Aside from firing ballistic missiles, North Korea has held live-fire artillery exercises, along with other military exercises.</p>

<p>Originally scheduled to conclude on Friday, the war games were extended for one additional day, with Pyongyang denouncing the decision as an <em>&ldquo;irrevocable and awful mistake.&rdquo;</em> On Friday, Pyongyang scrambled about 180 fighter jets north of the Military Demarcation Line which separates the two Koreas, in a new show of force.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; drills involve some 240 military aircraft and are the largest so far, according to the US Air Force. The joint US-South Korean exercise was first held in 2015 under the name &lsquo;Vigilant Ace&rsquo; and was set to be conducted annually. The drills were put on hold in 2018 when Seoul tried to mend ties with Pyongyang.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The UFO is believed to be part of a reusable transport system being developed by Beijing</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A Chinese reusable rocket orbiting Earth has released another object into orbit, according to the US Space Force, which detected the unknown craft on Monday. According to the Orbital Focus website, the second object is probably traveling less than 200 meters from its parent.</p>
<p>With little official information to go on, US experts believe the new object is related to a project funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China. Specifically, the paired craft may be involved in the development of an orbital segment on a fully reusable two-stage-to-orbit space transport system. The system&rsquo;s suborbital component performed a second flight in September.</p>
<p>Space watchers have hypothesized that the object may be a small satellite designed to monitor the larger craft, a service module, or the result of a test to see if the larger craft could successfully deploy satellite payloads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The<em> &ldquo;reusable experimental spacecraft&rdquo;</em> was launched August 4 from Jiuquan in the Gobi Desert, propelled by one of China&rsquo;s Long March 2F rockets, and has been in orbit for three months. It is possible the object was released some time ago and only became visible when the spacecraft shifted its orbit slightly two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Beijing has been characteristically silent on the nature and details of the mission, and it is not clear when the spacecraft will land or where. It is being developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.</p>

                            <p><strong>United Airlines has reportedly been forced to keep some seats vacant to comply with weight restrictions due to America’s obesity epidemic</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>United Airlines, the third-largest US air carrier, is reportedly unable to sell some seats on its flights due to the increased weight of the average American passenger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The carrier began blocking off three to six middle seats on each of its Boeing 757 aircraft earlier this week, according to travel blog Live and Let&rsquo;s Fly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The temporary change is a result of the increased average customer winter weights as prescribed by the FAA (The Federal Aviation Administration),&rdquo;</em> the airline said, according to the website. The FAA imposes weight limits and balance requirements on airlines.</p>
<p>The affected seats are apparently covered with red sleeves and a sign saying:<em> &ldquo;Seat inoperative &ndash; do not occupy.&rdquo;</em> The seatbelts are zip-tied together.</p>
<p>United will have to keep the seats out of service through April 30, as the FAA requires airlines to factor in higher average passenger weights during the winter months, when people wear heavier clothing. The agency raised the base weight averages that carriers use for their calculations in 2019, reflecting Americans&rsquo; expanding waistlines.</p>
<p>The averages during the summer months, including carry-on items, rose to 179 pounds (81kg) from 145 pounds (65kg) for female passengers and to 200 pounds (90.7kg ) from 185 pounds (83kg) for males. Airlines tack on an additional 5 pounds (2.2 kg) for clothing during winter months as they balance their loads for safety reasons.</p>

<p>The carriers also are apparently given the option of using actual weights, either by asking passengers to self-report or step on a scale, but that idea is not being implemented so far in the US. Reports last year suggesting that airlines might start weighing their customers led to a flurry of media coverage. The FAA said carriers will likely use other methods to calculate passenger weights, which are supposed to be updated every three years.</p>
<p>The average US adult male weighs 199.8 pounds (90.1 kg) and has a 40.5-inch (102.87 cm) waist, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That compares with 166.3 pounds (75.4 kg) in 1960. The average woman weighs 170.8 pounds (77.5kg) , up from 140.2 pounds (63.6) in 1960, and has a 38.7-inch (98 cm) waist.</p>
<p>Those figures are based on data from 2015-2018 and therefore do not include the weight that many Americans gained during the Covid-19 pandemic. A New Mexico State University study found that 48% of US adults said their weight increased during the first year of the pandemic.</p>
<p>A separate study by the American Psychological Association found that the average weight gain among those who reported increases was 29 pounds (13 kg).</p>
<p>More than 42% of US adults are obese. The obesity epidemic is so severe, in fact, that nearly 71% of Americans born after 1997 are ineligible for military service, most commonly because they are too overweight to qualify, according to Pentagon data.<br /><a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20220119/nearly-half-of-americans-gained-weight-in-pandemics-first-year"></a></p>

            <p>By acquiring Twitter last month, Elon Musk took charge of a social media platform that<em> &ldquo;spews lies all across the world,&rdquo;</em> US President Joe Biden said on Friday.</p>
<p>The comment came shortly after reports emerged that Musk had fired thousands of Twitter employees&nbsp;globally as part of a cost-cutting strategy. Sources told Politico that those laid off included members of teams working on the upcoming midterm elections in the US, content moderation, and verification of politicians&rsquo; accounts.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Elon Musk goes out and buys an outfit that spews lies all across the world,&rdquo;</em> Biden said during a Democratic fundraiser in Rosemont, Illinois, referring to the purchase of Twitter by the world&rsquo;s richest man.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no editors anymore in America,&rdquo;</em> he said, as quoted by CNN.</p>
<p>Earlier, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed that Biden had been <em>&ldquo;outspoken about the importance of social media platforms continuing to take steps to reduce hate speech and misinformation.&rdquo; That included Twitter, Facebook and any other other platform &ldquo;where users can spread misinformation,&rdquo;</em> she added.</p>

<p>Musk&rsquo;s $44 billion deal to acquire Twitter was followed by claims from left-wing politicians and activists that there had been a spike in hate speech and racism on the platform.</p>
<p>The owner of Tesla and SpaceX rebuffed those accusations, saying that <em>&ldquo;nothing has changed with content moderation&rdquo;</em> since he took charge just over a week ago.</p>
<p>On Friday, Musk revealed that Twitter was losing $4 million per day because <em>&ldquo;activist groups&rdquo;</em> had been <em>&ldquo;trying to destroy free speech in America&rdquo;</em> by pressuring advertisers to boycott his platform.</p>
<p>The tech entrepreneur said earlier that his goal was to turn Twitter into <em>&ldquo;a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

<p>The JCS added that US-made F-35As were among the South Korean jets scrambled, and that the military was in a <em>&ldquo;full response posture.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>While Seoul offered few details about the North Korean flights, officials said the planes remained north of the Military Demarcation Line which separates the two Koreas.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The South scrambled jets last month in a similar response after 10 North Korean planes were seen on radar, though the incident also ended without further escalation.</p>
<p>Tensions have soared on the Korean Peninsula in recent months, with the North carrying out a record number of weapons tests this year &ndash; including an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launched into the sea earlier this week. Seoul, meanwhile, has carried out several rounds of live-fire military drills with the United States, including the ongoing &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; exercise, the largest air drill ever held between the two allies.</p>
<p>Pyongyang has repeatedly condemned the exercises as preparations for an attack, while Washington and the South say the DPRK has engaged in dangerous <em>&ldquo;provocations&rdquo;</em> with its retaliatory <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/565810-north-korea-more-missiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">missile and artillery demonstrations</a>.</p>

<p><strong></strong>The previously unannounced trip was confirmed by National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson, who <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/04/statement-by-nsc-spokesperson-adrienne-watson-on-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivans-visit-to-kyiv-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Sullivan spoke with Zelensky and other senior officials to <em>&ldquo;underscore the United States&rsquo; steadfast support to Ukraine and its people as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>President Zelensky&rsquo;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said Kiev <em>&ldquo;received confirmation of unwavering support for our victory&rdquo;</em> during Friday&rsquo;s meeting with Sullivan, adding <em>&ldquo;Our friends and partners are with us, they fully understand our situation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>On Thursday, the Ukrainian leader <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/3718594-coons-portman-visit-ukraine-to-underscore-broad-support-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">met with a pair of US senators</a>, Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Rob Portman, who Zelensky hailed as <em>&ldquo;true friends of Ukraine.&rdquo;</em> The lawmakers said they traveled to Kiev to <em>&ldquo;discuss Ukraine&rsquo;s needs&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;show American solidarity with the Ukrainian people.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Despite the apparent bipartisan support, some in Congress have criticized the massive amounts of aid approved for Ukraine this year, with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-donald-trump-humanitarian-assistance-congress-c47a255738cd13576aa4d238ec076f4a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warning</a> his party would not continue to write a <em>&ldquo;blank check&rdquo;</em> for Kiev if it wins a majority in the upcoming midterm election.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>In addition to humanitarian and financial assistance, Washington has approved just shy of $19 billion in direct military aid to Ukraine since President Joe Biden took office, the bulk of it authorized after Russia sent troops into the country in February. Though much of that support has yet to reach the battlefield, the Pentagon has vowed to send a <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/04/2003109432/-1/-1/0/UKRAINE-FACT-SHEET-NOV-4.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long list</a> of heavy and light weapons platforms, equipment, vehicles and ammunition.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Chinese-sponsored Confucius Institutes have been accused of being influence operations</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>British Minister for Security Tom Tugendhat, a member of the newly formed Rishi Sunak cabinet, recently responded to a question from anti-China MP Iain Duncan Smith regarding the future of China&rsquo;s Confucius Institutes (CI) in the UK. Smith, the biggest cheerleader of the anti-China agenda in the UK, has a reputation for asking such opportunistic, inflammatory questions in a bid to generate headlines and put items on the agenda.</p>
<p>Tugendhat responded to the question, saying the government &ldquo;<em><a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/23094268.rishi-sunak-looking-close-confucius-institutes-pose-threat-civil-liberties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is looking to close</a></em>&rdquo; all of the institutions. The news was widely acclaimed online, and the talking point was again pushed that Confucius Institutes, whose official state purpose is providing instruction in the Chinese language, are really a &lsquo;trojan horse&rsquo; project for political influence and &lsquo;propaganda&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Confucius Institutes have been subjected to a longstanding propaganda campaign originating from the US, and now a highly unpopular and brittle Rishi Sunak government eyes them as an easy kill to pacify the right-wing constituency and prove its credentials. Sunak may be the new prime minister, but he is but a legacy of two previous governments who were forced to step down in disgrace and disarray. He trails Labour by 30 points in most polls, pointing to a wipe-out for the Conservatives when the next general election comes.</p>

<p>Sunak&rsquo;s stance as Britain&rsquo;s first ethnic minority prime minister does not soften his outlook. Rather, it leaves him with something to prove. He is but one of a group of British Indians who, having made it to the highest levels of politics, have sought to buy legitimacy and support for themselves not by preaching tolerance, equality, and goodwill, but by hard-line right-wing nationalism. Just ask Priti Patel, or Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/01/bravermans-invasion-claim-not-backed-by-facts-say-experts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">described migrants as an <em>&ldquo;invasion&rdquo;</em></a> last week. They aim to be more British than the British themselves.</p>
<p>And when not bashing migrants, what more of an easy target is there than China? During his time as chancellor, Sunak seemed favourable to Beijing. However, since aiming to become the leader of the party, he has become increasingly sensitive to the idea of being &lsquo;soft&rsquo; on Beijing, and has sought to appeal to ultra-hawks with inflammatory and aggressive rhetoric towards China, even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/26/biden-and-sunak-vow-to-support-ukraine-and-counter-china-in-first-call" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on his first day</a> as prime minister. Through this, he has conjured up the proposal to close all Confucius Institutes. For his government, it is seen as an easy target because it is incredibly easy to demonize and spread paranoia, and few members of the public have an objective or informed understanding of what Confucius Institutes actually do, not least the core Conservative Party constituency, who will be the least likely to use them.</p>
<p>Confucius Institutes have been repeatedly accused of spreading <em>&ldquo;propaganda&rdquo;</em> and &ldquo;<em>stifling academic freedom</em>.&rdquo; These talking points are not, of course, serious, but stem from a campaign created by the US, which has sought to contain China by deliberately whipping up a McCarthyist climate to undermine engagement with the PRC. The institutes have been made into a grotesque bogeyman, transforming something as innocent and benign as Chinese language education into a massive, out-of-proportion threat. There is no serious evidence that any of these institutions have really pursued what they have been accused of, from &lsquo;propaganda&rsquo; to &lsquo;stifling academic freedom&rsquo; to even &lsquo;espionage&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The campaign against CI, not surprisingly, emerged in 2018-19, as did most anti-China talking points, including the propaganda against Huawei, Xinjiang, etc., and was pushed by US-sponsored think tanks and individuals. For example, one German Marshall Fund scholar told the BBC that Confucius Institutes collect &ldquo;<em>Military Intelligence.&rdquo;</em> US politicians likewise began to push them out of the US, including cutting government funding for universities which hosted them, and then designating them as <em>&ldquo;foreign missions.&rdquo;</em> Above all, the campaign against CI has been a staple of American propaganda, smear tactics, and alarmism, which brings great inconveniences to those simply trying to learn Chinese language and culture.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Sunak demonstrates his determination to continue the foreign policy set by his disgraced predecessors &ndash; that is, one based on ideology, nationalism, and &lsquo;post-truth&rsquo; politics, which runs contrary to Britain&rsquo;s national interests. The proposal to close Confucius Institutes for easy political points will harm Britain&rsquo;s educational and academic environment. This is opportunism by a broken, disfigured government that has mismanaged Britain in every way imaginable.</p>
<p>But finally, we should see that this saga shows how the propaganda campaign against China is so intense that even something as positive as a language class can be depicted in dishonest, threatening, and opportunistic ways. This speaks volumes not only about the US, but also about the circus that governs Britain.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The agency has been politicized, corrupting America’s top law enforcement entity, a GOP report has claimed</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>America is no longer a country where citizens are afforded equal justice under the law, as guaranteed by their Constitution, because the nation&rsquo;s top law enforcement agency has been corrupted by politicized leadership and a <em>&ldquo;woke, leftist agenda&rdquo;</em> being imposed from the top, Republican lawmakers have claimed.</p>
<p>The allegations were contained in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/605112786/Hjc-Staff-FBI-Report#download&amp;from_embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,050-page report</a> released on Friday by Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee. The report, which was based on information gathered from 14 FBI whistleblowers who came forward to expose a pattern of misconduct, argued that the agency was <em>&ldquo;rotted at its core.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Quite simply, the problem &mdash; the rot within the FBI &mdash; festers in and proceeds from Washington,&rdquo;</em> the report said. <em>&ldquo;The FBI and its parent agency, the Justice Department, have become political institutions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1588489830505525252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> detailed such abuses as a secret partnership in which the FBI receives private information on conservative users from Facebook, without seeking their consent or going though the legal processes that would normally be required to tap such data.</p>

<p>Whistleblowers also alleged that the FBI <em>&ldquo;looked the other way&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;after dozens of attacks against anti-abortion groups, even as the agency sent heavily armed teams of officers to arrest pro-life activists at their homes for alleged violations of selectively enforced crimes.</p>
<p>Parents who spoke out at school board meetings over controversial policies were targeted by investigators as alleged terrorists.</p>
<p>At the same time, former FBI official Timothy Thibault <em>&ldquo;shut down&rdquo;</em> a probe into the overseas business dealings of President Joe Biden&rsquo;s son, Hunter Biden, and attempted to keep the case from being reopened, the report said. Thibault openly displayed his political bias in social media posts that included his official title.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;America&rsquo;s not America if you have a Justice Department that treats people differently under the law,&rdquo;</em> Representative Jim Jordan, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News on Friday. <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s supposed to be equal treatment under the law. That&rsquo;s not happening, and we know it&rsquo;s not happening because 14 brave FBI agents came to us as whistleblowers and told us what exactly is going on here.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The report also accused the FBI of inflating statistics on domestic extremism to help fuel a narrative promoted by President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration. FBI employees who have conservative views are being purged from the agency, it claims.</p>

<p>Republicans argued that the FBI was plagued by a <em>&ldquo;systemic culture of unaccountability,&rdquo;</em> as well as &ldquo;<em>rampant corruption, manipulation and abuse.&rdquo;</em> The agency&rsquo;s shift toward <em>&ldquo;political meddling&rdquo;</em> has allegedly pulled resources away from legitimate law enforcement duties. For instance, one whistleblower claimed that he was told after the January 2021 US Capitol riot that child sex-abuse cases were <em>&ldquo;no longer an FBI priority and should be referred to local law enforcement agencies.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The US president wants to see “wind and solar” replace coal-fueled power plants</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Speaking at an event in California on Friday, US President Joe Biden said his government intended to shut down coal-fueled power plants <em>&ldquo;all across America&rdquo;</em> and replace them with wind- or solar-powered generators.</p>
<p>Biden was in San Diego as part of a West Coast trip to fundraise for Democrats ahead of next week&rsquo;s midterm elections. During a speech on Friday, the president reminisced about visiting a former coal power plant in Massachusetts, which had been repurposed to wind power generation. He said&nbsp;it had been done because to continue using coal was just too expensive &ndash; presumably due to the costs imposed by government regulations.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna be shutting these plants down all across America, and having wind and solar,&rdquo;</em> Biden told the audience.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Biden: “We’re gonna be shutting these [coal] plants down all across America, and having wind and solar.”<br><br> <a href="https://t.co/MGM2oYLRxm">pic.twitter.com/MGM2oYLRxm</a></p>&mdash; The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) <a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1588623447046823936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Biden&rsquo;s remarks came during an event at Viasat Inc., intended to highlight the <em>&ldquo;CHIPS and Science Act&rdquo;</em> his government enacted in August. The bill set aside around $280 billion for domestic microchip manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Biden&rsquo;s trip to the manufacturing facility is <em>&ldquo;aimed at bolstering support for Democrats, who face a real risk of losing their razor-thin majorities in the US Congress.&rdquo;</em> California is a Democrat stronghold with little chance of an upset in the upcoming midterms, however.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The president&rsquo;s promise of putting coal miners and power-plant workers out of jobs backfired almost instantly, with opposition Republicans <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1588622773534052352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing</a> the clip on Twitter and other social media platforms.</p>
<p>Biden has doubled down on the push to shut down industries that his government sees as contributing to global warming, pledging to cut US carbon emissions in half by 2030. This is proceeding regardless of his other stated goal of racial <em>&ldquo;equity.&rdquo;</em> Last month, Democrats running New Mexico closed down a coal mine and the nearby power plant, eliminating hundreds of jobs in the already impoverished Navajo country, AP <a href="https://www.daily-times.com/story/news/local/navajo-nation/2022/10/02/san-juan-county-communities-feel-the-impacts-of-coal-plant-closure/69533460007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The site, discovered on an island off the coast of the UAE, could predate the advent of Islam</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Archaeologists in the United Arab Emirates have unearthed the ruins of a Christian monastery on an island off the coast of the Umm al-Quwain emirate. Hidden for more than a millennium beneath a sand dune, the monastery may predate the rise of Islam across the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>The emirate&rsquo;s tourism and archaeology department announced the find on Thursday. Archaeologists discovered the remains of a church, a refectory (dining hall), cisterns, and cells for the monks where they spent time in solitude, <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/heritage/2022/11/03/ancient-christian-monastery-discovered-in-umm-al-quwain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The National</a>, a Dubai-based news site, reported.</p>
<p>Carbon dating on pottery excavated at the site revealed that it was occupied between the late sixth century and the middle of the eighth century.</p>
<p>The Prophet Mohammed was born in the late sixth century, and it would take until the mid-seventh century for the first Caliph, Abu Bakr, to bring the entire Arabian peninsula under Islamic rule. Prior to this first Islamic conquest, Arabia was home to Christians, Jews, and clans and tribes of pagan Arabs.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;It is an extremely rare discovery,&rdquo;</em> Professor Tim Power, an archaeologist at the UAE University who took part in the dig, told The National.<em> &ldquo;It is an important reminder of a lost chapter of Arab history.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Power explained that the monks probably weren&rsquo;t driven from the site by the forces of the Caliphate. Rather, <em>&ldquo;the place was slowly abandoned.&rdquo;</em> Christians and Muslims generally coexisted for around 300 years after the rise of Islam, he continued, adding that <em>&ldquo;there was no sign of devastation or violence or burning&rdquo;</em> at the monastery.</p>
<p>Instead, Power&rsquo;s team discovered glass chalices used for mixing wine, a cistern potentially used for baptisms, a kitchen and an oven used for baking communion bread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The monastery is the second such early Christian site discovered in the UAE. Archaeologists working on Sir Bani Yas Island off Abu Dhabi in 1990 discovered a Christian monastery dating from a similar period. Six ancient monasteries in total have been discovered along the shores of the Arabian Gulf.</p>

                            <p><strong>Slovakian officials respond as polls reveal half of the population trusts Moscow more than Washington</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Slovakian government has accused Russia of waging a <em>&ldquo;disinformation campaign&rdquo;</em> on Facebook and announced it would invest in artificial intelligence programs to help its Hybrid Threats division cope with social media narratives.</p>
<p>This comes as polls showed that 44% of Slovaks don&rsquo;t think Russia caused the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slovakia&rsquo;s Center for Countering Hybrid Threats &ndash; a subsidiary of the Finland-based European Centre of Excellence &ndash; is run from the Interior Ministry, which is charged with domestic law enforcement. The unit&rsquo;s director, Daniel Milo, told Bloomberg on Friday that the AI will <em>&ldquo;allow us to have a better overview of what is happening online and whether it is managed from abroad.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>According to Milo, pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian narratives on social media were at parity in February, when the current conflict in Ukraine escalated, <em>&ldquo;but in the course of a few months, the situation shifted.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Pro-Russian Facebook posts prevailed more and more. It is the result of this disinformation campaign, part of the population is indoctrinated by pro-Russian propaganda,&rdquo;</em> Milo said, adding that Slovaks are prone to believing in conspiracy theories.</p>

<p><strong></strong>A May survey&nbsp;by the Bratislava-based think-tank GLOBSEC, referenced in the article, showed that 51% of Slovaks blamed Russia for the conflict in Ukraine, while 28% said the West had provoked Russia, and 16% said it was Ukraine's fault for violating the rights of Russian-speaking residents. Bloomberg also referenced another survey that reportedly showed more Slovaks trust Russia over the US, Bratislava&rsquo;s NATO ally.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Slovakia has taken in thousands of refugees from neighboring Ukraine and sent Kiev military aid in the form of tanks&nbsp;and air defense missiles, even hinting at the possibility of delivering fighter jets.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Bratislava&rsquo;s apparent disdain for domestic dissenters resembles the attitude of the neighboring Czechs. After over 70,000 demonstrators marched against his policies in Prague at the start of September, Czech PM Petr Fiala said that <em>&ldquo;Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns are present on our territory and some people simply listen to them.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev&rsquo;s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and <em>&ldquo;create powerful armed forces.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>A German minister has called for a ‘crackdown’ on activists for disrupting the work of rescue services</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p></p>
<p><strong></strong>German Interior Minister Nancy Fraser has called for a police <em>&ldquo;crackdown&rdquo;</em> on climate activists who block roads as part of their protests after a female cyclist died in a traffic accident in Berlin while emergency services were stuck in a traffic jam caused by the protest.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Blocking escape routes puts lives at risk,&rdquo;</em> Fraser tweeted on Thursday. <em>&ldquo;The police have my full support for a crackdown.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She added that climate activists who break the law <em>&ldquo;must be prosecuted quickly and consequently.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;When crimes are committed and other people are endangered, then every limit of legitimate protest has been breached,&rdquo;</em> Fraser said. She was among several top officials who criticized the activists this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 44-year-old cyclist was run over by a concrete mixer truck on Monday. According to Berlin&rsquo;s fire department, the woman sustained life-threatening injuries and was trapped under the truck, while the arrival of an emergency vehicle was delayed for several minutes because of a traffic jam caused by climate activists who had glued themselves to a road sign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The woman was eventually transported to a hospital, where she died on Thursday evening. According to German media outlets, the police are investigating two members of the climate activist group &lsquo;Last Generation&rsquo; in connection to the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Newspaper S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung cited an internal report by the fire brigade on Friday, which stated that the rescue vehicle may have not been needed after all because the rescuers had found another safe way to pull the cyclist from underneath the truck.</p>
<p>Despite the tragedy, &lsquo;Last Generation&rsquo; vowed to continue with their protests, including those that disrupt traffic. <em>&ldquo;At the moment, we don&rsquo;t know what exactly happened. We only have the information that an emergency vehicle was stuck in a traffic jam. But we don&rsquo;t know for how long, or what role it played in the rescue,&rdquo;</em> the group&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Aimee van Baalen, told news website T-Online on Wednesday.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The revelation comes after Russia warned London about its level of involvement in the country</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>UK military-intelligence operatives are reportedly working to create and train a covert terrorist force in Ukraine assigned to attack Russian targets in Crimea on behalf of the Kiev government.</p>
<p>Working through a private British intelligence services firm called Prevail Partners, the operatives signed an agreement with the Odessa branch of the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) to build the so-called <em>&ldquo;partisan&rdquo;</em> terror army, <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2022/11/03/british-spies-terror-army-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Grayzone</a> reported on Thursday, citing leaked documents detailing the plans. The work is conducted in close coordination with the SSU and is possibly funded at least partly by Ukrainian oligarch Andrey Sadovoy, who is the mayor of Lviv and heads the country&rsquo;s TRK Lux media company.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Their plans called for the secret army to conduct sabotage and reconnaissance operations targeting Crimea &hellip; precisely the kind of attacks witnessed in past weeks,&rdquo;</em> The Grayzone wrote.</p>

<p>Moscow has accused London of being involved in "[the] training, preparation and [the] execution of plans against Russian infrastructure and the Russian fleet in [the] Black Sea [near Crimea]."</p>
<p>The UK was also allegedly implicated in the October 8 terrorist bombing that targeted the strategically-important Crimean Bridge. UK intelligence officials commissioned a study in April examining ways to blow up the bridge, The Grayzone reported last month.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/565883-russia-summons-uk-ambassador/"></a></p>
<p>Also last month, the Kremlin accused London of orchestrating the terrorist attack that damaged the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The UK Ministry of Defence replied that Moscow was <em>&ldquo;peddling false claims on an epic scale.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Prevail, the private intelligence firm, was founded by special forces veterans, including Royal Marine Brigadier Justin Hedges. Chris Donnelly, the same British Army intelligence operative who requested the Crimean Bridge study, was among the key figures who covertly lobbied for Prevail&rsquo;s Ukrainian partisan program, The Grayzone said.</p>

<p>Initial hurdles included funding sources for the initiative and the UK government&rsquo;s reluctance to let private contractors provide the training services, <em>&ldquo;perhaps out of fear they would be caught in the act or even prosecuted for engaging in such provocative activity,&rdquo;</em> the outlet reported. Some operatives raised concerns that Prevail initially pegged the annual cost at $600,000 per partisan fighter.</p>
<p>Training sites were lined up in Poland and Greece. Hedges said that if funding needed to be kept at arm&rsquo;s length from government sources, <em>&ldquo;donations&rdquo;</em> could be gathered through Rhizome Insights Ltd., an NGO front group for Prevail. He added that the firm was also in talks with Sadovoy&rsquo;s office about funding help.</p>

                            <p><strong>The billionaire met this week with lobbyists to promise the site’s moderation policies would stay for now</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Twitter owner Elon Musk has accused &ldquo;<em>activist groups</em>&rdquo; of &ldquo;<em>trying to destroy free speech in America</em>&rdquo; by pressuring advertisers to boycott his platform even though he hasn&rsquo;t changed any policies. The billionaire took to Twitter to complain about the &ldquo;<em>massive drop in revenue</em>&rdquo; on Friday.</p>
<p>The platform is losing money &ldquo;<em>due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists</em>,&rdquo; Musk tweeted, calling the situation &ldquo;<em>extremely messed up!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>They&rsquo;re trying to destroy free speech in America</em>,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Musk held a Zoom call on Tuesday with representatives from the Stop Hate for Profit Coalition, a pressure group led by the ADL that has organized advertiser boycotts of social media platforms over perceived weaknesses in keeping out &ldquo;<em>hate speech</em>.&rdquo; Representatives from the NAACP, Color of Change, the Asian American Foundation, and the George Bush Presidential Center were also reportedly present, among others.&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.<br><br>Extremely messed up!

<p>The coalition was able to secure all three of its &ldquo;<em>immediate requests</em>&rdquo; from the Tesla tycoon, according to multiple members and Musk himself.</p>
<p>He promised not to replatform banned accounts before the midterm election results were certified or before a &ldquo;<em>clear process</em>&rdquo; had been devised, and vowed to keep in place &ldquo;<em>election integrity</em>&rdquo; measures. Additionally, Musk agreed to form a &ldquo;<em>content moderation council</em>&rdquo; that would include representatives from the ADL and other coalition members with &ldquo;<em>diverse</em>&rdquo; viewpoints.</p>

<p>Despite appearing to bring the self-described &ldquo;<em>free speech absolutist</em>&rdquo; to heel, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt hinted that further controls might be necessary in a statement released following the call. He insisted &ldquo;<em>much more needs to be done to reduce lies and hate on Twitter</em>&rdquo; and said backtracking on previous progress was &ldquo;<em>not an option.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few Twitter users had suggestions for how Musk might deal with the pressure campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Name and shame the advertisers who are succumbing to the advertiser boycotts</em>,&rdquo; Mike Davis, co-founder of the Internet Accountability Project, <a href="https://twitter.com/mrddmia/status/1588557835792953345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, suggesting Musk&rsquo;s followers engage in a &ldquo;<em>counter-boycott</em>&rdquo; against them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than three quarters of 2.7 million respondents agreed that advertisers should support free speech over political correctness when polled by Musk on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Musk fired the board of directors and several high ranking executives upon taking over as CEO last week. However, he has attempted to reassure advertisers that the site would not become a &ldquo;<em>free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequence</em>&rdquo; under his watch.</p>]]>

            <p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin declared on Thursday that any nuclear attack against the US or its allies by North Korea <em>&ldquo;is unacceptable, and will lead to the end of the Kim regime.&rdquo;</em> With the US and South Korea holding military exercises, Pyongyang has launched hundreds of projectiles, including an intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>
<p>Austin delivered his warning in a joint communique with South Korean Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup, explaining that the US would defend South Korea <em>&ldquo;utilizing the full range of [its] defense capabilities, including nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities and advanced non-nuclear capabilities.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In the document, released after a meeting with Lee, Austin <em>&ldquo;noted that any nuclear attack against the United States or its Allies and partners, including the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons, is unacceptable and will result in the end of the Kim regime.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the US National Defense Strategy, published last week, states that Washington&rsquo;s strategy for North Korea recognizes <em>&ldquo;there is no scenario in which the Kim regime could employ nuclear weapons and survive.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The US and South Korean&nbsp;armed forces have been taking part in joint military exercises since Sunday, involving hundreds of aircraft and thousands of combat troops from both nations. North Korea views drills such as these as provocations, and preparations for invasion.</p>
<p>North Korea, which has stepped up its missile testing in recent months, responded to the exercises by firing around 100 artillery shells and six ballistic missiles into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan on Wednesday. The Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea also tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday morning, its first such test since 2017.</p>
<p>The US requested a meeting of the UN Security Council in response, and extended its ongoing military exercises beyond their scheduled end on Friday. Pyongyang called this an <em>&ldquo;awful mistake&rdquo;</em> and an <em>&ldquo;irresponsible decision.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The former president’s advisers are reportedly preparing to launch his new campaign on November 14</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Former president Donald Trump reportedly aims to announce his entry into the 2024 presidential race later this month, when he expects Republicans to be in a celebratory mood after retaking control of Congress in next week&rsquo;s midterm elections.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;inner circle&rdquo;</em> is targeting November 14 as the date to unveil his bid to retake the presidency, Axios reported on Friday, citing unidentified people familiar with the discussions. The planning talks have escalated to the point where Trump allies are reportedly marking off dates on their calendars and booking their travel arrangements.</p>
<p>The announcement will be followed by a series of political events to promote Trump&rsquo;s campaign, according to Axios. A Trump spokesman declined to comment on the plans. They still haven&rsquo;t been finalized and the timing could be pushed back based on the results of the congressional midterms, according to the media outlet.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have hinted in recent weeks that his 2024 campaign announcement is imminent, but they haven&rsquo;t publicly disclosed a date. His former campaign manager, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/565921-trump-2024-announcement-soon/">Kellyanne Conway</a>, told reporters that Trump had held back on launching his bid to avoid taking attention away from congressional candidates in the November 8 midterms. &ldquo;I think you can expect him to announce [it] soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The former president appeared to be setting the table for his 2024 announcement on Thursday night at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa. <em>&ldquo;In order to make our country successful and safe and glorious, I will very, very, very probably do it again, OK?&rdquo;</em> he told the cheering crowd. He added, <em>&ldquo;Get ready &ndash; that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m telling you &ndash; very soon. Get ready.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The US could be headed for a rematch of 2020&rsquo;s bitter presidential election, as President Joe Biden has indicated that he intends to seek re-election in 2024, though he hasn&rsquo;t formally announced his candidacy yet.</p>
<p>However, recent polls have shown that most voters don&rsquo;t want a sequel to the Trump-Biden slugfest. Only 26% of Americans want Biden to seek re-election, while only 27% want Trump to run again, according to a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/28/biden-trump-rematch-2024-suffolk-poll/10596438002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today/Suffolk University</a> poll that was released last week. Recent polls suggest that voters in at least two key swing states &ndash; Florida and Ohio &ndash; believe another Republican, Ron DeSantis, would have a better chance than Trump of winning the presidency in 2024.</p>

                            <p><strong>The US president’s remark about “freeing Iran” was merely “expressing solidarity” with protesters</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s comments about freeing Iran were not meant as a statement of policy but an expression of solidarity with anti-government protesters, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Friday. Biden&rsquo;s off-the-cuff remark at a Democrat fundraiser in California the evening before has already drawn condemnations from Tehran.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re going to free Iran. They&rsquo;re going to free themselves pretty soon,&rdquo;</em> Biden told those attending a party fundraiser at MiraCosta College near San Diego on Thursday.</p>
<p><strong></strong>He was <em>&ldquo;expressing our solidarity with the protesters,&rdquo;</em> Kirby told the White House press corps the following day, adding that any change of government in Tehran <em>&ldquo;has to be up to the people of Iran."</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Asked if Biden&rsquo;s comments reflected Washington&rsquo;s assessment that the Iranian government is near collapse, Kirby said <em>&ldquo;We have no indication of that.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Speaking on Friday, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi addressed Biden&rsquo;s remarks by referring to the 1979 Islamic revolution in Tehran, which overthrew the pro-US monarchy&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling Biden that Iran was freed 43 years ago,&rdquo;</em> said Raisi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Tehran has accused the US and its allies of instigating a wave of anti-government protests that started in mid-September, ostensibly over the death of a young woman in police custody.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said the White House <em>&ldquo;has increasingly promoted violence and terror in the recent riots,&rdquo;</em> calling on the US to <em>&ldquo;stop hypocritical behavior.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>This is not the first time Biden&rsquo;s aides have sought to <em>&ldquo;clarify&rdquo;</em> their boss&rsquo;s remarks. Speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin in March, Biden said <em>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, this man cannot remain in power,&rdquo;</em> which was widely interpreted as calling for regime change in Moscow &ndash; only for this to be <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/552810-us-denies-russia-regime-change-strategy/">denied</a> by the State Department and White House aides.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Within 48 hours, Biden <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/552867-biden-putin-regime-change/">himself said</a> he was &ldquo;<em>not walking anything back,&rdquo;</em> but was not <em>&ldquo;articulating a policy change,&rdquo;</em> only <em>&ldquo;expressing moral outrage that I feel,&rdquo;</em> and could not believe his words were taken seriously.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>With Britain entering negotiations to hand over its other imperial vestiges, Buenos Aires wants the Falklands back</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Argentine Foreign Ministry requested on Thursday that Britain comply with a UN resolution and resume talks on the sovereignty of the Malvinas (Falkland) Islands. The request came after London agreed to negotiate with Mauritius over the future of the Chagos Islands.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said on Thursday that the UK wants to <em>&ldquo;resolve all outstanding issues&rdquo;</em> with Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago, a British territory in the Indian Ocean since 1814 that remained under British control after Mauritius won its independence from the UK in 1968. Ignored by London for decades, a UN resolution compels Britain to reach a settlement with Mauritius over the islands.</p>
<p>Guillermo Carmona, an official at the Argentine Foreign Ministry, said that Britain&rsquo;s decision to enter talks with Mauritius marks <em>&ldquo;a transcendental day for all the peoples who fight to put an end to colonialism.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Carmona said that just as it is honoring the UN resolution on the Chagos Islands, Britain <em>&ldquo;must comply with resolution 2065 on the Malvinas Question.&rdquo;</em> The resolution in question calls on London and Buenos Aires to negotiate sovereignty over the islands, which are called the Malvinas by Argentina and the Falklands by the UK.</p>
<p>Britain has administered the islands since 1833, and won a war with Argentina over them in 1982. Argentina still claims sovereignty over the archipelago, however, arguing that it acquired them from Spain when it won its independence in 1816.</p>
<p>While Argentina issues regular calls to Britain to honor resolution 2065, the UK refuses. Britain insists that a 2013 referendum &ndash; in which nearly 100% of the islands&rsquo; 3,400 residents voted to remain a British overseas territory &ndash; renders negotiations pointless.</p>
<p>Friday marks the 40th anniversary of UN General Assembly resolution 37/9, which stated that <em>"the maintenance of colonial situations is incompatible with the ideal of universal peace of the United Nations,&rdquo;</em> and called on the UK and Argentina to <em>&ldquo;find a peaceful solution&rdquo;</em> to the Malvinas/Falklands dispute.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Voices in Kiev dismissed Marjorie Taylor Greene’s promise, arguing she does not represent her party's mainstream</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>If Republicans win back Congress in next week&rsquo;s midterm elections, &ldquo;<em>not another penny will go to Ukraine</em>,&rdquo; US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene told a rally in Sioux City, Iowa on Thursday, accusing the ruling Democratic Party of prioritizing the Ukrainian military over the lives of Americans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The only border they care about is Ukraine, not America&rsquo;s southern border</em>,&rdquo; Greene declared. &ldquo;<em>Our country comes first</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While polls indicate Republicans have a very real chance of taking back the House as well as the Senate, Ukrainian politicians did not seem worried by Greene&rsquo;s promises.</p>
<p>Sviatoslav Yurash, a member of President Vladimir Zelensky&rsquo;s Servant of the People Party, told Newsweek on Friday that Greene is &ldquo;<em>not a lead part of the Republican discussion</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The fact that there are extreme right and extreme left in America which have a different point of view is obvious because America is a democracy</em>,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;<em>As far as the mainstream perspective is concerned on both sides of the aisle, support for Ukraine is very clear</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Insisting Kiev was not asking for &ldquo;<em>limitless aid</em>,&rdquo; Yurash argued that the government was &ldquo;<em>very clear on the point of where [aid] is spent and we are very welcoming to any kind of oversight or missions coming to Ukraine to check and verify on the use of anything</em>.&rdquo; A&nbsp;recent attempt by Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) to include oversight provisions in a $40 billion aid bill, however, was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Greene is regularly pilloried as an extremist by Democrats for her outspoken opposition to hot-button issues like LGBT kids, gun control, and abortion. She was also one of just 57 representatives to oppose a bill providing $40 billion in aid to Kiev, arguing that only about a third of the weapons sent there actually make it to the front lines, a statistic confirmed by CBS News.</p>
<p>As of August, the US had sent over $54 billion in aid to Ukraine this year. Accompanying the latest announcement of $275 million in advanced weapons systems was an acknowledgement by the State Department that there was a &ldquo;<em>possibility that criminal and non-state actors may attempt to illicitly acquire weapons from sources in Ukraine</em>.&rdquo;</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The German chancellor says he doesn’t want to ‘decouple’ from Beijing, but still sees no problem with Washington calling the shots</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Defending his trip to China this week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-we-dont-want-to-decouple-from-china-but-cant-be-overreliant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that he doesn&rsquo;t want&nbsp;his country to <em>&ldquo;decouple&rdquo;</em> from Beijing.&nbsp;On the other hand, there&rsquo;s evidence that Berlin, like other Western allies, is facing mounting pressure from Washington to fall in line.</p>
<p>While Scholz is in China proclaiming the importance of trade with Beijing as the German economy suffers from the EU sanctioning gas supplies from Russia, he&rsquo;s also warning against over-reliance on China. What about being dictated to by Washington, though? Anything about that being a problem?</p>
<p>Right before Scholz set off on his trip, his foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, qualified China as an inevitable partner in a globalized world, but also <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-baerbock-warns-scholz-ahead-of-his-china-trip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> Der Spiegel that Beijing was <em>&ldquo;a competitor and increasingly a systemic rival.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;The same could be said of Washington, having encouraged the European Union to sanction itself into economic turmoil in the interests of sticking it to Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. Oddly, no word from Baerbock about the need to maintain adequate independence from the US, as it swoops in to replace the EU&rsquo;s Russian gas supply with American freedom molecules at two to four times the price of sale on the domestic US market, though.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Scholz isn&rsquo;t aware of the headache that the US is giving Europe as US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration pulls out all the stops in light of a looming recession. Scholz even met recently with French President Emmanuel Macron&nbsp;in Paris to discuss the need for both leaders to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-and-germany-find-ground-on-a-common-concern-u-s-protectionism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">counter US protectionism</a> and the unfair tilting of the global playing field through corporate tax and energy incentives at a time when European industry is struggling with crushing energy costs.</p>
<p>Scholz also faces <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a14c4ae4-c513-46c1-b427-23a5e046703b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal pressure</a> from Macron to stop shoveling hundreds of billions of euros in government aid to German companies at the risk of distorting the EU market.</p>
<p>But behind the photo-ops with Macron and light public posturing, the reality with respect to how much pushing and shoving Berlin is willing to tolerate from Washington seems much different.</p>
<p>Last month, China secured a stake in Germany&rsquo;s port of Hamburg. But, now, an American state department official has bragged to the Western press that China&rsquo;s share was reduced from 35% to 25% due to pressure from the American embassy. <em>&ldquo;The embassy was very clear that we strongly suggested that there&rsquo;d be no controlling interest by China, and as you see when they adjusted the deal, there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;</em> the official <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-strongly-suggested-there-be-no-controlling-interest-by-china-hamburg-port-2022-11-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the press</a>.</p>
<p>Washington is currently in the middle of a full-court press to convince its allies to isolate China, much like how it managed to talk Europe into cutting itself off from Russian energy &ldquo;for Ukraine&rdquo; &ndash; to America&rsquo;s ultimate economic and competitive gain. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like having the EU&rsquo;s economic engine increasingly dependent on the US for energy.</p>

<p>And Germany isn&rsquo;t the only ally being pressured to align with Washington&rsquo;s agenda. American officials are reportedly set to head to the Netherlands next week to talk about <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/U.S.-pushes-Japan-and-other-allies-to-join-China-chip-curbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocking the sale</a> of microchip components to China.</p>
<p>Japan is also being told to fall in line with new US export controls targeting China&rsquo;s chip-making industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada is citing national security to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/canada-orders-three-foreign-firms-divest-investments-critical-minerals-2022-11-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dump Chinese stakes</a> in three lithium mines. Canadian Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said that the country welcomes foreign direct investment, but not when it threatens <em>&ldquo;critical minerals supply chains,&rdquo;</em> which is exactly the kind of &ldquo;friendshoring&rdquo; &ndash; reducing supply chain participation to allies only &ndash; that Washington conjured up and announced over the summer with the implication that countries are either on Team Washington or else with Russia and China.</p>
<p>Once again, national security is being trotted out as a pretext to justify a policy of aggression &ndash; this time, in economic warfare rather than the military kind.</p>
<p>Whether Scholz is up to the task of standing up to Washington in the interests of defending Germany&rsquo;s own sovereignty remains to be seen.</p>
<p>There have already been hints of what could happen if he ever does. African countries, for example, were threatened by the US earlier this year with <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7311/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sanctions</a> for trading with Russia&nbsp;and China. Just a few days ago, Japan struck a blow to the Washington-led push to get G7 countries onboard with controlling the global price of Russian gas with a price cap when Tokyo announced that it was sticking with its stake in Russia&rsquo;s Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project &ndash; if only because its economy needed Russian fuel imports.</p>
<p>So the big question is: What&rsquo;s the US going to do about it? Punish Japan &ndash; or just let it slide?</p>
<p>If Scholz had done the same in defense of his own country&rsquo;s energy supply &ndash; specifically, of the Nord Stream pipeline network running from Russia straight into Germany &ndash; if it had, say, threatened to kick the US out of military bases in Germany if it gave Berlin any grief, that would not only be a definite show of backbone, but would also have put him in a much better position to call the shots today.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The country won its freedom 43 years ago, President Ebrahim Raisi said</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>In a televised speech on Friday, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi dismissed US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s promise to <em>&ldquo;free Iran,&rdquo;</em> telling his American counterpart that the country secured its freedom when the pro-Western Shah was deposed in 1979. Tehran has accused the US and its allies of instigating a wave of anti-government protests in recent months.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo;</em> Biden told supporters at a rally in California on Thursday, <em>&ldquo;we&rsquo;re gonna free Iran. They&rsquo;re gonna free themselves pretty soon.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Biden did not elaborate on what the US would do to <em>&ldquo;free Iran,&rdquo;</em> but the White House and lawmakers from both parties in Washington have previously made statements in support of anti-government demonstrations in Iran, and the US has imposed two rounds of sanctions on the Iranian government in response. The protests broke out after a 22-year-old woman died in police custody following her arrest for wearing an <em>&ldquo;improper&rdquo;</em> hijab.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling Biden that Iran was freed 43 years ago,&rdquo;</em> Raisi declared, addressing Biden&rsquo;s comments. He referred to the revolution that ousted the American-backed Shah and led to the formation of the country&rsquo;s current Islamist government.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian called on Biden to <em>&ldquo;stop [his] hypocritical behavior.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>"The White House has increasingly promoted violence and terror in the recent riots in Iran, while at the same time it is trying to reach a nuclear agreement,&rdquo;</em> he wrote on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iranian officials have accused the US, as well as Saudi Arabia and Israel, of fomenting the ongoing protests and riots. Raisi has claimed that <em>&ldquo;these riots pave the ground for terrorist attacks,&rdquo;</em> referring to a mass shooting at a shrine last week that left 15 people dead.</p>]]>

            <p>The number of Germans who agree with Russia&rsquo;s position on the root causes of the Ukraine conflict has risen over the past several months, a recently published study reveals. The researchers categorically dismissed Moscow&rsquo;s version of events as &ldquo;<em>propaganda</em>&rdquo; and called on the German government to take action to counter it.</p>
<p>Published on Wednesday and titled &lsquo;Endurance test for democracy: Pro-Russian conspiracy narratives and belief in disinformation in society&rsquo;, the paper is based on opinion polls conducted at intervals of several months.</p>
<p>According to the report, 19% of respondents agreed with the statement that Russia had no choice but to attack Ukraine in response to NATO provocations; 21% partly supported this notion. In April, the figures stood at 12% and 17% respectively, the study says.</p>

<p>People living in eastern regions which comprised the former German Democratic Republic tend to show more understanding toward Moscow, the report indicates. The number of people who believe that NATO provoked Russia into the conflict is said to be nearly twice as high there compared to western Germany.</p>
<p>The researchers noted that supporters of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AFD) party are far more likely to espouse such views than the general population. Similarly, those at the opposite end of the political spectrum from the Left party also display more acceptance of Russia&rsquo;s positions.</p>
<p>NATO&rsquo;s expansion and its attempts to drag Ukraine into its sphere of control were cited by Russian President Vladimir Putin as one of the reasons for launching the military operation. The Kremlin argued that it had repeatedly tried to convey its national security concerns to the West, but they invariably fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Senior Ukrainian officials have acknowledged that Kiev has not given up on the idea of joining the alliance, and that NATO has played a key role in strengthening the Ukrainian military.</p>
<p>The authors of the study dismissed any narratives that are in line with Moscow&rsquo;s views as &ldquo;<em>disinformation</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>propaganda.</em>&rdquo; They claimed, however, that these ideas are &ldquo;<em>gaining ground among the German population in horrifying proportions.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>They concluded by calling on the government to do more to counter the spread of what they consider to be &lsquo;disinformation&rsquo;, which the paper described as an &ldquo;<em>attack on democracy as such.</em>&rdquo;</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>France’s National Assembly briefly descended into chaos after an MP shouted “They should go back to Africa!”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A session of the French parliament was suspended on Thursday after a legislator was accused of hurling a &ldquo;racist&rdquo; insult at a fellow MP during a debate on migration.</p>
<p>The incident took place when Carlos Martens Bilongo, an MP from the left-wing La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party whose parents are of Congolese and Angolan origin, was delivering a speech on behalf of an NGO that aids migrants arriving in Europe. He asked the government to help find a port for the 234 people recently rescued at sea.</p>
<p>Gregoire de Fournas, a newly elected legislator from the conservative National Rally (RN) party, interrupted the speech by shouting: <em>&ldquo;They should go back to Africa!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The heckle immediately led to an uproar, with several other MPs angrily yelling at de Fournas, after which the speaker, Yael Braun-Privet, suspended the session.</p>
<p>According to France 24 news channel, it could be believed that de Fournas was addressing Bilongo directly, because in French, the pronouns &lsquo;he&rsquo; and &lsquo;they&rsquo; are pronounced the same.</p>
<p>Many politicians condemned the conservative MP, whose party is known for its anti-migrant stance. <em>&ldquo;Racism has no place in our democracy,&rdquo;</em> Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said.</p>

<p>Bilongo also accused de Fournas of racism. <em>&ldquo;Today in the parliament chamber, he insulted me personally. He insulted millions of French people who look like me,&rdquo;</em> he told France Info radio.</p>
<p>De Fournas denied that he insulted Bilongo and accused his party of <em>&ldquo;manipulation.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;They are trying to distort my words, to make me look as if I was making disgusting comments towards a fellow MP who has the same legitimacy to sit in these benches as I do,&rdquo;</em> he told reporters, adding that he was specifically calling for migrants who cross the Mediterranean Sea by boat to be returned home rather than be allowed to land in France.</p>
<p>The RN, formerly known as the National Front and led by Marine Le Pen between 2011 and 2021, won 89 seats in the country&rsquo;s 577-seat National Assembly in June, marking the biggest victory in the party&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>In April, Le Pen lost to Emmanuel Macron in a presidential runoff election, receiving 41.45% of the votes to 58.55%.</p>]]>

            <p>Amazon and two other major US tech companies are the latest big names in corporate America to sound the economic alarm, announcing job cuts and other cost-control measures as they brace for <em>&ldquo;leaner times.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Ride-hailing giant Lyft Inc. revealed on Thursday that it will slash its staffing by 13%, eliminating about 700 jobs. Stripe Inc., a major payments processor, announced a 14% reduction in its workforce, putting around 1,000 people out of work. Amazon, the world&rsquo;s largest retailer, told employees that it&rsquo;s freezing corporate hiring for at least the next few months.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are facing stubborn inflation, energy shocks, higher interest rates, reduced investment budgets and sparser startup funding,&rdquo;</em> Stripe co-founders Patrick and John Collison said in a note to employees.&nbsp;The company underestimated the impact of a broad economic slowdown, they added, and now must cut costs <em>&ldquo;to adapt ourselves to the world we&rsquo;re headed into.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Many parts of the developed world appear to be headed for recession. We think that 2022 represents the beginning of a different economic climate.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lyft offered a similar explanation to its staffers, saying that it must become leaner to cope with a <em>&ldquo;probable recession&rdquo;</em> and rising insurance costs. <em>&ldquo;We worked hard to bring down costs this summer,&rdquo;</em> co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer said, adding that job cuts became necessary after an earlier hiring freeze and other steps failed to tighten expenses enough.</p>
<p>Amazon cited economic uncertainty in announcing its hiring freeze. <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re facing an unusual macroeconomic environment and want to balance our hiring and investments with being thoughtful about this economy,&rdquo;</em> Beth Galetti, senior vice president for people experience and technology, told employees. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has taken other steps in recent months to cut costs, such as closing call centers, discontinuing a tele-health service, and canceling or delaying new warehouse construction.</p>

<p>The latest Big Tech belt-tightening follows job cut announcements in recent weeks by companies such as Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. Like Amazon, Google and Apple Inc. have announced hiring freezes. Billionaire Elon Musk plans to fire nearly half of the 7,500 employees at Twitter after completing his $44 billion takeover of the social media platform last week, according to a Bloomberg report.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with US midterm congressional elections approaching next week, President Joe Biden and members of his administration have denied that the nation&rsquo;s economy is slumping. Biden, in fact, called the US economy <em>&ldquo;strong as hell.&rdquo;</em> Even as Thursday brought more announcements of job cuts, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the strength of the US labor market is <em>&ldquo;just not consistent with a recession, or with even a pre-recession. We believe our economy is incredibly resilient.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>The Foreign Ministry denounced the trip as a “farcical political stunt”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>China has condemned a recent trip to Taipei by lawmakers from several European nations and the EU itself, insisting all foreign efforts to assist <em>&ldquo;Taiwan independence&rdquo;</em> are <em>&ldquo;doomed to fail.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Meeting with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Thursday, the delegation included officials from Britain, Ukraine, Belgium, Germany, the Czech Republic, Kosovo, the Netherlands, and the European Parliament. Two of the lawmakers are currently <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/china-taiwan-eu-lawmakers-sanctioned-by-beijing-are-due-to-visit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">under sanctions</a> by Beijing in retaliation for previous EU measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Asked about the visit during a Thursday <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202211/t20221103_10800030.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press conference</a>, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian claimed the lawmakers in question <em>&ldquo;have often deliberately hyped up issues and spread falsehoods and rumors against China.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;They have little credibility to speak of and are not worth taking up your attention. The farcical political stunt of these few MPs will lead nowhere but only invite disgrace,&rdquo;</em> Zhao said, adding <em>&ldquo;a word of advice&rdquo;</em> to Taiwan&rsquo;s ruling Democratic Progressive Party: <em>&ldquo;to collude with external forces and seek &lsquo;Taiwan independence&rsquo; is doomed to fail.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>During the sit-down with Taiwan&rsquo;s leader, Ukrainian lawmaker Nikolay Kniazhitsky gifted Tsai a traditional shirt, and also gave Foreign Minister Joseph Wu a pair of boxing gloves signed by former champion fighters Vitali and Vladimir Klitschko. Wu later <a href="https://twitter.com/MOFA_Taiwan/status/1588062761463914496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thanked</a> the official for <em>&ldquo;passing on the fighting spirit of Ukraine to Taiwan,&rdquo;</em> while Tsai <a href="https://twitter.com/iingwen/status/1588140022519451650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> she had a <em>&ldquo;productive meeting&rdquo;</em> with the lawmakers.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The officials are part of the <a href="https://ipac.global/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China</a> (IPAC), a body established in 2020 to form a <em>&ldquo;coherent response to the rise of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China,&rdquo;</em> which it has deemed a <em>&ldquo;defining challenge for the world&rsquo;s democratic states.&rdquo;</em> This week&rsquo;s trip marked its first formal delegation to Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Just as the IPAC visit concluded, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was set to depart for his own trip to Beijing alongside a number of high-profile business executives. Though a German lawmaker was part of the latest junket to Taiwan, Zhao nonetheless expressed hope that Scholz&rsquo;s first trip as chancellor would be a success, noting that <em>&ldquo;China and Germany are comprehensive strategic partners.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>While Taiwan has been self-governed since nationalist forces fled to the island following the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Beijing considers it to be part of its sovereign territory. The Chinese government has stated that it seeks peaceful reunification with Taiwan, but ultimately claims the right to use force to reclaim the island.</p>

                            <p><strong>The husband of the US House speaker was treated for skull fractures after a brutal hammer attack</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Paul Pelosi has been discharged from the hospital nearly a week after an intruder broke into his home and attacked him with a hammer, delivering blows to his head, hands, and arm. The 82-year-old is now recovering at home after undergoing surgery.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Paul remains under doctors&rsquo; care as he continues to progress on a long recovery process and convalescence,&rdquo;</em> the office of his wife, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said in a <a href="https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/11322-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> on Thursday. <em>&ldquo;He is now home surrounded by his family who request privacy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>The elderly man came under <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/565522-pelosi-speaker-home-attacked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attack</a> last Friday after David DePape, 42, entered the Pelosis&rsquo; San Francisco residence searching for the House speaker, according to the FBI. Investigators say DePape planned to take the lawmaker hostage, but ultimately assaulted her husband when he did not find her, as she was in Washington, DC at the time.</p>

<p>Police recovered plastic zip ties, rope, a roll of tape, a hammer, and multiple types of gloves from the scene, and DePape <a href="https://archive.ph/WuCiM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> told responding officers that he was on a <em>&ldquo;suicide mission&rdquo;</em> to kidnap the House speaker. Despite repeatedly striking Paul Pelosi in the head with a hammer, he also claimed he <em>&ldquo;didn't really want to hurt&rdquo;</em> the man.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The attack left Pelosi with a fractured skull, for which he required surgery, as well as injuries to his right arm and both of his hands. He managed to speak to police before he was brought to the hospital, however, saying DePape appeared in his bedroom around 2:30am demanding to speak with his wife. Pelosi was able to call 911 after the break-in, but was found struggling with the suspect when officers arrived.</p>
<p><strong></strong>DePape now faces a series of state and federal charges, including attempted murder, attempted kidnapping, and an assault on the family member of a US official, according to prosecutors. The Department of Homeland Security has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/politics/david-depape-paul-pelosi-attack/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> reports that DePape, a Canadian national, had been in the country illegally for several years, though his immigration status is unlikely to affect his current case, as deportations typically only occur after criminal matters are resolved.</p>
<p><strong></strong>DePape entered a not guilty plea for all state-level charges during a hearing on Tuesday, but has yet to appear in federal court.</p>]]>

            <p>The&nbsp;US has asked for a meeting at the United Nations Security Council to discuss a series of recent missile launches by North Korea, including an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fired over the sea on Thursday morning.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Washington is seeking to meet publicly by Friday, UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield <a href="https://usun.usmission.gov/ambassador-linda-thomas-greenfields-interview-with-andrea-mitchell-of-msnbcs-andrea-mitchell-reports-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> MSNBC, accusing North Korea of violating <em>&ldquo;multiple&rdquo;</em> Security Council resolutions prohibiting missile tests.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We really do need to ramp up our efforts so that the DPRK gets the message that what they are doing is unacceptable. We will be having a Security Council meeting tomorrow to bring this before the entire council,&rdquo;</em> Thomas-Greenfield said on Thursday. <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re working closely with our Japanese and Republic of Korea colleagues also to ensure that the DPRK does not think that this is something that is acceptable.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Several other Security Council members have already backed the US request, including France, Britain, Norway, Ireland, and Albania, multiple unnamed diplomats <a href="https://archive.ph/gweTl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> Reuters.</p>

<p>Pyongyang unleashed around 100 artillery shells and at least six missiles into the sea on Wednesday as a show of force to protest the ongoing military exercises by the US and South Korea. It followed up that demonstration with an ICBM test on Thursday morning, its first since May, prompting a stern warning from the Pentagon.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Any nuclear attack against the United States or its allies and partners, including the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons, is unacceptable and will result in the end of the Kim [Jong-un] regime,&rdquo;</em> US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3209105/54th-security-consultative-meeting-joint-communique/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> during a meeting with his South Korean counterpart on Thursday.</p>
<p><strong></strong>North Korea has repeatedly condemned the joint military drills of Washington and Seoul, deeming them preparations for an attack, and has been particularly vocal about this week&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; aerial exercises. US and South Korean officials have agreed to extend the drills past Friday in response to <em>&ldquo;recent provocations&rdquo;</em> by Pyongyang, which denounced the move as an <em>&ldquo;awful mistake&rdquo;</em> and an <em>&ldquo;irresponsible decision.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Though the Security Council <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-china-japan-north-korea-c2814192ae7890d7cf08cbed76845336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">met last month</a> to discuss North Korea&rsquo;s record number of missile launches this year, the body was divided on how to proceed. Some members, including Russia and China, argued that US-led military exercises were inflaming tensions in the region and provoking reactions from Pyongyang, with Beijing&rsquo;s deputy envoy urging Washington to take a less hostile approach.</p>

                            <p><strong>Israel was Washington's only supporter in 30th vote in 30 years denouncing the blockade of Cuba</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The United Nations General Assembly has overwhelmingly voted in favor of a resolution condemning the US embargo on Cuba for the 30th year in a row. Only the US and Israel voted against the measure on Thursday, while Ukraine and Brazil abstained.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Since 2019, the US has &ldquo;<em>escalated the siege around our country, taking it to an even crueler and more humane [sic] dimension, with the purpose of deliberately inflicting the biggest possible damage on Cuban families</em>,&rdquo; Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez told the assembled representatives.</p>
<p>The diplomat slammed US President Joe Biden for continuing the &ldquo;<em>maximum pressure</em>&rdquo; policy of his predecessor Donald Trump rather than resuming the trend toward warming relations Barack Obama set in motion during his last year in office.</p>

<p>While acknowledging the Biden administration had made some extremely limited moves to open up flights, remittances, and consular services with Cuba, Rodriguez argued that &ldquo;<em>the blockade, which has been tightened to the extreme, continues to be the central element that defines the US-Cuba policy</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Biden has been in office, the embargo has cost the Cuban economy an estimated $6.35 billion, Rodriguez said &ndash; a figure that translates to more than $15 million per day. While he stressed he did not blame the US for all of Cuba&rsquo;s problems, denying its influence as &ldquo;<em>the main cause of the deprivations, scarcities and hardships suffered by Cuban families would be failing to tell the truth</em>,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>The US abstained from a vote condemning the embargo for the first time in 2016, shortly after Obama restored official relations with the island. However, Trump resumed previous presidents&rsquo; efforts to isolate the socialist nation. Washington imposed the embargo in 1960 after Fidel Castro&rsquo;s revolution overthrew the US-friendly Batista government and nationalized properties belonging to American citizens.</p>
<p>Both the Trump and Biden administrations have held up &ldquo;<em>human rights</em>&rdquo; to justify decades of economic strangulation, an argument Cuba&rsquo;s deputy UN ambassador, Yuri Gala, dismissed as illogical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>If the United States government really did care for the well-being, human rights and self-determination of the Cuban people, it could lift the embargo</em>,&rdquo; he said, adding that Washington could lift the economic restrictions currently choking off economic opportunities for would-be capitalists.</p>

<p>Instead, Rodriguez argued, the US was weaponizing Big Tech and media &ldquo;<em>in a virulent disinformation and disparagement campaign against Cuba &hellip; using our children, youths and artists as the targets of this political and media bombardment.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Washington imposed further sanctions on Cuba last year, condemning the police response to an outbreak of protests that began with outcry over food and drug shortages and morphed &ndash; with the US&rsquo; help, according to Havana &ndash; into violent anti-government demonstrations.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The Netherlands is expected to set up a multimillion ‘awareness fund’ as part of its history recognition campaign</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Dutch government plans to issue a formal apology next month for its historical involvement with the slave trade, the RTL news website reported on Thursday, citing sources.</p>
<p>According to the outlet, the government also intends to set up a &euro;200 million &lsquo;slavery awareness fund&rsquo; which will finance the relevant projects and dedicated school programs. Additional &euro;27 million will be allocated to create a slavery museum, RTL&rsquo;s sources said.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s move will constitute a formal response to a report last year by the Dialogue Group on Slavery History. The commission, which was set up by the Interior Ministry, recommended that Prime Minister Mark Rutte should recognize and apologize for past slavery.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;On the one hand, recognition will give satisfaction to those who suffered under slavery, and on the other hand, it will promote a critical view of Dutch history in a broader sense,&rdquo;</em> the group said at the time.<strong><br /></strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>The formal apology, which is not expected until mid-December, will reportedly be supported by most MPs, while key parliamentary parties have already called on the government to take a stand.</p>
<p>In July, 2021, the mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, officially apologized for <em>&ldquo;the active involvement&rdquo;</em> of the city<em> &ldquo;in the commercial system of colonial slavery.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the Netherlands maintained colonies in the regions known today as Indonesia, South Africa, Cura&ccedil;ao and New Guinea. It was one of the last countries to abolish slavery, doing so in 1863 in its main colony of Surinam in South America. The year 2023 will mark 150 years since the Netherlands freed tens of thousands slaves there and on the Dutch Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>In September, during a short official visit to Surinam, PM Rutte said that<em> &ldquo;the time is right&rdquo;</em> for the recognition of slavery.&nbsp;</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin insisted on an “ironclad” US commitment to defending Seoul</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US does not plan to permanently base &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; weapons systems in South Korea at this time, but will evaluate that position in consultation with Seoul and Tokyo in order to deter any attack from North Korea, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday.</p>
<p><strong></strong>In a brief press conference after his meeting with South Korean Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup, Austin mentioned a recent arrival of US <em>&ldquo;strategic assets&rdquo;</em> to the peninsula, prompting a question from CNN.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a plan to change our permanent positioning or stationing of assets on the peninsula, currently,&rdquo;</em> Austin replied, before rephrasing. <em>&ldquo;No new deployment of strategic assets on a permanent basis, but you&rsquo;ll see assets move in and out on a routine basis.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>A number of 5th-generation fighters &ndash; the troubled F-35s &ndash; were recently deployed to the peninsula. They are taking part in &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; joint drills, which Austin called <em>&ldquo;one of the largest exercises &hellip; in recent history,&rdquo;</em> involving over 240 aircraft.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Lee made it clear that Seoul&rsquo;s policy on de-nuclearization had not changed, and therefore his government was currently not requesting the US to redeploy its tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula.</p>

<p>North Korea <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/565810-north-korea-more-missiles/">fired</a> around 100 artillery shells and six more missiles into the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan on Wednesday, and tested an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Thursday morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Pyongyang has criticized Seoul and Washington for extending the &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; air drills, calling it an <em>&ldquo;awful mistake.&rdquo;</em> DPRK has repeatedly condemned the exercise as a rehearsal for an invasion of North Korea. The annual joint exercise had been put on hold in 2018, when North Korea and the US opened peace talks, but resumed on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Speaking on Thursday, Austin insisted the US alliance with South Korea was <em>&ldquo;ironclad&rdquo;</em> and that Washington was <em>&ldquo;fully committed&rdquo;</em> to defending Seoul &ndash; and other allies in the <em>&ldquo;Indo-Pacific&rdquo;</em> &ndash; with <em>&ldquo;the full range of our nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised the ex-president “for not stepping in the way of the midterm candidates”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Donald Trump is expected to announce&nbsp;his entry to the 2024 race for the White House <em>&ldquo;soon,&rdquo;</em> his ex-campaign manager and consultant, Kellyanne Conway, told reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking at a breakfast event in Washington, Conway said that Trump&rsquo;s refusal to commit to the race already was aimed at giving Republicans space to campaign for next week&rsquo;s midterm elections.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I give him a ton of credit for not announcing this year, for not stepping in the way of the midterm candidates,&rdquo;</em> she said, claiming that <em>&ldquo;a lot of people around&rdquo;</em> Trump may have been pushing him to declare his candidacy.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think you can expect him to announce soon,&rdquo;</em> Conway added.</p>

<p>Trump, who considers President Joe Biden&rsquo;s 2020 victory fraudulent, has spent the year campaigning for Republican candidates, wading into primary races to boost contenders espousing his <em>&ldquo;America First&rdquo;</em> brand of populism. As the midterms draw nearer, Trump has planned campaign-style rallies in the battleground states of Iowa, Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Donald Trump has never stopped campaigning,&rdquo;</em> Conway said. <em>&ldquo;As he would say: wait and see.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Trump himself has repeatedly dropped hints that he intends to run for office again, telling supporters that they will<em> &ldquo;be very happy&rdquo;</em> with his decision. <em>&ldquo;I ran twice. I won twice&hellip;I will probably have to do it again,&rdquo;</em> he said at a rally in Texas last month.</p>

<p>Conway&rsquo;s statement came on the same day that three of Trump&rsquo;s former advisers told Reuters that they expect an announcement shortly after the midterms. One of these advisers stated that Trump would enter the race between the elections and Thanksgiving, which falls on November 24.</p>
<p>Republicans hold a three-point advantage over Democrats heading into the midterms, according to an average of 17 polls compiled by <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2022-generic-congressional-vote-7361.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Clear Politics</a>. Looking forward to 2024, polling over the last month generally shows Trump and Biden within six points of each other. A Wall Street Journal survey published on Tuesday showed the two tied at 46%.</p>

                            <p><strong>Father Sean Sheehy has been condemned by his own bishop for giving a homily against abortion, homosexuality, and transgenderism</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>An Irish Catholic priest has refused to back down after he was censured by his own bishop for condemning the <em>&ldquo;mortal sins&rdquo;</em> of abortion and homosexuality. The priest maintains that his views are in line with the Church&rsquo;s teachings, and that Ireland&rsquo;s deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar, will burn in hell for being gay.</p>
<p>Father Sean Sheehy, a resident of Listowel in County Kerry, came out of retirement on Sunday to fill in for a local priest currently on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Churchgoers were shocked, with several dozen walking out of mass, when Sheehy took to the pulpit to denounce the <em>&ldquo;rampant&rdquo;</em> sin in Irish society.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What is so sad today is you rarely hear about sin, but it&rsquo;s rampant,&rdquo;</em> he declared.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We see it, for example, in the legislation of our governments,&rdquo;</em> Sheehy continued. <em>&ldquo;We see it in the promotion of abortion. We see it in the example of this lunatic approach of transgenderism. We see it, for example, in the promotion of sex between two men and two women.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That is sinful, that is mortal sin,&rdquo;</em> he continued, adding that <em>&ldquo;sin leads to hell.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#39;Sin leads to hell&#39; <br><br>This sermon led to an apology from the Bishop of Kerry <br><br>What are your thoughts? <a href="https://t.co/pBXVtjb5PG">pic.twitter.com/pBXVtjb5PG</a></p>&mdash; Catholic Arena (@CatholicArena) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatholicArena/status/1587451912676413440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Once a staunchly Catholic society, Ireland legalized gay marriage in 2015 and lifted its constitutional ban on abortion in 2018. Both decisions were made following popular referendums.</p>
<p>Bishop Ray Browne of Kerry later apologized <em>&ldquo;to all who were offended&rdquo;</em> by Sheehy&rsquo;s fiery homily. In a statement published on the diocesan website, Browne said that Sheehy&rsquo;s views <em>&ldquo;do not represent the Christian position.&rdquo;</em> Browne later told Radio Kerry that Sheehy had been banned from giving mass in the diocese.</p>

<p>In an interview with the same radio station on Tuesday, Sheehy insisted that he did nothing wrong, and that his views on sin were in line with the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Speaking to RTE Radio on Wednesday, Sheehy said that gay politicians like Varadkar would <em>&ldquo;absolutely&rdquo;</em> go to hell if they didn&rsquo;t repent.</p>
<p>Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney called on Sheehy to retract his remarks, while a spokesperson for Varadkar said that although the deputy PM <em>&ldquo;profoundly disagrees with Father Sheehy's views&rdquo;</em> he <em>&ldquo;respects his right to express his religious beliefs freely.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Catechism of the Catholic Church, which summarizes the Church&rsquo;s main beliefs, describes homosexual acts as <em>&ldquo;acts of grave depravity&rdquo;</em> that run <em>&ldquo;contrary to the natural law.&rdquo;</em> The book states that gay people <em>&ldquo;must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity,&rdquo;</em> but urged to suppress their desires.&nbsp;</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Institutions in Germany and Sweden have reportedly taken steps to increase security, such as banning bags and jackets</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Following a rash of widely publicized attacks by climate change protesters on iconic artworks such as Van Gogh&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sunflowers&rsquo; and Monet&rsquo;s &lsquo;Les Meules&rsquo;, museums have begun tightening security, Swedish broadcaster SVT reported on Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some museums in Germany have adopted bans on bags and jackets inside, according to the Swedish outlet TT, while France&rsquo;s famous Centre Pompidou and Spain&rsquo;s Prado Museum have also reportedly increased security in response to attacks by green campaigners affiliated with the group Just Stop Oil and its offshoots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patrik Steorn, director of the Gothenburg Museum of Art, revealed to SVT that the Swedish gallery had also upped its security, though he declined to explain exactly how. Steorn acknowledged it was &ldquo;<em>a little difficult to understand why our common cultural heritage should be exposed to</em>&rdquo; protests such as Just Stop Oil&rsquo;s stunts, which often leave protesters, artworks, or both, covered in glue or food.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>We would much rather see social movements and museums try to join hands to raise awareness of climate issues together</em>,&rdquo; he said. Four other Swedish museums declined to respond to the outlet&rsquo;s questions regarding securing their exhibits against unruly demonstrators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just Stop Oil campaigners have thus far had little difficulty getting close to priceless paintings to douse them in canned food, often concealing their tell-tale t-shirts beneath sweatshirts and jackets. Security guards at the Netherlands&rsquo; Maritshuis museum did not intervene to stop a well-known climate activist with the group from gluing his head to Vermeer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Girl with a Pearl Earring&rsquo; last week even as he set off the alarm on the painting, and waited patiently for him to finish his prepared statement before attempting to remove him from the artwork.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>That museum allows visitors to carry only &ldquo;<em>a small handbag</em>&rdquo; inside but has been reluctant to search anyone, with a spokesperson telling The Guardian that one &ldquo;<em>can never 100% prevent protest actions</em>.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members of the group descended on the British PM&rsquo;s residence at 10 Downing earlier this week for one last protest before announcing a temporary moratorium on actions in order to give governments time to consider its proposal to ban all new oil and gas projects. Just Stop Oil is funded by oil heiress turned climate crusader Aileen Getty, whose Climate Emergency Fund also backs climate campaigners Extinction Rebellion.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Ron Klain said that the president was losing patience with Republicans who doubted his election victory</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain stated on Thursday that US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s pre-midterm speech was intended as <em>&ldquo;one final warning&rdquo;</em> to so-called <em>&ldquo;election deniers,&rdquo;</em> meaning Republicans pushing for tighter voting laws or questioning the legitimacy of his 2020 victory.</p>
<p>In a prime-time address from Union Station in Washington, DC, Biden claimed on Wednesday that <em>&ldquo;democracy is under threat&rdquo;</em> from Republican candidates on the ballot next week, 300 of whom he called <em>&ldquo;election deniers.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think the president decided a few days ago it was important to issue one final warning on this issue,&rdquo;</em> Klain told MSNBC. He added that the president aimed to <em>&ldquo;leave no doubt that we have people out there still peddling the big lie, people now raising the issue of election denial in this election, and of course the horrible incident involving Speaker Pelosi and her family,&rdquo;</em> referring to an <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/565701-nancy-pelosi-attacker-canadian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attack</a> on Pelosi&rsquo;s husband that Democrats say was politically motivated, but some conservatives see as the actions of a <em>&ldquo;mentally ill, drug-addicted nudist,&rdquo;</em> to quote Fox News&rsquo; Tucker Carlson.</p>
<p>Klain did not elaborate on what Biden intends to follow his <em>&ldquo;final warning&rdquo;</em> with.</p>

<p>Biden and his fellow Democrats began using the term <em>&ldquo;election deniers&rdquo;</em> in recent weeks to describe Republicans &ndash; like former president Donald Trump &ndash; who consider the 2020 election tainted by fraud. The term has also been applied to GOP candidates promising to introduce voter ID laws and restrict voting by mail, which they argue is open to manipulation.</p>
<p>While Biden&rsquo;s speech referenced supposed <em>&ldquo;threats&rdquo;</em> to democracy more than a dozen times, a majority of voters say they&rsquo;re more concerned with the state of the US economy. A CNN <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/565909-biden-election-economy-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> published on Wednesday found that 51% of likely voters see the economy and inflation as the joint top issue facing the country, compared to just 9% who named <em>&ldquo;voting rights and election integrity&rdquo;</em> as their number-one concern.</p>
<p>The same poll showed Republicans with a 45-point advantage over Democrats when it comes to handling the economy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Biden and his supporters have focused their pre-election messaging on the so-called threat to democracy posed by the GOP. Speaking to MSNBC after Biden&rsquo;s speech, historian Michael Beschloss, a <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/biden-quietly-met-group-historians-021811222.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confidant</a> of the president, claimed that <em>&ldquo;children will be arrested and conceivably killed&rdquo;</em> if Republicans retake Congress next week. Beschloss provided no evidence to back up this prediction.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The veteran politician has come back with a decisive Knesset majority</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Benjamin Netanyahu will be the next prime minister of Israel, according to the vote count published on Thursday by the country&rsquo;s central election commission. Current PM Yair Lapid has called his rival to concede the election and pledge an orderly transition, Israeli media reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Preliminary results show Netanyahu&rsquo;s coalition with 64 out of the 120 seats in the Knesset, with Lapid&rsquo;s&nbsp;alternative mustering only 51. The Likud leader outperformed his pre-election polling, which showed him at only 60 seats. Officially ratified results will be published next week.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;The State of Israel is above any political consideration,&rdquo;</em> Lapid said on Thursday. <em>&ldquo;I wish Netanyahu luck for the sake of the people of Israel and the State of Israel.&rdquo;</em> The administration has been instructed to prepare for an orderly transfer of power, he added.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Netanyahu is Israel&rsquo;s longest-serving prime minister with over 15 years in power. His 12-year ruling streak <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/526466-netanyahu-change-israel-vote/">ended in May 2021</a>, when his former aide Naftali Bennett joined forces with Lapid to form a slim majority. Tuesday&rsquo;s elections were Israel&rsquo;s fifth in four years, due to repeated Knesset deadlocks.</p>

<p>In addition to the poor showing of Lapid&rsquo;s Yesh-Atid party and Bennett&rsquo;s Yamina, the left-wing Meretz party failed to reach the electoral threshold for the first time since its establishment in 1992. Meretz needed just 3,800 ballots to make the cut, according to Channel 12. Party leader Zehava Galon called the result <em>&ldquo;a disaster for Meretz, a disaster for the country and also a personal disaster.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Labor chief Merav Michaeli, who refused to merge her list with Meretz, vowed to <em>&ldquo;fight from the opposition against a coalition that has more indictments than female representatives.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Hadash-Ta&rsquo;al, a coalition of Israeli communists and Arabs, won five seats in the Knesset. Their MK Aida Touma-Sliman called the results alarming.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;We are facing a political reality that should be frightening for everyone,&rdquo; </em>she told Ynet.<em> &ldquo;It is a reality in which we have a right wing, and not just the usual &lsquo;classic&rsquo; right that we know, but a right wing willing to use violence, wild incitement and deep racism.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Meanwhile, Hungarian PM Viktor Orban hailed Netanyahu&rsquo;s victory by tweeting <em>&ldquo;Mazel tov!&rdquo;</em> &ndash; meaning &lsquo;congratulations&rsquo; &ndash; to the new prime minister. <em>&ldquo;Hard times require strong leaders.

                            <p><strong>The only ones outraged about Twitter’s new owner are the ones afraid of free speech getting in the way of their authority</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s Twitter takeover has heads rolling. But it is funny how the only people who seem to be upset are those who vehemently do everything in their power to shut down any peon who dares to air wrong-think on the platform.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not to mention the complete meltdown journalists and liberal commentators are having over Musk&rsquo;s idea of paid Twitter verification, which as a fellow Sir Blue Checkmark myself, I find hilarious. The thought of losing their precious blue tick, or, Heaven forbid, sharing it with the common plebeians for a mere $8 per month, has the aristocracy up in arms.</p>
<p>So what else does the Tesla founder have in store for us? How far does your $8 take you?</p>
<p>Well, for starters, you get prioritized posting, meaning that more people will see your replies at the top of tweet threads, in addition to being able to post longer videos, edit your existing posts, and Musk has mentioned his interest in providing content creators with actual payouts, so you&rsquo;ll be able to make money from your tweets in the same way that YouTubers, Instagrammers, and TikTokers have been for years.</p>

<p>On top of all of that, content creators will also gain access to extended analytics to tell them exactly what content of theirs is popular and what isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s just basic stuff that&rsquo;s been available to content creators on every other platform &ndash; except for Twitter &ndash; which begs the question: what have Twitter's engineers been doing all this time?</p>
<p>A recent report from insiders at the company suggests that Elon Musk is now working Twitter's engineers to the bone, giving hard deadlines to do their jobs working on the features he wants to implement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So no more in-office yoga, latte-sipping and wine breaks for Twitter's previously pampered employees, who are now facing the real prospect of having to do their jobs, at risk of getting fired. Imagine that. Twitter is an actual workplace now, not an adult daycare center, and it&rsquo;s all thanks to Elon Musk, a man who knows how to run a successful company. Do Tesla and SpaceX ring any bells? You don&rsquo;t become the world&rsquo;s richest man by being bad at your job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Musk himself pointed out in a Tweet, Twitter has too many managers for the amount of people it has doing actual jobs. And he intends to get rid of them. While he may not be getting rid of 75% of Twitter&rsquo;s workforce, his efforts to streamline the company are definitely shaking the place up.</p>
<p>Musk&rsquo;s demands have workers up in arms. Reports have emerged that he is demanding that some employees work 12 hours a day, seven days a week, to meet the deadlines for his changes. Over a thousand workers have left Twitter since Musk started the process of buying the platform, and a few high-ranking executives, including the CEO, were fired immediately after he completed the purchase.</p>
<p>The most sympathy for them is coming from journalists who want Musk gone. After all, with him in charge, they no longer have Twitter as an echo chamber all to themselves.</p>

<p>Musk&rsquo;s shakeup of Twitter has more than just a few journalists and disgruntled employees riled. The establishment political class, which has long used the platform to promote its own take on reality, is now using the tools of government to make his life miserable.</p>
<p>According to the Washington Post, officials at the US Treasury Department are looking into whether they have the legal authority to investigate his purchase of Twitter due to his close ties to foreign governments and investors, including investors from countries supposedly hostile to the United States.</p>
<p>But why now? Why not before, when investors from Saudi Arabia and companies such as Blackrock, which has close ties to the Chinese government, bought massive chunks of Twitter stock? Why is it only a problem when Musk wants to do it? Did the government take as much of an interest in Jeff Bezos when he bought the Washington Post? How about the fact that Amazon is pretty cozy with the Chinese government, which as we all know isn&rsquo;t exactly on the friendliest of terms with Washington?</p>
<p>So, according to the Washington Post, officials from the Treasury are concerned because large foreign investors could potentially have access to confidential information about Twitter&rsquo;s finances, and potentially its users. The government is reportedly also concerned about Musk&rsquo;s ties to the China-based crypto exchange company Binance.</p>
<p>According to the report, the FBI is also looking into potential counterintelligence risks posed by Musk&rsquo;s acquisition of Twitter. Never mind the fact that the agency was just exposed by the Intercept for colluding with Big Tech companies to censor political conversations. I&rsquo;m sure Musk is the real threat to democracy here when law enforcement authorities are actively trying to prevent people from talking about topics that make certain politicians and their sons look bad.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/11/01/musk-twitter-treasury-department-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> in the Washington Post comes in the wake of an earlier report about how the White House was mulling whether to subject Musk&rsquo;s business dealings to national security reviews. Specifically, the government wanted to look into his purchase of Twitter and SpaceX&rsquo;s satellite network. The White House denied the claims, so we don&rsquo;t know for certain if it was ever officially planned &ndash; but the idea was most definitely floated to the press by someone working in the administration.</p>
<p>In addition to being subject to a potential review by the Treasury Department, Democrat Senator Chris Murphy has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/business/dealbook/elon-musk-twitter-court-legal-battles-pay-layoffs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly requested</a> that the CFIUS, or the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, investigate Musk&rsquo;s purchase of Twitter. The senator says he&rsquo;s concerned about Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s so-called purchase of Twitter &ndash; never mind the fact that direct Saudi acquisition of Twitter stock years ago didn&rsquo;t trigger any such investigation. Once again, it&rsquo;s only a problem now because it&rsquo;s Elon Musk and they want to take him down for having the temerity to challenge the establishment with his advocacy of free speech.</p>
<p>Maybe some smart lawyers will step in and decide that nothing he&rsquo;s done merits an investigation so that they can save themselves the expense of using taxpayer dollars to fund frivolous investigations and lawsuits against Musk. It&rsquo;s doubtful that they&rsquo;ll ever catch anything &ndash; assuming it goes any further.</p>
<p>All the efforts to take down Musk only further prove the point that those in charge don&rsquo;t like having their authority questioned.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>One in five Americans believe it is "very likely" the GOP will indict the president if it wins control of Congress</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Most voters expect US President Joe Biden to face impeachment proceedings if the Republicans win back control of Congress in next week&rsquo;s midterm elections, a new poll has revealed.</p>
<p>The Rasmussen Reports poll, which was released on Thursday, showed that 54% of likely voters believe a Republican-controlled House of Representatives would impeach Biden. More than one in five, or 22%, see that outcome as <em>&ldquo;very likely.&rdquo;</em> By comparison, 32% of respondents said they don&rsquo;t think impeachment is likely, including 12% who see it as <em>&ldquo;not at all likely.&rdquo;</em> About 13% of voters are unsure.</p>
<p>The findings come less than one week before the November 8 midterms, in which Biden&rsquo;s Democratic Party is forecast to lose control of the House and possibly the Senate. Republicans are far more enthusiastic than Democrats about voting in the midterms &ndash; by a margin of 38% to 24% &ndash; and the GOP has a 51-47 lead when voters are asked which party&rsquo;s candidate they will support in their congressional district, according to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/cnn-poll-gop-congressional-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN poll</a> released on Wednesday.</p>

<p>While the latest Rasmussen poll showed that voters largely expect Biden to be impeached, an earlier survey by the researcher showed that most Americans also want the president to be ousted. A <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/biden_administration/impeach_biden_most_gop_independent_voters_say_yes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rasmussen poll</a> conducted in September found that 52% of voters believe Biden should be impeached, compared with 42% who are opposed to impeachment.</p>
<p>Even if a Republican-controlled House voted to impeach Biden, the president wouldn&rsquo;t likely be forced from office. The Constitution requires at least a two-thirds majority of the Senate to vote in favor of conviction for a president to be removed.</p>
<p>However, impeachment proceedings would likely undermine Biden&rsquo;s policy agenda and would give Republicans opportunities to score political points. If victorious in the midterms, the GOP also could argue that it has a mandate to pursue impeachment because, as the Rasmussen poll showed, that&rsquo;s what Americans expected to get when they voted for Republican candidates.</p>

<p>Then-President Donald Trump was twice impeached by the Democrat-controlled House during his term. The Senate voted 52-48 to acquit him in 2020. House prosecutors fell ten Senate votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump in 2021.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Some have reportedly involved deadly pathogens, and hundreds of cases have been kept from public view</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Directors of America&rsquo;s biolabs have admitted to hundreds of dangerous accidents in the past two decades, but even incidents involving exposure to deadly viruses have been kept from public view, an investigation by The Intercept has revealed.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;People have it in their minds that lab accidents are very, very rare, and if they happen, they happen only in the least well-run overseas labs,&rdquo;</em> Rutgers University molecular biologist Richard Ebright told the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/11/01/biosafety-lab-accident-chikungunya-virus/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=theintercept" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">media outlet</a>. <em>&ldquo;That simply isn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The erroneous public perception could stem from the fact that, as The Intercept found, Americans don&rsquo;t hear about US biolab accidents. The outlet obtained more than 5,500 pages of laboratory incident reports from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), compelling the agency to release the documents through a Freedom of Information Act request.</p>
<p>Many lab mishaps are reported to the NIH, the world&rsquo;s largest funder of biomedical research, but the agency doesn&rsquo;t pass on the information to the public, even in cases involving Level 3 and Level 4 biolabs.</p>

<p>One such incident occurred in 2016, when a graduate student at Washington University in St. Louis accidentally pricked her finger with a needle after injecting a mouse with a recombinant strain of the Chikungunya virus, The Intercept said. The student didn&rsquo;t tell her supervisor about the accident until after becoming ill and seeking treatment at a local hospital emergency room.</p>
<p>The university disclosed the accident and infection to the NIH, where the report was kept under wraps until The Intercept came calling six years later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a good situation,&rdquo;</em> said Scott Weaver, a University of Texas immunologist and expert on Chikungunya. <em>&ldquo;If that person knew they had a needlestick and they were working with Chikungunya, they should have reported it immediately. And then whatever health care people saw them should have recognized that there was a very small &mdash; but not zero &mdash; risk of them transmitting the virus.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Chikungunya, which was first identified in Tanzania in the 1950s, is a debilitating and potentially deadly virus that can lead to chronic arthritis. In the local Makonde language, its name means <em>&ldquo;bent over in pain.&rdquo;</em> Outbreaks of the virus were reported in Italy and the US between 2007 and 2017.</p>
<p>The Intercept investigation found a wide range of other biolab accidents over a period spanning 18 years. For instance, in 2018, a US Food and Drug Administration researcher in Maryland contracted MRSA after working with the antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The University of North Carolina reported five escapes of lab mice in 2013 and 2014. At least one of the rodents had been infected with SARS.</p>
<p>The Washington University Chikungunya incident was among five needle injuries reported by the school, despite its lab being a Level 3 facility where researchers wear double layers of protective gear, including two pairs of gloves.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>CT Group reportedly worked to swing presidential elections in the DRC and Zambia while lobbying on behalf of mining companies</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Australian lobbying firm CT Group, which maintains close ties to the UK&rsquo;s ruling Conservative Party, attempted to influence elections in African countries in the interests of mining companies, The Guardian reported on Thursday, citing leaked documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CT Group&rsquo;s co-owner Lynton Crosby managed the Tories&rsquo; 2005 and 2017 general election campaigns, as well as Boris Johnson&rsquo;s successful mayoral&nbsp;runs of 2008 and 2012. Many former employees of the firm eventually ended up in the Conservative Party&rsquo;s headquarters and in the government, The Guardian reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides well-known&nbsp;election-consulting&nbsp;in Australia, the UK, and elsewhere, the lobbying firm conducted a number of <em>&ldquo;secret political projects&rdquo;</em> in Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citing the leaked papers, the outlet revealed that CT Group &ndash; previously known as CTF Partners &ndash; worked for the Canadian enterprise First Quantum Minerals in the early 2010s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the copper-mining permit of First Quantum Minerals was revoked by the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), CT Group offered its client a secretive plan to discredit then-President Joseph Kabila, while supporting &ldquo;<em>the most likely person</em>&rdquo; to beat him, according to the documents.</p>

<p>The documents suggest CT Group was set to earn &pound;1.2 million in fees, with a &pound;1 million bonus available if it reached certain targets. It is not clear if these goals were met, as Kabila ultimately won the election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three years after the DRC campaign, CT Group allegedly became involved in another &ldquo;<em>secret political project</em>,&rdquo; this time in Zambia. The client in this case was also from the mining sector, according to The Guardian, though it is not clear if it was First Quantum or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>There is no suggestion CT Group engaged in unlawful activities on behalf of clients in the mining sector,</em>&rdquo; The Guardian said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CT Group told the paper it had supported &ldquo;<em>campaigns in a range of countries, including the DRC and Zambia</em>&rdquo; and that lobbying candidates for office is part of &ldquo;<em>the democratic process.&rdquo; &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The company also emphasized that when it works on election campaigns, it strictly adheres to all &ldquo;<em>laws and regulations&rdquo;</em> of the relevant countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2019, in another exclusive investigation, The Guardian claimed that CT Group, acting in its clients&rsquo; interests, had launched an undercover Facebook advertising campaign. According to the outlet, the company ran multiple supposedly &ldquo;<em>grassroots</em>&rdquo; social media groups to promote certain political views, including pro-Brexit ones.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Bern is concerned about violating its traditional neutrality</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A new German request to allow it to send Swiss-made ammunition to Ukraine has been rejected.</p>
<p>Switzerland's goverment&nbsp; revealed on Thursday that Economy Minister Guy Parmelin turned down the appeal, which had been made in an official letter sent by German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht to Bern last month.</p>
<p>In her correspondence, Lambrecht had asked for permission to supply some 12,400 rounds of ammunition for Gepard anti-aircraft vehicles, which Berlin sent earlier this year to prop-up Kiev in the ongoing conflict with Moscow.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Under the principle of equal treatment in neutrality law, Switzerland cannot agree to a request for the transfer of war materiel of Swiss origin to Ukraine as long as the latter is involved in an international armed conflict,&rdquo;</em> the Swiss government explained in a statement, adding that since the <em>&ldquo;legal situation&rdquo;</em> remains the same,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;approval of a transfer of Swiss war materiel by Germany to Ukraine is still not possible.&rdquo;&nbsp; </em></p>

<p>While Switzerland has partially abandoned its long-standing neutrality policy amid the conflict in Ukraine and joined Western sanctions against Russia, it has repeatedly shot down attempts to supply weapons of Swiss origin to Kiev.&nbsp;In addition to barring Germany from sending ammunition for the Gepards, Bern has also prohibited Denmark from supplying Swiss-made armored vehicles to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev&rsquo;s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and<em> &ldquo;create powerful armed forces.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Aleksandar Vucic pointed to rising electricity and gas prices in Europe with cold weather approaching</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>European countries are in for a <em>&ldquo;hell&rdquo;</em> of a winter due to the skyrocketing cost of energy, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the government in Belgrade has done its best to stockpile natural gas, in case the pipeline supplying the fuel, via Turkey, is sabotaged.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Colder weather will start in five to seven days and then Europe will start to burn its gas reserves,&rdquo;</em> Vucic told reporters after observing military exercises at a range in eastern Serbia.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Yesterday, the price of gas was $219 for 1,000 cubic meters and today it&rsquo;s $450,&rdquo; </em>Vucic added.<em> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to go up every day, because when the first batch starts leaving the stockpile and there is nothing to replenish it with, the price will rise.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>The Serbian president noted that this will also make electricity more expensive, pointing to a similar jump in price on the European spot market, which he said went from &euro;156 per megawatt-hour on Wednesday to &euro;240 on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>This will be a hell of a difficult winter.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong></strong>Vucic insisted that Serbia itself is well prepared, having stockpiled 667 million cubic meters of gas at four facilities. The people of Serbia have no reason to worry, even if <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/564609-trurkstream-gas-hub-peskov/">something happens</a> to the TurkStream pipeline delivering natural gas from Russia, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;If they cut it tomorrow, or carry out a sabotage and play stupid again &ndash; even though it is known who&rsquo;s behind the Baltic blasts, but we all play stupid so as to not harm the country&rsquo;s interests &ndash; we would survive. I&rsquo;m not sure about others,&rdquo;</em> Vucic said, referring to the September explosions that damaged the Nord Stream pipelines.</p>
<p>Moscow has blamed the UK for orchestrating the sabotage, which London has denied.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Serbia is not a member of the EU and has not joined the bloc&rsquo;s sanctions against Moscow, despite the rising pressure from Brussels to do so.</p>
<p><strong></strong>European gas futures were <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/565855-eu-gas-prices-soar/">trading</a> between $1,333 and $1,405 per 1,000 cubic meters on Thursday, amid fears that the unusually warm weather will soon give way to more seasonal November temperatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The flow of natural gas from Russia, which the EU long relied upon, has been <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/565723-russian-gas-supplies-west/">disrupted</a> this year by a combination of factors. In addition to EU sanctions against Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine complicating payments, the Nord Stream pipelines were damaged by explosions in September. A pipeline through Poland stopped working in May due to counter-sanctions, while gas transit through Ukraine was stopped in October.&nbsp;</p>]]>

            <p>With the US midterm elections just days away, three quarters of voters are unhappy with the direction the American economy is headed, a new CNN poll found. Economic issues are at the forefront of voters&rsquo; minds, and few trust the Democratic party to lower inflation.</p>
<p>The survey found that 75% of Americans believe the US economy is in a recession, up from 64% this summer, while 55% are dissatisfied with their own financial situation, and 74% say <em>&ldquo;things in the country are going badly today.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, 51% of likely voters told <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/cnn-poll-gop-congressional-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> that the economy and inflation are the joint top issues as they decide how to cast their ballots on Tuesday. The only other issue to break double figures is abortion, with 15% of voters rating this their number one concern.</p>

<p>This is bad news for Democrats, as voters who list the economy as their top issue favor Republicans in their House districts by a margin of 71% to 26%. More broadly, 71% of that group favor the GOP to handle inflation, compared to just 18% preferring the Democrats.</p>
<p>The poll is the latest to paint a dismal pre-election picture for the Democrats, with a Wall Street Journal survey on Tuesday finding that just 19% of voters believe the economy is heading in the right direction. Both polls found Republican candidates leading Democrats in a generic ballot, and Republican voters more enthusiastic than their Democrat counterparts.</p>
<p>Republican candidates only need to flip five seats to regain control of the House of Representatives, and one seat to retake the Senate. The GOP has focused its messaging on rising gas prices and inflation in recent months, and holds a three-point advantage, according to an average of 17 polls by <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2022-generic-congressional-vote-7361.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Clear Politics</a>.</p>
<p>President Biden has not paid attention to the most important problems facing the country, 61% of likely voters told CNN. On Wednesday, in his final major address before the midterms, Biden did not dwell on the economy. Instead, the president claimed that <em>&ldquo;democracy is under threat&rdquo;</em> from Republicans on the ballot, 300 of whom he called <em>&ldquo;election deniers.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Bulgaria’s parliament has authorized the sale of weapons to Kiev, despite a third of the country favoring partnership with Russia</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Bulgarian lawmakers voted on Thursday to supply Ukraine with arms, with socialist and nationalist MPs resisting the decision. This leaves Hungary as the final NATO member refusing to provide military aid to Kiev.</p>
<p>A bill authorizing weapons supplies to Ukraine passed Bulgaria&rsquo;s National Assembly by 175 votes to 49, the Novinite news site <a href="https://www.novinite.com/articles/217377/It+is+Official%3A+Bulgaria+will+provide+Military+Aid+to+Ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>. The pro-Western GERB party, currently the largest faction in the assembly, proposed the bill amid coalition talks following elections last month.</p>
<p>The issue of arms supplies to Ukraine is a contentious one in Bulgaria, where nearly a third of the population view Russia as their country&rsquo;s most important strategic partner, 35% see Ukraine as a <em>&ldquo;puppet of the West,&rdquo;</em> and 38% want to leave the NATO alliance, according to Globsec, a Slovakian think tank.</p>
<p>Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has spoken out against weapons transfers to Kiev, arguing that those in favor of arms shipments are <em>&ldquo;warmongers&rdquo;</em> who risk dragging Bulgaria into the conflict with Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Socialist leader Kornelia Ninova, whose party was in a ruling coalition until August, warned on Thursday that <em>&ldquo;the Bulgarian national interest is not to provide weapons, because that would make us a party to the conflict.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; Kostadin Kostadinov&rsquo;s &lsquo;Revival&rsquo; party also voted against the bill, with the nationalist leader complaining that <em>&ldquo;Bulgaria is supposedly ruled by Bulgarians, and we are talking about providing our little remaining armaments and literally bringing Bulgaria into the war.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>While Bulgarian parliamentarians have been debating the country&rsquo;s official stance on arming its neighbor, the country&rsquo;s arms industry has reportedly <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/bulgaria-doesnt-send-weapons-to-ukraine-but-arms-industry-flourishes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold</a> more than $1 billion worth of weapons to customers in Poland and Romania for re-export to Ukraine since February.</p>
<p>It is still unclear how much of Bulgaria&rsquo;s predominantly Soviet weapons stock will be sent to Ukraine, and what, if any, NATO equipment the alliance will offer Sofia in replacement. The government now has a month to list equipment for export and negotiate with Western NATO members for replacements.</p>
<p>With the bill&rsquo;s passage, only one NATO member remains steadfast on refusing to arm Ukraine: Hungary. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has refused to supply weapons or allow arms to enter Ukraine via Hungarian territory. Orban has also refused to embargo Russian energy exports and has called for direct talks between Russia and the US to end the conflict.</p>

                            <p><strong>US researchers with the Environmental Working Group believe the toxins leach from packaging into the contents</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Many of the leading cat and dog food products sold in the US are contaminated with toxic chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The toxins are especially deadly for pets, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) revealed in a report published on Thursday. &nbsp;</p>
<p>PFAS are used to make products resistant to water and heat. These substances are also known as &lsquo;forever chemicals,&rsquo; as they don&rsquo;t break down naturally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>EWG found seven individual PFAS in the packaging of seven pet food brands it tested, with Purina Cat Chow Complete Chicken Flavor topping the list with the highest contamination levels of 244.7 parts per billion (ppb). Kibbles &rsquo;n Bits Bacon and Steak flavor contained 14.3 ppb total PFAS, while other brands&rsquo; bags came in under 15 ppb each.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Traces of the &lsquo;forever chemicals&rsquo; were further discovered in the packaging of all 11 pet food varieties EWG submitted to an independent lab.</p>
<p>While no legal framework exists to limit PFAS in food, it&rsquo;s questionable whether any level of the substances can really be said to be &lsquo;safe,&rsquo; given that they are linked to cancer, kidney and liver disease, immune problems, birth defects, and other health issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EWG science analyst Sydney Evans hypothesized that the chemicals were used in manufacturing the bags to make them grease-repellant and that they could be expected to leach into the kibble inside, which was not tested for the study. A similar phenomenon has been observed with fast-food wrappers leaching PFAS into the human food contained therein. However, the Food and Drug Administration has declined to ban the substances&rsquo; use in food packaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We need strong new state and federal actions to eliminate sources of PFAS pollution&hellip;and end unnecessary uses of PFAS in pet food packaging and in products found in and around the home</em>,&rdquo; Evans told The Guardian. The chemicals&rsquo; ubiquity in consumer products has led to some 97% of Americans having detectable levels of PFAS in their blood, though the EWG believes banning the chemicals might someday lower that number.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The 1979 US embassy takeover shows the country can be “vulnerable,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US is not as invincible as it might seem, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told students on Wednesday ahead what is called the National Day of Fight against Global Arrogance, celebrated on November 4.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Some think that America is an untouchable power, but if we look at the events of this day [November 4], it turns out that no, it is completely vulnerable,&rdquo;</em> Khamenei said, referring to the 1979 US embassy takeover, which was carried out by a Muslim student movement.</p>
<p>A total of 52 US diplomats and their family members were taken hostage in the incident and were only released 444 days later, on January 20, 1981.</p>

<p>Yet, according to Khamenei, this was not the event that triggered the decades-long rivalry between Washington and Tehran. The turning point in relations between the two nations had come almost three decades earlier when the US, together with the UK, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of the Iranian prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, the supreme leader said.</p>
<p>The US and its British allies sought to control Iran&rsquo;s oil reserves, and that is why they turned against Mosaddegh, who was not an advocate of Islamic rule, Khamenei argued.</p>
<p>Mosaddegh&rsquo;s government had sought to audit the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which was controlled by the British, to verify that it was paying the contracted royalties to Iran. The company refused to cooperate, prompting the Iranian parliament to nationalize the oil industry altogether. The UK and US then used their leverage to undermine Mosaddegh&rsquo;s government through their agents in Iran.</p>
<p>The US formally acknowledged its role in the coup back in 2013, when it released a trove of previously unpublished documents related to the case.</p>]]>

            <p>The US and South Korea have made an <em>&ldquo;awful mistake&rdquo;</em> by extending the ongoing &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; war games and therefore pushing tensions in the region into an <em>&ldquo;uncontrollable phase,&rdquo;</em> a top North Korean official said on Thursday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It was reported that the US and South Korea decided to extend the combined air drill Vigilant Storm. It is a very dangerous and false choice,&rdquo;</em> Pak Jong-chon, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers&rsquo; Party of Korea, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The official said the <em>&ldquo;irresponsible decision&rdquo;</em> was <em>&ldquo;shoving the present situation caused by provocative military acts of the allied forces to an uncontrollable phase.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The US and South Korea will get to know what an irrevocable and awful mistake they made.</strong></em></p>

<p>The statement came shortly after the South Korean Air Force revealed it was discussing with the Pentagon a new timeline for the ongoing drills, which were originally scheduled to conclude on Friday. Seoul said the decision to extend the exercise stemmed from North Korea&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;recent provocations.&rdquo;</em> So far, however, a new timeline has not been officially announced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo;, which began on Monday and involves some 240 military aircraft, is the largest rendition of the exercise ever, according to the US Air Force. The drills were first held in 2015 under the name &lsquo;Vigilant Ace&rsquo; but were put on hold in 2018 as Seoul tried to mend ties with Pyongyang.</p>
<p>North Korea has repeatedly condemned the exercise, blasting it as a rehearsal for an invasion and proof that Washington and Seoul are taking a hostile stance. Over this week, Pyongyang conducted military drills of its own, launching multiple ballistic missiles and warning of <em>&ldquo;more powerful follow-up measures.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>A little-known agency inside the US Department of Homeland Security is on a mighty slippery censorship slope</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Partially-censored meeting minutes of the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee advising the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), an agency of the US Department of Homeland Security, have been obtained by <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Intercept</a>.</p>
<p>The documents reveal attempts to conflate the need to protect American &ldquo;<em>critical infrastructure&rdquo;</em> from what the committee repeatedly describes as threats of <em>&ldquo;disinformation&rdquo;</em> &ndash; or rather, <em>&ldquo;mis-, dis-, and mal-information (MDM).&rdquo;</em> The meeting notes describe telecommunications infrastructure (which would include the internet) and public healthcare infrastructure as in need of protection from wrong-speak.&nbsp;In essence, it keeps up the work of the short-lived and controversial Disinformation Governance Board, which earned the unenviable nickname of the &lsquo;Ministry of Truth&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The papers focus on countering non-establishment narratives related to Covid-19 origins and vaccines, racial justice, the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, and the US&rsquo; involvement in the Ukraine conflict. It also reveals the existence of a back channel for Homeland Security to communicate its desire to boost or censor certain messages on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>The nature of these online narratives being targeted for government protection from <em>&ldquo;disinformation&rdquo;</em> just happen to coincide with those that evoke a ton of legitimate criticism. When the government gets directly involved in narrative policing under the guise of &ldquo;<em>infrastructure protection,&rdquo;</em> it&rsquo;s a dodgy pretext that should raise serious concerns about government overreach to the detriment of free expression and flow of information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s blowing up the internet with mere words. No one&rsquo;s causing the public health system to fail by debating Covid-related science propagated by the government, even if it later does indeed turn out to be misinformed or questionable. Remember, for example, when Western officials, including US President Joe Biden, were saying that the jab would prevent infection and transmission &ndash; and that anyone saying otherwise was full of it? Or when the US government spent the better part of two decades repeating that the US was winning in Afghanistan &ndash; right up until the US withdrawal and the Taliban retaking the country? Or how about the claim that the US wasn&rsquo;t directly involved in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine &ndash; right up until the Pentagon <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/11/02/ukra-n02.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> the deployment of US troops to Ukraine, albeit not in frontline combat operations. <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been very clear there are no combat forces in Ukraine, no US forces conducting combat operations in Ukraine, these are personnel that are assigned to conduct security cooperation and assistance as part of the defense attach&eacute; office,&rdquo;</em> Pentagon Press Secretary Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But based on the rules laid out by this online disinformation policing agency, anyone who dared to reveal evidence, information, or observations that run contrary to what the US government was willing to admit as part of the official narrative could feasibly be considered a peddler of fake info. History has shown, however, that they&rsquo;re often proved correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Across the pond, French President Emmanuel Macron was asked recently in an interview with French state media about Russian media outlets remaining accessible in France through online platforms despite state censorship. In evoking the bans, Macron <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-france-russia-hands-are-tied-as-rt-still-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re using the informational weapon.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Like in the US, it sounds like Macron is admitting that the state is using censorship as a weapon against narratives and information that runs counter to their own. Apparently, the public&rsquo;s right to be fully informed and make up their own minds about what&rsquo;s going on in the world can just be shrugged off as collateral damage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now becoming commonplace for Western <em>&ldquo;democracy&rdquo;</em> to use the law enforcement apparatus of the state to ensure that its propaganda goes unchallenged online and offline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how well that goes down with new Twitter CEO Elon Musk, who has been waging a war on censorship on various fronts. Musk was asked back in March to block Russian news sources on his Starlink satellite network. <em>&ldquo;We will not do so unless at gunpoint. Sorry to be a free speech absolutist,&rdquo;</em> he <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1499976967105433600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a>.&nbsp;Musk has also been openly <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-commissioner-to-musk-twitter-will-play-by-our-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reminded</a> by European Union Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, in the wake of his recent talk of restoring free speech, that the platform would be forced to abide by the bloc&rsquo;s rules governing public expression. And clearly those aren&rsquo;t very free.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Chris Murphy is now demanding a US government <a href="https://worldnewsera.com/news/entrepreneurs/u-s-exploring-whether-it-has-authority-to-review-musks-twitter-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">investigation</a>&nbsp;into the financial participation of Saudi Arabia, Musk-owned Twitter&rsquo;s second largest investor, in the platform. Interesting that no one seemed to care that the Saudis had invested in Twitter long before Musk came along. Or that governments Murphy calls <em>&ldquo;repressive&rdquo;</em> have cash flowing into Hollywood and American media outlets as advertisers. And that cash conveniently didn&rsquo;t have any particular color or citizenship until Musk took over vowing to claw back free speech. Now suddenly this US official is dragging out the old foreign interference hammer to use against Musk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Musk was standing up against censorship perpetrated by a regime the West didn&rsquo;t like, he&rsquo;d be invited to sit next to First Lady Jill at Biden&rsquo;s next State of the Union address. Instead, US government agencies are increasingly guilty of the same sort of repression for which they&rsquo;re so quick to criticize others.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The act of removing a condom during sex without the partner’s consent could lead to a life sentence under a new law</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>An Australian state has voted to pass a bill that would introduce harsh penalties for men who remove condoms during sex without the consent of their partner, an act colloquially known as &lsquo;stealthing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The South Australian (SA) parliament passed the bill on Wednesday, joining other Australian states including ACT, Tasmania, Victoria, and New South Wales, which have also outlawed the practice. Anyone convicted of stealthing could potentially face a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>
<p>The legislation, dubbed the Criminal Law Consolidation (Stealthing) Amendment Bill, was introduced by SA MP Connie Bonaros, who described &lsquo;stealthing&rsquo; in a statement as a <em>&ldquo;repugnant''</em> and <em>&ldquo;disgusting act of betrayal.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Such grotesque acts of indecency deserve to be treated in the same manner as rape and a crime punishable by terms of imprisonment,&rdquo;</em> Bonaros said.</p>
<p>A study of 10,000 people conducted by the Australian Institute of Criminology last month reportedly found that as many as one in three women and one in five gay men had been stealthed at least once.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s expected that the introduction of criminal liability for the act of &ldquo;stealthing&rdquo; may deter potential offenders, some have raised concerns that not many people are even aware of the term.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Stealthing is a particularly intricate type of sexual violence because the definition, by default, means that you have consented to having protected sex with the perpetrator, meaning you probably had positive feelings towards that person,&rdquo;</em> the director of the Australia Institute&rsquo;s Centre for Sex and Gender Equality, Chanel Contos, told The Guardian last month.</p>
<p>She went on to call for the introduction of a national curriculum on consent and respectful relationships and to harmonize Australia&rsquo;s laws on stealthing in order to <em>&ldquo;facilitate education and public awareness that stealthing is a form of sexual assault.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>A former employee claims Hispanic staff were treated differently from white colleagues.</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A woman who worked as a housekeeper for former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has filed a lawsuit against her ex-boss. The plaintiff, Mercedes Wedaa, claims she was forced to work long hours without meal breaks and was also discriminated against on the basis of her ethnicity.</p>
<p>Wedaa lodged her complaint in a Seattle state court on Tuesday. She says she began working for the billionaire in September 2019 and spent nearly three years on the staff. She was put in charge of a team of five to six housekeepers.</p>
<p>The former employee&nbsp;recounted having been repeatedly forced to work 10 to 14 hours a day without rest. Moreover, the housekeepers were allegedly denied access to a toilet in a nearby security room, which meant they had to climb out a window to reach another bathroom.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, the plaintiff and other Hispanic employees were supposedly treated differently from Bezos&rsquo; white staff.</p>

<p>At one point, a household manager even &ldquo;<em>became aggressive and abusive</em>&rdquo; with Wedaa, the woman claims. Wedaa was eventually terminated. She is seeking back pay and benefits, as well as damages.</p>
<p>The plaintiff's lawyer, Patrick McGuigan, insisted that the US &ldquo;<em>labor and employment laws</em>&rdquo; clearly stipulate that employees &ldquo;<em>must be able to perform&hellip; work in a safe, sanitary and healthy workplace</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry Korrell, an attorney representing Bezos, meanwhile, argued that the claims made by Wedaa &ldquo;<em>have no merit,</em>&rdquo; and vowed to &ldquo;<em>defend</em> [his client] <em>against them.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having founded Amazon back in 1994 as an online bookstore, over the years Bezos successfully branched out into several other areas of e-commerce, and later into retail. Amazon is now a multinational tech company on par with the likes of Alphabet, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. Bloomberg and Forbes ranked Bezos as the world&rsquo;s wealthiest person from 2017 until 2021. Since then, however, he has slipped to fourth place, with a net worth of $115.6 billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has also received a lot of flak in recent years over its allegedly grueling and even unsafe workplace practices. Claims of racial discrimination have been made against Amazon as well.</p>
<p>The tech giant has faced several lawsuits filed by current and former employees as a result.</p>]]>

            <p>Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was shot and injured as he spoke during a protest march outside the town of Gujranwala on Thursday. Khan, who was rushed to the hospital after the incident, has been attempting to mount a political comeback after being ousted from power in April.</p>
<p>As Khan spoke to his supporters from the back of a truck, a gunman in the crowd opened fire. According to multiple media reports, the former PM was either hit in the foot or the leg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Khan was rushed to a hospital in Lahore, around 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. One of Khan&rsquo;s aides, Raoof Hasan, told AFP that the former leader is in <em>&ldquo;stable condition.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This was an attempt to kill him, to assassinate him,&rdquo;</em> Hasan added. A suspect has been arrested, Pakistan&rsquo;s Geo TV reported shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Khan is a former cricketer who served as Pakistan&rsquo;s prime minister from 2018 until his removal from office after a no-confidence motion in April this year. Khan built economic and diplomatic relations with Russia and China, and claimed that his removal was orchestrated by the US with the goal of installing a more compliant leader.</p>

<p>Khan was charged with terror-related offenses in August for threatening to take <em>&ldquo;action&rdquo;</em> against allegedly corrupt police officials, although a court in Islamabad later dropped the charges. Last month, the Election Commission of Pakistan barred Khan from running or serving as a member of parliament for five years, claiming that the ex-PM had failed to properly report gifts received while in office. Khan, who still leads the PTI party, insists he is being persecuted on political grounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s shooting took place a week into a protest march led by Khan from Lahore to Islamabad. Stopping to hold rallies along the route, the PTI leader has been demanding fresh elections, buoyed by his party&rsquo;s victories in six out of eight by-elections it contested last month.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Helsinki and Stockholm had pledged to address Ankara's concerns about suspected terrorists</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Finland and Sweden have not extradited a single "terrorism" suspect to T&uuml;rkiye since pledging to review Ankara's requests, a top official has complained.</p>
<p>T&uuml;rkiye made support from the two Nordic countries, in this area, a condition for NATO entry.</p>
<p>Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag reported a lack of progress with extraditions in an interview with the TV new channel A Haber on Thursday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There are positive conversations. They offered some explanations. They have reviews underway. There were no people who have been extradited from Finland and Sweden to us,&rdquo;</em> the official said.</p>
<p>He noted that his country wants the two Nordic nations to <em>&ldquo;support T&uuml;rkiye&rsquo;s fight against terrorism&rdquo;</em> before Ankara would agree to their NATO bids. The US-led military bloc gives every member state a veto on expansion.</p>
<p>Finland and Sweden applied for NATO membership in May, claiming that such a move was necessary to gain protection against Russia. Hungary and T&uuml;rkiye are the only members of the organization that have not yet ratified the applications. Budapest pledged to do so by mid-December, but Ankara has not set a deadline.</p>

<p>The two prospective members signed an agreement with T&uuml;rkiye in June in which they pledged to address a list of Turkish concerns. Among other things, Ankara accused the Nordic nations of harboring <em>&ldquo;terrorists&rdquo;</em> on their soil and failing to crack down on their operations to finance activities against T&uuml;rkiye.</p>
<p>The Turkish allegations were referring to individuals whom it suspects of having ties with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the movement of US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen.</p>
<p>The PKK waged a decades-long guerrilla war against T&uuml;rkiye and is considered a terrorist organization by the EU. Ankara blamed Gulen for masterminding a failed military coup in 2016.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg will visit T&uuml;rkiye this week to discuss, among other things, the bids of Finland and Sweden, according to the news agency Anadolu.</p>]]>

            <p></p>
<p>A man was arrested in Brazil after driving his car through a crowd of supporters of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, injuring nine people.</p>
<p>The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon on the Washington Luis Highway, according to national media. A group of people protesting the incumbent president&rsquo;s election defeat were demonstrating in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>The driver, who was later identified by state military police as a 28-year-old man, asked the crowd to let him pass through the blockade, but was denied. He then took off and drove through the crowd, carrying a number of protesters on the hood, footage of the incident shows.</p>
<p>The vehicle stopped shortly thereafter, and officers had to protect the driver from angry demonstrators who attempted to retaliate. He was arrested, and his 74-year-old mother, who was also in the car, was let go.</p>

<p>The suspect is facing charges of attempted murder. He injured nine people, including a 12-year-old girl and two law enforcement officers, the military police said in a statement. The incident took place in the Mirassol municipality in the state of Sao Paulo, around 400km northwest of the provincial capital.</p>

<p>Mass protests erupted in Brazil after Bolsonaro suffered a narrow defeat at the hands of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Sunday. Before the election, he claimed that he could only lose if there was fraud, and he never formally conceded defeat. The protesters are demanding a military takeover of the government and an inquiry into the nation&rsquo;s electronic voting system.</p>

            <p>Historic coins, uncut diamonds, and platinum bars &ndash; these are just some of the luxury items being put up for auction by the French finance ministry. All the goods are said to be contraband seized by the country&rsquo;s customs service.</p>
<p>On offer are 350 lots worth approximately &euro;1 million ($980,430). More than 1,200 prospective buyers have already signed up for the auction that kicks off on Friday at 9:30 GMT.</p>
<p>Among the items presented on the Hotel Drouot auction house&rsquo;s website are 14 platinum ingots weighing 1kg each with a starting price of &euro;22,000. The bars were reportedly impounded after the luggage of two UK-bound passengers was searched.</p>
<p>The catalogue also includes historic British gold coins, and a collection of uncut diamonds, seized at Paris airports.</p>

<p>More than 2,000 bottles of Grey Goose vodka are listed with a starting price of &euro;10,000. However, only professional buyers will be able to lay their hands on the upmarket spirit, with the auction organizers citing security and legal reasons.</p>
<p>Not all the items on offer fall under the category of &lsquo;luxury goods,&rsquo; there are semi-trailer trucks and laptops in the catalogue too.</p>
<p>Commenting on the auction, the finance ministry praised the customs service for its daily battle &ldquo;<em>against all illegal traffic that threatens our territory and our society in order to protect citizens and the environment.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officials added that the sale reflected the sheer diversity of impounded goods.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The New York congresswoman accused him of trying to turn freedom of speech into a monthly subscription plan</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Elon Musk and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sparred on Twitter over the billionaire&rsquo;s idea to charge $8 a month for the privilege of having verified status on his newly purchased platform. Both have enormous followings on Twitter, but have significant differences of opinion regarding policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The congresswoman from New York, who also goes by AOC, blasted the idea of making blue check verification available only to premium subscribers, tweeting on Wednesday: <em>&ldquo;Lmao at a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that &lsquo;free speech&rsquo; is actually a $8/mo subscription plan.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The left-wing politician relied heavily on her Twitter following to defeat Democratic heavyweight Joe Crowley in a primary for the 2018 congressional election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Musk, a self-described <em>&ldquo;free speech absolutist,&rdquo;</em> returned fire: <em>&ldquo;Your feedback is appreciated, now pay $8.&rdquo;</em> He then posted a screenshot from AOC&rsquo;s merch shop, highlighting the $58 price tag of a sweatshirt.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your feedback is appreciated, now pay $8</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587911540770222081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>AOC pushed back, saying she was proud of the merch and the fact that her workers are unionized, unlike employees at Musk&rsquo;s companies. The Tesla CEO is famously opposed to labor unions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She also claimed that her Twitter notifications were <em>&ldquo;conveniently&rdquo;</em> not working, concluding that she must have <em>&ldquo;gotten under a certain billionaire&rsquo;s skin.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Also my twitter mentions/notifications conveniently aren’t working tonight, so I was informed via text that I seem to have gotten under a certain billionaire’s skin 😂<br><br>Just a reminder that money will never by your way out of insecurity, folks.</p>&mdash; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1587968426374561793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>The &lsquo;billionaire&rsquo; had a similar interaction with American author Stephen King, also a vocal advocate of left-wing causes. King threatened to leave Twitter if verification becomes a premium service. <em>&ldquo;F**k that, they should pay me,&rdquo;</em> he tweeted on Monday. Musk responded by trying to negotiate a suitable subscription price.</p>

<p>Musk claimed that his $44 billion purchase of Twitter last month was ideologically motivated. He expressed concern with the platform&rsquo;s content moderation policies, saying it needs to become a neutral marketplace of ideas. Critics claim that Musk will turn the service into an unregulated cesspool of bigotry, hatred, and white supremacy.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Britain's state broadcaster claimed that Moscow's troops tried to create a drought in Nikolaev, using false information</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>On October 25, BBC News <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63383605">published</a> an absolutely shocking exclusive report revealing that residents of the southern Ukrainian city of Nikolaev (which current officials in Kiev insist should be spelt as "Mykolaiv," in English)&nbsp;had been without clean drinking water for six months, due to attacks on a pipeline supplying the city.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Evidence collected&rdquo;</em> by the British state broadcaster pointed to this being <em>&ldquo;a deliberate act by Russian forces&rdquo;</em> intended to cause mass dehydration and death among the local population.</p>
<p>Strangely though, despite all the sound and fury and finger-pointing, the BBC stopped short of condemning the alleged action as an outright war crime, simply noting that <em>&ldquo;destroying resources vital for civilian life is widely regarded as a violation of international humanitarian law.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This reluctance seems rather strange, given that the Beeb&nbsp;appears&nbsp;to offer an open-and-shut case, including <em>&ldquo;satellite imagery and data&rdquo;</em> showing the pipeline <em>&ldquo;was deliberately destroyed while under Russian control,&rdquo;</em> and bold declarations from esteemed military experts that it was a calculated act by Moscow.</p>
<p>The reasons for the BBC&rsquo;s hesitancy soon become very clear, though. A key part of its case against Russia is that <em>&ldquo;two separate points on the same pipeline&rdquo;</em> were <em>&ldquo;damaged in ways that are consistent with sabotage.&rdquo;</em> Photos of this damage are provided in the article, at least one being an &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; that was &ldquo;given&rdquo; to BBC journalists by unidentified people while in Nikolaev.</p>
<p>Other photos of tanks <em>&ldquo;close to the pipe&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;while the area was <em>&ldquo;under Russian control&rdquo;</em> are thus said to point to <em>&ldquo;occupying Russian forces deliberately cutting off the water supply.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Of course, images of someone&nbsp;&ndash; or something&nbsp;&ndash; near a subsequent murder scene is far from even circumstantial evidence, let alone proof that they pulled the trigger or wielded the knife. But the British state broadcaster&rsquo;s already shaky case is even less convincing when you consider that we may not be dealing with a murder scene in the first place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t take RT&rsquo;s word for it. The BBC itself seems simultaneously uncertain as to whether the deliberate destruction it claims the pictures show is in fact destruction at all. Descriptive texts accompanying the two highly pixelated, blurry shots&nbsp;&ndash; which may suggest they were taken on extremely dated photographic equipment, and/or aren&rsquo;t at all recent&nbsp;&ndash; add a small but hugely significant caveat to the allegation.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;These photos appear to show damage caused to Mykolaiv's water supply pipeline,&rdquo;</em> says one, while the other states, <em>&ldquo;the pipeline appears to have been damaged in a second area.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Such equivocation by a prosecution lawyer would get a case thrown out of any UK court in the West, on principle. If a non-mainstream media source was to engage in similar ambiguity when reporting on a matter of this seriousness, the Brussels-bankrolled&nbsp;<a href="https://euvsdisinfo.eu/">EU vs Disinfo</a>&nbsp;information war team&nbsp;would be on the scene in minutes to condemn the article&rsquo;s author and the outlet that published it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either the photos show damage&nbsp;&ndash; deliberate or otherwise&nbsp;&ndash; or they don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s one or the other, and certainly not both.</p>

<h2>Conflict of interest, much?</h2>
<p>As if to resolve the conundrum its own lack of certainty creates, the BBC goes on to consult two &ldquo;security experts&rdquo; so as to fortify the headline charge of deliberate Russian wrecking.</p>
<p>The first quoted is Chris Cobb Smith, a &ldquo;military forensics expert who served in the British Army as an artillery officer for over 20 years and spent three years as a UN weapons inspector in Iraq.&rdquo; He vehemently dismissed any suggestion the pipe could&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;damaged&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; note we&rsquo;re suddenly back to certainty on this crucial point again&nbsp;&ndash; by tank fire, or accidental &ldquo;random shelling,&rdquo; calling the chances of an &ldquo;indirect fire strike&rdquo; being responsible &ldquo;infinitesimal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead, he&nbsp;claims that the &ldquo;intentional placement of an explosive charge either directly under the pipe or possibly on top of it, at the most vulnerable point,&rdquo; was to blame. Absent from the article was any acknowledgement of the fact that his work as a &ldquo;media security&rdquo; consultant <a href="http://www.chiron-resources.com/about.html">started</a> in 2000, when he approached none other than the BBC and offered his services in this regard directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a welcome advance. His company, Chiron Associates, boasts that the British state broadcaster&nbsp;&ndash; among a great many other Western news outlets that have likewise published dubious claims about the conflict in Ukraine&nbsp;&ndash; remains a client to this day. Cobb-Smith also moonlights as an <a href="https://forensic-architecture.org/about/team/member/chris-cobb-smith">investigator</a> for Forensic Architecture, which played a prominent role in disseminating and legitimizing blatantly false war propaganda related to the Syrian crisis.</p>
<p>Still, his potentially not-so-independent view is reinforced by Michael Whelan, a &ldquo;security expert who served in the British military for over 20 years,&rdquo; who agrees &ldquo;the damage to the pipeline was deliberately caused by explosives.&rdquo; His unstated day job could amount to a conflict of interest even larger&nbsp;than Cobb-Smith&rsquo;s, for he serves as an &ldquo;international security advisor&rdquo; at <a href="https://www.operatorscircle.com/about-us/michael-whelan/">Operators Circle</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company connects retired military veterans looking for new opportunities to carry out their deadly trade in the private sphere, with companies on the hunt for mercenaries to hire. The landing page of the Operators Circle website indicates that the Western proxy war in Ukraine is very much a hotspot for recruitment, and a big earner from the firm&rsquo;s perspective as a result.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.11/original/63628a622030270c910771cf.jpg"  />

            </figure>

<p>Maybe it would be unwise to discount the insight of the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; Cobb-Smith and Whelan. Although, if their claims of explosives blowing up the pipe, not tank shelling, are true, that means the BBC&rsquo;s photo of tanks near the pipeline is completely immaterial, because a tank wasn&rsquo;t used to inflict the damage. But then, why didn&rsquo;t the Russians just use tanks if they wished to destroy the pipeline, as that capability was so near at the time?</p>

<h2>A neverending story</h2>
<p>Delivering a further coup de gr&acirc;ce to the narrative of deliberate Russian sabotage, a diligent and eagle-eyed Telegrammer <a href="https://t.me/timofei_v/630">geolocated</a> where the BBC claimed the damage was inflicted based on the photo of the tanks nearby, and dug up archived satellite images of the site dating back a number of years, as far as 2006. The same apparent &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; is present in every frame. In other words, there was no damage.</p>
<p>Still, why let facts get in the way of a good story? Shock headlines and allegations of major Russian atrocities get clicks and draw viewers, and very effectively serve the interests of the British state, which claims it is funnelling endless weapons to Kiev not in service of endlessly prolonging a brutal proxy conflict, but to save Ukraine and Ukrainians from &ldquo;genocide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is ironic&nbsp;&ndash; and no doubt a disappointment to the British state broadcaster&nbsp;&ndash; that the landmark waterpipe &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; largely went unreported on by the rest of the Western media. That may be an indication that, at this stage, sensational stories of Kremlin-directed war crimes are published so regularly that&nbsp;news organizations simply can&rsquo;t keep up with it all. In fact, since the BBC&rsquo;s baseless report dropped a week ago, we&rsquo;re well overdue for the next avalanche of lies, whether from government controlled outlets or the "free press."</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The US, France, and Britain shut down Russia’s call to investigate “military-biological” activities in Ukraine</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The UN Security Council has rejected Russia&rsquo;s call for an international investigation into claims that the US used laboratories in Ukraine to develop biological weapons.</p>
<p>While China backed Russia&rsquo;s proposal, the US, Britain, and France voted against it, and the ten rotating council members abstained.</p>
<p>Russia insists that the US and Ukraine have been violating the 1972 international convention that bans the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. According to Moscow, several laboratories in Ukraine were working on a secret <em>&ldquo;military-biological&rdquo;</em> program, which involved studies and the stockpiling of samples of anthrax, cholera, and other infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Washington and Kiev both deny developing biological weapons. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said in March that the laboratories were conducting <em>&ldquo;ordinary scientific research.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>During the vote in the Security Council on Wednesday, US envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, argued that the Russian proposal for a probe is &ldquo;<em>based on disinformation, dishonesty, bad faith, and a total lack of respect for this body</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas-Greenfield reiterated that the activities under the Pentagon&rsquo;s Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program in Ukraine and other former Soviet states <em>&ldquo;are not for military purposes.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>The US Mission to International Organizations in Geneva, Switzerland said in April that the CTR&rsquo;s goal in Ukraine was to help the country<em> &ldquo;consolidate and secure pathogens and to continue to ensure Ukraine can detect and report disease outbreaks before they pose security or stability threats.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>Dmitry Polyansky, Russia&rsquo;s deputy envoy to the UN, meanwhile, said he was <em>&ldquo;deeply disappointed&rdquo;</em> by the vote. He said <em>&ldquo;the Western countries are simply afraid&rdquo;</em> of an international investigation into the issue.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>An economics professor devised a formula to calculate how many times water has been consumed</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The tap water people drink in 2022 is the same water the dinosaurs urinated millions of years ago, having been drunk and excreted 10-25 times previously, according to London School of Economics Professor Paul Frijters.</p>
<p>Frijters devised a complex formula to attempt to calculate how many creatures a molecule of water passes through before it ends up in your mouth, posting his creation to the Core Economics blog last month. Acknowledging <em>&ldquo;a few guesstimates&rdquo;</em> were required for some variables as exact figures were impossible to come by, he gave the (rather crude) formula thus:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Piss ratio = (total water pissed)/(total water) = (total vertebrate biomass ever lived*piss rate)/(total water) = (average biomass vertebrates*piss rate per year*years of vertebrates)/(total water)&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The professor cited a US government statistic positing 1.386 billion cubic kilometers of water exists on Earth before plucking the figure 800 cubic kilometers for <em>&ldquo;total water pissed&rdquo;</em> out of thin air, admitting it was only his <em>&ldquo;best guess&rdquo;</em> &ndash; but it was a reassuring guess, as it meant <em>&ldquo;only one 2-millionth of the atoms in the average water molecule will have been pissed out by a human.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Working with similarly vague figures, Frijters calculated that the atoms in the average water molecule have been urinated about ten times &ndash; <em>&ldquo;a conservative estimate,&rdquo;</em> he wrote, suggesting the reality may be as many as 25 times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But those squeamish about consuming recycled human urine shouldn&rsquo;t be &ndash; only two of those cycles involved mammals, with most coming from fish and <em>&ldquo;only a trickle&rdquo;</em> from primates. While humanity only recently devised a process for directly purifying wastewater in order to make it safe to drink again, indirect reuse is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Frijters advises the UK government on public health policy,&nbsp;a discipline with a keen interest in acclimatizing skittish humans to the notion of drinking their own (purified) wastewater. The process once derided by media as <em>&ldquo;toilet to tap&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>is increasingly appealing to local governments as drought, overpopulation, and water shortages put a strain on resources. So-called &lsquo;direct potable reuse&rsquo;, in which &lsquo;highly treated&rsquo; sewage is sent to a central drinking water system for distribution to communities, has been legalized in Texas, while Arizona allowed it in some cases as of August. Colorado, Florida, and California are in the process of legalizing it.</p>]]>

            <p>North Korea has launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as part of a large-scale show of force against the ongoing war games between the US and South Korea, according to Seoul&rsquo;s armed forces.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20221005004354325?section=nk/nk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> the military detected <em>&ldquo;what is presumed to be a long-range ballistic missile launch from the Sunan area in Pyongyang&rdquo;</em> early on Thursday morning, noting that two additional short-range missiles followed about one hour later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After analyzing details of the launch, the military <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20221005004356325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a> that the weapon traveled a distance of around 760km (472 miles) and reached a top speed of Mach 15. However, a defense source later told Yonhap that <em>&ldquo;the missile seems to have failed in normal flight&rdquo;</em> after its second-stage separation.</p>

<p>In a statement later on Thursday, the Joint Chiefs said <em>&ldquo;Our military has beefed up surveillance and vigilance&rdquo;</em> and would maintain a <em>&ldquo;readiness posture in close cooperation with the US.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Thursday&rsquo;s launch marks the first time Pyongyang has fired an ICBM since May, though it comes amid a record number of missile tests overall this year. The DPRK has also unleashed hundreds of rockets, missiles, and artillery shells into the sea in recent days as a demonstration to Washington and Seoul, which are in the middle of some of their <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/565634-south-korea-us-air-exercises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest&nbsp;air drills ever</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>With tensions soaring on the peninsula, the North has repeatedly condemned the exercises as a rehearsal for a full-scale invasion, even suggesting earlier this week that Washington could be preparing a nuclear attack. The US and South Korea, meanwhile, have denounced each missile launch by Pyongyang as a dangerous provocation and have vowed to continue strengthening military ties.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Chaotic demonstrations erupted across Brazil after the president’s election loss</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has asked his supporters to stop blocking major roadways to protest his defeat in last week&rsquo;s election, saying such actions are not <em>&ldquo;legitimate demonstrations.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/jairbolsonaro/status/1587937176741851137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video message</a> shared on social media on Wednesday night, Bolsonaro pleaded with protesters to find other outlets for their anger after his loss to leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in a runoff vote over the weekend, suggesting that truck drivers and others blocking roads are discrediting their own cause.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I know you are upset... Me too. But we have to keep our heads straight,&rdquo;</em> he <a href="https://archive.ph/yzqTY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>. <em>&ldquo;I will make an appeal to you: clear the highways.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chaos in Brazil after presidential election. <br><br>Truck drivers who support Bolsonaro block main highways across Brazil in protest of the results. <a href="https://t.co/Rg6pQt76B3">pic.twitter.com/Rg6pQt76B3</a></p>&mdash; Raquel Krähenbühl (@Rkrahenbuhl) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rkrahenbuhl/status/1587424916734988289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Bolsonaro added that Brazil&rsquo;s Federal Highway Police (PRF) were facing <em>&ldquo;enormous&rdquo;</em> difficulties in trying to clear away the demonstrators, as they have been outnumbered in many locations. According to the PRF, roadblocks remain at 126 different sites across Brazil, though the agency said that number had dropped since Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Police also say they have cleared more than 700 separate blockades in total, but noted that roads continue to be obstructed in 14 of the country&rsquo;s 26 states. The clogged highways have meant disruptions in the distribution of fuel, food, and other key goods, especially as many long-haul truckers have taken part in the protests.</p>
<p>National health agency Anvisa has warned of potential shortages in medical supplies due to the roadblocks, while Brazil&rsquo;s oil regulator has relaxed certain storage requirements in preparation for scarcities.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The outgoing leader went on to <a href="https://www.terra.com.br/noticias/brasil/pressionado-bolsonaro-pede-a-apoiadores-o-fim-dos-bloqueios-nas-rodovias,372f53d161f0f093d0eb97d882504cde1pdrlga1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">say</a> that <em>&ldquo;the closing of highways in Brazil harms people's right to come and go,&rdquo;</em> arguing that it is&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;not part of legitimate demonstrations.</em>&rdquo; He added to&nbsp;his followers: <em>&ldquo;Protest otherwise, in other places. This is very welcome, it's part of our democracy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>On Tuesday, Bolsonaro broke days of silence following his loss at the polls, stating that the protests were the result of <em>&ldquo;indignation and a sense of injustice&rdquo;</em> over the election, though did not urge his backers to stop at the time. He has yet to publicly acknowledge defeat, but has nonetheless authorized the transition of power.</p>

                            <p><strong>The $44 billion buyout will allegedly allow “large foreign investors” to access sensitive company information, the Treasury claims</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A US federal agency is looking into whether it has the legal authority to investigate Elon Musk&rsquo;s recent purchase of Twitter, the Washington Post reports, suggesting the government is interested in the billionaire&rsquo;s alleged <em>&ldquo;ties to foreign governments and investors.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Officials at the US Treasury Department have requested approval to begin a probe into the Twitter deal, multiple unnamed sources <a href="https://archive.ph/0nkgm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the Post</a> on Tuesday. Though they noted that <em>&ldquo;preliminary examinations&rdquo;</em> do not always warrant a full investigation and are <em>&ldquo;fairly routine,&rdquo;</em> the sources said Musk&rsquo;s supposed connections abroad have piqued officials&rsquo; concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Separately, the Post also reported that under the terms of the $44 billion purchase, foreign investors will have access to <em>&ldquo;confidential information about Twitter&rsquo;s finances,&rdquo;</em> and possibly its users. The outlet said it was not clear whether the Treasury Department was aware of those details, however, as officials did not elaborate on the exact nature of the probe.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1587091085288947712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demanded</a> an investigation into the Twitter deal, voicing concerns that foreign powers will have sway over the social media giant. He cited Saudi Arabia by name, likely referring to reports that Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz is now Twitter&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2022/10/31/saudi-prince-alwaleed-becomes-twitters-second-largest-shareholder/?sh=6a26b4a7523a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second-largest investor</a> behind Musk. The lawmaker called for a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a body authorized to reject major investment deals based on &lsquo;national security&rsquo; considerations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The White House previously considered a <em>&ldquo;national security review&rdquo;</em> for the Twitter acquisition, according to the Post, though it&rsquo;s unclear what decision was ultimately made. The FBI also reportedly <em>&ldquo;looked into the potential counterintelligence risks posed by the deal&rdquo;</em> last spring, but it is also unknown whether any further action was taken by the bureau.</p>

            <p>US troops currently stationed in Poland on a temporary basis will be there for <em>&ldquo;a long time,&rdquo;</em> President Joe Biden said on Wednesday. The comment was made in passing following an event at the White House, and Biden did not elaborate. Warsaw has asked Washington to permanently garrison troops in Poland, but that would technically violate a NATO treaty with Russia.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Polish Radio correspondent Marek Walkuski called out a question about US troops as Biden was leaving the East Room.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be there for a long time,&rdquo;</em> the US president replied, walking away.</p>
<p>It is unknown how many US troops are currently in Poland, NATO&rsquo;s main logistical hub for supporting the government in neighboring Ukraine. In May, the US ambassador in Warsaw <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/555770-poland-us-troops-record/">revealed</a> that over 12,600 American military personnel were in the country, the largest number in history.&nbsp;</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The teenage climate activist also blamed “racism” for warming the planet</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Swedish eco-activist Greta Thunberg has turned her attention to the political arena, calling for the downfall of capitalism, which she claimed is responsible for climate change.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old climate campaigner launched her book &ndash; &lsquo;The Climate Book&rsquo; &ndash; in London on Sunday night, telling the audience that the world is <em>&ldquo;never going back to normal again.&rdquo;</em> She argued that global warming can only be solved by a<em> &ldquo;system-wide transformation,&rdquo;</em> according to a write-up of the event by the Telegraph.</p>
<p>The capitalist system, Thunberg continued, is <em>&ldquo;defined by colonialism, imperialism, oppression and genocide by the so-called global North to accumulate wealth that still shapes our current world order.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If economic growth is our only priority, then what we are experiencing now should be exactly what we should be expecting,&rdquo;</em> she added, before calling the extraction of fossil fuels <em>&ldquo;racist.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>As some of Thunberg&rsquo;s critics pointed out online, global living standards have broadly risen&nbsp;under capitalism, while carbon emissions have fallen in the capitalist USA since the turn of the millennium. Thunberg replied&nbsp;to these critics on Wednesday, stating that she is not advocating for a return to <em>&ldquo;socialism, liberalism, communism, conservatism, centrism, you name it,&rdquo;</em> which she said <em>&ldquo;have all failed.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Thunberg, who has previously been criticized for failing to offer solutions to the problems she outlines, did not say what kind of system she would replace capitalism with.</p>
<p>Shooting to fame after she organized a series of school walk-outs in her native Sweden in 2018, Thunberg has since delivered her dramatic predictions of ecological armageddon to lawmakers across the Western world, to UN summits, and to the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s yearly gatherings at Davos, Switzerland. WEF founder Klaus Schwab is also an advocate of radically restructuring the global order, a vision&nbsp;he calls <em>&ldquo;the Great Reset.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Despite spending several years on the globalist circuit, Thunberg will skip the UN COP27 climate conference in Egypt next week, telling her audience that she now views the summit as a <em>&ldquo;scam&rdquo;</em> and an example of <em>&ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo;</em> &ndash; an attempt by politicians to falsely portray themselves as environmentally friendly.&nbsp;</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Twitter users had earlier fact-checked the text and claimed it was actually bragging about sky-high inflation</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration has quietly deleted from the official White House account a tweet posted on Tuesday that praised a big increase in Social Security payments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The move came after users had appended a fact-check arguing the president was effectively boasting about the high inflation rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Seniors are getting the biggest increase in their Social Security checks in 10 years through President Biden&rsquo;s leadership</em>,&rdquo; the tweet read. A skeptical user had added a note clarifying that the size of the cost-of-living increase is calculated proportional to inflation, meaning a record increase in one reflects a record increase in the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Biden social media geniuses are giving Biden credit for the biggest Social Security COLA in 10 years, but neglect to mention that SS COLA is an automatic formula based on government inflation metric (CPI). 🤦‍♂️ <a href="https://t.co/1trGTRI9iV">pic.twitter.com/1trGTRI9iV</a></p>&mdash; Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) <a href="https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1587790124045279233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>The text was deleted on Wednesday without explanation. An administration official later told Fox News the reason for the removal was that &ldquo;<em>the point was incomplete.</em>&rdquo; White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded similarly during a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, explaining the tweet had been posted &ldquo;<em>without context</em>&rdquo; before attempting to add that context. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Because Medicare premiums will decline in 2023 for the first time in a decade, American seniors will have &ldquo;<em>a chance to get ahead of inflation</em>&rdquo; thanks to the &ldquo;rare combination of rising benefits and falling [Medicare] premiums,&rdquo; Jean-Pierre explained. &ldquo;<em>And let&rsquo;s not forget about MAGA Republicans in Congress and their continued threat to threaten Social Security and Medicare</em>,&rdquo; she added, insisting both would be &ldquo;<em>on the chopping block</em>&rdquo; under a Republican government.</p>

<p>Unlike official Twitter fact-checks, Wednesday&rsquo;s &lsquo;community note&rsquo; about the link between Social Security payment increases and inflation was added by ordinary users and voted up to the point where it appeared on the White House tweet. This is a relatively recent feature the platform&rsquo;s newly-minted owner Elon Musk had described earlier that day. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Inflation has reached a 40-year high under the Biden administration, boosting the Social Security cost-of-living increase to 8.7% for 2023, the largest hike since 1981. With less than a week to go before the mid-term elections, nearly half of the respondents to a poll conducted last week said inflation (or &ldquo;<em>the economy</em>&rdquo; in general) was the most important issue they would consider when voting.</p>]]>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The former CIA director allegedly violated the Fourth Amendment rights of Julian Assange and his guests at the Ecuadorian embassy</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has been served with papers for a lawsuit alleging he directed a criminal conspiracy violating the Fourth Amendment rights of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and his guests by spying on them at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.</p>
<p>Video of a process server handing the ex-CIA director the legal papers last week at a fundraising dinner was posted by Wikileaks to social media on Tuesday. In the clip, a bemused Pompeo can be seen handing over the papers, unread, to an aide.</p>
<p>A group of over 100 US citizens &ndash; including lawyers, journalists, and doctors &ndash; sued the CIA and Pompeo in August for allegedly violating their Fourth Amendment privacy rights by spying on them when they met with the Wikileaks publisher in 2017 and 2018 at the embassy, where he was under de facto house arrest.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Michael Richard Pompeo: You&#39;ve been served!&quot;<br><br>Mike Pompeo has been served with a lawsuit brought by US lawyers and journalists who visited <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Assange?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Assange</a>. Spanish court documents show violations of their US constitutional rights. Plaintiffs are represented by NY attorney Richard Roth. <a href="https://t.co/ZH4HVOPnlo">pic.twitter.com/ZH4HVOPnlo</a></p>&mdash; WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/1587782283196612610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>According to the lawsuit, Assange&rsquo;s visitors were required to turn over their cell phones to private security contractor Undercover Global SL, which then copied data from the devices and handed it over to the CIA &ndash; unbeknownst to the Ecuadorian government, which had hired the firm to provide security at the embassy. Undercover Global SL also recorded conversations between Assange and his visitors on behalf of the CIA, the suit claims, adding that Pompeo explicitly authorized and approved the theft of data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pompeo, who served as secretary of state under former US president Donald Trump, was summoned as a witness to a Spanish court in June to testify regarding claims by multiple former US security officials that the CIA had contemplated kidnapping or killing Assange following Wikileaks&rsquo; 2017 release of the Vault 7 documents.</p>
<p>The leak revealed top-secret hacking tools and reportedly constituted the &ldquo;<em>largest data loss in CIA history.</em>&rdquo; Pompeo specifically wanted revenge, one official told Yahoo News last year. However, no plan was ultimately approved, as White House lawyers pointed out it was highly illegal and the UK refused to allow such an operation on British soil.</p>

<p>Assange has been locked up at Belmarsh prison since 2019, when he was stripped of his Ecuadorian citizenship after seven years of living in the country&rsquo;s London embassy. He is currently fighting extradition to the US, where he faces conspiracy and espionage charges carrying up to 175 years in prison stemming from Wikileaks&rsquo; publication of top-secret Pentagon documents.</p>
<p>While a judge ruled last year that Assange should not be sent to the US due to his declining mental health, Washington appealed the ruling and secured a more favorable decision. His attorneys filed an appeal in August.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Twitter’s new owner hailed the ability to fact check the White House, as he continues to reform the site</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Elon Musk has vowed to make Twitter the world&rsquo;s most accurate source of information, stating that his platform allows regular users to debunk confusing claims by the US government. However, he added that he will allow a coalition of censorship advocates a say in shaping its policies.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our goal is to make Twitter the most accurate source of information on Earth, without regard to political affiliation,&rdquo;</em> Musk tweeted on Wednesday, under a screenshot of a user adding context to a misleading claim by the White House.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The community notes feature is awesome. <br><br>Our goal is to make Twitter the most accurate source of information on Earth, without regard to political affiliation.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587798343622737925?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Using Twitter&rsquo;s limited &lsquo;Community Notes&rsquo; feature, a user pointed out that a claim by the administration of US President Joe Biden that <em>&ldquo;seniors are getting the biggest increase in their Social Security checks in 10 years through President Biden&rsquo;s leadership&rdquo;</em> lacks context. Instead, the increase accounts for the rising cost of living, as inflation has climbed from 1.4% to 8.2% during Biden&rsquo;s time in office.</p>
<p>Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion last week, and immediately set about making changes to the business. The billionaire has since dissolved Twitter&rsquo;s board of directors, announced plans to <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/565768-musk-twitter-tick-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">charge users</a> for verification, and declared his intent to serve as the company&rsquo;s CEO.</p>
<p>While Musk stated that his acquisition of Twitter was aimed at bringing the platform back to its free speech roots, he has not yet made any changes to its content moderation policies. In a tweet on Tuesday, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587668703834955778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that he had met with <em>&ldquo;civil society leaders,&rdquo;</em> including representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, Color of Change and the George Bush Presidential Center, and would include such groups on Twitter&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;content moderation council.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>All of these organizations have <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/543327-adl-soros-fox-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advocated</a> for <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/497863-facebook-hate-jews-blackface-censorship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/topics/american-democracy/combating-disinformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">censorship</a> in various forms, and Twitter&rsquo;s current Head of Safety &amp; Integrity Yoel Roth is on record calling the supporters of former President Donald Trump <em>&ldquo;actual Nazis.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a>,<br><br>I want you to succeed at Twitter.<br><br>This critique is based only on cold hard facts:<br><br>You will never restore &quot;public trust&quot; at Twitter when the guy in charge thinks 100,000,000 Americans who support America First are &quot;Literal Nazis&quot;<br><br>Not possible.<a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@yoyoel</a> must go <a href="https://t.co/yUAabQPgdo">pic.twitter.com/yUAabQPgdo</a></p>&mdash; Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) <a href="https://twitter.com/bennyjohnson/status/1587799757824692225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Conservative pundit Benny Johnson urged Musk to fire Roth, along with anyone else who took part in Twitter&rsquo;s censorship of damaging information from Hunter Biden&rsquo;s laptop. Johnson also called on Musk to ensure that conservatives are represented on Twitter&rsquo;s safety board.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Absolutely agreed that the Twitter safety board should have people from all viewpoints,&rdquo;</em> the SpaceX and Tesla CEO replied.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The Pentagon “anticipates” delivering the weapons systems by mid-2023</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Ukraine is expected to soon receive a number of so-called VAMPIRE counter-drone systems, according to Pentagon press secretary Pat Ryder, who confirmed Washington&rsquo;s commitment to supply Kiev with air defense capabilities. The statement came amid Russia&rsquo;s continued strikes targeting Ukraine&rsquo;s energy infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Ryder said the US government has yet to secure a contract for the laser-guided missile launchers but expects one to be reached within the next few months. <em>&ldquo;Right now we&rsquo;re anticipating delivery to be mid-2023,&rdquo;</em> he explained, noting that <em>&ldquo;air defense continues to be a priority.&rdquo;</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The VAMPIRE, or Vehicle-Agnostic Modular Palletized ISR Rocket Equipment, can be installed on the cargo bed of almost any civilian truck and uses laser-guided munitions capable of hitting both ground and airborne targets, including unmanned aerial vehicles. Although it is not explicitly advertised as an anti-drone weapon, systems similar to the VAMPIRE have been used extensively in Ukraine for that purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These systems are part of a $3 billion arms package for Ukraine announced by the Pentagon back in August. This also includes the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS, which Washington also says will be arriving in Ukraine <em>&ldquo;in the very near future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>

<![CDATA[
    

<p>On Tuesday, a Pentagon official stated that the US had committed a total of eight NASAMS and the corresponding munitions, and that two of them would be in Ukraine soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kiev has been demanding more advanced air defense systems ever since Russia shifted its military tactics in Ukraine to use inexpensive kamikaze drones to cripple Ukraine&rsquo;s energy infrastructure. Kiev&rsquo;s Soviet-era and NATO-supplied air defense systems have so far been unable to effectively stop the Russian UAVs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of regions in Ukraine, including Kiev, Zaporozhye, Dnepropetrovsk, and Kharkov have been experiencing regular blackouts since the massive strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities began. The change in the Russian approach came after Moscow accused Kiev of terrorist attacks on its infrastructure, including the strategic Crimean Bridge.</p>]]>

<p>The Sunni Saudis have long been at odds with the Shia Iranians, relying on US military hardware and bases for protection. However, the US has <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/564512-biden-warns-opec-consequences/">threatened</a> to freeze military cooperation with Saudi Arabia after OPEC+ announced an oil production cut against US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s wishes.

            <p>Serbian air defenses have shot down a commercial drone near the boundary with Kosovo, the government in Belgrade announced on Wednesday. The incident comes a day after President Aleksandar Vucic issued a shoot-on-sight order for any UAVs violating Serbian airspace.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The drone was detected and followed in the sky over the Raska garrison and came from the direction of Mt. Kopaonik, the Serbian military said in a statement, adding the UAV was <em>&ldquo;brought down using electronic jamming measures.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The skies over Serbia are safe,&rdquo;</em> Defense Minister Milos Vucevic told reporters on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We did not use cannons but the most modern [electronic] equipment,&rdquo;</em> Vucevic added. <em>&ldquo;This shows we are serious. We do not threaten anyone, we aren&rsquo;t saber-rattling, but we are determined to protect Serbia and its freedom and independence.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>According to the newspaper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.novosti.rs/c/vesti/politika/1169191/hitno-vojska-srbije-oglasila-oborenom-dronu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vecernje Novosti</a>, the drone came down somewhere on Mt. Kopaonik. Military search parties expect to locate it before Thursday morning.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;In accordance with the standing orders of the president and commander in chief, the Serbian Army will continue to shoot down any UAVs entering restricted airspace or approaching military installations,&rdquo;</em> the military said.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Vucic announced the shoot-down order on Tuesday, after two MiG-29 interceptors were deployed against multiple UAVs spotted above the military bases in Raska.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Novosti cited unconfirmed reports that the drone was a commercial model and was used to scout the area, which is near the boundary with the&nbsp;province of Kosovo.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Kosovo was occupied by&nbsp;NATO in 1999 and declared independence in 2008 with US support. Belgrade refuses to recognize the breakaway province, a position supported by Russia and China.<strong><br /></strong></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>After the murder of a 12-year-old girl, the French government says it seeks a new immigration bill that will be “hardline”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>France will introduce tough immigration legislation next year, making it easier to deport foreign criminals, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told Le Monde on Wednesday. Under pressure from the right, Paris is <em>&ldquo;changing gear,&rdquo;</em> Darmanin said.</p>
<p>The bill will be debated in parliament in early 2023. While its specific provisions remain to be hammered out, the minister said that it will allow the police and courts to punish criminal aliens more effectively, while making it easier for legal immigrants to obtain work permits to shore up the country&rsquo;s labor demand.</p>
<p>One of its measures, Darmanin explained, will strip away three-quarters of the existing grounds for illegal immigrants to appeal deportation orders. The government will also remove access to social services for those set to be deported, remove rules barring long-term residents from deportation, and force the local authorities to act on expulsion orders.</p>

<p>According to Le Monde, France issued 122,000 expulsion orders in 2021 but only enforced 3,200 in the last two years. Although foreigners make up 7% of the French population, they are responsible for 19% of crimes, according to figures cited by both Darmanin and French President Emmanuel Macron. In Paris, foreigners are responsible for half of all crimes.</p>
<p>While pro-migrant activists say that many of these crimes are trivial, the latest push to tighten up immigration law comes after the body of a 12-year-old girl was found in a suitcase in Paris with her throat cut last month. The suspect, charged with raping and murdering the schoolgirl, is an Algerian woman who had been issued a deportation order two months previously.</p>
<p>With right-wing politician Eric Zemmour describing the murder as <em>&ldquo;Francocide&rdquo;</em> and National Rally leader Marine Le Pen demanding that the government stop <em>&ldquo;out-of-control illegal immigration,&rdquo;</em> Darmanin said that by tackling the problem, he would seek to deny the right<em> &ldquo;political fuel.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It is up to us to enact the strong &ndash; sometimes even hardline &ndash; measures that the French want or need, otherwise others will do it for us,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
<p>Macron has long been pressed by the right to harden his immigration policies, as migrant camps became a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/428486-paris-rich-against-migrant-camp/">familiar</a><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/530628-paris-homeless-migrant-camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> sight</a> on Paris streets under his leadership.

                            <p><strong>Oslo is deliberately stoking tensions by raising its military alert level, the Russian Foreign Ministry has said</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Norway&rsquo;s decision to put its armed forces on heightened alert amid the Ukraine conflict and Moscow&rsquo;s stand-off with the West is <em>&ldquo;unprecedented,&rdquo;</em> Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Tuesday, adding that any unfriendly actions by Oslo will not go unanswered.</p>
<p>Speaking at a regular press briefing, Zakharova noted that the move wouldn&rsquo;t have been of any concern to Moscow except for one <em>&ldquo;important detail.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Basically, such an unprecedented step is justified &ndash; as you can easily guess &ndash; by the actions of Russia, which &lsquo;brought about the most serious security policy situation in Europe&rsquo;,&rdquo;</em> she said.</p>
<p>Denying this allegation, Zakharova insisted that it was the West that was to blame for tensions with Moscow.<em> &ldquo;This was brought upon by your actions, not ours &hellip; You are the ones who have destabilized the situation on the European continent.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The spokeswoman went on to warn that while Moscow was open to having a conversation based on mutual respect, it would also respond to any <em>&ldquo;unfriendly&rdquo;</em> steps by Oslo.</p>

<p>She also denounced what she called attempts to <em>&ldquo;ramp up the threat from the East, smear our country and attribute to it things it is not doing&rdquo;</em> by Norway. By doing so, the spokeswoman argued, Oslo was trying <em>&ldquo;to disguise its own aspirations in terms of military preparations.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Zakharova added that Russia regards such actions close to its borders as Norway&rsquo;s bid to <em>&ldquo;deliberately follow destructive policies&rdquo;</em> meant <em>&ldquo;to stir up regional tensions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Zakharova&rsquo;s comments came after Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store announced that Oslo had raised the readiness level of its armed forces from phase 0 &ndash; a normal situation &ndash; to phase 1 on Monday. Explaining the move, the prime minister claimed Norway had found itself <em>&ldquo;in the most serious security policy situation in the past several decades,&rdquo;</em> while warning that since Russia is now <em>&ldquo;experiencing great resistance&rdquo;</em> on the ground in Ukraine, Moscow could be <em>&ldquo;resorting to other means&rdquo;</em> in its military campaign.</p>

            <p>Western countries are waging an information war not only against Russia but also the entire international community, Vassily Nebenzia, Moscow's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Speaking at a presentation at the UN of the RT documentary &lsquo;Journalists Under Fire,&rsquo; the top diplomat spoke of the massive media pressure on his country, especially since the Ukraine conflict escalated in February.</p>
<p>Nebenzia noted that Western coverage of the situation is typified by<em> &ldquo;a huge number of &lsquo;fakes&rsquo; about the activities of the [Russian] military, as well as about the goals, objectives and motives&rdquo;</em> of its campaign in Ukraine.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no secret that the West has launched a real information war against us, which affects not only the residents of Russia and Ukraine but also people around the world,&rdquo;</em> he reiterated.</p>

<p>He went on to compare Western media coverage with actual Ukrainian bombings of civilian infrastructure. <em>&ldquo;Just as Western weapons are now targeting cities in the Donbass and the liberated territories, Western propaganda is firing &lsquo;information shells&rsquo; at its own citizens,&rdquo;</em> he claimed.</p>
<p>According to Nebenzia, the media onslaught is harmful to ordinary people, who <em>&ldquo;are losing touch with reality, become distressed and confused&rdquo;</em> when being overwhelmed with an endless barrage of falsehoods. They also lose the ability to think critically, he claimed.</p>
<p>After Russia launched its military operation against Ukraine, Western countries unleashed an unprecedented crackdown on Russian media abroad, with the European Union banning RT and Sputnik channels. Moscow has repeatedly criticized the move, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claiming that it has shown the world the true worth of so-called Western values.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>North Korea continued its show of force, launching a ballistic missile across the maritime border, Seoul says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>North Korea fired around 100 artillery shells and six more missiles into the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan, known to Koreans as the East Sea, on Wednesday, Seoul&rsquo;s military has said.</p>
<p>The statement came hours after South Korea&rsquo;s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) reported that the North had launched at least 17 ballistic and other missiles, one of which crossed the so-called Northern Limit Line (NLL), the de facto maritime border, for the first time since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The JCS described the move as <em>&ldquo;very rare and intolerable.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the JCS, the shells were&nbsp;fired from the North&rsquo;s Kangwon Province, which borders South Korea. The JCS said that Pyongyang&nbsp;began its missile barrage at around 6:50am local time by launching four short-range ballistic missiles into the Yellow Sea from the northeastern Pyongan Province, and two hours later fired three more from the vicinity of the eastern city of Wonsan.</p>
<p>In response to the launches, South Korean F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets fired three air-to-surface missiles into the sea across the NLL.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our military&rsquo;s response reaffirms our resolve to sternly respond to any provocations and shows that we are capable of accurately striking our enemy,&rdquo;</em> the JCS said, adding that the South&rsquo;s missiles had flown an equivalent distance as the ones fired by the North.</p>

<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said the launch beyond the NLL is <em>&ldquo;an actual invasion&rdquo;</em> of the country&rsquo;s territory and that the North&rsquo;s actions will not damage Seoul&rsquo;s alliance with the US, according to his office.</p>
<p>Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada told reporters that Pyongyang fired at least two ballistic missiles, but that they fell outside of Japan&rsquo;s exclusive economic zone. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launches as <em>&ldquo;absolutely unacceptable.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apparent show of force came as the US and South Korea are conducting the week-long annual &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; exercise, during which around 240 warplanes are performing roughly 1,600 sorties, the largest number in the drill&rsquo;s history, according to the US Pacific Air Forces.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the North Korean Foreign Ministry on Tuesday denounced the drill as escalatory and warned of <em>&ldquo;more powerful follow-up measures.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>Pyongyang has said previously that it considers joint US-South Korean exercises a threat to its security. Pak Jong-chon, a senior official at the ruling Workers&rsquo; Party of Korea, stated that Washington and Seoul will <em>&ldquo;pay the most horrible price in history&rdquo;</em> if they use force against the North.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>“Support remains” for Kiev, but Rome’s new government is concerned about the country’s own defenses, according to a new report</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Rome is easing up on its arms supplies to Ukraine amid Kiev&rsquo;s ongoing military conflict with Russia, Il Messaggero reported on Tuesday, citing sources within the Italian government that claim no new weapons packages are under consideration at the moment.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Although new Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has pledged to honor Kiev&rsquo;s request for more military assistance and advanced air defense systems, the outlet says all arms shipments to Ukraine are currently on stand-by.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Only and only because it is first necessary to coordinate with NATO and go into detail on Ukraine&rsquo;s military requests. Only then will we understand what Kiev needs and what armaments we will be able to supply,&rdquo;</em> government officials reportedly told Il Messaggero.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is expected to visit Italy in the coming days to meet with Meloni and Italian Defense Minister Giulio Crosetto. Together, they are expected to discuss what weapons are essential to defend Kiev and work to solve three key issues before military shipments can resume.</p>
<p>The first one being Kiev&rsquo;s request for the very expensive SAMP-T surface-to-air anti-aircraft missile systems. According to Italy&rsquo;s Defense Ministry, the country only has a few of these systems at its disposal and if it were to deliver some of them to Kiev, it would risk weakening its own air defense capabilities. Il Messaggero notes that this issue could result in Rome sending other weapon systems to Kiev instead.</p>

<p>Italy has also yet to completely fulfill delivery of five arms packages already pledged to Ukraine. <em>&ldquo;We have to complete the job, before facing a new one,&rdquo;</em> sources told the outlet.</p>
<p>Finally, in order for any new weapons packages to be approved for Kiev, the minister of defense must discuss the issue with the Parliamentary Committee on Services, which is still not operational following the recent elections in Italy.</p>
<p>Despite this temporary delay in approving a sixth weapons package for Ukraine, Italy&rsquo;s new government insists that military support for Kiev is <em>&ldquo;not in question.&rdquo;</em> Meloni, who recently became the country&rsquo;s first female prime minister, told parliament last week that the only way to facilitate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is by helping Kiev defend itself militarily.</p>
<p>Russia, meanwhile, has repeatedly warned the West against pumping Ukraine with weapons, insisting that it would only prolong the conflict and lead to more bloodshed.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Warsaw has accused Moscow of planning to facilitate illegal crossings from Kaliningrad</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Poland has ordered the construction of a 210km barrier along the entire Russian-Polish border. Announcing the details, Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak accused Moscow of planning to arrange for Asian and African migrants to illegally cross into the EU state through the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move follows reports that Kaliningrad began accepting flights from North Africa and the Middle East, Blaszczak told reporters on Wednesday, as officials in Warsaw expressed concern over a repeat of the 2021 migrant crisis on the border with Belarus.</p>
<p>In October, the head of Khrabrovo airport in Kaliningrad, Aleksandr Korytny, said the hub will actively work to attract airlines from the Persian Gulf, as well as Asia. The official cited the <em>&rdquo;special geographical position&rdquo;</em> of the airport as a bonus for the new carriers. Still, the measure was announced only as a plan for now.</p>
<p>Blaszczak said the barrier between Poland and the Russian exclave will consist of three lines of razor wire.</p>
<p>Construction of the barrier will begin this Wednesday, with preparatory work carried out by Polish soldiers specialized in demining, the defense minister said.</p>
<p>Last year, the border between Poland and Belarus became the site of a major crisis as thousands of migrants attempted to illegally cross into the EU state. Warsaw has since constructed a steel wall along the border with Belarus and has accused Minsk of acting on Russia&rsquo;s behalf to wage a <em>&ldquo;hybrid war&rdquo;</em> and sow chaos and division within the EU.</p>
<p>Both Moscow and Minsk have denied these accusations. Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko explained that his government simply did not have enough money in the budget to stop illegal immigration due to the EU&rsquo;s sanctions.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the West of using the migrant crisis to put pressure on Minsk.</p>
<p>Earlier, when the idea of a fortified border between Russia and Poland was first suggested by the general secretary of Poland&rsquo;s ruling Law and Justice Party, Krzysztof Sobolewski, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow <em>&ldquo;cannot and is not going to interfere with such decisions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;History every time proves the silliness of decisions to build walls, because over the years or decades, all walls fall,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
<p>In late September, Russia's Air Transport Agency introduced an &lsquo;open skies&rsquo; policy at the airport in Kaliningrad, which was meant to increase the accessibility of the region and solve issues prompted by the closure of EU airspace for all Russian airlines. Under the regime, foreign airlines are allowed to travel not only between their home nations and Russia, but can also conduct flights from Kaliningrad to other countries.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Olaf Scholz’s upcoming visit to China is a message that Washington can’t dictate Berlin’s foreign policy</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3197667/german-chancellor-olaf-scholz-visit-china-next-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set to visit China</a> this week. It marks his first ever trip to the Asian country, amidst growing tensions between&nbsp;Beijing and the West. But the decision to make the trip and the timing behind it is no coincidence. Scholz is sending a deliberate message to the US that Germany isn&rsquo;t going to close the door on China, as Washington attempts to force countries to take a side.</p>
<p>In fact, he even made an explicit warning against &lsquo;decoupling&rsquo;, something the US has also been pushing for, as seen with its aggressive semiconductor-related sanctions last month. But there&rsquo;s more. Germany also approved a Chinese ownership stake in a critical port, as well as the takeover of a semiconductor company. It&rsquo;s all part of that same message.</p>
<p>Germany has the most open and enthusiastic policy towards China in Europe, or at least it did. Strengthening ties with Beijing was a critical focus for the government of Angela Merkel, who saw China as its biggest and most lucrative export market for automobile and engineering products.</p>

<p>But the US has always resented this. The US wants to politically dominate Europe, including Germany. It seeks for Berlin to be a lapdog who uncritically follows its foreign policy agenda. Therefore, the US has long raged against open German foreign policy towards both Moscow and Beijing. It funds <a href="https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/88210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">think-tanks</a> to aggressively lobby Berlin to follow transatlantic goals, an overt form of foreign influence in the country.</p>
<p>When the conflict in Ukraine broke out, the US believed all its Christmases had come at once and Washington now had the perfect opportunity to make Berlin follow its agenda, and for a while it certainly seemed like that. Olaf Scholz is no Angela Merkel, and at the very least he has talked the talk for most of this year concerning Germany&rsquo;s foreign policy.</p>
<p>Until reality hit. The costs of the American-led crusade against both Russia and China are exorbitant for Germany and its resource-sparse, export-heavy economy. Germany is facing crippling levels of inflation, its trade surplus has been wiped out by a surge in energy costs which has culled manufacturing, and what&rsquo;s worse is that this entire situation has been to America&rsquo;s own benefit. This prompted rare criticism from French President Emmanuel Macron, who effectively said the US was using the conflict to exploit Europe.</p>
<p>This has led Germany to hedge its foreign policy options and reassert &ldquo;<em>strategic autonomy</em>&rdquo; from the US. The US has devoted considerable effort to trying to sabotage the China-EU relationship, making this a bold act on Scholz&rsquo;s behalf. While he will have the support of France, which is usually unified with Germany on foreign policy, it will be a struggle to get the entirety of the European Union to follow. The US has gained an ironclad grip over many EU nations, with the exception of Hungary. This has allowed the US to use small countries, such as Lithuania, to drive wedges in the China-EU relationship, making it impossible for the EU to collectively engage with China in a positive way.</p>

<p>To make it worse, the EU institution itself (beyond the member states) has also become increasingly <a href="https://gcaptain.com/eu-warns-germany-against-china-port-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aggressive and vocal</a> concerning China, with leading commissioners such as Ursula von der Leyen being very pro-US. This means the EU&rsquo;s China policy will continue to be a struggle and tug-of-war concerning multiple agendas. Germany may be the most powerful state, but is even wrestling with itself in respect to its China policy. This means that while Scholz is intent on sending a message to the US in regards to China, one which has been met with a tidal wave of US-centric <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/eu-industry-chief-issues-china-warning-ahead-scholzs-beijing-visit-2022-10-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">media negativity</a>, it is going to be challenging to maintain the closeness of the Merkel years.</p>
<p>But one message is otherwise clear: European countries should be able to take their own path and the US has no right to demand their absolute compliance and obedience regarding their own foreign policy goals. Germany&rsquo;s post-war prosperity is built on being a great power that pursues openness and stable ties with other countries, including geopolitical rivals.&nbsp;The Biden administration, meanwhile, has run roughshod imposing its will on Europe. This move by Scholz is an early indication that Berlin is not ready to be Washington's puppet in every respect at the cost of its own wellbeing.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The Brazilian president stopped short of admitting defeat, but authorized the transition of power</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro failed to concede defeat in his first public remarks since Sunday&rsquo;s national election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, his chief of staff Ciro Nogueira claimed that the incumbent had authorized him to begin the transition process for handing over power.</p>
<p>The news came after ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva managed to claim victory over Bolsonaro by a narrow margin.</p>
<p>In a brief speech on Tuesday, breaking his two-day silence, the right-wing president did not directly address the election results, and avoided mentioning the winner by name, though he did vow to abide by the rules set out in the constitution.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I have always been labelled as antidemocratic and, unlike my accusers, I have always played within the four lines of the constitution,&rdquo;</em> he stated.</p>
<p>He also commented on the widespread protests by his supporters that erupted during the two days of his silence, describing them as <em>&ldquo;the fruit of indignation and a sense of injustice about the way the electoral process took place.&rdquo;</em> While he did not urge them to go back home, he said they should not destroy property.</p>

<p>Later, Nogueira signaled he would work with the new government to carry out the transfer of power. <em>&ldquo;President Jair Messias Bolsonaro authorized me, when it is time, based on the law, to start the transition process,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Before the presidential election, Bolsonaro had repeatedly claimed that Brazil&rsquo;s electronic voting system is open to fraud, and accused the election authorities of favoring Lula. His criticism appears to echo statements made by former US President Donald Trump &ndash; a leader he has had warm relations with &ndash; who has repeatedly claimed that the 2020 US election was stolen from him. Both Trump and Bolsonaro have failed to provide evidence to support their allegations.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro lost the second round of the election to former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who won by a thin margin of 50.9% against the incumbent&rsquo;s 49.1%. The president-elect is set to officially take office on January 1, 2023.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Government wanted Rumble to remove Russian news sources, which it refused to do, the platform has said</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Rumble, a Toronto-based video hosting service similar to YouTube, which touts itself as pro-freedom of speech, has announced that users in France will no longer be able to access the site. The suspension came after a demand by Paris to remove some Russian news sources, the company added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The video hosting service said it was committed to not moving the <em>&ldquo;goalposts&rdquo;</em> on its policy of platforming users with <em>&ldquo;unpopular views.&rdquo;</em> It has challenged the legality of the French order, but for now, access in France will be disabled, the statement on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>Rumble added that the decision will not impact the company materially, since less than 1% of its user base was viewing videos from France. It expressed hope that Paris will reconsider its demand and allow Rumble to operate in the country again.</p>
<p>CEO Chris Pavlovski shared the news on Twitter &ndash; in a reply to a tweet by Elon Musk in which he reported that he resisted pressure by some governments to ban Russian news sources on his Starlink satellite broadband service. In the post from March, Musk declared himself a <em>&ldquo;free speech absolutist&rdquo;</em> and promised not to yield <em>&ldquo;unless at gunpoint.&rdquo;</em> The billionaire purchased Twitter last month and pledged to overhaul its controversial content moderation policies.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The French Government has demanded that Rumble (<a href="https://twitter.com/rumblevideo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rumblevideo</a>) block Russian news sources.

<p>Journalist Glenn Greenwald contrasted Rumble&rsquo;s reaction to France&rsquo;s demands to the close cooperation between other American tech companies and the US government. <em>&ldquo;Thankfully, Rumble told France to f**k itself,&rdquo;</em> he <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1587552154977378304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>A report in The Intercept, a news outlet which Greenwald co-founded and later resigned from, revealed last week that US federal agencies and major US-based Big Tech firms have been working hand-in-glove to suppress what Washington deems to be <em>&ldquo;misinformation,&rdquo;</em> including the factually true Hunter Biden laptop story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenwald left The Intercept in October 2020 due to its refusal to print in full his analysis of Big Tech and media censorship of the laptop story. He has since partnered with Rumble and is in the process of launching a talk show on the platform, which he said <em>&ldquo;has no desire to be anything other than a content-neutral free speech platform.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>France, like other EU nations, banned Russian government-funded news outlets, including RT, after the launch of Moscow&rsquo;s military operation in Ukraine. Major platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are enforcing the ban by blocking people in the EU from accessing content from these sources.</p>
<p>Musk declared last week after his acquisition of Twitter that <em>&ldquo;the bird is freed,&rdquo;</em> but the EU leadership seemed to pour cold water on the notion. <em>&ldquo;In Europe, the bird will fly by our rules,&rdquo;</em> Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner for the internal market, said.</p>]]>

<p>The Chinese authorities have ordered&nbsp;that&nbsp;a key industrial area in the city of Zhengzhou be quarantined. The decision throws a wrench into the works for Apple, as this will affect an iPhone assembly plant which is crucial for the rollout of the new 14 series.</p>
<p>The Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone (ZAEZ) was placed under <em>&ldquo;static lockdown&rdquo;</em> on Wednesday for at least a week, according to a statement released by the local government. This means that all non-essential business and travel has been suspended in the district. People were ordered to work from home if possible, unless they join the volunteer forces for Covid-19 prevention.</p>
<p>The move comes on the back of a reported exodus of workers from a plant in ZAEZ run by Foxconn Technology Group, which assembles iPhone devices. A video shared on Chinese social media last week shows people leaving the facility on foot because public transportation in the city was restricted over Covid-19 concerns.</p>
<p>The factory employs around 300,000 workers. The walkout was apparently caused by an outbreak of the disease on the premises and fears of a full lockdown. Foxconn promised on Sunday to provide transportation for those who want to leave, as well as sanitary work conditions and daily PCR tests for those who wish to stay.</p>

<p>Some cities in the Henan province in central China, where Zhengzhou is located, offered assistance to workers, urging them to ask for buses to bring them to their hometowns. They are expected to undergo a quarantine.</p>
<p>The factory was previously placed under a &lsquo;closed-loop management&rsquo; system, which involves limiting the movement of employees in the compound to prevent the transmission of infections. According to Reuters, the plant experienced a sharp decrease in output, projected to cause a monthly slump of up to 30%.</p>
<p>The Chinese government maintains a zero-tolerance policy regarding Covid-19, imposing lockdowns to quash outbreaks. The Hanan province reported 359 new cases on Wednesday, up from 103 on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Foxconn&rsquo;s plant in Zhengzhou is touted as the world&rsquo;s largest iPhone assembly facility. According to an estimate cited by Bloomberg, it is responsible for 80% of capacity for the new iPhone 14 series, including more than 85% of capacity for the iPhone 14 Pro. The line was first unveiled in September.</p>

                            <p><strong>The military is struggling to man all the warplanes due to a training crisis, Ben Wallace has said</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p></p>
<p>The UK military does not have enough pilots to operate its state-of-the-art F-35 fighters due to training issues, Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said on Tuesday. The UK has over two dozen of the warplanes.</p>
<p>Speaking to the House of Lords, Wallace admitted that manning all of the F-35s presents <em>&ldquo;quite a challenge.&rdquo;</em> Explaining the reasons, he noted that flight training has been plagued by delays, with pilots waiting up to eight years before meeting the requirements to operate the sophisticated fighters instead of the target time of two to three years.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our pilot pipeline is not in a place I would want it to be,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>According to Wallace, another factor is that the F-35s are relatively new.</p>

<p>In total, the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy plan to operate 138 5th-generation F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing aircraft. However, the UK has so far purchased only 27 of the aircraft in the joint US-led program.</p>
<p>The UK announced its intention to buy F-35s as early as in 2006.</p>
<p>In early August, Sky News reported that more than two years ago, the defense secretary instructed Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston, who heads the Royal Air Force, to <em>&ldquo;fix chronic problems&rdquo;</em> with flight training and treat the issue as &ldquo;<em>his only priority.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>At the time, the outlet noted that the Air Force was concerned by a <em>&ldquo;damaging drain&rdquo;</em> of qualified pilots who opted for more lucrative jobs in industry over staying and training new recruits.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The protest movement announced a “pause” in its “campaign of civil resistance” after rushing the PM’s residence</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Environmental campaigners &lsquo;Just Stop Oil&rsquo; rallied outside 10 Downing Street on Tuesday to demand a moratorium on fossil fuel projects, before announcing a temporary <em>&ldquo;pause&rdquo;</em> to their controversial public stunts.</p>
<p>Wearing bright orange vests and surrounded by a horde of photographers, the protesters hoisted themselves over a low fence before posing in front of the gates outside the prime minister&rsquo;s official residence. Others glued themselves to the road and unfurled banners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police then arrived on the scene, arresting the demonstrators while a spokeswoman declared they were protesting because of government inaction on both the climate and cost-of-living crises.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨 BREAKING: DOWNING STREET BLOCKED 🚨<br><br>🚧 At 11:15 this morning, 22 Just Stop Oil supporters swarmed towards the gates of Downing St. A number of them attempted to scale the gates while others sat down in the road to block the entrance, with some gluing their hands to the tarmac <a href="https://t.co/KzxtOUpQdH">pic.twitter.com/KzxtOUpQdH</a></p>&mdash; Just Stop Oil ⚖️💀🛢 (@JustStop_Oil) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustStop_Oil/status/1587414938066239491?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>In a Twitter thread documenting their protest, the group demanded a <em>&ldquo;serious windfall tax on big oil, without the get-out-of-jail-free tax credits that will encourage more oil and gas that we cannot afford.&rdquo;</em> The government, they said, must abandon <em>&ldquo;new oil and gas projects.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another tweet, posted after the Downing Street stunt, promised to <em>&ldquo;pause [Just Stop Oil&rsquo;s] campaign of civil resistance,&rdquo;</em> declaring the reprieve was meant to give <em>&ldquo;those in the government who are in touch with reality&rdquo;</em> a chance to <em>&ldquo;consider their responsibilities to the country at this time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">⏸ BREAKING: Just Stop Oil pause disruption<br><br>From today, Just Stop Oil will pause its campaign of civil resistance.

<p>Should government ministers fail to respond adequately by Friday, however, <em>&ldquo;we will step up our legal disturbances against this traitorous government,&rdquo;</em> the group vowed, threatening new <em>&ldquo;actions&rdquo;</em> that would<em> &ldquo;be commensurate with the need to end the crime against humanity of new oil and gas developments.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last month, Just Stop Oil protesters have defaced multiple iconic artworks, including Van Gogh&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sunflowers&rsquo; and Johannes Vermeer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Girl with a Pearl Earring&rsquo;. The group is funded by the nonprofit Climate Emergency Fund, whose co-founder Aileen Getty is the heiress of Getty Oil. The fund provides grants to protesters that use &lsquo;civil disobedience&rsquo; in the service of ending fossil fuel use.</p>

<p>The Climate Emergency Fund and its fellow travelers insist that they are <em>&ldquo;not trying to be popular,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;arguing that it is better to be hated than ignored. However, others have argued stunts like Just Stop Oil&rsquo;s food fights with priceless artwork &ndash; or an earlier assault by a group protesting private jets that drenched a memorial to beloved British Covid-19 fundraiser Captain Tom with human waste &ndash; hurt the environmental cause as activists come off looking unhinged and unreasonable.</p>

                            <p><strong>Beijing responded after Washington’s new National Defense Strategy labeled China as America’s top threat</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>China has condemned the US&rsquo; new National Defense Strategy (NDS), saying American policy is driven by <em>&ldquo;the logic of domination,&rdquo;</em> while insisting that Beijing will never seek <em>&ldquo;hegemony&rdquo;</em> over other nations.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Asked about the Pentagon&rsquo;s 2022 NDS released in late October &ndash; which declares that China poses the <em>&ldquo;most consequential and systemic challenge&rdquo;</em> to US national security &ndash; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202211/t20221101_10795506.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> the document <em>&ldquo;plays up major-country competition and deliberately misrepresents China&rsquo;s foreign and defense policies.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It is driven ostensibly by a Cold War zero-sum mentality and the logic of domination and hegemonism and says everything about the ill intention of the US to contain and suppress China under various false pretexts,&rdquo;</em> the spokesman continued, adding that his country will reject all <em>&ldquo;attempts to blackmail, contain, blockade and exert maximum pressure.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>While the new NDS claims China has used its growing military and economic power to undermine US alliances across Asia, Zhao insisted Beijing&rsquo;s foreign policy is aimed at <em>&ldquo;upholding world peace and promoting common development&rdquo;</em> between nations.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;No matter what stage of development we reach, we will never seek hegemony or engage in expansionism,&rdquo;</em> he said, urging Washington to <em>&ldquo;follow the trend of peace and development, abandon the Cold War zero-sum mentality, stop viewing today&rsquo;s world and China-US relations from a confrontational perspective, and stop distorting China&rsquo;s strategic intentions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>The administration of US President Joe Biden has repeatedly declared China to be America&rsquo;s top competitor and foremost concern, putting heavy focus on the country in its new NDS, as well as in a separate Nuclear Posture Review and Missile Defense Review.</p>
<p>Tensions between Washington and Beijing have risen significantly since August, when US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan despite loud objections from Beijing, which sees the island as part of its own territory. Though the trip prompted an unprecedented round of Chinese military drills in the air and waters surrounding Taiwan, Western delegations have nonetheless continued to visit Taipei in the months since, with Germany <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/565344-china-germany-visit-taiwan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sending lawmakers</a> on a junket there last week.</p>

                            <p><strong>The South Korean military denounced the show of force as “intolerable”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>North Korea has launched at least&nbsp;ten ballistic missiles from areas along its coast, including one munition which crossed a de facto maritime border separating the two Koreas for the first time since the 1950s. The move comes just one day after Pyongyang denounced the ongoing war games between Washington and Seoul and vowed to take <em>&ldquo;powerful measures&rdquo;</em> in response.</p>
<p><strong></strong>After announcing an initial volley of <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20220307009054325?section=nk/nk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three missiles</a> earlier on Wednesday, the South Korean military&rsquo;s Joint Chiefs of Staff noted that <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20221102005300325?section=nk/nk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least&nbsp;ten&nbsp;projectiles</a> of <em>&ldquo;various types&rdquo;</em> were fired into the East and West Seas. At least three were said to be short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), one of which entered a buffer zone between the two sides.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;North Korea's missile launch &ndash; which marks the first time since the division of the peninsula that [any missiles have] landed near our territorial waters south of the Northern Limit Line &ndash; is very rare and intolerable,&rdquo;</em> the Joint Chiefs said in a press release cited by Yonhap, adding that the military would <em>&ldquo;respond firmly to this provocation.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>According to the military, the SRBM landed in the sea 26km (16 miles) south of the Northern Limit Line, which was established as the tentative maritime border between the North and South in 1953 following the Korean War &ndash; a conflict that was never officially concluded with a formal treaty.</p>
<p>Though the missile fell far short of land, the launch nonetheless set off air raid sirens on South Korea&rsquo;s Ulleungdo Island, prompting panicked residents to take shelter, Yonhap reported.</p>
<p>The show of force came amid the week-long &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; exercise held by the&nbsp;US and South Korea, which will see hundreds of aircraft perform more than 1,600 practice sorties and other aerial maneuvers. Pyongyang has denounced the drills as provocative, even suggesting they could be preparation for a nuclear attack on North Korea.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; drills follow several other rounds of war games between Washington and Seoul in recent months, some also involving Tokyo, all of which have been condemned by the North as rehearsals for an invasion. Pyongyang has responded with a record number of weapons tests this year, stoking fears among US and South Korean officials that it could be preparing to carry out another nuclear test.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The new owner of the social media platform says charging more will give “power to the people”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The wealthiest person in the world, Elon Musk, announced on Tuesday that those who wish to have a blue check by their Twitter user name should have to pay $8 monthly.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p>Taking to the social media platform which he recently bought for a whopping $44 billion, Musk said that<em> &ldquo;Twitter&rsquo;s current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn&rsquo;t have a blue checkmark is bulls**t.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Power to the people! Blue for $8/month,&rdquo;</em> the businessman, whose fortune is estimated at around $210 billion, said.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p>Continuing the series of tweets, Musk added that the new fee&nbsp;would give Twitter <em>&ldquo;a revenue stream to reward content creators.&rdquo;</em><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p>He noted&nbsp;that the price&nbsp;could vary in different countries<em> &ldquo;proportionate to purchasing power parity.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter’s current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit. <br><br>Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587498907336118274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Besides the blue check, which shows that an account is verified and is currently free of charge, paying users would have priority in replies and searches, and half as many ads, he said. The current premium subscription, Twitter Blue, costs $4.99 and allows articles from certain publishers to be viewed without ads, along with more customization options.</p>
<p>The price of $8 for a blue check is apparently a concession from Musk. On Monday, following media reports that the fee would be $20, the businessman responded to criticism from author Stephen King.<br /><strong></strong></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">$20 a month to keep my blue check? Fuck that, they should pay me. If that gets instituted, I’m gone like Enron.</p>&mdash; Stephen King (@StephenKing) <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1587042605627490304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>After King said Twitter should have to pay him to stay on the platform, Musk said the company needs to <em>&ldquo;pay the bills somehow&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;cannot rely entirely on advertisers.&rdquo;</em> He then suggested $8 instead.</p>
<p>As Twitter has not posted a profit in years, Musk, who now describes himself on the platform as <em>&ldquo;Twitter Complaint Hotline Operator,&rdquo;</em> began making changes to the business immediately after buying it. According to legal documents filed with financial regulators on Monday, Musk has already dissolved the entire board of directors.</p>

                            <p><strong>A large group of illegals waving the Venezuelan flag clashed with the police as they tried to cross into the US</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>US Customs and Border Patrol repelled a large group of migrants waving a giant Venezuelan flag as they attempted to cross the border near El Paso, Texas on Monday after two members of the group allegedly attacked CBP personnel, the agency told Fox News in a statement.</p>
<p>The altercation was partially caught on video and the Office of Professional Responsibility has reportedly been tasked with reviewing it.</p>
<p>After one migrant allegedly assaulted an agent with the flagpole and another supposedly injured an agent by throwing a rock at them, CBP &ldquo;<em>initiated crowd-control measures</em>,&rdquo; according to the statement, including &ldquo;<em>the use of the authorized less-lethal force pepper ball launching system</em>&rdquo; &ndash; pepper ball grenades.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear if the would-be immigrants were actually from Venezuela, or how long they had been carrying the large, heavy flag. A video of the altercation posted to social media, filmed by an unnamed &ldquo;<em>activist</em>,&rdquo; shows the migrants being herded back into the Rio Grande by the advancing line of Border Patrol agents while a Honduran flag is left planted in the riverbed on the US side.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Longer video provided by activist at scene shows incident in El Paso yesterday where Border Patrol agents fired pepper balls at a group of Venezuelans crossing illegally into the U.S.<br>CBP says a thrown rock injured one agent, &amp; another was assaulted with a flagpole. <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FoxNews</a> <a href="https://t.co/t7FrGjnAtb">pic.twitter.com/t7FrGjnAtb</a></p>&mdash; Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) <a href="https://twitter.com/BillFOXLA/status/1587458018395897856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Border Patrol has apprehended more than 50 large groups consisting of 100 migrants or more in the last month alone, according to Fox. The outlet reported that another group, this one comprising about 300 mostly single adults, crossed into Normandy, Texas on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A record 2.3 million illegal immigrants were apprehended in the US in fiscal year 2022, with more than 227,000 of those encountered in September &ndash; the worst September in CBP history for migrant crossings. Between 7,300 and 7,500 migrants crossed the border every day during the month.</p>

<p>While Border Patrol counts &ldquo;<em>migrant encounters</em>&rdquo; rather than individual migrants, meaning some people may be counted more than once, the figure nevertheless represents a major increase over 2021, which saw 1.7 million migrants enter the US. Both President Joe Biden&rsquo;s political rivals at home and the leaders of Guatemala and El Salvador have blamed the US leader for the increase in illegal crossings.</p>
<p>Biden reversed several measures adopted by his predecessor, Donald Trump, that had proven to be effective in cutting back on the number of illegal border-crossers, like the &ldquo;<em>remain in Mexico</em>&rdquo; policy forcing new arrivals to wait outside the US while their case was considered, as well as a Covid-19 pandemic control order. A Fox News investigation found the Biden administration was even funding legal aid for immigrants fighting deportation.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Production of the drug in Afghanistan is up by a third over the previous year, a report reveals</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Opium cultivation in Afghanistan, the largest grower in the world, has boomed since the Taliban assumed power in August 2021, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) revealed on Tuesday. Land under opium poppy cultivation in the country rose 32% over the previous year, to 233,000 hectares, according to the UN agency&rsquo;s latest <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/crop-monitoring/Afghanistan/Opium_cultivation_Afghanistan_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a ban on opium cultivation and other narcotics was put in place in April, opium prices &ldquo;<em>soared</em>,&rdquo; the UNODC stated. As a result, the 2022 opium harvest, which was largely exempt from the Taliban&rsquo;s decree due to there being a two-month grace period, became &ldquo;<em>the most profitable for farmers since 2017.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the report, &ldquo;<em>the income made by farmers from opium sales more than tripled</em>&rdquo; from $425 million last year to $1.4 billion in 2022. The latest figure represents 29% of the 2021 value of the country's agricultural sector.</p>
<p>The agency notes, however, that the higher profit has not necessarily increased the purchasing power of farmers &ndash; surging inflation has pushed the price of food up by about 35%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the UNODC, since the beginning of the Taliban&rsquo;s rule, opiate trafficking from Afghanistan, which supplies some 80% of global opiate consumption, has been ongoing without interruption.</p>

<![CDATA[
    

<p>Because it normally takes between a year and a year and a half for opiates originating in Afghanistan to reach destination countries, any changes in cultivation or trafficking activity in Afghanistan can be seen &ldquo;<em>within the same year in the Near and Middle East and South-West Asia, and a year later in Europe,</em>&rdquo; the UN agency stated.</p>
<p>In its 2023 forecast, the UNODC said Afghan farmers would be making decisions on opium cultivation based on a variety of factors, including economic disruption, humanitarian crises, high prices for opium, as well as &ldquo;<em>uncertainty about how the de facto authorities will enforce the cultivation ban.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Most of the 2023 opium crop must be sown by early November 2022, the UN Office on Drugs and Crimes notes.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The international community must work to address the acute needs of the Afghan people, and to step up responses to stop the criminal groups trafficking heroin and harming people in countries around the world,&rdquo;</em> UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly said.</p>
<p>Opium is used in many pain-killing drugs but is also the key ingredient in heroin.</p>
<p>In 2020, in the United States alone, 13,000 people died from heroin overdoses, according to the country&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/deaths/heroin/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a></p>
<p>Figures from the US National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics <a href="https://drugabusestatistics.org/heroin-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show</a> that 80% of people who use heroin first abused prescription opioids.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Iran has accused foreign powers of instigating a wave of anti-government demonstrations</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Saudi Arabia has warned US intelligence officials of an imminent attack on its territory from Iran, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. While no details of the intelligence in question was revealed by the newspaper, American, Saudi and allied forces in the Middle East have reportedly been placed on high alert.</p>
<p>Iran intends to attack both the Kingdom itself and the Iraqi city of Erbil, where US troops are stationed, the officials told their American counterparts, according to the WSJ.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday, Pentagon Press Secretary Patrick Ryder told reporters that the US was <em>&ldquo;concerned about the threat situation,&rdquo;</em> and reserved <em>&ldquo;the right to protect and defend ourselves no matter where our forces are serving, whether in Iraq or elsewhere.&rdquo;</em> Just like the Wall Street Journal, Ryder offered no further details of the alleged threat.</p>

<p>Iranian forces have struck Erbil on several occasions this year, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/553020-us-sanctions-iran-missiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">firing</a> a dozen ballistic missiles at the city in March and launching more missiles and drones since late September. Tehran <a href="https://archive.ph/Mf10s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that the latest strikes were aimed at Kurdish <em>&ldquo;terrorist groups&rdquo;</em> operating near the Iraqi city.</p>
<p>Iran has accused foreign powers &ndash; specifically the US, Israel, and Saudi Arabia &ndash; of instigating a wave of anti-government demonstrations across the country in recent weeks. The commander of Iran&rsquo;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, General Hossein Salami, publicly accused Riyadh last month of <em>&ldquo;interfering in our internal affairs&rdquo;</em> through media coverage of the protests.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You are involved in this matter and know that you are vulnerable,&rdquo;</em> Salami warned the Saudis, according to the Wall Street Journal. It is unclear whether the latest alert is connected with the Iranian commander&rsquo;s statement.</p>

                            <p><strong>Belgrade will face “consequences” if it partners with Moscow, a German representative told the news agency</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Serbia must decide to align itself with either Russia or the EU, a German official told Reuters on Tuesday. While Berlin has warned Belgrade against looking eastwards, the country&rsquo;s government remains skeptical of Brussels and the West.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The need for a decision is coming to a head in view of geopolitical developments,&rdquo;</em> the unnamed German representative told reporters. The official was referring specifically to the conflict in Ukraine, which Serbia has refused to sanction Russia over. Moreover, Belgrade and Moscow signed an agreement in September to expand cooperation on matters of foreign policy.</p>
<p>Alignment with Brussels&rsquo; stance on global affairs is a precondition to joining the European Union. Serbia has been a candidate for membership since 2009. Should Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic renege on his agreement with Moscow and turn to the EU, Germany will offer its support, the representative revealed to Reuters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Should he decide to go the other way, this will have consequences in reverse,&rdquo;</em> the official explained.</p>

<p>Delegations from five Balkan countries &ndash; Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia &ndash; as well as the partially recongnized province of Kosovo, will meet in Berlin later this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last month, Vucic stated that Germany and France have <a href="https://www.trtworld.com/europe/serbia-rejects-recognition-of-kosovo-as-condition-to-speed-up-eu-membership-61481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offered</a> to <em>&ldquo;accelerate&rdquo;</em> Serbia&rsquo;s path to EU membership if it recognizes the independence of Kosovo.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;They think this will settle one of Europe&rsquo;s internal issues&hellip; [but] Serbia will not accept Kosovo&rsquo;s membership in the UN for both constitutional and other reasons,&rdquo;</em> the president stressed during a televised address to the nation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The question is not whether we want to join the EU, but whether the EU wants Serbia,&rdquo;</em> Interior Minister Aleksandar Vulin told the Novosti news site in October. <em>&ldquo;I believe that friendship with Russia is of the greatest importance and that without it we risk the physical disappearance of Serbia,&rdquo;</em> the official added.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The probability that Britain will face a colder-than-usual winter is slightly higher than normal, the Met Office said on Monday in its three-month <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/business/public-sector/civil-contingency/3moutlook-ndj-v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forecast</a>.</p>
<p>As the country braces for an energy crisis, exacerbated by anti-Russia sanctions and a sharp decrease in Moscow&rsquo;s energy supplies to Europe, meteorologists say there is a 25% chance the upcoming season will be cold, which is 1.3 times the usual chance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, the Met Office said that the <em>&ldquo;chances of dry conditions are greater than normal</em>,&rdquo; while stormy conditions &ldquo;<em>are less likely than normal.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Overall, however, the most likely scenario is that the upcoming winter will be an average one, according to the outlook.</p>
<p>October in Britain was unusually warm, with temperatures last weekend going above 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>The mild weather means there hasn&rsquo;t been as much of a spike in energy demand and gas prices have actually decreased from their summer peaks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Britain is preparing for a challenging winter. Despite not being directly dependent on Russian energy supplies, the UK used to import gas and electricity from continental Europe during the coldest months and extreme weather events. However, this year, European countries are facing severe energy crises of their own amid attempts to rid themselves of dependency on Russian fuel.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Late last month, Centrica Plc announced that it was reopening North Sea-based Rough &ndash; the country&rsquo;s biggest gas storage facility &ndash; after a five-year suspension. Though it will be operating at only around 20% of its former capacity, it will still add 50% to the UK&rsquo;s reserves.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Britain&rsquo;s National Grid ESO <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/document/268346/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> in October that its <em>&ldquo;base case&rdquo;</em> remains unchanged, suggesting there will be enough gas and electricity for Britain this winter. However, it didn&rsquo;t rule out a <em>&ldquo;more extreme scenario&rdquo;</em> involving<em> &ldquo;a hypothetical escalation of the energy crisis in Europe&rdquo;</em> and a deficit in gas, as well as in electricity supplies. In this case, &ldquo;<em>mitigation strategies</em>&rdquo; are expected to be launched, including dispatching<em> &ldquo;the retained coal units.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>ESO head John Pettigrew also revealed a worst-case scenario: If the weather turns extremely cold and if gas supplies to feed power stations are insufficient, the company will have to switch off gas and electricity in parts of the country for a few hours at a time.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>CDC director Rochelle Walensky got her latest round of booster shots less than two months ago</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Rochelle Walensky, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has tested positive for Covid-19 a second time after undergoing treatment with Pfizer&rsquo;s antiviral drug, the organization revealed on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky experienced mild symptoms from her recent COVID-19 infection, completed a course of Paxlovid, and, after a period of isolation, tested negative for the virus</em>,&rsquo;&rsquo; the agency said in a statement. On Sunday, however, &ldquo;<em>Walensky began to develop mild symptoms and has again tested positive</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walensky first tested positive for Covid-19 on October 22, a month after receiving a bivalent booster shot that contained elements of the original form of the virus as detected in December 2019 in Wuhan and the more recent Omicron variant.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden and his chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci also experienced rebound Covid-19 infections after taking Paxlovid. Both contracted the virus despite being fully vaccinated and boosted.</p>
<p>In September, a study published in&nbsp;the New England Journal of Medicine&nbsp;showed positive Covid-19 tests and rebound infections were more common in patients treated with Paxlovid than the drug&rsquo;s manufacturer had previously acknowledged. Patients experiencing rebound infections were also found to be just as capable of spreading the disease as their untreated counterparts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pfizer responded to the news by promising to study re-treating those patients with more Paxlovid, though there is no evidence that this is an effective treatment. Experts from the National Institutes of Health have stated they do not believe a five-day course of Paxlovid is sufficient for the body to develop a strong immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last month, a Pfizer executive admitted that the company&rsquo;s vaccines had never been proven effective in preventing Covid-19 infection, despite widespread belief they did just that. CEO Albert Bourla had acknowledged in December 2020 as the vaccine was rolled out in the US that he was &ldquo;<em>not certain</em>&rdquo; the jab prevented transmission.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Washington wants to double the capacity of a holding camp amid fears of “mass exodus,” NBC News claims</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Anticipating a surge of&nbsp;human traffic from Haiti, the US government is looking at doubling the capacity of a detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba as one of the options, NBC News reported on Tuesday, citing two officials and an internal document.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The US military base in Guantanamo Bay currently has a detention facility capable of accommodating about 200 people, and the White House is looking at doubling that capacity.</p>
<p>The National Security Council has also asked the Department of Homeland Security at which point a third country would need to be designated as a <em>&ldquo;lily pad&rdquo;</em> to handle the incoming Haitians. Migrants would be sent to Guantanamo only if and when that third country is itself overwhelmed, according to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/possible-surge-haitian-migrants-ahead-biden-admin-weighs-holding-third-rcna54610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC</a>.</p>
<p><strong></strong>President Joe Biden&rsquo;s government last considered using Guantanamo for overflow migration <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/535584-guantanamo-haitians-biden-migration/">in September 2021</a>, when some 15,000 Haitians crossed the US-Mexico border in Texas and set up a tent city under a highway bridge. The idea was roundly denounced by Democrats, however, who thought the location under consideration was the camp for holding terrorist suspects.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The Migrant Operations Center in Guantanamo has been around for more than 30 years and is different from the nearby Camp Delta, which is used to hold suspected terrorists. Up to 12,000 Haitians were held there once before, after the 1991 coup. The US Coast Guard currently uses the facility to hold migrants it rescues at sea in the Caribbean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Haiti has been in political turmoil since President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in July. Economic woes have since caused armed protesters to set up roadblocks and demand the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry. The government in Port-au-Prince officially requested foreign military intervention last month, but the US has struggled to set up a coalition willing to send soldiers to the island.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been no progress getting partners to volunteer. No one is stepping up,&rdquo;</em> the Florida-based Miami Herald reported last week, noting that Brazil, Canada, and France have all refused to commit troops. Washington is also trying to postpone any major moves until after the November 8 midterm elections.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Meanwhile, the National Security Council has organized a <em>&ldquo;series of meetings&rdquo;</em> with the departments of State, Defense and Homeland Security in anticipation of a <em>&ldquo;mass exodus&rdquo;</em> from Haiti.&nbsp;</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The country’s commander-in-chief claims it should allow the bloc to use its territory as it see fit</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Sweden should not &ldquo;<em>set reservations at an early stage</em>&rdquo; before even joining NATO, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Micael Byden told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday. Byden recommended the government present no objections should the US-led military bloc seek to place nuclear weapons or bases on Swedish soil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The commander-in-chief revealed that the armed forces plan to more than double the number of conscripts to 50,000 by 2035. Stockholm will reach NATO&rsquo;s required expenditure of 2% of GDP on defense by 2026, earlier than previously believed, thanks to a weak currency and higher costs of military equipment, he added.</p>
<p>Byden&rsquo;s advice against limiting the bloc&rsquo;s access to his country&rsquo;s resources echoed the words of Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin, who noted&nbsp;at the same press conference that she did not want to &ldquo;<em>close any doors</em>&rdquo; to the alliance. There should not be &ldquo;<em>any preconditions</em>&rdquo; to NATO membership, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marin&rsquo;s Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, expressed similar views, suggesting the two Nordic nations &ldquo;<em>should draw exactly the same conclusions</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>embrace</em>&rdquo; whatever the military bloc demands of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stockholm and Helsinki applied to join NATO in May, citing Russia&rsquo;s military operation in Ukraine as the reason behind the move. While 28 of the bloc&rsquo;s 30 members have approved their applications, T&uuml;rkiye and Hungary have yet to do so.</p>
<p>Last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, speaking at a press conference in Prague, said that &ldquo;<em>Finland is not a country where terrorists are roaming freely</em>,&rdquo; but Sweden is &ldquo;<em>a place where terror is rampant.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finland sent&nbsp;a delegation to T&uuml;rkiye in late October, according to Turkish news outlet Anadolu Agency, which revealed that the talks focused on the extradition of Kurdish militants, a key concern for Ankara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commenting on Finland&rsquo;s and Sweden&rsquo;s potential accession to NATO, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned in June that the move would further escalate tensions between Moscow and the West.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The number of new cases of West Nile fever in the country has doubled since last year</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Twice as many people contracted West Nile fever in Germany this year than in 2021, Der Spiegel reported on Tuesday, citing data provided by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the national health watchdog.</p>
<p>The number of infections registered in Germany since the end of August has risen to ten, according to RKI. At least eight of them were proven to have been contracted within Germany, the agency&rsquo;s spokeswoman told Der Spiegel.</p>
<p>At least four states have been affected by the spread of the disease, including the capital, Berlin, the eastern states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, as well as North Rhine-Westphalia in the west, the RKI said, adding that further cases could still be discovered.</p>
<p>While the number of cases doubled in comparison to 2021, it is lower than in 2020, when a total of 30 cases were registered, Der Spiegel said. Infections in Germans who had not traveled abroad were first detected in 2019.</p>

<p>The RKI also said that it documented the virus being transmitted between birds and mosquitos in Germany back in 2018. It is now believed the pathogen can hibernate in mosquitoes in Germany.</p>
<p>The fever is usually asymptomatic, meaning most cases are unreported, according to the RKI. Every fifth person infected with the virus develops flu-like symptoms, including headaches or fever, as well as vomiting or rash.</p>
<p>One in 100, however, can become seriously ill as the disease can cause brain inflammation, such as encephalitis or meningitis, and can lead to seizures. The likelihood of death among seriously ill patients is about 10%. Recovery may take weeks or even months. Older people and those with chronic illnesses are considered to be at particular risk of serious infections.</p>
<p>According to the EU health agency (ECDC), a total of 950 cases of West Nile fever have been reported throughout the bloc this year, with 82 infection-related deaths. Southern European countries appear to be disproportionately affected. Italy alone registered more than 570 cases with another 280 reported in Greece.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Ankara still demands that Stockholm extradite suspects it considers terrorists, a Turkish official has said</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>T&uuml;rkiye is still not ready to lift its veto and endorse Sweden&rsquo;s NATO bid, a spokesman for the&nbsp;ruling AK Party, Omer Celik, said on Monday. Promises made by Stockholm in response to Ankara&rsquo;s concerns about providing asylum to suspects it considers terrorists are not enough, he added. <br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;These statements from Sweden are good, but not enough until they are implemented,&rdquo;</em> Celik said, according to Bloomberg. <em>&ldquo;We are waiting for it to come to life.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>T&uuml;rkiye stalled the process of approving the applications of Sweden and Finland to join NATO, which were filed in May. Both nations sought to join the military bloc following the launch of Russia&rsquo;s military operation in Ukraine. Ankara earlier warned that it could block the bids, as it accused the two nations of harboring members of the Kurdistan Workers&rsquo; Party (PKK) and other groups it considers to be terrorist organizations.</p>
<p>In early October, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed that his nation was ready to back Finland&rsquo;s bid, adding that <em>&ldquo;Finland is not a country where terrorists are roaming freely.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A week ago, Reuters reported that Sweden informed T&uuml;rkiye it was ready to work with Ankara on the extradition of terrorist suspects and said it had taken additional measures against Kurdish militants. Stockholm also reportedly said it remained &ldquo;<em>fully committed to the implementation&rdquo;</em> of the memorandum signed by Sweden, Finland, and T&uuml;rkiye in June.</p>

<p>The prime minister is expected to visit T&uuml;rkiye at some point next week. The statements also come ahead of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg&rsquo;s visit to T&uuml;rkiye this week. On October 20, he said he was <em>&ldquo;confident that all Allies will ratify the Accession Protocol,&rdquo;</em> opening the way for Finland and Sweden to join NATO.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg added that Stockholm does not have any restrictions on arms exports to T&uuml;rkiye any longer and has also established a cooperation mechanism in the fields of intelligence sharing and fighting international terrorism.</p>
<p>So far, only two NATO members have not ratified the Accession Protocols for Finland and Sweden: T&uuml;rkiye and Hungary. According to Stoltenberg, in the Hungarian parliament, the ratification is on the agenda <em>&ldquo;this fall.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Belgrade scrambled fighters after UAVs were spotted above military bases near Kosovo</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p>The Serbian military has orders to immediately destroy any hostile drones in the country&rsquo;s airspace, President Aleksandar Vucic announced on Tuesday. The new rules of engagement come after MiG-29 interceptors were sent to fend off UAVs spotted above military bases near the boundary with the&nbsp;breakaway province of Kosovo.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles were detected above a military facility near Merdare, one of the designated crossings between Kosovo and the rest of Serbia, and Vucic ordered the military to deploy planes with orders to shoot. The drones then quickly withdrew, the media in Belgrade reported. The order to shoot down any hostile drone remains in effect, however.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Defense Minister Milos Vucevic revealed earlier on Tuesday that the military has already been placed on high alert <em>&ldquo;to be prepared to respond to any task,&rdquo;</em> as the ethnic Albanian administration in Kosovo attempted to coerce Serbs living there to change their car license plates and documents.</p>

<p>Kosovo was occupied by NATO in 1999 and its ethnic Albanian provisional government declared independence in 2008, with the support of the US and its allies. Belgrade has refused to recognize the breakaway province, and is backed by Russia and China, among others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The government in Pristina says its&nbsp;order encompasses the whole province, including territories where Serbs remain in the majority. Previous attempt to impose license plate and ID rules, at the end of July, escalated into a military standoff until the US ambassador intervened and <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/559963-kosovo-serbs-tensions-vucic/">asked for a delay</a>.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Belgrade says it wants peace but won&rsquo;t allow another <em>&ldquo;pogrom&rdquo;</em> of Serbs. It also accuses Pristina of failing to fulfill any of its obligations from multiple agreements mediated by the EU &ndash; such as giving the Serbs autonomy &ndash; even as it cites those agreements as justification for the document crackdown.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Vucic has repeatedly said he wants Serbia to join the EU and that he won&rsquo;t recognize Kosovo &ndash; even though Brussels demands such recognition as a prerequisite for membership.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock has lost his party’s whip after signing up for ‘I’m a Celebrity’</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Former UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock was suspended as Tory MP on Monday over his intention to take part in the popular reality show &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Conservative Party Chief Whip Simon Hart made the announcement shortly after The Sun revealed that Hancock would soon swap the halls of Westminster for the Australian jungle, where he will be fighting for survival along with other well-known contestants.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Following a conversation with Matt Hancock, I have considered the situation and believe this is a matter serious enough to warrant suspension of the whip with immediate effect,&rdquo;</em> Hart, who is responsible for party discipline, said.</p>
<p>Hart&rsquo;s decision means that Hancock must now sit in Parliament as an independent MP, unless his whip is returned to him.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also expressed his disapproval of Hancock&rsquo;s decision to take time off in order to be the show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The PM believes that at a challenging time for the country, MPs should be working hard for their constituents in the House or in their constituencies. The public, when they elect their MPs, expect them to work hard for their constituency</em>,&rdquo; Sunak&rsquo;s spokesperson said.</p>
<p>According to the spokesperson, it is &ldquo;<em>unlikely</em>&rdquo; that the prime minister will watch Hancock&rsquo;s struggles on TV, though some Tory party members apparently can&rsquo;t wait.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to him eating a kangaroo&rsquo;s penis. Quote me. You can quote me that,&rdquo;</em> Andy Drummond, the deputy chairman of the West Suffolk Conservative Association, said.</p>

<p>An unnamed ally of Hancock told LBC that the MP decided to take part in the show because he <em>&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t expect to serve in Government again.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>According to that person, the former health secretary plans to make a charitable donation and views &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a Celebrity&rsquo; as &ldquo;<em>an amazing opportunity to engage with the public and talk about issues he really cares about &ndash; including his dyslexia campaign.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to PR expert Mark Borkowski, as quoted by the Daily Mail, the role may have landed Hancock a whopping &pound;350,000 ($401,000). That&rsquo;s on top of his MP salary of &pound;84,000 ($96,000) &ndash; numbers which stirred outrage on social media.</p>
<p>Hancock, who gained wide publicity due to his TV appearances during the Covid-19 pandemic, resigned as health secretary last year. His resignation came after a video emerged showing him kissing his aide, Gina Coladangelo, in his office, in breach of his own social distancing rules.</p>]]>
