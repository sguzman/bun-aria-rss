    <title>Ruthie's Table 4</title>
    <link>https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-river-cafe-table-4-86783836/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home. 

On River Cafe Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.

Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt, and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. 

Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sitting here in The River Café on a sunny Monday morning with chefs in the kitchen making ravioli with girolles, and waiters laying tables in the garden, the uncertain world we live in feels miles away.</p>
<p>The artist and filmmaker Steve McQueen does not separate the world of beauty and the world of suffering in any of his work. Political oppression, slavery, sexual inequality.</p>
<p>Steve and I met in 1999 when he won the Turner Prize for his radical video art, and we once had dinner together with President Obama.</p>
<p>It was clear that the only person President Obama was interested in talking to was Steve McQueen and he didn’t want to share him with anyone else. Now, a few years later, I finally have Steve McQueen all to myself, and being a generous person, will share him with you.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>As part of our limited art series we are reposting our favourite episode from season 1 just in case you missed it the first time round. This is a conversation about food between two friends - Ruthie Rogers, a chef, and Tracey Emin, an artist.</p>
<p>Listen when you have a quiet time - time to hear Tracey convey to Ruthie what it meant to have the Salvation Army cook her and her brother Christmas dinner. Time to let Tracey explain why the solitude of being an artist makes restaurants crucial, and time to listen to her describe why she is passionate about eating eight apples a day.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>

      <title>Ruthie's Table 4: Sam Taylor-Johnson</title>
      <itunes:title>Ruthie's Table 4: Sam Taylor-Johnson</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sam Taylor-Johnson is an artist, photographer, and film-director - and she has been a friend of Ruthie’s since the day they met at the Tate gallery in 1998 when Sam was awarded the Turner Prize.</p>
<p>Listen to their memories of children, food, music and art as part of Ruthie's Table 4's artist series.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p>On Ruthie’s Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

      <itunes:title>Ruthie's Table 4: Jonas Wood</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In 2015, Jonas Wood was in London for his show at Gagosian Gallery. He came to The River Cafe for lunch, leaving behind the gift of a beautiful drawing on River Cafe stationery—a spiky long cactus, its leaves reaching out over the logo.</p>
<p>Jonas brought LA to London, and a cactus to The River Cafe. Ruthie and Jonas promised to meet one day to talk about food, family and art. Six years later, London came to LA to record a podcast.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the last year, I’ve had the great luck to sit with 46 fabulous guests on our podcast ‘Ruthie's Table 4’ - talking about food, family, and memories. Everyone has read a recipe from a River Cafe cook book and shared stories about cooking and eating in their favourite restaurants. In September we will be back for Season 2.</p>
<p>Gwyneth Paltrow, Wolfgang Puck, Mel Brooks and many more will be with me. Join us then - your table will be ready and waiting.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last year, I’ve had the great luck to sit with 46 fabulous guests on our podcast ‘Ruthie's Table 4’ - talking about food, family, and memories. Everyone has read a recipe from a River Cafe cook book and shared stories about cooking and eating in their favourite restaurants. In September we will be back for Season 2.</p>
<p>Gwyneth Paltrow, Wolfgang Puck, Mel Brooks and many more will be with me. Join us then - your table will be ready and waiting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie’s Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.  Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks.   Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.

      <itunes:title>Ruthie's Table 4: Danny Huston</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In front of the camera and behind, Danny Huston has spent his life in movies.</p>
<p>Danny, son of John Huston, grew up watching rushes, travelling to film locations, and meeting all the great actors. Later directing, producing and acting in films and television series: Mr North, Fade to Black, The Constant Gardener, Succession and much more.</p>
<p>I knew Danny loves food, but nothing could have impressed me more than when, of all The River Cafe recipes, he chose, toast.</p>
<p>Toast - or rather as the Italians call it bruschetta - was what made me want to cook Italian food when I first tasted it in Florence in 1971.</p>
<p>Danny and I had much to discuss as we sat together in the River Cafe. On Episode 45 of Ruthie's Table 4, Danny and I spoke about food, music, family, cooking, travelling – and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>

      <title>Ruthie's Table 4: Darren Walker</title>
      <itunes:title>Ruthie's Table 4: Darren Walker</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently a friend led me across a crowded room with the words—“Talk to this man about food; he is passionate!”</p>
<p>So, I did  - and put away all my questions about the dynamic, social and radical philanthropic work that Darren Walker does as CEO of the Ford Foundation. After 10 minutes of stories and memories of his childhood and the food he ate in Lafayette, Louisiana, I asked him to pause suggesting we do this on Ruthie's Table 4.</p>
<p>And here we are — in the restaurant ready to carry on the conversation.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie’s Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When Ruthie was asked to debut a live podcast, her first call was to Josh Berger.</p>
<p>In his thirty years at Warner Bros. UK, Josh gave audiences some of Hollywood’s greatest movies – Harry Potter, A Star is Born, and The Hangover and with his role as chairman of the British Film Institute he helped make London a city of movie-goers and moviemakers.</p>
<p>On Broadway he co-produced the Tony Award­–winning musical Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of The Temptations.</p>
<p>He is also the non-executive chair of The BRIT School Trust</p>
<p>Ruthie and Josh talking about food in his life with a live audience at the Cannes Lions festival is a great conversation - and a great debut.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>My favourite line in this conversation from our 41st episode of River Cafe Table 4, is Austin Butler saying he and I are ‘family’.</p>
<p>Austin arrived straight from playing Elvis Presley in Baz Luhrmann’s movie ‘<em>Elvis</em>’ in January 2021 and we met soon after.</p>
<p>London was just out of a COVID lockdown and, needing an immediate tradition, we decided to have dinner at my home every Sunday night with the same small group of friends. Austin would arrive early and cook with me, and this is what we did, every Sunday, for 39 weeks.</p>
<p>Austin is a brilliant actor, a beautiful singer, a poet, and an extraordinary friend.</p>

Austin would arrive early and cook with me, and this is what we did, every Sunday, for 39 weeks.  Austin is a brilliant actor, a beautiful singer, a poet, and an extraordinary friend.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Ruthie's Table 4: Adam Schiff</title>
      <itunes:title>Ruthie's Table 4: Adam Schiff</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When Congressman Adam Schiff came to London, giving a dinner for him in our home was a great honour. On Episode 40 of Ruthie's Table 4, Ruthie and Adam talk about the food he grew up with, the food he cooks for his family, and the food he finds personally comforting. </p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie’s Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Everybody is interested in process. How do actors memorize their lines, how does an airplane stay up in the sky?</p>
<p>The question I'm most often asked is how does a restaurant work?</p>

<p>The answers to these questions ? It's people. And two very important people for me are Sian Wyn Owen and Joseph Travelli, Executive Chefs in the River Cafe.</p>

<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

      <itunes:title>Ruthie's Table 4: Afua Hirsch</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Having read Afua Hirsch’s political memoir <em>Brit(ish),</em> I was both moved and informed. So I asked her if we might have a conversation for Ruthie's Table 4. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyone who’s watched her documentaries, read her articles, or participated in her grassroots organising, knows that Afua’s insights on racism, inclusion, and British history is radical, brave and brilliant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before going into the restaurant for lunch together, we will talk about what her Ghanain grandmothers cooked for her as a teenager in London, the food she prepares for her daughter, and much more. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie’s Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>There is no such thing as a simple phone call with my beautiful friend Christiane Amanpour. Asking, as I did yesterday, where she’s been she answers “Ukraine”, asking where she is going, she says, “Afghanistan”.</p>
<p>This is what it is like having a fearless friend you love, who puts herself in danger, reporting facts, holding people to account, and telling the truth from wherever she is and whoever she is talking to. </p>
<p>Christiane goes on biking trips, retreats to her house in the Isle de Re, and flies to New York for a day to see her son. The food of Persia is her passion.</p>
<p>Today, I’m going to interview the most brilliant interviewer there is, today I’m the fearless one.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie’s Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, I walked into a very busy River Café lunch to be greeted by a buzz from the young waiters and chefs working here. They were incredibly excited – “Ruthie, Ruthie” they said, “Rag’n’Bone Man is on Table 4, why don’t you ask him to be on your podcast”. I personally have a rule not to interrupt anyone’s lunch, much less Britain’s most successful and brilliant blues singer, but this time I broke that rule. And here we are today, on a spring evening, in The River Cafe garden – about to get to know each other. </p>

      <title>Ruthie's Table 4: Duro Olowu</title>
      <itunes:title>Ruthie's Table 4: Duro Olowu</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Duro Olowu is a man of many parts. Fashion designer, art director, mentor to young entrepreneurs, and a passionate lover of food. </p>
<p>Whenever he calls me, I never know if he is on his way to show his collection in Paris, curate an exhibition in Chicago, visit a wool factory in Tuscany, or just sitting down to have a plate of spaghetti bottarga in The River Cafe. Today I know where he is - with me on episode 32 of Ruthie's Table 4. Join us there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie's Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

      <title>Ruthie's Table 4: Iwan Wirth</title>
      <itunes:title>Ruthie's Table 4: Iwan Wirth</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Iwan Wirth - Swiss gallerist and co-founder of Hauser and Wirth - and Ruthie Rogers met through a mutual admiration and love for the artist Philip Guston.</p>
<p>On episode 29 of Ruthie's Table 4, he and Ruthie discuss what it’s like to have 15 galleries four restaurants, two farms, three hotels, and large family to cook for.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie's Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

Lily in May 1985 and The River Cafe 18 months later in September 1987.

Lily really does tell it as it is, and that's what she and Ruthie will do on episode 25. Talk about food, food and memories, food and family, food and love.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Tell anyone who works at The River Cafe that Maggie Gyllenhaal is coming in, and you will see a happy face.</p>
<p>And if you listen to Episode 23 of The Ruthie's Table 4, you will understand why. She talks to Ruthie about eating only spinach pie while directing the Academy Award–nominated <em>The Lost Daughter</em> in Greece, perfectly peeling an orange for her children’s breakfast, her joy of expressing gratitude to the cast with a special dinner, and much more.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie's Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

<p>And if you listen to Episode 23 of The Ruthie's Table 4, you will understand why. She talks to Ruthie about eating only spinach pie while directing the Academy Award–nominated <em>The Lost Daughter</em> in Greece, perfectly peeling an orange for her children’s breakfast, her joy of expressing gratitude to the cast with a special dinner, and much more.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>

      <itunes:title>Ruthie's Table 4: David Beckham Part 1</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>David Beckham loves family, loves football, and loves cooking.</p>
<p>On Episode 20 of The Ruthie's Table 4, he discusses it all with Ruthie Rogers—telling her how he learned to make a traditional risotto while playing for AC Milan, explaining why his idea of a perfect night is cooking dinner for his children, and recalling in detail the jellied eels, pie and mash, gammon and chips he ate as a child in the East End of London.</p>
<p>David has a lot of friends, a lot of colleagues, and certainly a lot of fans, but when he comes to The River Cafe, it’s with Victoria and their four children—always sitting at the table closest to the kitchen, sharing food and always enjoying a bottle of Sassicia, his favourite wine.</p>
<p>Listen to David Beckham, as you’ve never heard him before, on Episode 20 of <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/_qsmCrVJT2X6EOH7mhZr">Ruthie's Table 4</a>.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie's Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

      <title>Ruthie's Table 4: Tracey Ullman</title>
      <itunes:title>Ruthie's Table 4: Tracey Ullman</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie's Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

      <itunes:title>Ruthie's Table 4: Jude Law</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>For Jude Law, food is family. </em></p>
<p><em>On episode 14 of  Ruthie's Table 4, Jude talks to Ruthie Rogers about cooking ‘breakfast in bed’, with his grandfather, baking cakes with his aunt, his dreams of Lancashire hotpot and why for him happiness is putting six children to bed well fed and happy. </em></p>
<p><em>Listen to Ruthie and Jude talk food, family and love, the perfect ingredients to any conversation.</em></p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie's Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie's Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pete Davison is funny.</p>
<p>In River Cafe Table 4 he makes Ruthie Rogers laugh a lot - describing his life as a waiter in Staten Island, giving his recipe for Cup a Soup Noodles and recalling his stand up in a bowling alley to an audience of three.</p>
<p>Listen and Pete will make you laugh too.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie's Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today, on the sixth episode of Ruthie's Table 4, Emily Blunt gives Ruthie the recipe for the roast chicken she cooked, leading to a proposal of marriage, reveals why her best-loved pasta is cacio e pepe, and endearingly explains why she ran to Burger King before acting with Dame Judi Dench.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Ruthie's Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>
<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>
<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</p>

      <title>Introducing: Ruthie's Table 4</title>
      <itunes:title>Introducing: Ruthie's Table 4</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>On Ruthie's Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.</em></p>
