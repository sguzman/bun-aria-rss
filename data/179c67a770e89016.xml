    <title>High Horses VS High Fructose Corn Syrup</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>High horse?  High ground?  Naw girl... it&apos;s high <em>passion </em>that has us chewing over &quot;food&quot; that poses as food, migraines, brain fog, belly aches versus savory nourishment that allows us to LIVE so we can keep rescuing this FINE ART of homemaking.<br/>While we may want to believe food intake is a subjective topic... the fact is, we homemakers are, for the most part... IN CHARGE of providing ourselves and our families with the best nutrition possible.   Is that possible at the average grocery store?  Is it possible with fast and easy effort?   Does it matter in the grand scheme of things?<br/>In this episode, Shaye plays her inner &quot;food snob&quot; card and Ang talks about the French and their uncanny, intimidating portion control.  Today we talk about WHY do we feel so strongly about this particular topic and why we REALLY think it matters in view of Season 3&apos;s theme of &quot;doing the hard things&quot; and homemaking.   <br/><br/><b>THE HOLIDAYS ARE COMING!

After they discovered years ago that their daughter had gluten sensitivity, they struck out to find grains that her body could easily digest and thrive off eating - and that led them to einkorn. Einkorn is an ancient variety of wheat - the oldest we know of - that our bodies flourish off of because of its high protein and extremely weak gluten. Now, Jovial Foods is the top supplier of einkorn flours, einkorn pastas, Italian olive oils, prepackaged einkorn snacks, and the top-rated gluten-free pasta line. I’ve hardly met anyone in my life more intent on quality ingredients and quality products than Carla - I continually fall in love with the quality of these products (especially that buttery, rich, einkorn flour that I use to bake everything with!).

Thank you for sticking to what you set out to do because I don’t know how much more I can take of today’s media and what’s being thrown at us left and right (no pun intended). You two are such a HEALTHY brake from today’s world. The media takes up my mental space and then I am not at my best for my family and the two of you clear a healthy space for me to set out to do what I need to. Thank you so much.

It is such a RELIEF to be around two women who are wise, hilarious, and have many insightful things to say. The two of you always make me think twice about my day, my attitude, and even yesterday I made a few changes in my home per your podcast. Thank you for sticking to what you set out to do because I don’t know how much more I can take of today’s media and what’s being thrown at us left and right (no pun intended). You two are such a HEALTHY brake from today’s world. The media takes up my mental space and then I am not at my best for my family and the two of you clear a healthy space for me to set out to do what I need to. Thank you so much. You’re on point, in your element, in your zone, and I will kindly ask that you don’t do anything different!!!</em></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><br/><br/></p>]]></content:encoded>
