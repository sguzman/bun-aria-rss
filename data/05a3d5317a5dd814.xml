										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Automotive Sector Leads Industrial Digital Transformation Charge with US$238 Billion Investment, Followed by Electronics, Oil &amp; Gas, and FMCG</p>
<p>ABI Research’s new whitepaper explores the four key markets being transformed by Industry 4.0<span id="more-38805"></span><br />
The automotive sector is the biggest spender on digital transformation. In its latest whitepaper, 4 Key Industries Embracing Industry 4.0, global technology intelligence firm ABI Research forecasts that this sector’s spend on Industry 4.0 technologies will approach US$100 billion in 2022 and grow to over US$238 billion in 2030. The main reason for this is that OEMs and their suppliers need to adjust for the move away from the internal combustion engine to electric powertrains.</p>
<p>“The automotive industry is not alone in its digital transformation acceleration,” says Ryan Martin, Industrial and Manufacturing Markets Research Director at ABI Research. “Industry 4.0 – also known as smart manufacturing, connected manufacturing, the Industrial Internet of Things, and other monikers – has revolutionized the way companies manufacture, enhance, and distribute products using new technologies.”</p>
<p>Michael Larner, Industrial and Manufacturing Markets Research Director at ABI Research, adds, “This transformation is not just limited to the manufacturing sector, it has begun shaping other industries and markets throughout the globe.”</p>
<p>4 Key Industries Embracing Industry 4.0 whitepaper explores the state of Industry 4.0 in four key markets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automotive</li>
<li>Electronics &amp; High Technology</li>
<li>Oil &amp; Gas</li>
<li>Fast-Moving Consumer Goods</li>
</ul>
<p>To discover the drivers and inhibitors that are shaping the adoption of digital technologies across market maturity, practitioners’ investment priorities, and best practices for deploying the technologies, download the whitepaper, <a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUX-2FnMa5YMK5rGsZes60PyKXQh-2Fa1jQJtZ7rCxViO6GOEVQUEgTH-2FnjZ1Pa8mHKZKcdbMLBNu8LFkyNKlNqLQuaUj2u-2BfyzFwGLt-2Fa4j5DVWD6JUePwaTXQckhB1jIOxZLnpZc7e8MgQYD-2FB6jhd1LV6tWgEPrJPe5ZPOm4XYe-2FAOXld5_c5AHMOQPCyPFVpmUor6CsMOr-2Byky1I4yyQpdcR3fvsrTSlFLXEoiJGshZ2tb8MBpNBf3Gx7HWkGIpk6Sw4lFzOzzPzptHe17NTBDUc7BXW-2FWbUkbWnfKxRrbR3TrEwM9n-2FWD2FU7qVMCoDn5NCtA7bExpecz0SDl9jkFdtTPaChYRIocL-2Bf-2BgLYQ3Ls96L77i2XKabcOEnyvsMnc5hfObM2gRrUo5QwY17F4mREJWGLQlF-2FSJTkvFUnLEH2bzW90uURNoOXR5-2F1M3NAkK2hznjToM5a0Ea-2FcCIku-2FwflaQbH0IFhFFSAnlqKjB4wyV7YNlfBrf4tRgRUZhLrNyF-2Fzpm46v-2BA8vBp4NaHaKzoEMs-3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-safelink="true" data-linkindex="10">4 Key Industries Embracing Industry 4.0</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Volocopter Raises Additional USD 182 million in Second Signing of Series E Financing Round</p>
<p><span id="more-38792"></span></p>
<p>Volocopter, the pioneer of urban air mobility (UAM), has raised an additional USD 182 million in the second signing of its Series E funding round. NEOM – the Red Sea&#8217;s smart, cognitive region project – and GLy Capital Management of Hong Kong have joined Volocopter&#8217;s diverse investor base. This will carry the company beyond the certification of its electric passenger aircraft, the VoloCity air taxi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sustainable mobility is a tremendous challenge facing today&#8217;s world. Volocopter offers a suite of fully electric aircraft for urban missions. Crucially, Volocopter&#8217;s holistic UAM ecosystem approach connects all key global market players as it strives to get the industry off the ground. This includes developing multipurpose electric aircraft to bring passengers and goods safely to their destination (the VoloCity, VoloRegion, and VoloDrone), and enabling the physical and digital infrastructure to match (the VoloPort and VoloIQ).</p>
<p>&#8220;Attracting NEOM And GLy as investors is a great success and highlights our pole position in the commercial certification race. This is the key requirement to launching commercial operations and starting to generate revenue,&#8221; said Dirk Hoke, CEO of Volocopter.</p>
<p>Volocopter is a UAM leader, with over ten years of experience and upward of 1,500 successful test flights. As the first and only electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) company to receive Design Organisation Approval (DOA) from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Volocopter expects to launch its first commercial air taxi routes in the next two years in megacities like Singapore, Rome, Paris, and the NEOM region.</p>
<p>Christian Bauer, CCO of Volocopter, added: &#8220;Raising over USD 180 million despite the generally tense economic climate highlights Volocopter&#8217;s robust technology strategy and its ongoing progress toward achieving market readiness. We appreciate the remarkable spirit of collaboration and the trust that our existing and new shareholders have placed in us as we forge ahead on our journey to bring the urban air mobility ecosystem to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volocopter and NEOM signed a joint venture (JV) company in December 2021, becoming strategic partners to integrate the VoloCity and the VoloDrone into NEOM&#8217;s sustainable and smart mobility systems. The JV will design, integrate, and operate all-electric public flight routes for the initial seven years.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Neom we strongly believe in the potential for urban air mobility to provide a new dimension to future integrated transport systems. Building on our successful collaboration with Volocopter, we are excited to strengthen our partnership and to make a strategic investment in the future of mobility. We believe Volocopter is the best partner to build an advanced air mobility ecosystem in Neom. We look forward to realising this exciting mission jointly with Volocopter and its global partners&#8221; said Florian Lennert, Head of Mobility of NEOM.</p>
<p>GLy is backed by Geely Holding, and in their joint venture, Geely and Volocopter aim to bring UAM to China which is expected to become one of the largest markets for electric air taxis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Volocopter&#8217;s vision encompasses industrial short- and medium-range commercial passenger applications to bring efficiency to the way we move around our cities. I look forward to supporting their journey; a journey that promises to be exciting, safe, and scenic in equal measure,&#8221; said Hrvoje Krkalo, co-CEO of GLy Capital.</p>
<p>With many interested companies having passed the due diligence phase, Volocopter&#8217;s Series E funding round remains open.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><u>Driving Sustainable Production in the F&amp;B and Packaging Sector</u></strong></p>
<p><em>By Alfred Lee, President Industrial, Schaeffler Asia Pacific </em></p>
<p><span id="more-38738"></span></p>
<p>An increase in world population growth is predicted to drive an exponential rise in food demand between 59% to 98% by 2050. Amidst growing acute pressures placed on the Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) industry for higher production standards, environmental impact and sustainability goals are also fast becoming key concerns for businesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other major disruptions including evolving consumer demands, shifting government regulations, supply chain bottlenecks, and rising energy costs are part of the challenges that can impact the F&amp;B industry players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growing social awareness of the climate change threat and a greater need for a more sustainable economy are contrasted with the need for energy-intensive automated processes to maintain tiptop F&amp;B hygiene. Other factors including increased temperatures contributed by global warming and round-the-clock operations can lead to a need for high-frequency cleaning and maintenance cycles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While these factors pose significant challenges to the F&amp;B sector, we need to take advantage of the endless opportunities presented to evaluate processes and adopt innovative technologies to create more energy-efficient production lines that are reliable, hygienic, and friendlier on the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enabling Sustainability Through Digitalisation </strong></p>
<p>With most food, beverage and packaging production facilities running round-the-clock, unexpected failures resulting in unplanned downtime or improper management of facilities can significantly result in high carbon emissions and costs when left unoptimised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To effectively counter these challenges, smart and intelligent solutions such as automated condition monitoring and predictive maintenance can make it possible for manufacturers to monitor the operations of several machines in real-time. The immediate data gained provides insights into understanding energy consumption levels across operations and processes and generates forecasts of expected load profiles to optimise workflows for greater energy efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one of our plant facilities at Schaeffler Vietnam, we adopted a comprehensive suite of lifetime digital solutions such as the SmartCheck diagnostic system to better identify bearing damage, wear and tear, and irregularities to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining useful life of our production machinery. In addition, the data received from the system allowed our team to track and benchmark towards ideal targets and optimise maintenance work following actual operating conditions for higher energy efficiency across all production operations.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Building Sustainability Through Competencies</strong></p>
<p>The durability of machines and systems plays a huge role in the sustainability of production, particularly in machine-processed and highly automated food production. With variable demand loads and short-cycle times coupled with regular cleaning and maintenance cycles, using sub-optimal components may lead to poor chemical resistance and corrosion protection, which impacts energy wastage and downtime of machines. Similarly, these issues would also lead to high operating costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a specific use case from the production of baked goods, it was found that operating costs for conveyor belts in the production and assembly line could be lowered by 98% with reduced production stops and maintenance activities. This is because when the conveyor and production line stops, unwanted excess in the pipeline and machines must be destroyed and cleaned before a restart can happen – all of which require manpower and time that could be utilised elsewhere. Therefore, manufacturers need to take the relevant mechanical loads and ambient conditions into account even during the planning stages of their machines and choose optimal quality components in their production.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Riding on the Sustainability Wave  </strong></p>
<p>With heightening public awareness about climate change and the environment, consumers are leaning towards companies with sustainable-driven practices in their products and services. It is thus imperative for both manufacturers and industrial players to ride on this wave to support the decarbonisation of the entire supply chain to ease environmental threats and ensure business continuity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start off, manufacturers and industrial players should adopt internal governance measures and external regulations as part of their zero-carbon strategy. One way to kickstart the sustainability strategy is to manage new sourcing strategies across supply chains for better traceability and transparency and to choose suppliers that adhere to sustainable practices. To help stakeholders make the switch to sustainability practices, Schaeffler offers smart technologies such as OPTIME and OPTIME C1 that let organisations reduce production downtime and optimise supply chains for greater cost benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on our long-standing expertise in the field of bearing engineering, vibration analysis, and lubrication, the OPTIME Ecosystem enables a high level of intelligence that supports predictive maintenance and condition monitoring to eliminate unplanned downtimes in machines, a highly unfavourable situation in the F&amp;B industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should manufacturers and industrial players find fault with their machines’ lubrication, potentially affecting food production, our smart lubricator OPTIME C1 also helps streamline lubrication management and turns complexity into simplicity by cutting on the time and effort in tedious manual lubricating and checking throughout the plant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the intrinsic nature of the F&amp;B industry is fast-paced and calls for the right type of rolling bearings in conveyor belts and machines. It is imperative for manufacturers to engage in bearing solutions that meet the requirements of the food, beverage and packing sector – and we offer just the right kind of bearing solutions to ensure smooth and continuous operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Schaeffler, we are actively driving sustainable practices across our value chain guided by our Sustainability Roadmap to meet our goals of climate neutrality for in-house production by 2030 and supply chain by 2040. To date, we have successfully transited towards renewable sources across our production sites in Germany and aim for all our global sites to make the switch by 2024.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>With all things considered, there is considerable potential for the food, beverage, and packaging sector to leverage intelligent solutions and tools to improve sustainability in the industry. While the transformation might seem daunting, identifying the right technologies, components, systems, and development partners will allow industry players to be well on their way to unlocking hidden benefits of sustainability while taking responsibility for a cleaner and greener world.<!--more--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cost-effective labelling robot wins the 2022 igus ROIBOT Award</strong></p>
<p><strong>An amortisation period of 16 to 24 months and a zero margin of error convinces the panel of expert judges for the robotics competition</strong><span id="more-38735"></span></p>
<p><strong>Simple, cost-effective automation solutions can be found both in an increasing number of Small and Medium Enterprises and among large industrial players. Every two years, igus presents the ROIBOT Award for the most creative applications. This year, the inventors of a labelling robot, the developers of a fully automatic container system for growing vegetables and herbs, and the designers of a wallpapering device received the coveted prize.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robots are in use all over the world – in logistics, laboratories, and agriculture. Every two years, experts from industry and trade press work with igus GmbH to honour the most cost-effective, creative, clever solutions with the ROIBOT Award. The focus of the competition is on igus Low Cost Automation solutions such as delta robots, Cartesian robots, and articulated arm robots. The award&#8217;s name says it all and reveals main decision criterion for the panel of judges: return on investment that quickly pays for the outlay. A total of 110 submissions from 20 countries show the diverse application options for cost-effective robotics. In the second iteration of the competition, MFG Technik &amp; Service GmbH won over the judges with its &#8220;LabelMonkey&#8221; labelling robot, winning robotic components worth 5,000 euros. A robolink DP multi-axis articulated robot for 7,700 euros is the heart of this system. Its two printing modules ensure that logistics labels are reliably affixed to pallets. The LabelMonkey is a simple, cost-effective mechanism for the end user. The system pays for itself in just 16 to 24 months, making it very attractive for many logisticians to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Automatic harvest assistant takes second place</strong></p>
<p>The increasing extremes in weather conditions due to climate change requires ever greater expenditure of resources and personnel in agriculture. Then there is crop storage and the long transport routes. Farmionic, an Austrian company, has therefore set itself a very special goal: The engineers are developing the vegetable garden of the future. It is a fully automatic, resource-conserving container system for growing vegetables and herbs with 24/7 availability, anywhere in the world. A robolink DP robot takes on all tasks, from planting to harvesting, on a seventh axis. The robotics system costs 11,200 euros. It pays for itself in 13 to 15 months. The pioneering invention took second place. tapo-fix GmbH &amp; Co. KG, based in Wolfsburg, took third. Using a room linear robot, the manufacturer of wallpapering equipment for home and crafts has developed an extremely affordable automation solution for applying paste to metal. The acquisition value is 6,700 euros. To free up employees, the dosing robot is now assuming this task. It works extremely precisely and hand-in-hand with staff, saving the company up to 8,000 euros per year.</p>

<p><i>From L-R: Mr Desmond Tay, Vice President for Strategic Planning, City Energy, Mr Perry Ong, Chief Executive Officer, City Energy, Mr David DeVries, Chief Technology Officer, Sydrogen, Mr Mun Meng Wai, Assistant Director, Strategic Marketing, Sydrogen</i></p>
<p>City Energy Pte Ltd. (as Trustee of City Energy Trust) (“City Energy”) and Sydrogen Energy Pte. Ltd. (“Sydrogen”) (hereinafter, the “Parties”) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to study the Proof of Concept (“PoC”) of generating an end-to-end hydrogen fuel cell solution for off- grid power supply, utilising high-purity hydrogen extracted from the town gas produced by City Energy. The study is expected to commence in early 2023 and will continue until mid-2024, at which point the parties will further explore town gas-powered hydrogen fuel cells for broader off-grid applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hydrogen has gained global recognition as an important potential energy source in the world’s journey towards decarbonisation, with more than 50 countries having committed to hydrogen road maps and announced associated projects. This is the first time that a hydrogen fuel cell study will be conducted using town gas as fuel source in Singapore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hydrogen has emerged as a key component of Singapore’s decarbonisation strategy, with the announcement of the “4 Switches” in 2019, and Energy Market Authority (EMA)’s Energy 2050 Committee Report. Distributed Energy Resources (“DER”) from clean energy like low-carbon hydrogen, coupled with smart technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), enable Singapore’s energy grid to flexibly optimise the system at a local level, leading to reduced overall grid capacity and costs. Advancement of smart technologies also accelerate aggregation and management of DERs acting as a virtual power plant, which contributes to a more reliable and stable system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore has stepped up efforts to electrify its transport sector with supporting infrastructure. This includes establishing up to 60,000 Electric Vehicle (EV) charging points island wide by 2030. Such rapid electrification will add significant demand to the power grid, thereby necessitating grid upgrades where current electrical infrastructure is insufficient to meet demand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In view of these developments, City Energy is collaborating with Sydrogen on a proof of concept to establish the viability of distributed power generation using fuel cells and the town gas network. The parties seek to demonstrate that hydrogen fuel cells can be used as an off-grid decentralised means to augment grid infrastructure upgrades that support large-scale EV charging in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For City Energy, which is the sole producer and retailer of town gas in Singapore, successful completion of the PoC would enable the repurposing of the extensive town gas network for the distribution of hydrogen via hydrogen-enriched (up to 65%) town gas to fuel a network of hydrogen fuel cells around the island and form a network of DERs to serve residential and commercial users with on-site basic utilities and EV charging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perry Ong, Chief Executive Officer of City Energy, said: “As the nation’s sole piped town gas provider for more than 880,000 homes and businesses, we look forward to the possibility of using the town gas network to support the hydrogen economy development, and accelerate deployment of green hydrogen in Singapore. It is our pleasure to collaborate with Sydrogen on this innovative PoC to accelerate Singapore’s hydrogen adoption, electrification goals and path to net zero emissions.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>David DeVries, Chief Technology Officer of Sydrogen, said: “Decentralised power generation plays an important role in diversifying our energy use. The proof of concept combines Sydrogen’s Deep Tech capabilities with a key ecosystem player to develop home-grown solutions for to future-proof Singapore’s energy supply future. We are glad to work with forward-looking partners such as City Energy in this endeavour”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Sydrogen, a JV between Nanofilm Technologies International and a subsidiary of Temasek, was only formed in 2021, Sydrogen has already begun shipping of metallic bipolar plates to a key automotive customer in China and also the provision of coating services to other players in the market. This PoC will provide additional opportunity to showcase Sydrogen’s capabilities in stationary and distributed power systems connected to gas networks.</p>
