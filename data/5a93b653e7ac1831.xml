Description:
This poster will spark conversations about the emerging Uncle Sam Plantation Project, that is part of the Grinnell College Immersive Experiences Lab (GCIEL). The GCIEL is an interdisciplinary community of inquiry exploring new ways to approach the liberal arts and make them more widely accessible through immersive 3D, VR, and MR experiences. A GCIEL project development team consisting of Dr. Sarah Purcell (History), Dr. David Neville (Digital Liberal Arts Collaborative), and three students (3D artist, software developer, and subject-matter expert) are working on creating a 3D model of the Uncle Sam Plantation, a 19th-century sugar plantation that was located near the town of Convent in St. James Parish, Louisiana. Constructed between 1829 and 1843, the Uncle Sam plantation was once one of the most intact and architecturally-unified plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States and a prime example of Greek Revival-style architecture. Before the plantation complex was razed in 1940 to make room for a river levee, floor plans and elevations of the buildings were produced by the Historic American Buildings Survey.

The poster will present both technological and historical/philosophical issues that are important to this kind of digital project. The team is grappling with ethical and technological issues simultaneously as we seek to represent the physical plantation that was part of a system of racialized hegemony in the United States. The project lies, therefore, at the intersection of race, visualization, and the spatial humanities. Questions to be explored in the poster include: What are the ethics of creating an immersive digital experience that relates to enslaved labor and white supremacy? How can immersive environments act as tools of historical recreation and preservation? What was the significance of the Uncle Sam plantation in the history of slavery and of Louisiana? Is there a connection between digitally created immersive environments and the abolitionist technique of moral suasion (for example, can technology enhance the anti-slavery impulse or fight racism)? Finally, how can an interdisciplinary team best answer these questions while also implementing an excellent technical project? We hope the poster can spark deep and interesting conversations.</media:description>

The physical layout of a museum gallery and the manner in which artwork is installed influence how visitors interpret an exhibition. The Virtual Museum Experience is a prototype virtual reality application that allows users to experiment with the physical layout of a museum space and the relationship of exhibition objects to each other. By changing the structure of an exhibition, users assume a more active role in constructing meaning and understanding the effects of layouts on spatial narratives and space-use patterns.</media:description>

Using a Self–designed Video Game to Improve Writing Outcomes by David Neville, Digital Liberal Arts Specialist at Grinnell College. Presented on 10 December 2016 at the Immersive Environments Colloquium at Vanderbilt University. The high definition, closed captioned presentation briefly introduces viewers to activity theory before drawing parallels between game-based and real-world activity systems. The presentation then details the creation of a 3D digital game-based language learning environment before concluding with a description of how this environment was evaluated and what students learned by being immersed in it.</media:description>

Creating Language Learning Games for the Classroom by David Neville, Digital Liberal Arts Specialist at Grinnell College. Presented on 09 December 2016 at the Immersive Environments Colloquium at Vanderbilt University. The high definition, closed captioned presentation details the development of two language learning games: (1) a text-based interactive fiction game; and (2) a 3D digital game-based language learning environment, and describes the lessons I learned from the design and development process. The presentation ends with a brief description of a project I am currently working on, a 3D/VR simulation of a 19th-century Louisiana sugar plantation.</media:description>

Re-rendered high definition video with closed captioning explains how I came upon the idea of using digital game-based learning approaches for second language acquisition. Original screen recording was made on 28 April 2010. In the video I mention that I intend to make a game for teaching German language and culture; links to the game and a research article on the game are listed above. The article reports on a mixed-methods study evaluating the use of a three-dimensional digital game-based language learning (3D-DGBLL) environment to teach German two-way prepositions and specialized vocabulary within a simulated real-world context of German recycling and waste management systems. The study assumed that goal-directed player activity in this environment would configure digital narratives, which in turn would help study participants in the experimental group to co-configure story maps for ordering and making sense of the problem spaces encountered in the environment. The study further assumed that these participants would subsequently rely on the story maps to help them structure written L2 narratives describing an imagined personal experience closely resembling the gameplay of the 3D-DGBLL environment. The study found that immersion in the 3D-DGBLL environment influenced the manner in which the second language was invoked in these written narratives: Participants in the experimental group produced narratives containing more textual indicators describing the activity associated with the recycling and waste management systems and the spaces in which these systems are located. Increased usage of these indicators suggest that participants in the experimental group did indeed rely on story maps generated during 3D gameplay to structure their narratives, although stylistic and grammatical features of the narratives suggest, however, that changes could be made to the curricular implementation of the 3D-DGBLL environment. The study also puts forward ideas for instructional best practices based on research findings and suggests future areas of development and investigation.</media:description>
