   <media:description>This past spring I attended the FRC North Carolina State Championships and got to talk to a bunch of the teams. If you've never heard of FIRST Robotics, you're in for a real treat, because this competition is AWESOME. (If you haven't seen the hub video for all these interviews, check it out first! https://youtu.be/BycqWYE3Ais)

These teams, thousands of them, have only about 2 months to design, build, and test robots to play a brand new game before the competitions begin, and then their work is put to the test! It would be a lot for any professional engineer, but these kids are still in high school! It's pretty incredible.

This video is the complete pit interview with FIRST Team 5727. Enjoy!

   <media:description>The electrons are back! This is the first of three videos discussing electricity - what is it, how does it work, how do we use it? This first installment talks about the speed of electricity and electrical signals in wires. Next up is Ohm's law, and what resistance really does in circuits, and third, I'll be taking another look at the experiment featured on Veritasium last year, building on the first two videos to explore the mechanism that couples the two long wires with a little more scrutiny. Enjoy!

   <media:description>This past spring I attended the FRC North Carolina State Championships and got to talk to a bunch of the teams. If you've never heard of FIRST Robotics, you're in for a real treat, because this competition is AWESOME.

These teams, thousands of them, have only about 2 months to design, build, and test robots to play a brand new game before the competitions begin, and then their work is put to the test! It would be a lot for any professional engineer, but these kids are still in high school! It's pretty incredible.

Stay tuned for all of the individual pit interviews!

If you're interested in finding a team or attending an event, here's the official team search from FIRST:
https://www.firstinspires.org/team-event-search
And if you want to know more about any specific team (like a link to their website) you can probably find it on Blue Alliance:
https://www.thebluealliance.com/

If you're looking to help a team as a mentor, volunteer, or sponsor:

   <media:description>I've had piles and piles of questions about the research that I did in gradschool, so here it is! Be careful what you wish for... About a year ago I defended my dissertation from UCSB in Materials, exploring, among other things, growth of a semiconductor called lead selenide, a narrow-gap material with a bright (ba-dum-tss) future in the realm of infrared optoelectronics. I hope you enjoy!

Viewers of the channel are probably going to be most interested in all the fun machines featured in chapter 2, &quot;Experimental Methods&quot;
- Molecular beam epitaxy (making crystals in ultra high vacuum)
- X-ray diffraction (explained with almost no math)
- Electron microscopy (many variants)

   <media:description>Today's video is about my favorite microscope ever. I did a lot of work in gradschool on this STEM, or Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope, and today I get to share how it works! Extra thanks to the Materials Department at UCSB for letting me film in the lab!

Admittedly it's old footage, but since it's REAL research, I was waiting for the paper to get published. If anybody's super-curious, here's the doi:
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.cgd.2c00188
(unfortunately it's not indexed on SciHub yet - I'm trying to figure out how to get the manuscript posted elsewhere for you guys - check back in a couple days if you're curious!)

   <media:description>A real lunar eclipse is DARK - the red moon is super faint, and it doesn't illuminate the clouds around it the way the regular sunlit moon does. Using two cameras, a tracker, and a bit of math. I created a video that's hopefully closer to what the human eye sees than what any single auto-exposing camera would be able to manage.

There's a lot more info about the process in the full video: https://youtu.be/6R-iMmcQ5aI

   <media:description>Hey everyone! it's been nearly a month since the eclipse and I'm FINALLY ready to publish my timelapse - you'll see why it took so long in this video... I set up two cameras and did an extremely crude high dynamic range stack that is able to resolve some detail on the sunlit moon, and some detail on the shadowed moon, simultaneously. I wish I'd taken 6 pictures at once, and that they were easy to align, so that I could have a full lograithmic-ish HDR picture, but for now, this is my best eclipse timelapse yet. I hope you like it!

   <media:description>Lots of detail in a second video, but I've spent the last few weeks since the eclipse trying to process my timelapse into the most realistic view I could. In reality when you look up at a half-eclipsed moon, you can totally see that part of it already looks red, but if you just take a picture with one camera, the dynamic range is nowhere near where it would need to be to actually see what your eye does - so I fudged it - using two cameras and combining both clips in post. Hope you enjoy!
