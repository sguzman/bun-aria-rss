   <media:description>What's in our minds when we throw an if/then sentence out there? How do we work out what worlds we may be talking about? In this week's episode, we talk about the semantics of conditionals: what an &quot;if&quot; looks like logically, why a simple logical arrow isn't enough to capture the complexities of conditionals, and how we change what possibilities we allow ourselves to think of based on what our &quot;if&quot; clause holds.

This is Topic #95!

Sources:
The theory of conditionals here dates back to Kratzer's 1986 paper &quot;Conditionals,&quot; which is where that quote at the end comes from: http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/ThkMjYxN/Conditionals.pdf

The idea of if-clauses as restrictors actually goes back to David Lewis' 1975 paper &quot;Adverbs of Quantification,&quot; which you can find here: http://www.andrewmbailey.com/dkl/Adverbs_of_Quantification.pdf. 

The presentation was based mostly on some of the usual  semantic suspects:

Crucial inspiration also from here http://books.google.ca/books?id=1NwWDgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=frana+modality+in+the+nominal+domain&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s , in a chapter by Ilaria Frana titled &quot;Modality in the Nominal Domain: The Case of Adnominal Conditionals.&quot; 

There's also a series of videos on YouTube that explores the topic from a more philosophical point-of-view, and arrives at a different conclusion, but might still be of interest, starting here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zxp2-_pLCE

   <media:description>What can silence tell us about the syntax of a sentence? How do we know what meaning to fill in when words are missing? In this week's episode, we talk about ellipsis: what rules are at work to tell us how to use it, how sentence structure plays into what words we can leave out, and whether words are even missing at all, or just hiding. 

This is Topic #94!

   <media:description>How do some sentences trick us into thinking they're good, when really they're not? And what can that tell us about how we process language? In this week's video, we take a look at the comparative illusion, a tricky kind of sentence that seems meaningful, but falls apart when we consider it further. And then we look at what exactly it is about them that confuses our minds.

This is a shorter format video that we'd been toying with making for a while! Do you like this length? We'll be making more of our regular length videos coming up soon!

   <media:description>How do we know who &quot;he&quot; is? And how does &quot;he&quot; differ from &quot;himself&quot; when we interpret it? In this week's episode, we talk about the syntax and semantics of pronouns: how we can place them in sentences, how they link up to variables, and the role of context in how we interpret them.

   <media:description>How do events factor into our mental linguistics? How can we adjust our logic to capture different sentence permutations? In this week's episode, we take a look at event semantics: what problems they're meant to solve, how they help us limit time and place in our sentences, and what evidence we have that events are real.

   <media:description>We were really excited to get a chance to talk with Dr. Tecumseh Fitch! Dr. Fitch is an evolutionary biologist and cognitive scientist who received his PhD from Brown University, and is now a professor in the Department of Cognitive Biology at the University of Vienna. He’s published extensively on the evolution of speech, language, and music, and is the author of the 2010 book The Evolution of Language.

In our interview, we discussed the following topics:
- his recent research on whether it's anatomy or neurology holding back monkeys from speech
- his thoughts on Darwin's hypotheses about how language may have evolved
- how to come up with good hypotheses about how language evolved, given that it doesn't leave fossils
- what he believes is different about humans that led to the development of language

... and more! Thanks again to Dr. Fitch for speaking with us.

His book, The Evolution of Language, can be found here: http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780521677363

   <media:description>How do we try influencing what other people think about the world? What techniques get used for bending the truth? In this week's episode, we take a look at some of the linguistics around propaganda and censorship: what people can try beyond just outright lying, how using conversational rules can get you to think things that aren't said, and how we can use bias to influence people's views.

   <media:description>How do we capture the meaning of &quot;may&quot; or &quot;can&quot;? What kinds of linguistic math do we need to understand them? In this week's episode, we take a look at modality: where words like &quot;must&quot; fit in our meanings; how we consider many ways the world could be to account for their semantics; and how the same string of sounds can have a lot of flavours.

This is Topic #90!

Sources:
A good portion of the presentation was based off of Kai von Fintel's Intensional Semantics notes (http://web.mit.edu/fintel/fintel-heim-intensional.pdf)

We also consulted Angelika Kratzer's papers from 1977, 1981, and 1991, where all these ideas about modality originally come from:

The 1977 paper: http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/s08/semantics2/kratzer77.pdf

The 1981 paper: http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/s08/semantics2/kratzer81.pdf

The 1991 paper: https://udrive.oit.umass.edu/kratzer/kratzer-modality.pdf

For background -- historical and otherwise -- we consulted Basic Concepts in Modal Logic (https://mally.stanford.edu/notes.pdf) and William Starr's lecture notes: (http://williamstarr.net/teaching.html). 

Finally, we drew some inspiration from Seth Cable's recent (and wonderfully lucid) Formal Semantics notes: http://people.umass.edu/scable/LING620-SP17/Handouts/

   <media:description>We can put whole clauses inside other phrases, but what does that do to their structure and their meaning? In this week's episode, we take a look at the syntax and semantics of relative clauses: how these clauses kind of look like adjectives; how using them creates islands from which words can't escape; and how moving things around in them throws semantic variables into the sentence setup.

This is Topic #89!

   <media:description>We're really excited to have gotten to interview Sali Tagliamonte at the Linguistic Society of America meeting in January! Dr. Tagliamonte is a full professor at the University of Toronto, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. She's written a bunch of books and articles about sociolinguistics, and how languages shift and vary over time. You can find out more about her and her work at http://individual.utoronto.ca/tagliamonte/

In our interview, we discussed the following topics:
- why it's so important to investigate how teens use language, and what facets of adolescent speech she finds most interesting
- what differences we can find in spoken vs. online language use
- the Toronto English Project, and the changes we see in people's language use over the course of their lives
- how language might look in the future
- how to better inform people about how language variation works
- the role of social media in telling people about linguistics, and in language change

... and more! Thanks again to Dr. Tagliamonte for speaking with us.

Her most recent book, Teen Talk: The Language of Adolescents, can be found here: http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781107676176

   <media:description>How do verbs like &quot;give&quot; and &quot;put&quot; juggle more than one object? Is there an element that lets verbs cause things to happen? In this week's episode, we talk about splitting up the verb phrase: how our basic syntactic theory has a hard time with verbs with more than one object; how the syntax of causation shows us why we should expand our trees; and how once we break the phrase up, we can capture all sorts of facts, from two-object verbs to ambiguities.

This is Topic #88!

Much of the basic argument found in the video can be found in this set of slides: https://apps.carleton.edu/people/cussery/assets/7._Introducing_little_v.pdf

Examples were taken from Lisa Travis's 2010 book Inner Aspect (http://blogs.mcgill.ca/mcling/files/2012/01/Travis2010InnerAspect_Chpt6.pdf) and this paper by Heidi Harley:

There's also good stuff in the Wikipedia article on causatives: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causative#Lexical

Some of the original work proposing splitting the VP includes Angelika Kratzer's 1996 paper &quot;Severing the external
argument from its verb&quot; in Rooryck &amp; Zaring, eds., &quot;Phrase structure and the lexicon, 109-137&quot;.

   <media:description>What's the difference between &quot;thinking&quot; and &quot;knowing&quot;? What rules do we follow for adjusting our conversational worlds? In this week's episode, we delve into the semantics and pragmatics of presuppositions: which words come equipped with them, how presuppositions depend on the situation and our mental worlds, and what antipresuppositions can tell us about the mechanics of interpreting sentences.

This is Topic #87!

   <media:description>How do sentences fit inside other sentences? Where can we put words like &quot;that&quot;, &quot;whether&quot;, and &quot;if&quot;? In this week's episode, we take a look at complementizer phrases: what exactly they are, how they account for embedded sentences and questions, and what they can let us do to capture word order in languages like German and Dutch.

   <media:description>What kinds of sentences do we hear from babies and toddlers? How much grammar can we find in their language use? In this week's episode, we take a look at child syntactic stages: what characteristics kids display as they progress from one to two to many words, whether their grammars are similar to those of adults, and how their linguistic interpretation may tell us more than just their speech.

   <media:description>We're really excited to have gotten to interview Anne Charity Hudley at the Linguistic Society of America meeting in January! Dr. Charity Hudley is an associate professor at the College of William and Mary, and the inaugural William and Mary Professor of Community Studies. She's co-authored two books on English language variation in classroom settings, and also wrote the section on language and racialization in the Oxford Handbook of Language and Society. She's a great sociolinguistic researcher who's doing a lot of work on dialectal variation, linguistic justice, and more. You can find out more about her and her work at https://annecharityhudley.com/

In our interview, we discussed the following topics:
- the importance of attending to language variation in the classroom
- what teachers and students have to learn from linguists, and vice versa
- the role language and linguistics has played in racialization, and how to get away from that
- how to work to convince people of the importance of interacting with language variation and linguistic justice
- why we should do more to get younger people involved in linguistics and research

... and more! Thanks again to Dr. Charity Hudley for speaking with us.
