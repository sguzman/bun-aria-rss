The Fence is the story of Mr. Felix, a grumpy old rabbit, and Marcus, the cheerful young mole who lives in the next tree. Their outlooks on life could not be more different. Their dispositions could not be less similar. When Mr. Felix can no longer tolerate Marcus&#39;s exuberance, Mr. Felix takes drastic action. But what will happen when a storm rips through the forest? Don&#39;t worry--this story ends on a happy and hopeful note. ENJOY!
If you love this story, please share it with all rabbits with enviable whiskers, any and all molescouts, every single frogcaster, and your friends! They might just need a good story these days. Big People: leave a rating or review in your podcast app!

This is a quiet, sleepy story perfect for bedtime. The main character is an abandoned house that has become the resting place not for people (as intended for all houses) but for hapless woodland creatures who seek refuge from the elements. The house gets a surprise when she hears voices on her porch. Soon a &#39;For Sale&#39; sign is placed in the yard. Follow along as House relives her early days of life decades ago, and the new possibilities in her future once the sign goes up. What will happen when a couple decides to buy the house? You&#39;ll have to listen and find out.
If you love this story, please share it with all mice scurrying through your basement, any and all realtors who wear bangles on their wrists, all sleepy raccoons, and your friends! They might just need a good story these days. Big People: leave a rating or review in your podcast app!

Little Hedgehog and Bebe decide to write their very own book. They imagine holding it in their tiny paws, and seeing their names on the cover. But what if the fantasy of book-writing does not quite match the reality? Follow along as they meet an impressed caterpillar, a confused spider, a scowling weasel, and a prolific (and prickly) writer who just happens to live very nearby.  
If you love this story, please share it with all sleepy cows off in the distance, any and all forest comedy night headliners, all choir members, and your friends! They might just need a good story these days. Big People: leave a rating or review in your podcast app!
If your tiny person wants to share a story they&#39;ve written, please send photos or recordings of it to rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com. I&#39;d LOVE to see their artwork, stories, and anything else they&#39;d like to share.

Mr. Beetle is back for another tale. In the last year, Mr. Beetle has skyrocketed to fame. He is known throughout the land as being inadvertently hilarious and somehow simultaneously boring. He makes bugs throughout the region laugh until it hurts, then he puts them to sleep with the dullness of his storylines. Gwen convinces Mr. Beetle to take a break from his adoring fans. What will become of Mr. Beetle once he is no longer immersed in the 25th branch&#39;s &#34;beetle mania&#34;?! Will one of his listeners be eaten by an ominously dangling spider? You&#39;ll just have to listen to find out. ENJOY!

Squirrel is the best sales squirrel in the business, but he is also chronically late. When he finds a shiny new elevator in the tree he needs to climb, he figures it won&#39;t hurt to take a ride rather than rumple his suit. Once Squirrel is inside, he finds himself on an unexpected adventure. Will Squirrel be late for his sales meeting? And who is the strangely enthusiastic mouse huddled in the corner? You&#39;ll just have to listen and find out. ENJOY!

How do we know what we know? That is the question I wanted to explore in this story. In it we follow a tortoise named Lionel, who is challenged by another tortoise to consider how well he understands the world around him, and how he&#39;s gained the knowledge he claims to have. I hope this one sparks your own thinking on this topic. ENJOY!
If you love this story, please share it with all sweatshirt-wearing tortoises, all book club members who actually read the books, all pigs who claim to have sprouted from plants, and all of your friends! They might just need a good story these days. Big People: if you happen to have an Apple device, leave a review in Apple Podcasts!

Mr. Beetle has decided to host a weekly storytime for young bugs (aided by his friend Gwen, who has agreed to operate the music player in an effort to provide the perfect soundtrack). Hosting a live storytime turns out to be slightly more complicated than Mr. Beetle imagined. How will his story end? Will it make any sense at all? And how will the young bugs (and the one terrifying mouse) respond to it? Is Mr. Beetle destined to become a legendary storyteller? You&#39;ll just have to listen and find out.

Mr. Beetle has decided to host a weekly storytime for young bugs (aided by his friend Gwen, who has agreed to operate the music player in an effort to provide the perfect soundtrack). Hosting a live storytime turns out to be slightly more complicated than Mr. Beetle imagined. How will his story end? Will it make any sense at all? And how will the young bugs (and the one terrifying mouse) respond to it? Is Mr. Beetle destined to become a legendary storyteller? You&#39;ll just have to listen and find out.

I think you are going to love this story. I know I say that a lot, but I really think you will love this one. It&#39;s a story about friendship, big feelings, the randomness in life, and things that are out of our control. It&#39;s about a spider and her dearest friends. ENJOY!
If you love this story, please share it with all spiders you happen upon in your ceiling corners, all dogs with jangly collars, any and all people who use canes, and your friends! They might just need a good story these days. And if you happen to have an Apple device, leave a review in Apple Podcasts!
If your tiny person wants to share a story they&#39;ve written, please send photos or recordings of it to rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com. I&#39;d LOVE to see their artwork, stories, and anything else they&#39;d like to share.

This story is a follow-up to one of my most popular stories, We All Fell In. If you are new to the podcast, you may want to go back and listen to that episode first. This one is about FEARS but it is NOT SCARY. A new cast of characters accidentally falls into a deep dark hole...will they find a way out? Listen and ENJOY!

BIG THANKS to the listeners who provided sound effects used in the story: CALVIN, OSCAR, CLAIRE, ERIK, and ONA!
I am STILL COLLECTING sound effects (and I never want to stop)! Just use the voice memo app on your phone, record your tiny people making a (recognizable) sound, and email it to rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com! You might just hear your sound in a future story.

Our friend Herman is back with a new story about dealing with FRUSTRATION. But before we get to that, a STUDIO SPIDER has brought to my attention that there is an ISSUE with Herman. In this ridiculous episode, we come to terms with my fallibility and listen as Herman copes with an increasingly frustrating situation. All he wants to do is add an overhang above his door so he can listen to the rain. No big deal, right?

It&#39;s time for another TWO PART story! My first one (The Mistake Artist) was so well-received, and won so many awards - okay, not YET, but give it time - that I decided to tell you another one.

You can send me your very own sound effect! Just use the voice memo app on your phone, record your tiny people making a (recognizable) sound, and email it to rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com! You might just hear your sound in a future story.
Thank you to ZOE for helping me with the reminder at the beginning of this episode!!!
Your child can help me too! Here are the lines:
Remember, there are no pictures. You&#39;ll have to imagine the pictures in your mind. You can imagine them however you want. OK, here we go!

SEASON SIX IS HERE! I am thrilled to share a brand new story with you after months of hibernating...er, daydreaming and writing. The Mistake Artist is my very first two-part story and I think you will love it. It features a little girl who is a bit of a perfectionist about her art, and a magical being who takes the girl&#39;s &#34;mistakes&#34; and showcases them as things of beauty in her faraway realm of magical beings. Tune in next time for part two of this story and hear how Em learns to reframe her mistakes as opportunities.
If your tiny person wants to share a story they&#39;ve written, please send photos or recordings of it to rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com. I LOVE to see their artwork, stories, and anything else they&#39;d like to share.

Happy Holidays, friends! This is not a holiday themed story, but it&#39;s a very sweet one about growing up and learning to set aside the search for perfection in life. ENJOY!
I will be taking a break to write more stories for you. In the meantime, if you have a moment, please share the show with friends! They will be so happy to have easier bedtimes, peaceful car rides, and generally happier tiny people. I will be ever so grateful, too.
If your tiny person wants to share a story they&#39;ve written, please send photos or recordings of it to rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com. I LOVE to see their artwork, stories, and anything else they&#39;d like to share.

<p>BIG THANKS to the listeners who provided sound effects used in the story: RILEY and NORA</p>
<p>You can send me your very own sound effect! Just use the voice memo app on your phone, record your tiny people making a (recognizable) sound, and email it to rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com! They might just hear their sound in a future story.</p>
<p>Thank you to KENDI for helping me with the reminder at the beginning of this episode!!!</p>
<p>Your child can help me too! Here are the lines:</p>
<p>Remember, there are no pictures. You'll have to imagine the pictures in your mind. You can imagine them however you want. OK, here we go!</p>
<p>Also, my book is available NOW. Find it here: https://amzn.to/3DeLf6E Thank you so much to those who have supported my work by getting the book!</p>

Our story today is about a tiny person joining a family as a toddler instead of as a newborn baby, in a foster care or adoption situation. Foster care and adoption can look so many different ways and this story depicts just one way it might look (from the perspective of a sweet little hamster, naturally). My hope is the story can convey some of the many feelings that family members experience during such a time and can spark a conversation about how families can grow. Thank you to the family of tiny people that inspired this story: REID, NOLYN, MILES, BLAIRE, and MASON.
Today’s episode features wonderful SOUND EFFECTS from listeners GRACE, EVRYN, NORA, LUKE, BRIANNA, GLORIA, ALAINA, and SAGE. You can send me your very own sound effect. Just use the voice memo app on your phone, record your Tiny People making a (recognizable) sound, and email it to rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com! They might just hear their sound in a future story.

I’m fairly certain your tiny people will not know the words ‘merchandise’ and ‘protagonist’. If they do, I am super impressed!

Little Hedgehog is BACK for a school’s out episode. Little Hedgehog has big plans for summer break and she leads her dad and Bebe on a ridiculous adventure. Enjoy!
Also, Mr. Eric from What If World appears as MR. HEEDGEHOG! Do not even think about confusing him with a hedgehog. He has 2 E’s in his name and he is quite proud.
You can hear me on the latest episode of What If World as I help Mr. Eric tell a very wacky story based on listeners’ ‘what if’ questions. Find What If World wherever you get your podcasts.
This week there are many school’s out-themed podcast episodes available by fellow Kids Listen members. Take a look at the Kids Listen iOs mobile app or visit http://www.kidslisten.org for more information!

      <itunes:subtitle>Schools Out for Little Hedgehog: A Story for Kids</itunes:subtitle>
      <description>LITTLE HEDGEHOG T-SHIRTS are now available! OMG. Big people, don’t worry - I speak in code about this in the actual episode. I’m fairly certain your tiny people will not know the words ‘merchandise’ and ‘protagonist’. If they do, I am super impressed! Go to the new ‘Shop’ tab at http://www.littlestoriestinypeople.com or you can head over to my threadless store at http://littlestoriestinypeople.threadless.com to choose from two adorable designs.
Little Hedgehog is BACK for a school’s out episode. Little Hedgehog has big plans for summer break and she leads her dad and Bebe on a ridiculous adventure. Enjoy!
Also, Mr. Eric from What If World appears as MR. HEEDGEHOG! Do not even think about confusing him with a hedgehog. He has 2 E’s in his name and he is quite proud.
You can hear me on the latest episode of What If World as I help Mr. Eric tell a very wacky story based on listeners’ ‘what if’ questions. Find What If World wherever you get your podcasts.
This week there are many school’s out-themed podcast episodes available by fellow Kids Listen members. Take a look at the Kids Listen iOs mobile app or visit http://www.kidslisten.org for more information!
Make sure you are subscribed to LSFTP so you never miss an episode! Please show your support by leaving a rating/review wherever you listen to the show. (Thank you to everyone who has done so already! I really have the best listeners ever.)
Thank you so much to everyone who has sent me their beautiful artwork and letters!!! I love to hear from my listeners. Please email me (rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com) with your artwork and photos of how the podcast fits into your child’s life!
You can also find the LSFTP page on Facebook, and find me on Instagram @littlestoriestinypeople, and twitter @littletinystory. Check out my social media accounts to see animated videos, updates, and fan art.

Isn’t sleep the best? I believe it is and I’m sure you agree. Let’s convince all the tiny people of this, shall we? It seems that not all of them received the memo. This story features a little lamb who learns some habits that help him get more sleep. Obviously, this process involves a magical train ride. My tiny people already love this story and I hope yours do too.

Did you know not every elf works at the North Pole? It’s true. Some elves are self-employed and only take jobs they think are best. This story is about one such elf, Flumberton Cabbagesmith, who tries to help a boy who never seems to want any help at all. This story is really about learning to accept help when you need it, and being open to help when it is offered.

Ava Takes The Moon is another children’s story about BIG feelings and the lengths we may go to in order to assuage them. Why are so many of my stories about big feelings?

It’s a very odd habit.

Humphrey’s Tree Falls Down stars our friend Humphrey the squirrel in a rhyming story based on something that happened in my REAL LIFE! This is a story about a scary event told in a not so scary way, and it gently addresses how children (and adults) may process upsetting situations.

Every review makes the show more visible in search results and allows more families to find the podcast. I love seeing your feedback and learning how Little Stories for Tiny People fits into your children’s lives. Thank you!!!

Have your tiny people ever had BIG feelings? If they are anything like mine, they have them multiple times per day…sometimes multiple times per hour. Well today’s story is about FEELINGS and how all of us, including an endearing robot named Vincenzo, have to learn how to cope with them so we don’t go haywire! The Robot Who Had Feelings is the longest episode yet so it is perfect for a car ride or a date with a coloring book.
Today’s episode also features my first REAL PERSON guest — my very own tiny person! You won’t want to miss hearing his froggy little four-year-old voice.

Today’s story takes place in the moments right after a little girl feels a tap on her shoulder, before she’s had a chance to turn all the way around to see who or what may have been trying to get her attention.

Jamir Stands to the Side is a hopeful, rhyming story about a little boy who is just a little bit quiet. It takes him a bit longer to feel comfortable playing with other children. The story follows him as he discovers a way that he can play with other kids without feeling limited by or hiding his quiet nature. This story is perfect for children who tend toward introversion, as well as children who may need help understanding why some friends (or siblings!) don\&#39;92t feel comfortable jumping right in to social situations.
Story themes include friendship; nurturing self-worth in children; the importance of empathy; and the power of art as self-expression.
