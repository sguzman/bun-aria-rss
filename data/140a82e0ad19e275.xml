Schindler started moonlighting in 1922, which Wright hated, and eventually Schindler quit to became a huge success on his own.  He and wife Pauline hosted many events at their Kings Road house, a model of architectural brilliance that's now 100 years old.  </p> <p>LA photographer Mona Kuhn got her first camera at 12 and she studied at Ohio State and the San Francisco Art Institute. Exhibited internationally, she has published several books of photography, her most recent entitled Kings Road, featuring Rudolf Schindler's Kings Road House. Later, we found out that USModernist's own Michela O'Connor-Abrams lived there as a child - and witnessed a secret late night burglary.  </p> <p>Later, profound cello with musical guest Helen Gillet.</p>]]></description>

He’s the top presenter every year at Modernism Week.</p> <p>Returning guest, fashion designer, and CEO Trina Turk has one of the most exciting brands of brightly colorful, wildly fun clothing for both men and women. Trina is also a devoted serial Modernist, having owned many houses, and an active philanthropist, contributing to preservation causes, including the USModernist Advisory Board and the fight to Move Marilyn in Palm Springs.  Last February, she spoke at Modernism Week to discuss the influence of another important lifestyle entrepreneur and tastemaker, Vera Neumann.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Going back as far as Neutra and Schindler, it has always been hard as an architect to specialize in houses - and even harder to specialize in Modernist houses. Clients, even the most forward-thinking, collaborative, affluent clients, are time-consuming - when for the same amount of time you could design a 120,000 square foot office building for a much bigger fee. So those architects who are prolific with modernist houses and do it well are hard to find - and we love'em. Toshiko Mori, Annabelle Selldorf, Rick Joy, and past podcast guests Tom Kundig and Will Bruder are in this league, and with them, today's guest - architect and furniture designer David Thompson of Assembledge+ in Los Angeles. The son of architect Richard Thompson, David worked for Syndesis and Lorcan O'Herlihy before establishing Assembledge+ in 1997. David's houses are classic California Modernism, and if you want him to design your new house, lure him with sushi and a freshly-made Manhattan. Later on, musical guest Louise Cappi and a few minutes with TikTok design critic Louisa Whitmore.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Eero Saarinen, who died in 1961, is now one of the most well-known and respected Modernist architects in history, famous for the St. Louis Arch, the TWA Terminal at JFK, Dulles Airport, and many other innovative projects. More that about any other architect, his work signaled an optimistic future, a sweeping beautiful, curvy future that was going to require, as the song would say decades later, shades. But Saarinen wasn't always so well-known, and for about eight years before his death, there was one incredibly smart and talented woman who built and managed Saarinen's reputation into the mega-star he is today. We are joined by author Eva Hagberg, with the new book When Eero Met His Match: Aline Louchheim Saarinen and the Making of an Architect. And later, somewhat miraculously, we found Ruth Clements Pudists, Eero Saarinen's secretary, still in her 90's. With a memory better than any of us, she was there during the growth of the Saarinen practice and made arrangements with Aline when he died.</p>]]></description>

He started collecting vintage Kodachrome slides in the 1990s and has been giving talks and creating colorful coffee table books, a YouTube video series of classic car joyrides, and fun double decker bus tours during Modernism Week. 90 miles south of Florida, there’s Cuba. The US can’t quite decide whether we’re still mad at Cuba, but the architecture lives on and architect Monty Freeman knows all about it. An award-winning New York architect who has repurposed timeless, modern spaces around the world, Monty is an expert on Cuban architecture and leads architectural tours when the US allows it.

Architectural scholars offer intricate and complex design analysis for even larger and more complex social problems. Design scholars have their own rhythmic and intense way of writing as they search to provide meaningful analysis about buildings, materials, design, planning, and social impact. All this can be a little intimidating for the general public. Imagine if Sheldon Cooper from the Big Bang theory studied architecture instead of physics. Yet scholars are the R&D department for innovations that may come 5, 10, or even 50 years later.

A successful singer since his junior high school days, Ron led the group responsible for some of the most iconic sounds of the 1970s, including vocals on the Partridge Family hit “I Think I Love You,” for which Ron and his group nabbed a Grammy nomination. He also sang some of TV’s most memorable theme songs like MASH, That Girl, Batman, Happy days, Laverne and Shirley, and the famous Mickey D jingle You Deserve a Break Today. Popular music, from Big Band to Swing to Rock, had album covers and liner notes that inspired Americans yearning to be more modern. All this helped generate today’s huge consumer culture, and it’s the subject of a new book. Author Janet Borgerson is the senior Wicklander fellow at the Institute for Business and Professional Ethics at DePaul. Author Jonathan Schroeder is Professor of Communications at Rochester Institute of Technology. Together, they wrote <em>Designed for Hi-Fi Living: The Vinyl LP in Midcentury America.</em></p>]]></description>

While the public was largely inspired by his work, Rudolph fell out of favor in the US and shifted to Singapore and Hong Kong, where he was much heralded and sought after.  Like most Modernist architecture, over the years Rudolph’s houses and buildings around the world became highly prized and at the same time, endangered.  Joining us is preservationist, archivist, and President of the Paul Rudolph Institute for Modern Architecture, Kelvin Dickinson. Later on, music by the charming Tierney Sutton.   </p>]]></description>

Designed by Buckminster Fuller as the US pavilion for the 1967 World’s Fair, or what everyone else on the planet calls the World Expo, the Biosphere attracted more than 5 million visitors, and today the site is a museum dedicated to the environment. In case you are a dome geek, and we know there are some out there, the Biosphere is a Class 1 icosahedral dome, as opposed to a Class 2 dodecahedral or a Class 3 tetrahedral.  Just sayin’.  It’s a 32-frequency version where the inner and outer layers are connected by latticework standing two hundred feet high and covered by 1,900 acrylic panels.  Joining us today from Montreal is Michele Picard from Montreal's Bureau of Public Art, plus from New York, an expert on World’s Fair history, Beverly Payeff Masey. </p>]]></description>

Frank Lloyd Wright tried and it didn’t go so well.  Sears, the retail store that's hurting these days, had a pretty good run in the early 20th century. For a while, people loved ordering houses right out of the Sears catalog.  Later on after WWII, the cult favorite Lustron, well, not so much.  There have been more than a dozen firms trying to create a modular home line that people will buy in large-enough  numbers.  But the idea of getting a well-designed, energy-efficient, affordable factory-built house delivered to your lot and assembled in days or weeks?  What’s not to like?  Today we continue the prefab quest with Connect Homes’ Gordon Stott, Jared Levy, and Greg Leung. Then we visit with Steve Glenn, founder and CEO of Plant Prefab and Steve’s collaborator, Swiss designer Yves Béhar. Later on, a few minutes with Frank Harmon.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In 1950, a modest glass-walled Modernist house designed by Gregory Ain was on exhibit in the Museum of Modern Art’s garden, another in the Museum’s series of full scale builds of Modernist houses.  A system of movable walls made flexible spaces even though there were only two-bedrooms.  But once the exhibition closed, the entire house, and any knowledge of it, disappeared. Countless people over the decades searched for it. The New York Times published an article in 2017 extolling the mystery and highlighting efforts from filmmakers, academics, and the Museum to find it.  Our George Smart solved this Modernist mystery, and today we'll hear from guests Emily Ain, Cornelia Cotton, Soni and Lisa Bell, David Stevens, Shaun Kelly, and New York Times reporter Eve Kahn. Later on, musical guest Alice Peacock, for which we swoon.  </p>]]></description>

Today we talk with Ross Johnston, owner of the Largent House in San Francisco, designed by Richard Neutra, and Mike and Nina Marco, owners of the Biggs House in Delray Beach Florida, designed by Paul Rudolph.  Later on, music with Susannah Clifford Blachly.</p>]]></description>

We’re talking acres of flowing grounds open to the public, an award-winning complex of stunningly beautiful buildings by a world-class architecture firm, and a philanthropic mission that includes, among other noteworthy causes, the elimination of slave labor in the construction supply chain. One visionary person did just that in the Modernist center of New Canaan CT, notable for houses by Philip Johnson, Eliot Noyes, John Johansen, Frank Lloyd Wright, Edward Durell Stone, Gisue and Mojgan Hariri, Jim Evans, and other famous Modernists. What did our heroine get in return for this amazing project? A cranky Planning and Zoning board and crankier neighbors who apparently are into lawsuits. Joining us is Sharon Prince, CEO and Founder of Grace Farms. Later on, jazz from Canada with musical guest Lily Frost.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bertie County, North Carolina, has only about 19,000 people, about 62% Black. That's fewer than in most city zip codes. It’s one of the poorest county in the state, and the population is down about 10% over the last decade. Black farmers lost much of their land as subsidies and credit by the USDA heavily favored white farmers. In 2007, the schools were in terrible shape, as you might expect. Then, an innovative school superintendent came to town, did a great job, and got fired. One of the programs he sponsored was Project H, teaching design and construction skills to high school students. There was a documentary about this called If You Build It. Nearly 10 years later, we talk to Emily Piloton-Lam, cofounder of Project H and executive director of Girls Garage; and Ron Wesson, a Bertie County Commissioner. Later on, music with Star Search champion and Broadway star Linda Eder. This show is dedicated to that school superintendent, Chip Zullinger, who died in 2014.</p>]]></description>

Later on, jazz with Bobbie Eakes, a face you know from Days of our Lives, The Bold and the Beautiful, and even the very last episode of Laverne and Shirley – but a voice you might not. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Way before there was an internet, the way people learned about buildings outside of their city was in architecture magazines. Initially in black and white, which still has a certain allure, and later in color, magazines such as Architectural Record, Progressive Architecture, Art and Architecture, Architecture Forum, House and Home, and Architecture Plus chronicled new construction.  All of these publications, sadly, are gone – except for one.  At 130 years old and still wild and frisky, Architectural Record continues to bring readers stories of amazing buildings and architects around the world – and we do love their annual Record Houses issue.  We’ll talk today with Architectural Record publisher Alex Bachrach, host Aaron Prinz of the magazine’s podcast Design:ED, and all the way from the Netherlands, Phoebus Panigyrakis who did his PhD on Record's midcentury Modernist heyday. Later on, double trouble jazz with singer and trumpeter Bria Skonberg.  </p>]]></description>

Before our phones were full of Cardi B, Tik Tok, and $32 million inheritance offers, pending a $1200 processing fee, of course, researching Modernism meant spending time in real life deep in a major library. Fortunately, the web brings incredible research resources and tools without leaving the comfort of your cool ranch Dorito-covered couch. Those are delicious, aren't they? Today we visit with two giants of Modernism research, Bill Storrer, creator of the Storrer system for Frank Lloyd Wright projects, and one of our favorite podcast guests, the Maestro of Modernism, the jolly green giant of Googie, the Samuel L. Jackson of architecture documentaries; the Ryan Seacrest of Modernism Week hosting dozens of events, author and speaker Alan Hess. Later on, a few minutes with architect Frank Harmon, reading from his book Native Places.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Well-known Modernist architects came to fame in a time before computers, a time where getting published in magazines was the mid-century equivalent of going viral.  Even if an architect lived in a large metro such as Los Angeles, world of mouth and house tours wouldn’t get you the big commissions.  Blowing up meant having photos of your work in major publications of the era. To get those photos, you had to have a great photographer who really understood design and light and capturing the beauty of a project.  Joining us are Eric Bricker, producer of Visual Acoustics, a documentary about the life and career of celebrated architecture photographer Julius Shulman, and Keith Isaacs, one of the South’s rising stars in architectural photography.  Later on, jazz with the fabulous Stacey Kent.  </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In 1966 the first episode of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek<em> </em>launched a franchise still going strong over fifty years later.  Sequels, movies, toys, fan films - there’s just no end to Star Trek’s bright, progressive, optimistic future where Earth has transcended national and international politics. Something architecture fans may have missed, and we certainly did, is that Star Trek adapted midcentury Modern furniture for the set design, from the Bridge to the Conference Room, to the alien buildings on the planets they landed on. Today we meet authors Dan Chavkin and Brian McGuire about their new book:  Star Trek - Designing the Final Frontier - The Untold Story of How Midcentury Modern Decor Shaped Our View of the Future.  Later on, legendary singer Jennifer Warnes, who you’ve loved for I’ve Had the Time of my Life, Right Time of the Night, Up Where We Belong, and a vast treasure of songs with and by Leonard Cohen. </p>]]></description>

Gropius founded the heralded Bauhaus in Dessau, Germany, but the rise of Hitler in the 1930's drove Gropius first to London working for Maxwell Fry, and later to Cambridge MA where he taught at Harvard and MIT. His post-war houses with Marcel Breuer were a distinctive combination of unusual geometries that people still treasure as owners and as fans. His granddaughter Erika Pfammatter is a musician, music teacher, and former minister of music.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Woodward “Woodie” Garber</strong> was a Modernist architect whose name you would know if you lived in Cincinnati. Garber was called “a controversial visionary whose advocacy of an uncluttered openness in design grows more influential every year.” He was a brilliant independent Modernist who wanted things his own way, daring even to refer to <a href= "http://www.usmodernist.org/wright.htm"><strong>Frank Lloyd Wright</strong></a> as Frank Lloyd Wrong.  Architecture was not the only controversy in his life. Being married to him, or being his child, was to experience the fury of bipolar disorder coupled with a desire to control everything – and everyone – in his path. There was a lot to process, on so many levels. He died in 1994, and it took 24 years for our guest, daughter <strong>Elizabeth Garber</strong>, to write <em>Implosion: A Memoir of an Architect’s Daughter.</em>  Later on, a few minutes with Frank Harmon, author of Native Places. </p>]]></description>

Every February, they have a huge architecture and design festival called Modernism Week which actually lasts 11 days. We were there interviewing nearly all the major speakers and special guests.</p> <p>When we can't go to Modernist houses ourselves, architectural photographers bring them to us, both new and iconic, by waking up at 5am to get the right light, or taking hours to set up a shot only available a few minutes. Hired by architects, magazines, and occasionally clients, architectural photographers ultimately become historians, their body of work becoming a visual timeline to the evolution of design, materials, and photography itself.</p> <p><strong>Darren Bradley</strong> travels the world on architecture assignments and runs the wildly successful Instagram feed @modarchitecture. In 1998, he and his wife rented a mid-century modern house in Palm Springs, and he was smitten. He began researching, exploring and appreciating modernist architecture more and more. Darren's work has appeared in large-format art books, academic and professional architecture journals, and lifestyle magazines around the world. He regularly accepts international commissions from architects, builders, developers and homeowners.  </p> <p>Returning guest <strong>Andrew Pielage</strong> is an architectural and travel photographer based out of Phoenix with 20 years creating photography by capturing the heart and inspiring the imagination. Pielage has photographed some of the best architecture and most beautifully stunning landscapes on the planet and talks about his quest to shoot every Frank Lloyd Wright building in the world.</p>]]></description>

Sometime later this year, plans call for a nearly 30 foot tall statue of her in the famous blowing white dress to return to Palm Springs as a permanent home.  In her day, Marilyn was as big as any celebrity you could name.  She was involved with some of the most well-known men in the world:  baseball great <strong>Joe Dimaggio</strong>, playwright <strong>Arthur Miller</strong>, and generally accepted nowadays, <strong>John F.

Hosts <strong>George Smart</strong> and <strong>Tom Guild</strong> talk with three people who keep Marilyn’s legacy alive for the 21st century. First, it’s <strong>Sunny Thompson</strong>, who has been channeling Marilyn in her live shows and completely brings her back to life. Next, <strong>Greg Schreiner</strong>, who has one of the worlds largest collections of Marilyn’s costumes and also leads the annual memorial service in Los Angeles, and finally, <strong>Joshua Greene</strong>, son of photographer Milton Greene, who took some of Marilyn’s most memorable photos.

For years the airline TWA (later absorbed by American Airlines) used it as a glamorous gateway to the world, sending off passengers in an era people dressed up to fly and there was no such thing as airport security.  The volume of passengers increased so much that the building had to be abandoned.  After a few decades in mothballs, and dangerously close to demolition, Saarinen’s TWA terminal has been meticulously restored and expanded, with a world-class hotel adjacent and even better, a massive underground conference facility you’d never know was there.</p> <p>Host <strong>George Smart</strong> was in New York for a huge gala opening inside that underground conference center.  He talked with <strong>Richard Southwick</strong>, project partner in charge with restoration architects Beyer Blinder Belle.  But first, George sat down in Los Angeles at the iconic Beverly Hilton with Saarinen’s son, <strong>Eric Saarinen</strong>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the best 80s films is, the envelope please, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. Here's the plot: near the end of the school year, high school senior Ferris Bueller (played by <strong>Matthew Broderick</strong>) fakes being sick to stay home. His parents believe him, though his sister Jeanie (played by <strong>Jennifer Grey</strong>, the baby you don’t back into a corner) is not convinced. Ferris persuades his best friend Cameron (<strong>Alan Ruck</strong>) to help lure Ferris' girlfriend (<strong>Mia Sara</strong>) out of school and let them use his father's prized 1961 Ferrari. Spoiler:  that Ferrari tumbles out of a really cool Modernist house, much to the chagrin of Cameron and his dad. Our pal <strong>Bob Langford</strong>, who pretty much knows every line in the movie, drops by to help us examine this cultural icon with guest <strong>Meghann Salamasick</strong>, who with her husband Chris are the owners of the that now-famous Modernist house. Later in the show, with apologies to <strong>Wayne Newton</strong>, it's George and Bob and Tom serenading Meghann.</p>]]></description>

Our first guest is Sarah Lorenzen, Director of the Neutra's VDL house in Los Angeles, a place where he experimented with new Modernist building materials and techniques. </p> <p>Philip Johnson was an architect but he thrived on being a kingmaker to the growing Modernist movement.  He organized the profoundly influential exhibition on International Style at the Museum of Modern Art in 1932 which introduced important Modernist architects such as Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and Mies van der Rohe. Joining the conversation is Cole Akers of the Glass House, former home to Johnson and his partner David Whitney in New Canaan CT.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ah, Cape Cod, the arm-shaped stretch of Massachusetts where Boston goes in the summer.  The sun.  The ocean.  The traffic.  The clam chowder.  The summer theatre productions.  And best of all, except for perhaps the clam chowder, the modern architecture by <strong>Marcel Breuer, Walter Gropius</strong>, and others. There are more than 100 modernist houses representing a little-known treasure map of residential architecture.  Our guest <strong>Peter McMahon</strong> is Principal of PM Design.  Peter curated an exhibition on Cape Cod Modernist architecture for the Provincetown Art Museum.  This led to the creation of the unique and highly effective Cape Cod Modern House Trust, which documents and preserves these houses and makes them available for the public to stay in.  His own summer house in Wellfleet MA was published in House Beautiful and Outside and he is co-author with <strong>Christine Cipriani</strong> of Cape Cod Modern: Mid-Century Architecture and Community on the Outer Cape. </p>]]></description>

He is author of two books about design, and with <strong>Sydney Pollack</strong>, Guilfoyle produced <em>Sketches of Frank Gehry</em>. His latest film is <em>Frank Gehry: Building Justice</em> where architect Gehry, philanthropist <strong>George Soros</strong>, and students at SCI-ARC and Yale re-design prison architecture for the complex social, political, racial, and aesthetic issues behind incarceration. </p> <p><strong>Paul Clemence</strong> is co-producer with <strong>Aksel Stasny</strong> of the film <em>Two Pianos</em>. His book on <strong>Mies van der Rohe's</strong> Farnsworth House remains the most complete photo documentation of that iconic design, and his many photographs have appeared in Metropolis, ArchDaily, Architizer, Casa Vogue Brasil, and his own blog Archi-photo with nearly 1M followers worldwide. <em>Two Pianos</em> is about the Italian architect <strong>Renzo Piano</strong>, and the film captures the masterful use of light, carefully orchestrated relationship between inside and outside, the seamless connection to the surroundings, and an exacting craftsmanship. </p> <p><strong>Alan Hess</strong> is an architect and author who has shed light on many forgotten and neglected styles of postwar American modernist architecture. The Los Angeles Conservancy named him "The preeminent authority on Southern California Modernism."  Host George Smart named him the <strong>Samuel L. Jackson</strong> of architecture documentaries, because like the prolific Mr. Jackson in film, Alan has appeared in more documentaries for design than anyone else.  Hess is one of the stars in a <strong>Jake and Tracey Gorst</strong> documentary on architect <strong>Albert Frey</strong>, the first American to work for French superstar architect <strong>Le Corbusier</strong>, in the film Frey Part I, The Architectural Envoy.  </p>]]></description>

There’s an stirring and brilliant documentary about his life, filmed by his son, called My Architect.  Kahn taught at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania most of his career.  He didn’t do a lot of buildings, but he was famous for almost all of them plus many fascinating unbuilt projects.  One of those was the Four Freedoms memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt on Roosevelt Island in New York City.  It was on the drawing boards when Kahn died.  The project languished for decades and wasn’t finished until 2012.  The architecture firm Mitchell Giurgola in New York ultimately took Kahn’s design and faithfully executed it to much international acclaim.  Host <strong>George Smart</strong> does a West Wing walk n talk with <strong>Paul Broches</strong>, the Mitchell Giurgola partner in charge of Four Freedoms.  They met at the tram station on the East side, right near the Queensboro Bridge. After a while exploring the memorial, they met one of the show's favorite guests.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In 1948, most US universities were slow to embrace the growing Modernist movement.  Then NC State University brought in a brilliant Dean from Oklahoma who went all-in on Modernism.  Within two years, <strong>Frank Lloyd Wright</strong> and <strong>Richard Neutra</strong> were speaking at the school and students and faculty from all over the world wanted to be there.  He wasn't the greatest architect and only designed a few buildings, but he sure knew how to get NC State's School of Design on the map.  Although he died in 1990, his impact on thousands of careers and tens of thousands of buildings endures. USModernist Radio welcomes former students, old friends, and respected colleagues <strong>Abie Harris, Roger Clark, Ben Taylor, and Jerzy Główczewski</strong> to talk about the man, the myth, the legend, <strong>Henry Kamphoefner.</strong></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Gregory Ain</strong> was inspired to become an architect after visiting <strong>Rudolf Schindler's</strong> King’s Road house. He worked for <strong>Richard Neutra</strong> as well as <strong>Harwell Hamilton Harris</strong>. As a result of a proposed housing project suspected of being communist by Senator <strong>Joseph McCarthy</strong> -- because it was racially integrated -- Ain was investigated by the FBI over 30 years.  He was considered the most dangerous architect in America, and this broad and inaccurate accusation caused the loss of many commissions.  Our first guest is Ain’s daughter, <strong>Emily Ain</strong>. </p> <p>Architect <strong>Pierre Koenig</strong> apprenticed in the offices of Raphael Soriano and <strong>A.

He worked for Richard Neutra as well as Harwell Hamilton Harris. As a result of a proposed housing project suspected of being communist by Senator Joseph McCarthy -- because it was racially integrated -- Ain was investigated by the FBI over 30 years.  He was considered the most dangerous architect in America, and this broad and inaccurate accusation caused the loss of many commissions.  Our first guest is Ain’s daughter, Emily Ain. </p> <p>Architect Pierre Koenig apprenticed in the offices of Raphael Soriano and A.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>There are certain Modernist houses that just can’t be captured in a photo, a video, or even a 3D rendering. For example, Fallingwater in Pennsylvania is considered <strong>Frank Lloyd Wright’s</strong> greatest residential work.  It continues to attract millions of people, and in 1991 the AIA named Fallingwater the "best all-time work of American architecture.<strong>" </strong> <strong>Denise Miner</strong> is<strong> </strong>Public Tour Supervisor at Fallingwater.  She’s been associated with the house in some way almost all her life and has worked there as a guide for more than 30 years.   Her grandfather and two uncles were part of Fallingwater’s construction and she is the Obiwan Kenobi of Fallingwater, training their team of wonderful guides.  </p> <p>However, there ain’t no party like a west coast party, and in LA there’s a house that’s not only iconic, it’s a true Hollywood movie celebrity.  Former football player <strong>Buck Stahl</strong> created the vision for the Stahl House, also known as Case Study House 22, designed by <strong>Pierre Koenig.</strong> The two-bedroom house features a wraparound view from the mountains to the sea. It starred in countless movies and TV plus music videos for ATB and Wilson Phillips.

For example, Fallingwater in Pennsylvania is considered Frank Lloyd Wright’s greatest residential work.  It continues to attract millions of people, and in 1991 the AIA named Fallingwater the "best all-time work of American architecture."  Denise Miner is Public Tour Supervisor at Fallingwater.  She’s been associated with the house in some way almost all her life and has worked there as a guide for more than 30 years.   Her grandfather and two uncles were part of Fallingwater’s construction and she is the Obiwan Kenobi of Fallingwater, training their team of wonderful guides.  </p> <p>However, there ain’t no party like a west coast party, and in LA there’s a house that’s not only iconic, it’s a true Hollywood movie celebrity.  Former football player Buck Stahl created the vision for the Stahl House, also known as Case Study House 22, designed by Pierre Koenig. The two-bedroom house features a wraparound view from the mountains to the sea. It starred in countless movies and TV plus music videos for ATB and Wilson Phillips. In 2013 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Shari Stahl Grunwald grew up in the home and administers the property with her brother Bruce.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>After WWII, states looked at their aging capitol buildings and considered sweeping new plans to bring technology, commerce, government, and even the performing arts into the full 20th century.  One of the few state capitols to actually achieve this was Albany NY.  The Empire State Plaza is series of Modernist office and cultural buildings that started in the late 1950’s, and it’s gorgeous.  It’s a stunning achievement spearheaded by NY <strong>Governor Nelson Rockefeller</strong> and designed primarily by architect <strong>Wallace Harrison.</strong></p> <p>Albany’s master plan was so successful, other states wanted to do the same thing.  One of those was North Carolina.  In 1965, the State Capital planning Commission issues a report and a design they had been working on for several administrations.  The goal was, like Albany, to transform the epicenter of downtown Raleigh, the state capitol, into a city of the future.  The blue ribbon panel of architects, consultants, and government members presented a beautiful plan.</p> <p>One of those consultants from 1965 is a young man with a lot of potential who just turned 90.  <strong>Lewis Clarke</strong> is one of North Carolina’s most celebrated and prolific landscape architects.  Clarke came to Harvard on a Fulbright Scholarship taught at the the NCSU School of Design from 1952 to 1968. His teaching influenced generations of architects and his 1300 projects, papers, photographs, and slides are now at the NC State University Special Collections Research Center, their third largest collection.

Although he aspired for another career, Eric eventually returned to his roots in architecture.

After a long period of service, abandonment, and use as temporary offices as newer buildings were built, it is scheduled for deconstruction/demolition.  It was a really brilliant design idea that just didn't function. </p>]]></description>
