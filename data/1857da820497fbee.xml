    <description>Huberman Lab discusses neuroscience: how our brain and its connections with the organs of our body control our perceptions, our behaviors, and our health. We also discuss existing and emerging tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works. Dr. Andrew Huberman is a tenured Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. His laboratory studies neural regeneration, neuroplasticity, and brain states such as stress, focus, fear, and optimal performance. For more than 20 years, Dr. Huberman has consistently published original research findings and review articles in top-level peer-reviewed journals, including Nature, Science, Cell, Neuron, and Current Biology. He is a regular member of several National Institutes of Health review panels and a Fellow of the McKnight Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts. Dr. Huberman regularly consults for technology development companies, professional athletic organizations, and various units of U.S. and Canadian Special Operations.</description>

      <title>AMA #1: Leveraging Ultradian Cycles, How to Protect Your Brain, Seed Oils Examined and More</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.supercast.com/</link>
      <description>Welcome to a sneak peek of the first Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

      <title>How Meditation Works &amp; Science-Based Effective Meditations | Episode 96</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-meditation-works-and-science-based-effective-meditations/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the biological mechanisms of the state changes that occur during different types of meditation and describe how to develop the meditation practice optimal for you. I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level. I also explain the concept behind the “third-eye center,” what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability. Whether you are a novice or an experienced meditator or simply interested in how our brain controls different aspects of conscious awareness and self-regulation, this episode should interest you.

      <title>Dr. Eddie Chang: The Science of Learning &amp; Speaking Languages | Episode 95</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-eddie-chang-the-science-of-learning-and-speaking-languages/</link>
      <description>My guest is Eddie Chang, MD, a neurosurgeon and professor of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the co-director of the Center for Neural Engineering &amp; Prostheses. We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying speech, language learning and comprehension, communicating human emotion with words and hand gestures, bilingualism and language disorders, such as stuttering. Dr. Chang also explains his work developing and applying state-of-the-art technology to decode speech and using that information and artificial intelligence (AI) to successfully restore communication to patients who have suffered paralyzing injuries or “locked in syndrome.” We also discuss his work treating patients with epilepsy. Finally, we consider the future: how modern neuroscience is overturning textbook medical books, the impact of digital technology such as smartphones on language and the future of natural and computer-assisted human communication.

      <itunes:summary>My guest is Eddie Chang, MD, a neurosurgeon and professor of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the co-director of the Center for Neural Engineering &amp; Prostheses. We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying speech, language learning and comprehension, communicating human emotion with words and hand gestures, bilingualism and language disorders, such as stuttering. Dr. Chang also explains his work developing and applying state-of-the-art technology to decode speech and using that information and artificial intelligence (AI) to successfully restore communication to patients who have suffered paralyzing injuries or “locked in syndrome.” We also discuss his work treating patients with epilepsy. Finally, we consider the future: how modern neuroscience is overturning textbook medical books, the impact of digital technology such as smartphones on language and the future of natural and computer-assisted human communication.

      <title>Fitness Toolkit: Protocol &amp; Tools to Optimize Physical Health | Episode 94</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/fitness-toolkit-protocol-and-tools-to-optimize-physical-health/</link>
      <description>I describe a fitness protocol that maximizes all the major sought-after aspects of physical fitness, including strength, endurance and flexibility. I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state. Physical fitness is a key variable for immediate and long-term health. This episode provides a modifiable “foundational” template that can be adjusted based on your current fitness level, goals, time constraints, and access to different types of equipment.

      <title>Dr. Nolan Williams: Psychedelics &amp; Neurostimulation for Brain Rewiring | Episode 93</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-nolan-williams-psychedelics-and-neurostimulation-for-brain-rewiring</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Nolan Williams, M.D., a triple board-certified psychiatrist, neurologist and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He is also the Director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications for brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first discuss the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We discuss Dr. Williams’ work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to depression, trauma, PTSD, and other mood disorders. We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise, and training to control the brain-heart-rate pathways. Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams’ knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.

We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise, and training to control the brain-heart-rate pathways. Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams’ knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.

      <title>The Effects of Cannabis (Marijuana) on the Brain &amp; Body | Episode 92</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-effects-of-cannabis-marijuana-on-the-brain-and-body/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss cannabis (aka marijuana), including the biological mechanisms underlying its effects on the mind and body, its known medical applications, its impact on libido, creativity, hunger, hormones and more. I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one’s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents.

      <title>Dr. Casey Halpern: Biology &amp; Treatments for Compulsive Behaviors &amp; Binge Eating | Episode 91</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-casey-halpern-biology-and-treatments-for-compulsive-eating-and-behaviors/</link>
      <description>My guest is Casey Halpern, M.D., Chief of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery and Professor of Neurosurgery at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Halpern’s research and clinical practice focus on using deep brain stimulation to treat compulsive and movement disorders (e.g., binge eating disorders, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Parkinson’s disease essential tremor, dystonia). We discuss using deep brain stimulation to help patients who suffer from movement and compulsive disorders and applying this treatment to patients afflicted with binge eating. We also explore applications of this technology to other conditions such as OCD, anorexia and tremor, and the future therapeutic directions of the use of non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound, for the treatment of other psychiatric illnesses and conditions. This episode will interest those curious about the biology of eating, anorexia, bulimia, compulsive thoughts and behaviors, and movement.

        <![CDATA[<p>My guest is Casey Halpern, M.D., Chief of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery and Professor of Neurosurgery at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Halpern’s research and clinical practice focus on using deep brain stimulation to treat compulsive and movement disorders (e.g., binge eating disorders, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Parkinson’s disease essential tremor, dystonia). We discuss using deep brain stimulation to help patients who suffer from movement and compulsive disorders and applying this treatment to patients afflicted with binge eating. We also explore applications of this technology to other conditions such as OCD, anorexia and tremor, and the future therapeutic directions of the use of non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound, for the treatment of other psychiatric illnesses and conditions. This episode will interest those curious about the biology of eating, anorexia, bulimia, compulsive thoughts and behaviors, and movement.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>ROKA: <a href="https://www.roka.com/huberman">https://www.roka.com/huberman</a></p><p>Eight Sleep: <a href="https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman">https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-casey-halpern-biology-and-treatments-for-compulsive-eating-and-behaviors/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Casey Halpern &amp; Disordered Eating &amp; Brain Stimulation</p><p>(00:03:18) ROKA, Eight Sleep, InsideTracker</p><p>(00:07:19) Momentous Supplements</p><p>(00:08:28) Neurosurgeon’s View of the Brain, Neurosurgery Specialization</p><p>(00:13:05) Deep Brain Stimulation &amp; Other Unexpected Positive Effects</p><p>(00:17:20) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Prescriptions &amp; Cognitive Therapies</p><p>(00:25:40) Brain Areas in OCD, Risk, Rewards &amp; Addiction</p><p>(00:31:11) AG1 (Athletic Greens)</p><p>(00:32:27) Facial and Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress &amp; Superstition</p><p>(00:39:28) Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders &amp; Obesity</p><p>(00:47:18) Stimulation of Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation</p><p>(00:49:49) Binge Eating Disorder &amp; Loss of Control Eating</p><p>(00:53:02) Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress</p><p>(01:02:07) Electrodes in Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”</p><p>(01:11:41) Effects of Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation</p><p>(01:16:46) Anorexia, Obesity &amp; Compulsions, Potential Treatments for Anorexia</p><p>(01:23:14) Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</p><p>(01:32:27) MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor &amp; Parkinson’s</p><p>(01:36:40) Future of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy &amp; Depression</p><p>(01:41:51) Pre-Behavioral States in Compulsion &amp; Awareness, Mood Provocation</p><p>(01:48:02) Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence &amp; Compulsion Predictions</p><p>(01:53:05) Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training &amp; Deadlifts</p><p>(01:59:00) “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time &amp; Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training</p><p>(02:09:53) Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation</p><p>(02:11:59) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn</p><p> Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Nicotine’s Effects on the Brain &amp; Body &amp; How to Quit Smoking or Vaping | Episode 90</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/nicotines-effects-on-the-brain-and-body-and-how-to-quit-smoking-or-vaping/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain how nicotine impacts the brain and body, including its potent ability to enhance attention, focus, and alertness, increase blood pressure and metabolism and reduce appetite. I discuss nicotine’s ability to increase the action of neurochemicals, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine and activate sympathetic (alertness-promoting) neural circuits. I also discuss common nicotine delivery methods, such as cigarettes, vaping, dip, and snuff, and how they each create their own unique experience and how they, but not nicotine itself, cause cancer and other adverse health effects. I also explain science-based tools to permanently quit smoking cigarettes or vaping, including peer-reviewed clinical hypnosis tools, antidepressants, and alternative nicotine replacement (patches, lozenges, gums etc.). As nicotine is one of the most widely used substances with billions of users — most of whom report wanting to quit — this episode ought to be of interest to former/current nicotine users, those who want to quit smoking or vaping and/or those interested in learning the biology behind how nicotine impacts the brain and body.

      <title>Dr. David Anderson: The Biology of Aggression, Mating, &amp; Arousal | Episode 89</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-anderson-the-biology-of-aggression-mating-and-arousal/</link>
      <description>My guest is David Anderson, PhD, a world expert in the science of sexual behavior, violent aggression, fear and other motivated states. Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind (and body) arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience, and hormones, and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior. We also discuss peptides and their role in social isolation-induced anxiety and aggression. Dr. Anderson also describes novel, potentially powerful therapeutics for mental health. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about mental health, human emotions, sexual and/or violent behavior.

This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about mental health, human emotions, sexual and/or violent behavior.  </p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>Levels: <a href="https://levels.link/huberman">https://levels.link/huberman</a></p><p>Helix Sleep: <a href="https://helixsleep.com/huberman/">https://helixsleep.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://drinklmnt.com/huberman">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-anderson-the-biology-of-aggression-mating-and-arousal/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. David Anderson, Emotions &amp; Aggression </p><p>(00:03:33) Momentous Supplements </p><p>(00:04:27) Levels, Helix Sleep, LMNT </p><p>(00:08:10) Emotions vs. States</p><p>(00:10:36) Dimensions of States: Persistence, Intensity &amp; Generalization</p><p>(00:14:38) Arousal &amp; Valence </p><p>(00:18:11) Aggression, Optogenetics &amp; Stimulating Aggression in Mice, VMH</p><p>(00:24:42) Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive &amp; Predatory </p><p>(00:29:20) Evolution &amp; Development of Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear</p><p>(00:35:38) Hydraulic Pressures for States &amp; Homeostasis</p><p>(00:38:33) AG1 (Athletic Greens)</p><p>(00:39:46) Hydraulic Pressure &amp; Aggression</p><p>(00:44:50) Balancing Fear &amp; Aggression</p><p>(00:48:31) Aggression &amp; Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone &amp; Testosterone</p><p>(00:52:33) Female Aggression, Motherhood</p><p>(00:59:48) Mating &amp; Aggressive Behaviors </p><p>(01:05:10) Neurobiology of Sexual Fetishes </p><p>(01:10:06) Temperature, Mating Behavior &amp; Aggression</p><p>(01:15:25) Mounting: Sexual Behavior or Dominance?</p><p>(01:20:59) Females &amp; Male-Type Mounting Behavior</p><p>(01:24:40) PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation &amp; Fear </p><p>(01:30:38) Tachykinins &amp; Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear &amp; Aggression </p><p>(01:43:49) Brain, Body &amp; Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis &amp; Vagus Nerve </p><p>(01:52:52) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Focus Toolkit: Tools to Improve Your Focus &amp; Concentration | Episode 88</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/focus-toolkit-tools-to-improve-your-focus-and-concentration/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I provide a list of behavioral, nutritional, and supplement-based tools you can use to improve your ability to get into a focused state to do mental or physical work. I explain science-supported strategies for transitioning into focus, maintaining focus during the work bout, and exiting the focus session, which is also critical, including decompression/defocusing tools. I explain when and how to use: binaural beats, caffeine, deliberate cold exposure, the pros and cons of working in fasted vs. fed states, and supplements and foods that enhance dopamine, epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) and acetylcholine to promote optimal focus. Also, I explain how short behavioral practices, such as meditation and visual gaze training, will benefit your ability to focus over the long term. As deep focus is crucial to significantly improve cognitive or physical performance in any realm, this episode should be useful to anyone. By the end, you’ll have an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost focus and concentration strategies to select from that can be tailored to your physical and mental performance needs.

      <title>Dr. Erich Jarvis: The Neuroscience of Speech, Language &amp; Music | Episode 87</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-erich-jarvis-the-neuroscience-of-speech-language-and-music/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Dr. Erich Jarvis, PhD—Professor and the Head of the Laboratory of Neurogenetics of Language at Rockefeller University and Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). Dr. Jarvis’ research spans the molecular and genetic mechanisms of vocal communication, comparative genomics of speech and language across species and the relationship between speech, language and movement. We discuss the unique ability of humans (and certain animal species) to learn and communicate using complex language, including verbal speech production and the ability to interpret both written and spoken language. We also discuss the connections between language, singing and dance and why song may have evolved before language. Dr. Jarvis also explains some of the underlying biological and genetic components of stutter/speech disorders, non-verbal communication, why it's easiest to learn a language as a child and how individuals can learn multiple languages at any age. This episode ought to be of interest to everyone interested in the origins of human speech, language, music and culture and how newer technology, such as social media and texting, change our brains.

      <title>What Alcohol Does to Your Body, Brain &amp; Health | Episode 86</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-brain-health/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the physiological effects that drinking alcohol has on the brain and body at different levels of consumption and over time. I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior – hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways. The goal of this episode is to help people make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption that are in keeping with their mental and physical health goals.

      <title>Dr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality &amp; Longevity | Episode 85</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-peter-attia-exercise-nutrition-hormones-for-vitality-and-longevity/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., who trained at Stanford University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Dr. Attia is host of The Drive podcast and is a world expert on behavioral approaches, nutritional interventions, supplementation and pharmacological techniques to improve lifespan, healthspan and athletic performance. We discuss how best to evaluate your health status using routine blood work, body scans and regular tests of physical strength and endurance. Dr. Attia explains what he uses with his patients to “back-cast” their health goals as a way to design their exercise and nutritional programs. We also discuss hormone modulation and replacement therapy for both men and women. We explain how cholesterol and related factors contribute to cardiovascular disease risk and how to monitor and mitigate that risk. Dr. Attia details various supplementation, nutrition, exercise and prescription approaches useful to people in every decade of life to improve vitality, reduce their risk of disease and increase the number of years sustaining peak cognitive and physical health.

      <title>Sleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep &amp; Sleep-Wake Timing | Episode 84</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/sleep-toolkit-tools-for-optimizing-sleep-and-sleep-wake-timing</link>
      <description>In this episode, I describe a comprehensive toolkit consisting of behavioral and supplement-based tools that you can customize to enhance the quality, duration and impact of your sleep. This has an enormous positive impact on your overall health and daytime functioning, brain, hormones and immune system. I teach you how to effectively harness light (and darkness), temperature, food, exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital devices in order to fall asleep faster, stay deeply asleep longer and overall, and achieve better quality sleep. I also describe how these tools can be modified to recover quickly from a poor night’s sleep, jet lag or bouts of shift work. Given that sleep is the foundation of all mental health, physical health and performance, this episode should benefit everyone as it provides an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost strategies that can be tailored to optimize your sleep routine.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I describe a comprehensive toolkit consisting of behavioral and supplement-based tools that you can customize to enhance the quality, duration and impact of your sleep. This has an enormous positive impact on your overall health and daytime functioning, brain, hormones and immune system. I teach you how to effectively harness light (and darkness), temperature, food, exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital devices in order to fall asleep faster, stay deeply asleep longer and overall, and achieve better quality sleep. I also describe how these tools can be modified to recover quickly from a poor night’s sleep, jet lag or bouts of shift work. Given that sleep is the foundation of all mental health, physical health and performance, this episode should benefit everyone as it provides an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost strategies that can be tailored to optimize your sleep routine.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Eight Sleep: <a href="https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman">https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://drinklmnt.com/huberman">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/sleep-toolkit-tools-for-optimizing-sleep-and-sleep-wake-timing">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Tools to Optimize Sleep</p><p>(00:03:02) Momentous Supplements</p><p>(00:04:16) InsideTracker, Eight Sleep, LMNT</p><p>(00:08:24) Factors to Control Circadian Rhythm &amp; Sleep</p><p>(00:15:10) Morning Tool: Morning Sunlight Viewing, Cortisol</p><p>(00:20:44) Morning Sunlight: Circadian Rhythm, Artificial Lights, Cloudy Days</p><p>(00:26:18) Evaluating Light in Environment, Compensating for Missed Morning Light</p><p>(00:29:26) AG1 (Athletic Greens)</p><p>(00:30:46) Morning Tools: Temperature &amp; Deliberate Cold Exposure, Exercise</p><p>(00:34:58) Timing Caffeine, “Afternoon Crash,” Exercise</p><p>(00:40:08) Timing Eating, Alertness &amp; Circadian Rhythm</p><p>(00:45:20) 3 Daily Critical Periods</p><p>(00:46:49) Afternoons: Naps, Deep Relaxation (NSDR, Self-Hypnosis), Exercise &amp; Body Temperature, Caffeine</p><p>(00:51:59) Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight in Late Afternoon, Evening Light</p><p>(00:56:45) Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity</p><p>(01:04:40) Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature &amp; Sleeping Environment</p><p>(01:09:40) Alcohol, THC &amp; Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety &amp; Falling Asleep</p><p>(01:11:45) Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin &amp; Theanine</p><p>(01:16:34) Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)</p><p>(01:17:44) Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol &amp; Anxiety</p><p>(01:20:08) Falling Back Asleep: Reveri App, NSDR, Yoga Nidra</p><p>(01:22:55) Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet</p><p>(01:24:58) Tool: Sleep Apnea &amp; Nasal Breathing</p><p>(01:28:20) Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep &amp; Caffeine</p><p>(01:31:14) Tools: Temperature Minimum &amp; Jet Lag, Shift Work &amp; Red Lights</p><p>(01:37:38) Behavioral Tools for 3 Daily Critical Periods</p><p>(01:39:26) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Huberman Lab Clips, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Emily Balcetis: Tools for Setting &amp; Achieving Goals | Episode 83</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-emily-balcetis-tools-for-setting-and-achieving-goals/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Dr. Emily Balcetis, PhD, Professor of Psychology at New York University (NYU). Dr. Balcetis’ research focuses on how our perception of the world, particularly our visual perceptions, influences our level and persistence of motivation, how we conceptualize goals, actual goal achievement, and our emotional state as we pursue goals. Dr. Balcetis explains how to best visualize and overcome challenges in pursuit of larger, complex goals. We also discuss the science of how to define goals and intermediate milestones, overcome obstacles, and effectively track progress. This episode highlights science-based, immediately actionable tools that anyone can use to set and achieve physical and/or cognitive goals more effectively.

      <title>The Science &amp; Treatment of Bipolar Disorder | Episode 82</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the biology, symptoms, causes and types of bipolar disorder (sometimes called bipolar depression). I discuss neuroplasticity and how the brain normally regulates mood, energy, and perceptions; then, I contrast that with the biology of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by extremes of energy and mood, e.g., mania and depression. I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity.’ I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation. This episode should interest anyone who has or knows someone with bipolar disorder and, more broadly, those interested in how the brain works to create a balance between thoughts, energy levels, focus, and mood.

      <description>My guest this episode is Dr. Charles Zuker, PhD, Professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biophysics and Neuroscience at Columbia University and an Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. Zuker is the world’s leading expert in the biology of taste, thirst and craving. His laboratory explores the mechanisms of taste perception, focusing on how our conscious and unconscious processing of specific foods and nutrients guide our actions and behaviors. We discuss the neural circuits of taste, the “gut-brain axis,” the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, to our emotions, and expectation. We also consider how sugar containing and highly-processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems. Dr. Zuker provides a true masterclass in the biology of taste and perception that ought to be of interest to anyone curious about how the brain works, our motivated behaviors and the neural, chemical perceptual aspects of the mind.

      <title>Optimize &amp; Control Your Brain Chemistry to Improve Health &amp; Performance | Episode 80</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/optimize-and-control-your-brain-chemistry-to-improve-health-and-performance/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the biological roles of the four major neuromodulators—dopamine, epinephrine (aka adrenaline), serotonin, and acetylcholine—and describe how these neuromodulators impact a wide variety of mental states and behaviors, including focus, creativity, motivation, drive, learning, alertness, mood, relationships, and feelings of well-being. Then, with that foundational understanding in mind, I describe a potent toolkit of science-supported behavioral, nutrition, and supplementation tools that can be used to increase baseline levels of individual neuromodulators and that can be modified for specific goals. This episode summarizes low-or-no-cost, actionable, science-based tools that can benefit anyone in order to enhance their levels of brain chemicals and improve mental health, physical health, and performance.

      <title>The Science &amp; Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) | Episode 78</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the biology and psychology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—a prevalent and debilitating condition. I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatments—both behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive “thought-action loops” and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments. I describe an often effective approach for treating OCD where clinicians use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to deliberately bring patients into states of high anxiety while encouraging them to suppress compulsive actions in order to help them learn to overcome repetitious thought/action cycles. This episode should interest anyone with OCD, anyone who knows someone with OCD or OCPD, and more generally, those interested in how the brain works to control thoughts and actions, whether those thoughts are intrusive or not.

      <title>Ido Portal: The Science &amp; Practice of Movement | Episode 77</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/ido-portal-the-science-and-practice-of-movement/</link>
      <description>My guest is Ido Portal, the world’s foremost expert on human movement. Ido has spent a lifetime studying, combining and evolving elements from an enormous range of martial arts, dance genres, athletic endeavors, and science, to develop a unified theory and practice of movement called “The Ido Portal Method.” Here we discuss all things movement, including the role of the nervous system, reflexive versus deliberate movement patterns, and the link between emotions and awareness in movement. We also discuss learning and neuroplasticity, the mind-body connection and how movement itself can be leveraged toward expanding other types of skills- cognitive, creative and otherwise. As one of the most sought out teachers of movement alive today, the knowledge Ido shares in this conversation can benefit everyone—children, adults, athletes, dancers, clinicians and trainers and the everyday person.

        <![CDATA[<p>My guest is Ido Portal, the world’s foremost expert on human movement. Ido has spent a lifetime studying, combining and evolving elements from an enormous range of martial arts, dance genres, athletic endeavors, and science, to develop a unified theory and practice of movement called “The Ido Portal Method.” Here we discuss all things movement, including the role of the nervous system, reflexive versus deliberate movement patterns, and the link between emotions and awareness in movement. We also discuss learning and neuroplasticity, the mind-body connection and how movement itself can be leveraged toward expanding other types of skills- cognitive, creative and otherwise. As one of the most sought out teachers of movement alive today, the knowledge Ido shares in this conversation can benefit everyone—children, adults, athletes, dancers, clinicians and trainers and the everyday person.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a>.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/ido-portal-the-science-and-practice-of-movement/">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Ido Portal, Movement &amp; Movement Practice</p><p>(00:03:30) AG1 (Athletic Greens), InsideTracker, Thesis</p><p>(00:07:49) What is Movement?</p><p>(00:10:56) Movement &amp; the Body-Mind Connection</p><p>(00:14:47) Entry Points to Movement</p><p>(00:18:08) Early Education in Movement: Awareness, Play &amp; Examination</p><p>(00:21:19) Stillness, Movement &amp; the Environment, Playfulness</p><p>(00:31:34) Unique Postures, Types of Movement, Contents vs. Containers</p><p>(00:40:50) Discomfort: Marker of Movement, Failures &amp; Learning</p><p>(00:47:05) Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution</p><p>(00:56:36) Animal &amp; Human Movements, Gain &amp; Change</p><p>(01:02:04) Core Movement, Emotion &amp; Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution</p><p>(01:12:39) Song, Dance &amp; Complex Language, Movement as Language, Consilience</p><p>(01:21:39) Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild &amp; Wise</p><p>(01:26:36) Potential for Movement, “Humming”</p><p>(01:32:18) Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees of Freedom</p><p>(01:35:50) Variety, Diversity &amp; Virtuosity</p><p>(01:38:06) Vision &amp; Movement, Focus &amp; Awareness, Panoramic Awareness</p><p>(01:48:28) Hearing &amp; Movement</p><p>(01:52:43) Walking Gaits</p><p>(01:56:55) Playful Variability &amp; Evolution, Improvisation &amp; Openness</p><p>(02:03:05) Reactivity &amp; Personal Space, Touch &amp; Proximity to Others, Play &amp; Discomfort</p><p>(02:18:13) Visualization &amp; Experience, Feedback</p><p>(02:20:14) Linear Movement &amp; Movement Investigation, Examination</p><p>(02:31:45) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Episode 76</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/improve-flexibility-with-research-supported-stretching-protocols</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the science behind limb range of motion and flexibility and how to increase them by using science-supported protocols. Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. I also provide science-based stretching and “micro-stretching” protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment. I review all the details of those stretching protocols: how often to do them, for how long, their timing relative to other exercises, sets, the time between sets, measuring progress and more. All people, physically active or not, should benefit from the information and tools described in this episode.

      <title>Dr. Paul Conti: Therapy, Treating Trauma &amp; Other Life Challenges | Episode 75</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-paul-conti-therapy-treating-trauma-and-other-life-challenges/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist and expert in treating trauma, personality disorders and psychiatric illnesses and challenges of various kinds. Dr. Conti earned his MD at Stanford and did his residency at Harvard Medical School. He now runs the Pacific Premiere Group—a clinical practice helping people heal and grow from trauma and other life challenges. We discuss trauma: what it is and its far-reaching effects on the mind and body, as well as the best treatment approaches for trauma. We also explore how to choose a therapist and how to get the most out of therapy, as well as how to do self-directed therapy. We discuss the positive and negative effects of antidepressants, ADHD medications, alcohol, cannabis, and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin and LSD), ketamine and MDMA. This episode is must listen for anyone seeking or already doing therapy, processing trauma, and/or considering psychoactive medication. Both patients and practitioners ought to benefit from the information.

      <title>The Science &amp; Process of Healing from Grief | Episode 74</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-process-of-healing-from-grief/</link>
      <description>This episode, I discuss grief and the challenges of processing losses of different kinds. I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives.
We recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States. While we hope the information in this episode will be of use to anyone suffering from grief of any kind and at any time, we are also careful to acknowledge that many people require additional support and resources. For that reason, we include mention of such resources and we generally hope people will access them if needed.

      <title>Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Boost Attention &amp; Memory with Science-Based Tools | Episode 73</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-wendy-suzuki-boost-attention-and-memory-with-science-based-tools/</link>
      <description>My guest is Dr. Wendy Suzuki, Ph.D., Professor of Neural Science and Psychology and (soon) Dean of New York University, whose research focuses on memory, attention, brain plasticity and simple, daily habits that can be leveraged to improve learning, focus, memory and cognitive ability. We discuss the role of cardiovascular exercise, weight training, deliberate cold exposure, meditation, verbal affirmations, sleep, and other behavioral practices for enhancing learning, mood and stress management, and increasing attention span. Dr. Suzuki shares the mechanisms by which these practices change our brain in order to improve cognitive function fast and reduce age-related cognitive decline.

      <title>Understand &amp; Improve Memory Using Science-Based Tools | Episode 72</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/understand-and-improve-memory-using-science-based-tools/</link>
      <description>This episode I explain the mechanisms by which different types of memories are established in our brain and how to leverage the amount and timing of key neurochemicals and hormones, such as adrenaline (aka epinephrine) and cortisol, to improve your learning and memory abilities. I describe multiple science-based protocols to do this, including repetition, caffeine, emotional states, deliberate cold exposure, sleep, meditation, and the role of vision, including taking “mental snapshots.” I also describe how exercise and an associated hormone, osteocalcin, can improve cognitive ability and memory formation. I also describe unique aspects and forms of memory such as photographic memory, extreme facial recognition (aka super recognition), and the phenomenon known as déjà vu.

        <![CDATA[<p>This episode I explain the mechanisms by which different types of memories are established in our brain and how to leverage the amount and timing of key neurochemicals and hormones, such as adrenaline (aka epinephrine) and cortisol, to improve your learning and memory abilities. I describe multiple science-based protocols to do this, including repetition, caffeine, emotional states, deliberate cold exposure, sleep, meditation, and the role of vision, including taking “mental snapshots.” I also describe how exercise and an associated hormone, osteocalcin, can improve cognitive ability and memory formation. I also describe unique aspects and forms of memory such as photographic memory, extreme facial recognition (aka super recognition), and the phenomenon known as déjà vu.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/understand-and-improve-memory-using-science-based-tools/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Memory, Improving Memory  </p><p>(00:02:45) Sponsors</p><p>(00:07:54) Sensory Stimuli, Nervous System &amp; Encoding Memory </p><p>(00:11:12) Context &amp; Memory Formation </p><p>(00:13:46) Tool: Repetition, Improving Learning &amp; Memory </p><p>(00:17:11) Co-Activation and intensity Neuron Activation  </p><p>(00:20:50) Different Types of Memory</p><p>(00:25:40) Memory Formation in the Brain, Hippocampus </p><p>(00:28:00) Hippocampus, Role in Memory &amp; Learning, Explicit vs. Implicit Memory</p><p>(00:31:49) Emotion &amp; Memory Enhancement </p><p>(00:36:44) Tool: Emotion Saliency &amp; Improved Memory</p><p>(00:41:42) Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline </p><p>(00:47:14) Adrenaline &amp; Cortisol  </p><p>(00:49:35) Accelerating the Repetition Curve &amp; Adrenaline </p><p>(00:53:03) Tool: Enhancing Learning &amp; Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC &amp; Stimulant Timing</p><p>(01:00:50) Tool: Enhancing Learning &amp; Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)</p><p>(01:04:48) Tool: Enhancing Learning &amp; Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline</p><p>(01:08:42) Timing of Adrenaline Release &amp; Memory Formation </p><p>(01:12:36) Chronically High Adrenaline &amp; Cortisol, Impact on Learning &amp; Memory </p><p>(01:15:12) Adrenaline Linked with Learning: Not a New Principle </p><p>(01:17:25) Amygdala, Adrenaline &amp; Memory Formation, Generalization of Memories</p><p>(01:22:20) Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise &amp; Neurogenesis </p><p>(01:27:00) Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin &amp; Improved Hippocampal Function</p><p>(01:29:59) Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin &amp; Cognitive Ability </p><p>(01:34:41) Tool: Timing of Exercise, Learning &amp; Memory Enhancement</p><p>(01:37:29) Photographic Memory</p><p>(01:38:49) “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition   </p><p>(01:41:46) Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs &amp; Memory Enhancement</p><p>(01:49:12) Déjà Vu</p><p>(01:53:24) Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing of Meditation</p><p>(02:02:21) How to Enhance Memory </p><p>(02:05:51) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Understanding &amp; Controlling Aggression | Episode 71</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/understanding-and-controlling-aggression/</link>
      <description>This episode I describe the neural mechanisms that activate and control aggressive states and behaviors and the role of hormones—estrogen and testosterone—in mediating violent and and/or competive aggression. I also describe tools that can be used to modulate the factors that have been shown to ‘prime’ an individual for aggression, including sunlight, estrogen sensitivity, competition within social settings, and overall stress levels, and the hormone cortisol. I discuss how substances such as caffeine and alcohol can impact impulsive behaviors, and how nutrition and supplementation can be used to regulate mood and aggression.

      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-rhonda-patrick-micronutrients-for-health-and-longevity/</link>
      <description>My guest is Rhonda Patrick, Ph.D. She earned her doctoral degree in biomedical science from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and has become one of the leading public health educators on the brain and general health, aging, cancer, and nutrition. We discuss the four major categories of micronutrients that regulate cellular and organ stress and antioxidants, inflammation, hormone regulation, immune system, and longevity. Dr. Patrick provides actionable protocols for obtaining key micronutrients from food and/or supplement-based sources. Additionally, Dr. Patrick outlines protocols for deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure to benefit metabolism, cardiorespiratory fitness, mental health, and lifespan.

      <title>The Science &amp; Health Benefits of Deliberate Heat Exposure | Episode 69</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-health-benefits-of-deliberate-heat-exposure/</link>
      <description>I describe the mechanisms by which deliberate heat exposure impacts body temperature, metabolism, heart health, hormone production, exercise recovery, cognition, mood, and longevity. I detail specific protocols for deliberate heat exposure, including exposure times, temperature ranges to consider, time of day, and delivery mechanisms (sauna vs. hot bath vs. open air heat, etc.) in order to achieve different specific outcomes, including dramatic growth hormone releases, or reduction in cortisol levels. I also discuss the ability of locally applied heat to heal or otherwise improve various bodily tissues and new data on how local application of heat may induce the conversion of metabolically sluggish white fat to metabolically robust beige fat.

      <title>Using Light (Sunlight, Blue Light &amp; Red Light) to Optimize Health | Episode 68</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-light-sunlight-blue-light-and-red-light-to-optimize-health</link>
      <description>I describe the mechanisms by which different wavelengths of light impact the cells, tissues and organs of the human body, and how specifically timed light exposure of specific wavelengths can be used to improve sleep, enhance alertness, modulate hormone levels, and improve mood. I also explain the use of ultraviolet and infrared phototherapies to relieve pain increase testosterone and estrogen levels; improve skin health, appearance and wound healing; and how red light can be used to offset age-related vision loss and provide neuroprotection. Throughout the episode, I describe the mechanisms of light-based therapies and actionable tools that people can use positively impact mental and physical health.

      <title>Dr. Kyle Gillett: How to Optimize Your Hormones for Health &amp; Vitality | Episode 67</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-optimize-your-hormones-for-health-and-vitality</link>
      <description>My guest is Dr. Kyle Gillett, MD, a dual board-certified physician in family medicine and obesity medicine and an expert in optimizing hormone levels to improve overall health and well-being in both men and women. We discuss how to improve hormones using behavioral, nutritional, and exercise-based tools and safely and rationally approach supplementation and hormone therapies. We discuss testosterone and estrogen and how those hormones relate to fertility, mood, aging, relationships, disease pathologies, thyroid hormone, growth hormone, prolactin, dopamine and peptides that impact physical and mental health and vitality across the lifespan. The episode is rich with scientific mechanisms and tools for people to consider.

      <title>Using Deliberate Cold Exposure for Health and Performance | Episode 66</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-deliberate-cold-exposure-for-health-and-performance/</link>
      <description>I describe mechanisms by which deliberate cold exposure can enhance mental health, physical health, and performance. I detail specific protocols to safely engage in deliberate cold exposure, including minimal exposure times, time-of-day effects, determining optimal temperatures, recovery, mindset, and movement during cold exposure. I discuss how cold exposure can be used to safely stress the body to improve attention, mood, and cognitive focus and boost metabolism and reduce inflammation. Also, I explain how cold exposure on specific regions of the body (called glabrous skin surfaces) can be leveraged to enhance endurance and weight training and increase work output.

      <title>Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Build Strength, Muscle Size &amp; Endurance | Episode 65</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-build-strength-muscle-size-and-endurance</link>
      <description>My guest is Dr. Andy Galpin, Professor of Kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton, and one of the foremost experts in the world on the science and application of methods to increase strength, hypertrophy and endurance performance. We discuss fundamental principles of strength and hypertrophy training and building endurance, the mechanisms underlying them and we review specific protocols to optimize training and recovery. We also discuss hydration, sleep, nutrition, supplements, and mental tools that can be leveraged to accelerate adaptations leading to enhanced strength, muscle growth and/or endurance.

      <title>Controlling Sugar Cravings &amp; Metabolism with Science-Based Tools | Episode 64</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/controlling-sugar-cravings-and-metabolism-with-science-based-tools</link>
      <description>I explain how to blunt sugar cravings through fundamental knowledge of how sugar is sensed, metabolized, and utilized within the body. I explain how sugar is processed through the digestive tract and nervous system and how both the taste and nutritive components of sugar can lead to specific appetite changes and cravings. I discuss the connection between sugar, dopamine, and cravings and outline many tools to curb sugar cravings, specifically craving highly processed refined sugars.

      <title>Using Salt to Optimize Mental &amp; Physical Performance | Episode 63</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-salt-to-optimize-mental-and-physical-performance/</link>
      <description>I discuss the role of salt (sodium) in the nervous system and the key role that it plays in mental performance, physical performance and health. I explain how the brain senses salt levels in our body and how that relates to our feelings of thirst. I cover the physiology of the renal system and the hormones that control sodium and water balance in our body. I also explore how salt interacts with stress and our immune systems and its crucial role in neuron function. Additionally, I examine research findings suggesting that some individuals might benefit from increased intake of sodium and other electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) to enhance mental performance, lessen anxiety, and offset dizziness. Yet, other people may need less sodium. I discuss how you can determine your optimal sodium intake and why sodium intake levels need to be uniquely tailored to an individual’s lifestyle. Finally, I explain how salt creates ‘hidden’ sugars in many processed foods and the problems that can create. Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed findings outlining salt’s essential role in overall health and describe general recommendations and tools anyone can use to find their optimal salt balance and thereby enhance their brain and body’s performance.

Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed findings outlining salt’s essential role in overall health and describe general recommendations and tools anyone can use to find their optimal salt balance and thereby enhance their brain and body’s performance.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman%20">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbGdJN2JnUV9XSHlyd3NlNkhHanVEMmk3LXF2UXxBQ3Jtc0trOF9KbHhkaVZyS2tDUk5aV2lUVEtzTTVTb3kzZE5VQVZxUDZqczBya2NfU1RxWklmcmhBV01acl8zN2JKS2pqcWtwY0RpZWJIM3BDQkZmT2FGN1hYRTkxeEhjWC1OaEliUHI2X1FkU3JnbzlTUmxOcw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fdrinklmnt.com%2Fhuberman">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/using-salt-to-optimize-mental-and-physical-performance/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Role of Salt </p><p>(00:02:57) Neuropod Cells, Artificial Sweeteners &amp; ‘Hidden’ Cravings </p><p>(00:10:57) Sponsors</p><p>(00:15:06) Salt Regulation </p><p>(00:17:13) How the Brain Senses Salt</p><p>(00:24:15) Salt &amp; Thirst </p><p>(00:29:27) Blood Pressure &amp; Thirst </p><p>(00:33:47) Kidneys &amp; Urine Regulation</p><p>(00:39:08) Vasopressin: Roles in Libido &amp; Urination </p><p>(00:45:46) How Much Salt Do You Need? </p><p>(00:56:45) Should You Increase Your Salt Intake? </p><p>(01:02:19) Tools: Determining Your Individual Salt Intake</p><p>(01:14:02) Iodine, Sea Salt </p><p>(01:17:13) Salt: Roles in Stress &amp; Anxiety </p><p>(01:24:20) Other Electrolytes: Magnesium &amp; Potassium </p><p>(01:27:57) Tools: Effects of Low-carbohydrate Diets &amp; Caffeine </p><p>(01:32:28) General Recommendations for Salt Intake </p><p>(01:36:34) Perception of Salt &amp; Sugar Taste, Processed Foods </p><p>(01:47:13) Role of Sodium in Neuronal Function, Action Potentials </p><p>(01:53:13) Dehydration </p><p>(01:55:36) What Salt Intake is Best for You? </p><p>(02:00:58) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter </p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: How to Build, Maintain &amp; Repair Gut Health | Episode 62</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-justin-sonnenburg-how-to-build-maintain-and-repair-gut-health/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Professor of Microbiology &amp; Immunology at Stanford University. Dr. Sonnenburg’s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their gut microbiome and health.

      <title>How to Enhance Your Gut Microbiome for Brain &amp; Overall Health | Episode 61</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-enhance-your-gut-microbiome-for-brain-and-overall-health/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the profound effect the gut has on the nervous system. I cover the structure and function of the gut-brain axis and the role of the gut microbiome in the brain and overall health. I describe how the gut controls hunger or satiety by affecting neurons in our brain. I also contrast the many pathways by which the gut influences the brain: direct vs. indirect pathways, chemical vs. mechanical, and fast vs. slow signaling. Additionally, I discuss what defines a healthy microbiome and how your lifestyle impacts the gut microbiome, including the effects of stress, fasting, antibiotics, pets, environment, prebiotics and probiotics. I address how different foods shape the gut microbiome, in particular, the emerging data that fermented foods can increase the diversity of healthy gut microbiota. Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed and textbook findings that reveal the critical role of the gut microbiome in supporting mental and physical health and I outline simple tools that anyone can use in order to enhance their gut microbiome health.

      <title>Dr. David Spiegel: Using Hypnosis to Enhance Mental &amp; Physical Health &amp; Performance | Episode 60</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-spiegel-using-hypnosis-to-enhance-mental-and-physical-health-and-performance/</link>
      <description>My guest is Dr. David Spiegel MD, Associate Chair of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Sciences, Director of the Center on Stress and Health and Director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Spiegel has more than 40 years of clinical and research experience with hypnosis, stress physiology, and psychotherapy. In this episode, we examine the role of clinical hypnosis for the treatment of trauma, chronic pain, anxiety and more. Dr. Spiegel explains how to determine your level of ‘hypnotizability’ and provides case studies of incredible successes with hypnosis to treat a variety of ailments. We also discuss how breathing, vision and directed mental focus can modulate internal states and enhance performance. Additionally, we discuss how the adoption of self-hypnosis techniques can reduce stress and enhance sleep in anyone. Dr. Spiegel teaches us how hypnosis works at the neural circuit level to enhance cognitive flexibility. Throughout the episode, Dr. Spiegel summarizes key clinical trials and peer-reviewed findings and resources to work with a trained clinical professional or to do guided self-hypnosis.

      <title>The Science of Love, Desire and Attachment | Episode 59</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-love-desire-and-attachment/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the psychology and biology of desire, love and attachment. I explain how childhood attachment types are thought to inform adult attachment styles to romantic partners, and I describe some of the major theories of human mate selection, relationships and infidelity. Additionally, I explore the neurobiology and proposed subconscious processing underlying desire, love and attachment, including the roles of empathy and “positive delusion." I outline how self-awareness can shift one’s relationship attachment style towards securely bonded partnerships. Finally, I describe specific tools and supplements that have been researched to increase libido and sex drive. Throughout the episode, I explain the science and key mechanisms underlying romantic love and outline tools for those seeking to find a strong, healthy relationship, or for those wanting to strengthen an existing relationship.

      <title>Using Play to Rewire &amp; Improve Your Brain | Episode 58</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-play-to-rewire-and-improve-your-brain/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the transformative nature of play—how it changes our feelings, thoughts and actions and indeed, how it can rewire our brain to function better in all contexts. I explain the role of play in childhood, as well as adulthood in skill and social development and describe key characteristics of the mind and body during play. Additionally, I explore how play allows the brain to test contingencies in different roles/environments. Throughout, I discuss the underlying neurobiology of play. I also describe how low-stakes play, and tinkering can broaden and shape your future capabilities. Finally, I discuss how our childhood ‘personal play identity’ informs our adult personality. Throughout the episode, I use the science of play to outline recommendations for using play as a means to enhance neuroplasticity and explore novel situations, regardless of age.

Additionally, I explore how play allows the brain to test contingencies in different roles/environments. Throughout, I discuss the underlying neurobiology of play. I also describe how low-stakes play, and tinkering can broaden and shape your future capabilities. Finally, I discuss how our childhood ‘personal play identity’ informs our adult personality. Throughout the episode, I use the science of play to outline recommendations for using play as a means to enhance neuroplasticity and explore novel situations, regardless of age.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/using-play-to-rewire-and-improve-your-brain/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) The Power of Play</p><p>(00:02:23) Tool: Reading on Smart Phones, Sighing &amp; Learning</p><p>(00:09:14) Sponsors</p><p>(00:13:57) Homeostatic Regulation of Play</p><p>(00:23:53) Childhood Play &amp; Mindsets</p><p>(00:29:21) Contingency Testing</p><p>(00:32:17) The (Power of) Playful Mindset</p><p>(00:36:13) Body Postures</p><p>(00:44:03) Rule Testing &amp; Breaking</p><p>(00:48:24) Role Play</p><p>(00:50:39) Neurobiology of Low-stakes Play</p><p>(00:54:22) Expanding Capabilities through Tinkering</p><p>(01:00:03) Play Is THE Portal to Neuroplasticity</p><p>(01:04:44) Adulthood Play</p><p>(01:10:14) Fire Together, Wire Together</p><p>(01:18:03) Trauma &amp; Play Deficits &amp; Recovery</p><p>(01:23:25) Competition &amp; Dynamic Movement</p><p>(01:27:36) Chess, Mental Roles, Novelty</p><p>(01:32:52) Personal Play Identity</p><p>(01:37:24) Play Transforms Your Future Self</p><p>(01:40:55) Recommendations for Play</p><p>(01:44:25) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify/Apple Reviews, YouTube, Sponsors, Instagram, Twitter, Supplements</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Optimizing Workspace for Productivity, Focus, &amp; Creativity | Episode 57</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/optimizing-workspace-for-productivity-focus-and-creativity/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss ways to set up your workspace to optimize productivity, focus and creativity. I discuss how to adjust light, physically arrange your work environment, and leverage body posture to enhance productivity. Additionally, I explore how to shift your work environment for particular types of tasks. Moreover, I review the role of body movement in the workspace. I also discuss sound-based tools that can either enhance or diminish cognitive functioning (the ability to focus on deep work). I describe a particular frequency of binaural beats that studies show can be used to enhance memory and recall. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed findings practical tools anyone can use, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their workspace to achieve heightened levels of productivity, increased alertness and focus, and creativity.

      <title>Dr. Alia Crum: Science of Mindsets for Health &amp; Performance | Episode 56</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-alia-crum-science-of-mindsets-for-health-performance/</link>
      <description>My guest is Dr. Alia Crum, Associate (tenured) Professor of Psychology at Stanford University and Director of the Stanford Mind &amp; Body Lab. Dr. Crum is a world expert on mindsets and beliefs and how they shape our responses to stress, exercise, and even to the foods we eat. We discuss how our mindset about the nutritional content of food changes whether it is satisfying to us at a physiological (hormonal and metabolic) level. She also tells how mindsets about exercise can dramatically alter the effects of exercise on weight loss, blood pressure, and other health metrics. Dr. Crum teaches us how to think about stress in ways that allow stress to grow us and bring out our best rather than diminish our health and performance. Throughout the episode, Dr. Crum provides descriptions of high-quality peer-reviewed scientific findings that we can all leverage toward better health and performance in our lives.

      <title>The Science of Setting &amp; Achieving Goals | Episode 55</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-setting-and-achieving-goals/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the science of setting, assessing, and pursuing goals. I explain the neural (brain) circuits that underlie goal setting and pursuit. Then I describe nine science-supported tools anyone can apply toward their goals. I explain when and how to use goal visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to improve the likelihood of reaching your goals. I also explain why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. I also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit. Finally, I explain a unique tool called 'space-time bridging' that can be used to support all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit. This episode ought to be useful for anyone seeking to improve their performance in work, school, exercise, athletics, or personal development.

      <itunes:subtitle>In this episode, I discuss the science of setting, assessing, and pursuing goals.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I discuss the science of setting, assessing, and pursuing goals. I explain the neural (brain) circuits that underlie goal setting and pursuit. Then I describe nine science-supported tools anyone can apply toward their goals. I explain when and how to use goal visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to improve the likelihood of reaching your goals. I also explain why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. I also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit. Finally, I explain a unique tool called 'space-time bridging' that can be used to support all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit. This episode ought to be useful for anyone seeking to improve their performance in work, school, exercise, athletics, or personal development.

      <title>Dr. Jack Feldman: Breathing for Mental &amp; Physical Health &amp; Performance | Episode 54</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-jack-feldman-breathing-for-mental-physical-health-and-performance/</link>
      <description>This episode my guest is Dr. Jack Feldman, Distinguished Professor of Neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles and a pioneering world expert in the science of respiration (breathing). We discuss how and why humans breathe the way we do, the function of the diaphragm and how it serves to increase oxygenation of the brain and body. We discuss how breathing influences mental state, fear, memory, reaction time, and more. And we discuss specific breathing protocols such as box-breathing, cyclic hyperventilation (similar to Wim Hof breathing), nasal versus mouth breathing, unilateral breathing, and how these each affect the brain and body. We discuss physiological sighs, peptides expressed by specific neurons controlling breathing, and magnesium compounds that can improve cognitive ability and how they work. This conversation serves as a sort of "Master Class" on the science of breathing and breathing-related tools for health and performance.

      <title>The Science of Making &amp; Breaking Habits | Episode 53</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-making-and-breaking-habits/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I review the science of habit formation and habit elimination and how the process of neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) underlies these processes.
I describe two new systems for habit formation. The first system is grounded in the neuroscience of brain states and our ability to perform (and to avoid) certain tasks at different phases of the 24-hour day. The second system focuses on 21-day habit formation and consolidation.
I also discuss "task bracketing" as an approach to enhancing habit formation and eliminating unwanted habits and the neural circuits that underlie task bracketing in the basal ganglia (a brain region for generating and stopping behaviors). I also review the science of dopamine rewards and how to apply that knowledge to shaping habits.
The science and tools in this episode ought to be helpful for anyone looking to build better habits and eliminate unwanted habits for school, work, fitness, relationships, creative endeavors, and more—indeed for any person or situation where behavioral changes are needed.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I review the science of habit formation and habit elimination and how the process of neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) underlies these processes.
I describe two new systems for habit formation. The first system is grounded in the neuroscience of brain states and our ability to perform (and to avoid) certain tasks at different phases of the 24-hour day. The second system focuses on 21-day habit formation and consolidation.
I also discuss "task bracketing" as an approach to enhancing habit formation and eliminating unwanted habits and the neural circuits that underlie task bracketing in the basal ganglia (a brain region for generating and stopping behaviors). I also review the science of dopamine rewards and how to apply that knowledge to shaping habits.
The science and tools in this episode ought to be helpful for anyone looking to build better habits and eliminate unwanted habits for school, work, fitness, relationships, creative endeavors, and more—indeed for any person or situation where behavioral changes are needed.

      <title>Dr. David Sinclair: The Biology of Slowing &amp; Reversing Aging | Episode 52</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-sinclair-the-biology-of-slowing-and-reversing-aging/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I am joined by Dr. David Sinclair, tenured Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and an expert researcher in the field of longevity. Dr. Sinclair is also the author of the book Lifespan: Why We Age &amp; Why We Don't Have To, and the host of the Lifespan Podcast, which launches January 5, 2022. 
In this interview, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and what we all can do to slow or reverse the aging process. We discuss fasting and supplementation with resveratrol, NAD, metformin, and NMN. We also discuss the use of caffeine, exercise, cold exposure, and why excessive iron load is bad for us. We discuss food choices for offsetting aging and promoting autophagy (clearance of dead cells). And we discuss the key blood markers everyone should monitor to determine your biological versus chronological age. We also discuss the future of longevity research and technology. This episode includes lots of basic science and specific, actionable protocols, right down to the details of what to do and when. By the end, you will have in-depth knowledge of the biology of aging and how to offset it.

      <title>Science of Social Bonding in Family, Friendship &amp; Romantic Love | Episode 51</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/science-of-social-bonding-in-family-friendship-and-romantic-love/</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss the science of social bonding- the process by which we form attachments. I explain the neural and hormonal basis for "social homeostasis" (our drive for a given amount of socializing) which reveals why we get lonely, why we seek out connection with others and how power dynamics (hierarchies) shape those connections. I also discuss the neurochemical basis of introversion and extroversion, of trust and how shared experiences that promote similar physiological states in two or more individuals, leads to more rapid bonding. I also discuss how food and oxytocin play key roles in social bonding. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed science and practical tools for anyone seeking to find, build or end relationships.

        <![CDATA[<p>This episode I discuss the science of social bonding- the process by which we form attachments. I explain the neural and hormonal basis for "social homeostasis" (our drive for a given amount of socializing) which reveals why we get lonely, why we seek out connection with others and how power dynamics (hierarchies) shape those connections. I also discuss the neurochemical basis of introversion and extroversion, of trust and how shared experiences that promote similar physiological states in two or more individuals, leads to more rapid bonding. I also discuss how food and oxytocin play key roles in social bonding. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed science and practical tools for anyone seeking to find, build or end relationships.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/science-of-social-bonding-in-family-friendship-and-romantic-love/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Social Bonding: Child-Parent, Romantic, Friendship, Breakups</p><p>(00:02:55) Sponsors</p><p>(00:07:08) Social Bonding as a Biological Process</p><p>(00:10:03) Social Isolation</p><p>(00:13:32) Social Homeostasis &amp; Neural Circuits for Social Drive </p><p>(00:18:55) Brain Areas &amp; (Neuro)Chemistry of Social Drive </p><p>(00:22:48) What is Social Homeostasis &amp; Dopamine</p><p>(00:27:00) When We Lack Social Interactions: Short- Versus Long-Term</p><p>(00:28:10) Introverts &amp; Extroverts</p><p>(00:31:00) “Good” Versus “Bad” Social Interactions &amp; Hierarchies</p><p>(00:33:54) Loneliness &amp; Dorsal Raphe Nucleus &amp; Social Hunger </p><p>(00:37:33) Tools</p><p>(00:38:05) Socializing &amp; Food Appetite: Crossover Craving</p><p>(00:42:45) Falling in Love</p><p>(00:45:05) Tools for Social Bonds: Merging Physiologies; Story</p><p>(00:53:54) Childhood Attachment Patterns in Adulthood</p><p>(01:03:45) Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment</p><p>(01:06:10) Emotional Empathy &amp; Cognitive Empathy, Arguing</p><p>(01:09:45) Allan N.

      <title>Dr. David Berson: Understanding Your Brain's Logic &amp; Function | Episode 50</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-berson-your-brains-logic-and-function/</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Berson, Professor &amp; Chairman of Neuroscience at Brown University. Dr. Berson discovered the neurons in your eye that set your biological rhythms for sleep, wakefulness, mood and appetite. He is also a world-renowned teacher of basic and advanced neuroscience, having taught thousands of university lectures on this topic. Many of his students have become world-leading neuroscientists and teachers themselves. 
Here Dr. Berson takes us on a structured journey into and around the nervous system, explaining: how we perceive the world and our internal landscape, how we balance, see, and remember. Also, how we learn and perform reflexive and deliberate actions, how we visualize and imagine in our mind, and how the various circuits of the brain coordinate all these incredible feats. 
We discuss practical and real-life examples of neural circuit function across the lifespan. Dr. Berson gives us a masterclass in the nervous system—one that, in just less than two hours, will teach you an entire course's worth about the brain and how yours works.

      <title>Erasing Fears &amp; Traumas Based on the Modern Neuroscience of Fear | Episode 49</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/erasing-fears-and-traumas-based-on-the-modern-neuroscience-of-fear/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss fear and trauma, including the neural circuits involved in the "threat reflex" and how specific experiences and memories come to activate that system. I also discuss how our body is involved in trauma and fear. First, I describe the logic of fear mechanisms and how "top-down" processing-- meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then I discuss what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and consider various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine, other drug-assisted therapies, and more. I also review new data on how 5 minutes per day of deliberate, self-imposed stress can erase fear and depression. And I review the role that social connection plays in erasing or maintaining fears by activating specific molecular pathways in the brain and body. Finally, I review supplementation with over-the-counter compounds for their effects on anxiety and fear and when to take them, if at all.

Finally, I review supplementation with over-the-counter compounds for their effects on anxiety and fear and when to take them, if at all. </p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/erasing-fears-and-traumas-based-on-the-modern-neuroscience-of-fear/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Introducing Fear, Trauma &amp; Trauma </p><p>(00:02:15) Sponsors</p><p>(00:06:49) What is Fear? </p><p>(00:11:45) Autonomic Arousal: “Alertness” vs. “Calmness”</p><p>(00:13:44) Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis (HPA axis)</p><p>(00:17:36) “The Threat Reflex”: Neural Circuits for Fear</p><p>(00:28:24) Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing</p><p>(00:32:27) Narratives: “Protective or Dangerous”</p><p>(00:35:58) Attaching Fear to Events: Classical Conditioning &amp; Memory</p><p>(00:41:45) How Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA</p><p>(00:46:10) Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears</p><p>(00:50:25) Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies for Fear</p><p>(00:57:56) Repetition of Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences with Good</p><p>(01:05:28) EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing</p><p>(01:14:00) Social Connection &amp; Isolation Are Chemically Powerful</p><p>(01:18:23) Trans-Generational Trauma</p><p>(01:25:00) PTSD Treatments: Ketamine, MDMA, oxytocin</p><p>(01:39:25) How Do You Know If You Are Traumatized? </p><p>(01:46:16) Deliberate Brief Stress Can Erase Fears &amp; Trauma</p><p>(01:49:50) Erasing Fears &amp; Traumas In 5 Minutes Per Day</p><p>(01:59:42) Nutrition, Sleep, &amp; Other General Support Erasing Fear &amp; Trauma</p><p>(02:02:30) Supplements for Anxiety, Fear: Saffron, Inositol, Kava</p><p>(02:10:00) Synthesis </p><p>(02:11:46) Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. David Buss: How Humans Select &amp; Keep Romantic Partners in Short &amp; Long Term | Episode 48</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-buss-how-humans-select-and-keep-romantic-partners-in-short-and-long-term/</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Buss, Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, and one of the founding members of the field of evolutionary psychology.
Dr. Buss describes his work on how people select mates for short and long-term relationships, the dynamics of human courtship, and mate value assessment — meaning how people measure up as potential partners. We also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences for infidelity in men and women. He explains how people evaluate and try to alter other people’s mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. We discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans. And we discuss what Dr. Buss calls “the dark triad”— features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships.
This episode is sure to be of interest to anyone single or in a relationship who seeks to know how people select mates and anyone who is interested in forming and maintaining healthy romantic partnerships.

      <title>The Science of Gratitude &amp; How to Build a Gratitude Practice | Episode 47</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-gratitude-and-how-to-build-a-gratitude-practice/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the science of gratitude, which has been shown in peer-reviewed studies to have tremendous positive effects on mental and physical health. I explain, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. I also discuss why we can't simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. I also explain the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, I use the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol.

      <title>Time Perception &amp; Entrainment by Dopamine, Serotonin &amp; Hormones | Episode 46</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/time-perception-and-entrainment-by-dopamine-serotonin-and-hormones/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss how our brain and body track time and the role that neurochemicals, in particular dopamine and serotonin, but also hormones such as melatonin, allow us to orient ourselves in time. I review the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. I also discuss circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. I explain the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And I cover the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity. I include ten tools based on the science of time perception that you can apply to enhance productivity, creativity, and relationships in various contexts.

      <title>Dr. Duncan French: How to Exercise for Strength Gains &amp; Hormone Optimization | Episode 45</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-duncan-french-how-to-exercise-for-strength-gains-and-hormone-optimization/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I talk to Dr. Duncan French, Ph.D., the Vice President of Performance at the UFC Performance Institute and a world-class performance specialist. We discuss specific resistance (weight) training regimens for increasing testosterone in men and women and how to vary mechanical loads and rest between sets and workouts to optimize hormone output and training results. We also discuss how stress-induced "catecholamines" can increase testosterone or decrease it, depending on duration and mindset. And we discuss specific cold- and heat- therapies for increasing resilience, reducing inflammation, heat shock proteins and more. We discuss nutrition for training and how to match nutrition to training goals and metabolic flexibility. We discuss mental focus and how long to train for skill development. Finally, we discuss how mixed martial arts and the UFC Performance Institute are a template for exploring human performance more generally. This episode is intended for anyone interested in athletic and mental performance: athletes, students, and recreational exercisers and includes both science and many practical tools people can apply in their own training.

      <title>Using Your Nervous System to Enhance Your Immune System | Episode 44</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-your-nervous-system-to-enhance-your-immune-system/</link>
      <description>This episode teaches you a lot about the immune system, immune-brain interactions and offers 12 potential tools for enhancing immune system function. I discuss how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system.
I discuss the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes-- not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And I review how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. I discuss how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and, if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. I also discuss the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and I discuss how to increase glymphatic "washout" of brain debris during sleep. I also review fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation).

      <itunes:summary>This episode teaches you a lot about the immune system, immune-brain interactions and offers 12 potential tools for enhancing immune system function. I discuss how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system.
I discuss the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes-- not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And I review how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. I discuss how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and, if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. I also discuss the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and I discuss how to increase glymphatic "washout" of brain debris during sleep. I also review fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation).

      <title>Dr. Samer Hattar: Timing Your Light, Food, &amp; Exercise for Optimal Sleep, Energy &amp; Mood | Episode 43</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-samer-hattar-timing-light-food-exercise-for-better-sleep-energy-mood/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I host Dr. Samer Hattar, Chief of the Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms at the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite, and mental health. We discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep-wake cycle for you. We also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight savings leads to outsized effects on our biking because of the way that our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days. And he offers precise tools to rapidly adjust to jetlag, shift work, and reset your clock after a late night of work or socializing. This episode is filled with cutting-edge data on the biological mechanisms of human physiology and practical tools for people of all ages.

      <title>Nutrients For Brain Health &amp; Performance | Episode 42</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/nutrients-for-brain-health-and-performance/</link>
      <description>This episode I describe science-supported nutrients for brain and performance (cognition) and for nervous system health generally.
I describe 10 tools for this purpose, including specific amounts and sources for Omega-3 fatty acids which make up the "structural fat" of neurons (nerve cells) and allow them to function across our lifespan. I also review data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline. I describe both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds, and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature.
Then I review the 3 factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it's not just about what tastes good to us. Next, I explore how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. I also review new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental, in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation. This episode covers more than 10 actionable tools for those seeking to improve and/or maintain brain function, and it explains modern neuroscience underlying of our sense of taste, our food seeking preferences and brain metabolism.

      <title>Effects of Fasting &amp; Time Restricted Eating on Fat Loss &amp; Health | Episode 41</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/effects-of-fasting-and-time-restricted-eating-on-fat-loss-and-health/</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss the science and practice of fasting also called time-restricted feeding. I review the data on how limiting food intake to specific portions of every 24-hour cycle (or fasting longer) impacts weight loss, fat loss specifically, liver health, mental focus, muscle, longevity and more. I explain how "fasted" is contextual, and relates to blood glucose levels and their downstream effects, and how the depth of fasting can be adjusted with behaviors such as different types of exercise, or with glucose disposal agents. I also discuss the optimal fasting protocol: and both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features of a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol that will allow you to get the most benefits. I also discuss what does and does not break a fast, the effects of fasting on hormones like testosterone and cortisol and on fertility. I also review how different feeding windows of 8 or 10 or 4 hours differentially impact the effects of fasting, and why the classic 8 hour feeding window came to be but also might be ideal. I discuss mechanisms and offer tools to discern the optimal fasting duration and timing for you.

      <title>Dr. Craig Heller: Using Temperature To Optimize Performance, Brain &amp; Body Health | Episode 40</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-craig-heller-using-temperature-for-performance-brain-and-body-health/</link>
      <description>This episode I am joined by Dr. Craig Heller, Professor of Biology at Stanford University and world expert on the science of temperature regulation. We discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how most everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run further and faster, as well as to eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness. Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance, and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and to enhance sleep and cognition. We discuss how anyone can apply these principles for themselves, even their dogs! Our conversation includes both many practical tools and mechanistic science.

      <title>Controlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus &amp; Satisfaction | Episode 39</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/controlling-your-dopamine-for-motivation-focus-and-satisfaction/</link>
      <description>This episode serves as a sort of “Dopamine Masterclass”. I discuss the immensely powerful chemical that we all make in our brain and body: dopamine. I describe what it does and the neural circuits involved. I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine—both their benefits and risks—and synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine.

        <![CDATA[<p>This episode serves as a sort of “Dopamine Masterclass”. I discuss the immensely powerful chemical that we all make in our brain and body: dopamine. I describe what it does and the neural circuits involved. I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine—both their benefits and risks—and synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine. </p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/controlling-your-dopamine-for-motivation-focus-and-satisfaction/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Introduction &amp; Tool 1 to Induce Lasting Dopamine</p><p>(00:04:48) Sponsors</p><p>(00:09:10) Upcoming (Zero-Cost) Neuroplasticity Seminar for Educators</p><p>(00:09:58) What Dopamine (Really) Does</p><p>(00:15:30) Two Main Neural Circuits for Dopamine </p><p>(00:18:14) How Dopamine Is Released: Locally and Broadly</p><p>(00:22:03) Fast and Slow Effects of Dopamine</p><p>(00:25:03) Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate</p><p>(00:28:00) Your Dopamine History Really Matters </p><p>(00:30:30) Parkinson’s &amp; Drugs That Kill Dopamine Neurons.

      <title>Dr. Matthew Johnson: Psychedelics for Treating Mental Disorders | Episode 38</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-matthew-johnson-psychedelic-medicine/</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss medical research on psychedelic compounds with Dr. Matthew Johnson, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. We discuss the biology and medical clinical-trial uses of psilocybin, MDMA, ayahuasca, DMT, and LSD. Dr. Johnson teaches us what the clinical trials in his lab are revealing about the potential these compounds hold for the treatment of depression, addiction, trauma, eating disorders, ADHD, and other disorders of the mind. Dr. Johnson describes a typical psychedelic experiment in his laboratory, start to finish, including the conditions for optimal clinical outcomes. And he explains some of the potential hazards and common misconceptions and pitfalls related to psychedelic medicine. Dr. Johnson explains flashbacks, the heightened risks of certain people and age groups using psychedelics and the ever evolving legal and pharmaceutical industry landscape surrounding psychedelics. Dr. Johnson also explains how the scientific study of psychedelics is likely to set the trajectory of psychiatric medicine in the years to come. Dr. Johnson is among a small handful of researchers who have pioneered the clinical study of these powerful compounds. He has unprecedented insight into how they can be woven into other psychiatric treatments, changing ones sense of self and of reality.

      <title>ADHD &amp; How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus | Episode 37</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/adhd-and-how-anyone-can-improve-their-focus/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder): what it is, the common myths, and the biology and psychology of ADHD.
I discuss both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for ADHD, and brain-machine interface tools. I also discuss behavioral training protocols that can improve focus in people with ADHD and those without ADHD, and for people of different ages. I discuss the role of dopamine in coordinating 'default-mode' and 'task-related' neural networks, attentional "blinks" (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, I review some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD).
The role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed. Throughout, both basic science and clinical scenarios, as well as applicable tools and resources are covered.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I discuss ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder): what it is, the common myths, and the biology and psychology of ADHD.</p><p>I discuss both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for ADHD, and brain-machine interface tools. I also discuss behavioral training protocols that can improve focus in people with ADHD and those without ADHD, and for people of different ages. I discuss the role of dopamine in coordinating 'default-mode' and 'task-related' neural networks, attentional "blinks" (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, I review some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD).</p><p>The role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed. Throughout, both basic science and clinical scenarios, as well as applicable tools and resources are covered.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/adhd-and-how-anyone-can-improve-their-focus/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Introduction &amp; Note About Diagnosis</p><p>(00:03:27) Sponsors </p><p>(00:07:56) ADHD vs. ADD: Genetics, IQ, Rates in Kids &amp; Adults</p><p>(00:13:00) Attention &amp; Focus, Impulse Control</p><p>(00:14:57) Hyper-focus </p><p>(00:16:45) Time Perception</p><p>(00:18:25) The Pile System</p><p>(00:20:00) Working Memory</p><p>(00:24:10) Hyper-Focus &amp; Dopamine </p><p>(00:26:40) Neural Circuits In ADHD: Default Mode Network &amp; Task-Related Networks </p><p>(00:32:57) Low Dopamine in ADHD &amp; Stimulant Use &amp; Abuse</p><p>(00:37:10) Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil &amp; Armodafinil </p><p>(00:47:00) Non-Prescribed Adderall, Caffeine, Nicotine</p><p>(00:49:18) How Stimulants “Teach” the Brains of ADHD Children to Focus</p><p>(00:52:00) When To Medicate: A Highly Informed (Anecdotal) Case Study</p><p>(00:56:35) Elimination Diets &amp; Allergies In ADHD</p><p>(01:04:46) Omega-3 Fatty Acids: EPAs &amp; DHAs </p><p>(01:07:00) Modulation vs Mediation of Biological Processes</p><p>(01:10:50) Attentional Blinks </p><p>(01:16:56) Open Monitoring &amp; 17minute Focus Enhancement </p><p>(01:22:50) Blinking, Dopamine &amp; Time Perception; &amp; Focus Training </p><p>(01:30:10) Reverberatory Neural &amp; Physical Activity</p><p>(01:33:40) Adderall, Ritalin &amp; Blink Frequency</p><p>(01:35:00) Cannabis </p><p>(01:37:30) Interoceptive Awareness </p><p>(01:41:15) Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil, Armodafinil; Smart Drugs &amp; Caffeine: Dangers</p><p>(01:48:05) DHA Fatty Acids, Phosphatidylserine</p><p>(0:1:50:54) Ginko Biloba </p><p>(01:51:45) Modafinil &amp; Armodafanil: Dopamine Action &amp; Orexin</p><p>(01:56:19) Acetylcholine: Circuits Underlying Focus; Alpha-GPC</p><p>(01:59:04) L-Tyrosine, (PEA) Phenylethylamine </p><p>(02:01:23) Racetams, Noopept </p><p>(02:05:15) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Combining Technology &amp; Pharmacology </p><p>(02:09:14) Smart Phones &amp; ADHD &amp; Sub-Clinical Focus Issues In Adults &amp; Kids</p><p>(02:14:30) Synthesis/Summary</p><p>(02:16:10) Support for Podcast &amp; Research, Supplement Resources</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Healthy Eating &amp; Eating Disorders - Anorexia, Bulimia, Binging | Episode 36</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/healthy-eating-and-eating-disorders-anorexia-bulimia-binging/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss what drives hunger and satiety, and the role our brain, stomach, fat and hormones play in regulating hunger and turning off the desire to eat more. I also address how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day, and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day.
Then I delve into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa where people binge and purge their food. I discuss some common myths about Anorexia such as the role of media images increasing the rates of anorexia and the myth of the "perfectionist" anorexic. I also review the symptoms, and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. I explain how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then I discuss the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices. I also discuss new more experimental clinical trials on MDMA, Psilocybin and Ibogaine for Anorexia, and both their promise and risks
I review the latest work on binge eating disorder and brain stimulation, drug treatments and thyroid disruption in Bulimia and why the treatments for Bulimia are so similar to those for ADHD. Finally, I discuss "cheat days," body dysmorphia and the growing list of novel forms of eating disorders start to finish. As always, science and science-based tools are discussed.

      <title>Dr. Robert Sapolsky: Science of Stress, Testosterone &amp; Free Will | Episode 35</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-robert-sapolsky-science-of-stress-testosterone-and-free-will/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I interview Dr. Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D., Professor of Biology, Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery at Stanford University. We discuss stress, what defines short-term versus long-term stress, and how stress can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context. We also discuss stress mitigation and how our sense of control over stress mitigation techniques, including exercise, determine health outcomes. Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone — how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior, but that it does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence, and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He also explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. And we discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity. Finally, we discuss free will, what it means to have free will, and if we have any free will, including how knowledge alone might allow us to make better decisions for ourselves and society.

We also discuss stress mitigation and how our sense of control over stress mitigation techniques, including exercise, determine health outcomes. Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone — how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior, but that it does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence, and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He also explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. And we discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity. Finally, we discuss free will, what it means to have free will, and if we have any free will, including how knowledge alone might allow us to make better decisions for ourselves and society. </p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-robert-sapolsky-science-of-stress-testosterone-and-free-will/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><p>Timestamps</p><p>(00:00:00) Introduction: Dr. Robert Sapolsky </p><p>(00:02:26) Sponsors</p><p>(00:06:30) Stress: Short &amp; Long-Term, Good &amp; Bad </p><p>(00:09:11) Valence &amp; Amygdala </p><p>(00:11:00) Testosterone: Common Myths vs. Actual Truths </p><p>(00:15:15) Behaviors that Affect Testosterone  </p><p>(00:17:20) Mindsets &amp; Contexts that Affect Testosterone</p><p>(00:20:28) How Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels  </p><p>(00:22:30) Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, &amp; Female-Female </p><p>(00:24:05) Testosterone: The Challenge Hypothesis </p><p>(00:29:20) How Dopamine Impacts Testosterone &amp; Motivation </p><p>(00:32:32) Estrogen: Improves Brain &amp; Longevity BUT TIMING IS KEY </p><p>(00:39:40) Are Testosterone &amp; Sperm Counts in Males Really Dropping? </p><p>(00:42:15) Stress Mitigation &amp; Our Sense of Control </p><p>(00:51:35) How Best to Buffer Stress </p><p>(00:57:04) Power of Perception, Choice &amp; Individual Differences </p><p>(01:00:32) Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex &amp; Hierarchy </p><p>(01:11:20) How Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking  </p><p>(01:13:17) Do We Have Free Will? </p><p>(01:20:50) How to Apply Knowledge &amp; Learning  </p><p>(01:23:44) Robert’s New Book: “Determined: The Science of Life Without Free Will” </p><p>(01:28:27) Reflections, Support of Podcast, &amp; Supporting Stress Research </p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Understanding &amp; Conquering Depression | Episode 34</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/understanding-and-conquering-depression/</link>
      <description>This episode, I explain what major depression is at the biological and psychological level and the various treatments that peer-reviewed studies have revealed can help prevent and treat depression. I explain the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression: norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. I review 8 specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more. I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression, especially treatment-resistant major depression.

      <title>Dr. Anna Lembke: Understanding &amp; Treating Addiction | Episode 33</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-anna-lembke-understanding-and-treating-addiction/</link>
      <description>This episode I interview Dr. Anna Lembke, MD, Chief of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Lembke is a psychiatrist expert in treating addictions of all kinds: drugs, alcohol, food, sex, video games, gambling, food, medication, etc. Dr. Lembke is also an expert in the opioid crisis, and the author of Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence.
We discuss the biology and psychology of why people become addicted to certain substances and behaviors and the key role that our "dopamine balance" plays in creating addiction. We also discuss the science and practice of how to conquer addictions, why people relapse and how to avoid relapsing. Dr. Lembke also shares her expertise on topics closely related to addiction such as community, shame and lying and she explains why telling the truth—even about the most basic things in daily life, adjusts dopamine levels in our brain.
This episode is an important one for anyone struggling with addictions of any kind, for their friends and families and for health care professionals. It is also for anyone who has defeated addiction and is determined to stay clean. Last but not least, it helps explain why all humans do what we do, and how we can all maintain a healthy sense of pleasure seeking in life.

Last but not least, it helps explain why all humans do what we do, and how we can all maintain a healthy sense of pleasure seeking in life.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-anna-lembke-understanding-and-treating-addiction/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Anna Lembke, Addiction Expert</p><p>(00:02:25) Disclaimer &amp; Sponsors</p><p>(00:07:00) Dopamine, Happiness &amp; Impulsivity </p><p>(00:15:56) What Is Pleasure? </p><p>(00:18:20) Addiction, Boredom &amp; Passion for Life</p><p>(00:24:00) Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction</p><p>(00:29:10) Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia</p><p>(00:30:47) Are All Addictions the Same?</p><p>(00:35:38) Boredom &amp; Anxiety Lead to Creativity </p><p>(00:40:35) Finding Your Passion Starts with Boredom &amp; Action Steps </p><p>(00:50:05) How to Break an Addiction</p><p>(00:55:25) Relapse, Craving &amp; Triggers</p><p>(01:07:40) Can People Get Addicted To “Sobriety”? </p><p>(01:11:45) Are We All Wired for Addiction? </p><p>(01:15:57) Bizarre Addiction</p><p>(01:18:14) Recovered Addicts Are Heroes</p><p>(01:20:10) Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt &amp; Shame</p><p>(01:30:40) Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin &amp; MDMA </p><p>(01:40:20) Social Media Addiction </p><p>(01:51:25) Narcissism </p><p>(01:53:30) Goal Seeking, Success &amp; Surprise</p><p>(01:58:10) Reciprocity</p><p>(02:01:15) Closing Comments, Resources</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>How to Control Your Sense of Pain &amp; Pleasure | Episode 32</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-control-your-sense-of-pain-and-pleasure/</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss our sense of pain and pleasure: where and how they each arise in our mind and body and various ways to control their intensity. I discuss the science of behavioral tools like acupuncture and hypnosis and directed pressure, including the neural circuits they each activate to modulate our experience of pain or pleasure. I also discuss whole body pain, pain "syndromes" and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine. I discuss neuroplasticity of the pain system and the key role that visual perception plays in pain modulation. Finally, I address the link between dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, with arousal, pleasure and pain. As always, both basic science and various protocols are described.
Note: The description of the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) was intentionally simplified and does not include mention of dorsal horn spinal relay neurons, etc. For an excellent full text review of this anatomy and circuits for touch sensing, please see: https://bit.ly/3jH9CPf

      <title>Dr. Matthew Walker: The Science &amp; Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep | Episode 31</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-matthew-walker-the-science-and-practice-of-perfecting-your-sleep/</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Matt Walker, Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology and the Founder &amp; Director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also the author of the international best-selling book Why We Sleep and the host of "The Matt Walker Podcast." We discuss the biology of sleep, including its various stages and what specifically happens to those stages when we don't get enough sleep. We also discuss the effects of sunlight, caffeine, alcohol, naps, hormones, exercise, marijuana, sexual activity, and various supplements on sleep. The episode consists of both basic science information and many science-supported actionable tools.

      <title>How to Optimize Your Brain-Body Function &amp; Health | Episode 30</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-optimize-your-brain-body-function-and-health/</link>
      <description>This episode I describe how the organs of the body influence the function and health of our brain and how our brain controls our bodily organs. The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception. I describe how two factors- mechanical forces (e.g., pressure, pain, volume, etc.) and chemical factors (e.g., gut acidity, microbiome diversity, etc.) combine to influence our moods, control inflammation, immune system, recovery from injury and more. I explain how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm, control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways. I describe 11 science-supported protocols for enhancing brain-body health and the logic behind them.

      <title>Maximizing Productivity, Physical &amp; Mental Health with Daily Tools | Episode 28</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/maximizing-productivity-physical-and-mental-health-with-daily-tools/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss science-supported tools for enhancing focus, learning, creativity, sleep, physical strength and endurance and brain and body health. I explain each protocol in detail, the rationale behind it, and how the protocol can be adjusted depending on individual needs.

      <title>The Science of Hearing, Balance &amp; Accelerated Learning | Episode 27</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-hearing-balance-and-accelerated-learning/</link>
      <description>This episode I describe how our ears and nervous system decode sound waves and gravity to allow us to hear and make sense of sounds. I also describe protocols for rapid learning of sound and other types of information. I discuss sound localization, doppler effects (sound motion), pitch perception and how we isolate sounds in noisy environments. I also review the scientific findings on binaural beats and white noise and how they can improve learning. Other topics and protocols include tinnitus, sea sickness, ear movement, ear growth and the science-supported ways we can all accelerate learning using "gap effects".

      <title>Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Understanding &amp; Healing the Mind | Episode 26</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/karl-deisseroth-understanding-and-healing-the-mind/</link>
      <description>Dr. Karl Deisseroth, MD, PhD, is a Clinical Psychiatrist and scientist who directs a bioengineering research laboratory at Stanford University School of Medicine. His work aims to understand and develop treatments for disorders of the mind such as depression, attention deficit disorders (ADHD &amp; ADD), autism, schizophrenia, anxiety, eating disorders, borderline personality and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We discuss his experience treating his patients and his laboratory’s mission to find and develop cures for mental disease and tools for probing how the brain works.

        <![CDATA[<p>Dr. Karl Deisseroth, MD, PhD, is a Clinical Psychiatrist and scientist who directs a bioengineering research laboratory at Stanford University School of Medicine. His work aims to understand and develop treatments for disorders of the mind such as depression, attention deficit disorders (ADHD &amp; ADD), autism, schizophrenia, anxiety, eating disorders, borderline personality and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We discuss his experience treating his patients and his laboratory’s mission to find and develop cures for mental disease and tools for probing how the brain works. </p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/karl-deisseroth-understanding-and-healing-the-mind/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Introduction</p><p>(00:07:41) Using Language to Understand the Mind</p><p>(00:12:19) Blood Tests For Mental Disease</p><p>(00:13:38) The Largest Challenges Facing Treatment of Mental Health</p><p>(00:20:21) Predicting Depression &amp; Suicide</p><p>(00:22:47) Drugs That Work for Brain Illness</p><p>(00:27:01) What Would A Cure For the Broken Mind Look Like?</p><p>(00:32:23) Channelopsins: Tools For Understanding &amp; Treating the Mind</p><p>(00:39:10) Curing Blindness with Channelopsins</p><p>(00:41:58) Why Karl Became a Scientist</p><p>(00:47:10) Vagus Nerve In Depression</p><p>(00:54:12) Challenges To Overcome for Treating Mental Illness with Channelopsins</p><p>(00:58:34) Using the Dialogue with Patients to Guide Treatment</p><p>(01:00:52) How Our Eyes Reveal Our Mental Health</p><p>(01:06:04) Controlling Structures Deep In the Brain</p><p>(01:08:23) The Most Effective Drugs Often Have the Most Side Effects</p><p>(01:09:50) Do Psychiatrists Take the Drugs They Prescribe</p><p>(01:14:15) Moving From Experimental Tools To Novel Treatments</p><p>(01:16:00) Brain-Machine Interfaces &amp; Neuralink</p><p>(01:19:30) ADHD &amp; Dr. Deissroth’s Approach To Focusing His Mind</p><p>(01:26:36) How Dr. Deisseroth Balances A Career In Medicine, Science &amp; Family</p><p>(01:35:41) New Ways of Exploring Brains: CLARITY</p><p>(01:38:49) What Is Special About the Human Brain?</p><p>(01:46:03) Psychedelics</p><p>(01:54:12) MDMA</p><p>(01:57:15) Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: A Story of Emotions”</p><p>(01:59:42) Connecting with Dr. Deisseroth on Twitter</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>How Smell, Taste &amp; Pheromone-Like Chemicals Control You | Episode 25</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-smell-taste-and-pheromone-like-chemicals-control-you/</link>
      <description>This episode explains how we sense chemicals through smell, taste, and pheromones. How things smell and taste and chemicals in the tears, breath, and on the skin of others have a profound effect on how we feel, what we do, and our hormones. I explain the 3 types of responses to smell, the 5 types of tastes, the possible existence of sixth taste sense, and how the act of sniffing can make us learn and focus better. I explain how smell and taste reflect brain health and can assess and even promote brain regeneration. I discuss how eating specific categories of foods makes us crave more of those foods, including how to make sour things taste sweet and develop a heightened sense of smell and taste.

      <title>The Science of Vision, Eye Health &amp; Seeing Better | Episode 24</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-vision-eye-health-and-seeing-better/</link>
      <description>This episode I describe how we see, meaning how our eyes focus, convert light information into electricity the rest of the brain can understand and how our brain creates the incredible thing we experience as “sight”. I also describe how we can train and support our visual system to improve at any age. I describe more than a dozen protocols to support depth perception, offset near-sightedness, improve mood, sleep, and our ability to focus (both visual focus and our mental focus generally). I also explain how to use eyesight to improve our levels of alertness and why visual hallucinations, lazy eyes and colorblindness occur. I also describe various compounds that may assist in supporting visual health and possibly improve our vision. Many simple, zero-cost protocols and a lot of scientific mechanisms are covered in this episode in clear language anyone can understand-- it is for anyone that values their brain and whether eyesight, young, adult-age or advanced age.

      <title>How To Build Endurance In Your Brain &amp; Body | Episode 23</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-build-endurance-in-your-brain-and-body/</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss endurance: our ability to perform effort over extended amounts of time. I describe the four kinds of endurance: muscular endurance, long duration (single-set) efforts, and the two kinds of high intensity interval training (HIIT). I discuss efficiency of effort and maximizing quality of effort, and a hydration formula. I review how our heart literally gets stronger when we oxygenate muscles properly. I also discuss motivation for long bouts of work and the visual physiological basis of the "extra gear" we all can leverage for effort. Finally, I review how accelerating as we fatigue can allow us to access untapped energetic resources.

        <![CDATA[<p>This episode I discuss endurance: our ability to perform effort over extended amounts of time. I describe the four kinds of endurance: muscular endurance, long duration (single-set) efforts, and the two kinds of high intensity interval training (HIIT). I discuss efficiency of effort and maximizing quality of effort, and a hydration formula. I review how our heart literally gets stronger when we oxygenate muscles properly. I also discuss motivation for long bouts of work and the visual physiological basis of the "extra gear" we all can leverage for effort. Finally, I review how accelerating as we fatigue can allow us to access untapped energetic resources.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors:</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-build-endurance-in-your-brain-and-body/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Science &amp; Tools For Muscle Growth, Increasing Strength &amp; Muscular Recovery | Episode 22</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/science-of-muscle-growth-increasing-strength-and-muscular-recovery/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I describe how our brain and nervous system control muscle tissue and how to leverage that for muscle maintenance, growth (hypertrophy) and recovery. I explain how neurons control muscle contractions and limb movements. I explain muscle metabolism and muscle fiber recruitment. I detail protocols for increasing muscular growth and for neuro-muscular recovery. I explain the effects of deliberate cold, anti-inflammatory agents, and anti-histamines on training progress. I describe science-supported protocols using certain weight load ranges, total sets per week, training intensity, frequency, and in-between set activities if one's goal is to increase muscle growth, strength or endurance. I review three foundational compounds and nutrients and three optimization compounds and nutrients that have been shown to improve neuro-muscular performance. Finally, I explain how to leverage exercise and weight training to enhance cognitive function.

      <title>How to Lose Fat with Science-Based Tools | Episode 21</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-lose-fat-with-science-based-tools/</link>
      <description>This episode I describe the science of fat loss, including how fat is mobilized and oxidized (burned) and how to increase fat burning by leveraging the nervous system. Most people don't realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation.

      <title>How to Learn Skills Faster | Episode 20</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-learn-skills-faster/</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss the science and practice of learning physical skills: what it involves at a biological level, and what to focus on during skill learning at each stage to maximize learning speed and depth. I also describe what to do immediately after a training session (note: this is different than the optimal protocol for cognitive skill training) and as you progress to more advanced levels of performance. I also cover the science of skill-based visualization which does have benefits, but only if done correctly and at the correct times. I discuss auto-replay of skill learning in the brain during sleep and the value of adding in post-training ‘deliberately idle’ sessions. I cover how to immediately improve limb-range-of-motion by leveraging cerebellum function, error generation, optimal repetition numbers for learning and more. As always, scientific mechanism, peer-reviewed studies and science-based protocols are discussed.

      <itunes:summary>This episode I discuss the science and practice of learning physical skills: what it involves at a biological level, and what to focus on during skill learning at each stage to maximize learning speed and depth. I also describe what to do immediately after a training session (note: this is different than the optimal protocol for cognitive skill training) and as you progress to more advanced levels of performance. I also cover the science of skill-based visualization which does have benefits, but only if done correctly and at the correct times. I discuss auto-replay of skill learning in the brain during sleep and the value of adding in post-training ‘deliberately idle’ sessions. I cover how to immediately improve limb-range-of-motion by leveraging cerebellum function, error generation, optimal repetition numbers for learning and more. As always, scientific mechanism, peer-reviewed studies and science-based protocols are discussed.

      <title>Supercharge Exercise Performance &amp; Recovery with Cooling | Episode 19</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/supercharge-exercise-performance-and-recovery-with-cooling/</link>
      <description>This episode I explain the science of heating and cooling the body, a process called thermoregulation-- and how to apply that knowledge to significantly improve physical performance. I describe the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. I also describe how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous-- and the better alternatives. Finally, I discuss the temperature-effects of caffeine, alcohol and anti-inflammatory compounds. The information in this episode is focused on mechanisms and tools for increasing athletic or exercise performance.

      <title>Boost Your Energy &amp; Immune System with Cortisol &amp; Adrenaline | Episode 18</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-cortisol-and-adrenaline-to-boost-our-energy-and-immune-system/</link>
      <description>This episode I describe the biology of two essential hormones we all make: cortisol and adrenaline (also called epinephrine). Cortisol and adrenaline powerfully regulate our levels of energy, focus and immune system function. I describe various science-supported tools and practices to increase or decrease cortisol and/or adrenaline, depending on one's specific needs and goals. I also describe the biology of nootropics, and how cortisol and adrenaline can improve or degrade learning. Finally, I review the scientific data and tools for timing the release of these hormones to improve memory, energy and immune system function.

      <itunes:summary>This episode I describe the biology of two essential hormones we all make: cortisol and adrenaline (also called epinephrine). Cortisol and adrenaline powerfully regulate our levels of energy, focus and immune system function. I describe various science-supported tools and practices to increase or decrease cortisol and/or adrenaline, depending on one's specific needs and goals. I also describe the biology of nootropics, and how cortisol and adrenaline can improve or degrade learning. Finally, I review the scientific data and tools for timing the release of these hormones to improve memory, energy and immune system function.

      <title>How to Control Your Metabolism by Thyroid &amp; Growth Hormone | Episode 17</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-control-your-metabolism-by-thyroid-and-growth-hormone/</link>
      <description>This episode discusses metabolism and how our thyroid hormone and growth hormone control our metabolism. I also clarify that metabolism isn't just about burning energy, it’s about converting energy from different sources into fuels for building and repairing our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilizing energy from body fat storage. I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. I also describe the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides and other factors for changing levels of thyroid and growth hormone, and some of their risks. Throughout the episode, mechanisms and tools grounded in specific mechanisms are discussed.

      <title>How Hormones Control Hunger, Eating &amp; Satiety | Episode 16</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-our-hormones-control-our-hunger-eating-and-satiety/</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss how hormones from our gut, liver, pancreas and brain control our appetite-- and the specific tools we can use to adjust those hormones in order to achieve specific goals. I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering release of the hormone CCK, and more.
Note: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I mis-spoke when explaining POMC neurons. I said “P-M-O-C” but should have said “POMC”. Apologies. The name I gave for what POMC is, however, was correct: "proopiomelanocortin".

      <itunes:summary>This episode I discuss how hormones from our gut, liver, pancreas and brain control our appetite-- and the specific tools we can use to adjust those hormones in order to achieve specific goals. I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need.

      <title>How to Optimize Testosterone &amp; Estrogen | Episode 15</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-how-to-optimize-testosterone-and-estrogen/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss testosterone and estrogen hormones and how they impact the brain, body, and behavior after puberty. I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: "what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?"; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways, it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. We discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels by changing their binding to other proteins, raising them directly, or changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause.

I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-how-to-optimize-testosterone-and-estrogen/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><p>Timestamps</p><p>(00:00:00) Introduction</p><p>(00:05:50) Hormone Optimization</p><p>(00:07:00) Salutogenesis: A Powerful Way to Conceptualize Health</p><p>(00:10:03) Estrogen and Testosterone: Sources, Levels and Ratios</p><p>(00:15:46) The Power of Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence and Dopamine</p><p>(00:20:58) Testosterone and Libido Pre-Ovulation</p><p>(00:21:48) Estrogen and Sexual Receptivity; Libido In Males</p><p>(00:23:10) How Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence</p><p>(00:26:46) Testosterone and Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding</p><p>(00:27:30) DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects on Levels/Ratios</p><p>(00:28:45) Behaviors That Decrease Testosterone (and Cortisol): Parenting and Prolactin</p><p>(00:31:24) How Illness Impacts Testosterone and Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6</p><p>(00:33:20) How Exactly Do Behaviors Change Hormones?</p><p>(00:34:18) Pheromones: Miscarriage, Menstrual Cycles, Puberty Onset, and Mate Recognition</p><p>(00:43:33) Apnea: A Powerful Bi-Directional Influence On Estrogen and Testosterone</p><p>(00:47:44) Mouth vs. Nose Breathing and Hormone Levels: Effects Via Sleep and Direct Effects</p><p>(00:51:11) How Sleep Adjusts Cortisol/Testosterone and Cortisol/Estrogen Ratios</p><p>(00:53:49) 02:CO2 Ratios, Nasal Breathing During Exercise</p><p>(00:56:30) Light Viewing Patterns and Hormones: Dopamine, GnRH</p><p>(00:57:44) Spring Fever: Tyrosinase, Hair Color, Mating Frequency</p><p>(01:04:39) Specificity of Hormone Effects</p><p>(01:06:03) Temperature: Cold and Hot Gonads</p><p>(01:14:10) How To Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing</p><p>(01:21:42) Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First or Last?)

      <title>The Science of Sexual Development | Episode 14</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/biological-influences-on-sex-sex-differences-and-preferences/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss how hormones such as testosterone and estrogen and their derivatives impact the early development of the brain and body and their maturation. I review published data on environmental factors shown to powerfully alter hormone pathways in animals and humans and the effects of cannabis, alcohol and cell phones on testes, sperm, ovaries and hormones. I describe the predictable relationship between genes, beard growth and balding patterns, and the importance of estrogen for brain development in people of all chromosomal sexes. Finally, I discuss how the hormones we are exposed to in the womb shape the relative length of our finger digits, the sounds our ears make (yes you read that correctly), and how those correlate with people's self-reports of their sexual preferences. As always, basic information and tools are discussed.

      <title>The Science of Emotions &amp; Relationships | Episode 13</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-emotions-relationships/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the biology of emotions and moods in the context of relationships. I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shape our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I discuss the biology of emotions and moods in the context of relationships. I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shape our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-emotions-relationships/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Introduction</p><p>(00:05:10) Announcing New Cost-Free Resources: Captions, NSDR Link</p><p>(00:07:40) Emotions: Subjective Yet Tractable</p><p>(00:10:53) To Understand Your Emotions: Look At Infancy &amp; Puberty</p><p>(00:15:21) Your First Feeling Was Anxiety</p><p>(00:17:36) What Are “Healthy Emotions”?</p><p>(00:19:03) Digital Tool For Predicting Your Emotions: Mood Meter App</p><p>(00:21:08) The Architecture Of A Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions To Ask Yourself</p><p>(00:24:00) You Are An Infant: Bonds &amp; Predictions</p><p>(00:27:57) Attachment Style Hinges On How You Handle Disappointment</p><p>(00:32:40) “Glue Points” Of Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (&amp; Written)</p><p>(00:36:34) “Emotional Health”: Awareness of the Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic</p><p>(00:37:50) An Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias</p><p>(00:42:19) Getting Out Of Your Head: The Attentional Aperture</p><p>(00:46:59) Puberty: Biology &amp; Emotions On Deliberate Overdrive</p><p>(00:47:58) Bodyfat &amp; Puberty: The Leptin Connection</p><p>(00:50:34) Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage</p><p>(00:54:37) Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Of Puberty &amp; Performance Enhancing Agent</p><p>(00:58:26) Neuroplasticity Of Emotions: Becoming Specialists &amp; Testing Emotional Bonds</p><p>(01:00:25) Testing Driving Brain Circuits For Emotion: Dispersal</p><p>(01:07:48) Science-Based Recommendations for Adolescents and Teens: The Autonomy Buffet</p><p>(01:11:05) “Right-Brain Versus Left-Brain People”: Facts Versus Lies</p><p>(01:14:18) Left Brain = Language, Right Brain = Spatial Awareness</p><p>(01:16:15) How To Recognize “Right Brain Activity” In Speech: Prosody</p><p>(01:18:32) Oxytocin: The Molecule of Synchronizing States</p><p>(01:20:09) Mirror Neurons: Are Not For “Empathy”, Maybe For Predicting Behavior</p><p>(01:23:00) Promoting Trust &amp; Monogamy</p><p>(01:27:00) Ways To Increase Oxytocin</p><p>(01:28:34) Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy and Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities</p><p>(01:30:43) Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via the Body</p><p>(01:35:18) A Powerful Tool For Enhancing Range &amp; Depth of Emotional Experience</p><p>(01:30:43) MDMA and Other Psychedelic Compounds: Building A Framework</p><p>(01:38:54) Roundup, Various Forms of Support</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>How To Increase Motivation &amp; Drive | Episode 12</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-increase-motivation-and-drive/</link>
      <description>This episode explains the science of motivation and drive. I describe how dopamine-- a chemical we all make in our brain, underlies our desire for and pursuit of our goals, as well as our capacity to move and experience pleasure. I describe how we can leverage specific behaviors, reward schedules and dopamine-prolactin balance to help ensure we can maintain motivation and capacity for pleasure over the long term. I also discuss dopamine in the context of ADHD, craving and addiction, and some absolutely amazing results about specificity of drug effects based purely on belief.

      <title>How Foods and Nutrients Control Our Moods | Episode 11</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-foods-and-nutrients-control-our-moods/</link>
      <description>This episode explains the brain-body connections that allow the specific foods we eat to control our moods and motivation. I discuss the vagus nerve and its role in dopamine and serotonin release in the brain. I review Omega-3 fatty acids and the key role of the gut microbiome in supporting (or hindering) our mental and emotional states. Many actionable tools are reviewed and discussed related to fasting, ketogenic and plant-based diets, probiotics, fermented foods, fish oils, artificial sweeteners, specific supplements that promote dopamine and serotonin, and some remarkable behavioral (and belief) effects.

        <![CDATA[<p>This episode explains the brain-body connections that allow the specific foods we eat to control our moods and motivation. I discuss the vagus nerve and its role in dopamine and serotonin release in the brain. I review Omega-3 fatty acids and the key role of the gut microbiome in supporting (or hindering) our mental and emotional states. Many actionable tools are reviewed and discussed related to fasting, ketogenic and plant-based diets, probiotics, fermented foods, fish oils, artificial sweeteners, specific supplements that promote dopamine and serotonin, and some remarkable behavioral (and belief) effects.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/how-foods-and-nutrients-control-our-moods/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Introduction</p><p>(00:05:00) Emotions: Aligning Mind &amp; Body</p><p>(00:06:41) Nutrients, Neurochemicals and Mood</p><p>(00:08:39) Primitive Expressions and Actions</p><p>(00:12:30) The Vagus Nerve: Truth, Fiction, Function</p><p>(00:15:45) “Vagus Stimulation”: A Terrible Concept</p><p>(00:16:35) Polyvagal Theory</p><p>(00:18:27) Vagus Senses Many Things, &amp; Moves Our Organs</p><p>(00:19:35) Sugar Sensing Without Perception of Sweetness</p><p>(00:23:00) Eating-Induced Anxiety</p><p>(00:27:30) We Eat Until Our Brain Perceives “Amino Acid Threshold”</p><p>(00:29:45) Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown and Wanting More</p><p>(00:32:01) L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, &amp; Movement</p><p>(00:34:04) Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs of Abuse, Wellbutrin</p><p>(00:38:29) Serotonin: Gut, Brain, Satiety and Prozac</p><p>(00:43:38) Eating to Promote Dopamine (Daytime) &amp; Serotonin (Night Time)</p><p>(00:44:30) Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, &amp; Caution About Sleep Disruptions</p><p>(00:46:40) Examine.com An Amazing Cost-Free Resource with Links to Science Papers</p><p>(00:48:05) Mucuna Pruriens: The Dopamine Bean with a Serotonin Outer Shell</p><p>(00:51:00) Emotional Context and Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Are Made”</p><p>(00:54:55) Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, But Lacks Specificity</p><p>(00:56:45) Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil and Alleviating Depression</p><p>(01:01:00) Fish Oil as Antidepressant</p><p>(01:02:40) EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain</p><p>(01:07:24) Alternatives to Fish Oil to Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs</p><p>(01:09:05) L-Carnitine for Mood, Sperm and Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia, Migraine</p><p>(01:16:29) Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths &amp; the Tubes Within Us</p><p>(01:21:55) Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation</p><p>(01:25:20) Artificial Sweeteners &amp; the Gut Microbiome: NOT All Bad; It Depends!</p><p>(01:28:00) Ketogenic, Vegan, &amp; Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences</p><p>(01:33:20) Fasting-Based Depletion of Our Microbiome</p><p>(01:35:20) How Mindset Effects Our Responses to Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!</p><p>(01:38:30) How Mindset Controls Our Metabolism</p><p>(01:41:03) Closing Comments, Thanks, Support &amp; Resources</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Master Stress: Tools for Managing Stress &amp; Anxiety | Episode 10</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/tools-for-managing-stress-and-anxiety/</link>
      <description>This episode explains what stress is, and how it recruits our brain and body to react in specific ways. I describe the three main types of stress, and how two of them actually enhance the function of our immune system making us less vulnerable to infections. I review tools that allow us to control our stress in real-time, as well as tools to prevent long-term stress, burnout and stress-induced illness and anxiety. As always, we cover behavioral tools and supplements that can assist or hinder stress control.

      <title>Control Pain &amp; Heal Faster with Your Brain | Episode 9</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/control-pain-and-heal-faster-with-your-brain/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I describe the science of how and why pain arises in the body and brain, and how we can actively control our experience of pain. I discuss inflammation, stress, acupuncture, limb damage and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). I review protocols that leverage the lymphatic and nervous system to accelerate pain relief and healing in a variety of situations. Other topics discussed include how heat versus cold impacts neurons and wounds, red-light, sunlight, stem cells and more.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I describe the science of how and why pain arises in the body and brain, and how we can actively control our experience of pain. I discuss inflammation, stress, acupuncture, limb damage and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). I review protocols that leverage the lymphatic and nervous system to accelerate pain relief and healing in a variety of situations. Other topics discussed include how heat versus cold impacts neurons and wounds, red-light, sunlight, stem cells and more. </p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="hubermanlab.com/control-pain-and-heal-faster-with-your-brain/">hubermanlab.com</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Introduction/Avenues for Support</p><p>(00:04:58) Deliberate Unlearning</p><p>(00:06:43) Pain, Injury and Regeneration</p><p>(00:09:17) A System of Touch (Somatosensation)</p><p>(00:11:42) Pain and Injury are Dissociable</p><p>(00:15:19) Objective versus Subjective Control of Experience</p><p>(00:16:15) Plasticity of Perception</p><p>(00:16:41) Lack of Pain Is Self-Destructive; So Is Excessive Pain</p><p>(00:18:42) Homoculous, Ratonculous, Dogunculus</p><p>(00:19:05) “Sensitivity” explained</p><p>(00:21:30) Inflammation</p><p>(00:22:24) Phantom Limb Pain</p><p>(00:24:00) Top-down Relief of Pain by Vision</p><p>(00:26:41) From Deaf to Hearing Sounds</p><p>(00:28:10) Pain Is In The Mind &amp; Body</p><p>(00:29:44) Recovering Movement Faster After Injury</p><p>(00:35:00) Don’t Over Compensate</p><p>(00:37:34) Concussion, TBI &amp; Brain Ageing</p><p>(00:40:49) The Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance</p><p>(00:43:05) Body Position &amp; Angle During Sleep</p><p>(00:44:30) Types of Exercise For Restoring &amp; Maintaining Brain Health</p><p>(00:47:33) Ambulance Cells in The Brain</p><p>(00:49:20) True Pain Control by Belief and Context</p><p>(00:51:45) Romantic Love and Pain</p><p>(00:55:05) Dopaminergic Control of Pain</p><p>(00:57:15) Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment</p><p>(01:07:32) Vagus Activation and Autonomic Control of Pain</p><p>(01:08:30) Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead and DHT</p><p>(01:11:40) Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing</p><p>(01:14:53) Protocols For Accelerating Tissue Repair &amp; Managing Pain</p><p>(01:17:55) Ice Is Not Always Nice (For Pain and Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.</p><p>(01:22:02) Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight</p><p>(01:26:10) Glymphatics and Sleep</p><p>(01:26:29) Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds and Should Nots</p><p>(01:31:38) Young Blood: Actual Science</p><p>(01:35:44) Synthesis, Support &amp; Resources</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.blabacphoto.com/">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Optimize Your Brain with Science-based Tools | Episode 8</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/optimize-your-learning-and-creativity-with-science-based-tools/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I describe how to access focused learning bouts, creative states, and the underlying neural circuitry involved. I frame this in the context of our daily 24-hour cycle in order to make it practical, clear and precise about timing. I review the role of fasting, meal timing and specific types of nutrients for promoting certain states of mind. I also review various other tools and biological factors that directly or indirectly gate brain function and that we can control. I answer commonly asked questions about the science of psychedelics, binaural beats, and visualization. Thank you for your interest in science!

      <title>How to Learn Faster by Using Failures, Movement &amp; Balance | Episode 7</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-failures-movement-and-balance-to-learn-faster/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss how we can use specific types of behavior to change our brain, both for sake of learning the movements themselves and for allowing us to learn non-movement-based information as well. I describe the key role that errors play in triggering our brains to change and how the vestibular (balance) system can activate and amplify neuroplasticity. As always, I cover science and science-based practical tools. Thank you in advance for your questions and for your interest in science!

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I discuss how we can use specific types of behavior to change our brain, both for sake of learning the movements themselves and for allowing us to learn non-movement-based information as well. I describe the key role that errors play in triggering our brains to change and how the vestibular (balance) system can activate and amplify neuroplasticity. As always, I cover science and science-based practical tools.

      <title>How to Focus to Change Your Brain | Episode 6</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-focus-to-change-your-brain/</link>
      <description>This episode introduces neuroplasticity—which is how our brain and nervous system learn and acquire new capabilities. I describe the differences between childhood and adult neuroplasticity, the chemicals involved and how anyone can increase their rate and depth of learning by leveraging the science of focus. I describe specific tools for increasing focus and learning. The next two episodes will cover the ideal protocols for specific types of learning and how to make learning new information more reflexive.

      <title>Understanding and Using Dreams to Learn and to Forget | Episode 5</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/understanding-and-using-dreams-to-learn-and-to-forget/</link>
      <description>This episode is all about the two major kinds of dreams and the sorts of learning and unlearning they are used for. I discuss REM-associated dreams that control emotional learning and their similarity to various trauma treatments such as ketamine and EMDR. I also discuss Non-REM dreams and their role in motor learning and learning of detailed, non-emotionally-laden information. I relate this to science-backed tools for accessing more of the types of sleep and learning people may want. Other topics are listed in the time stamps below.

      <title>Find Your "Temperature Minimum" to Defeat Jetlag, Shift Work &amp; Sleeplessness | Episode 4</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/find-your-temperature-minimum-to-defeat-jetlag-shift-work-and-sleeplessness/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss a simple and reliable measurement called your "temperature minimum" that you can use to rapidly adjust to new time zones when traveling and to offset the bad effects of nocturnal shift work. I also discuss tools for adjusting sleep and waking rhythms in babies, teens, new parents and the elderly.

      <title>How Your Brain Works &amp; Changes | Episode 1</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-your-nervous-system-works-and-changes/</link>
      <description>Today’s episode provides an introduction to how the nervous system works to create sensations, perceptions, emotions, thoughts and behaviors, as well as how we can change our nervous system— a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity. The information sets the stage for all Huberman Lab Podcast episodes that follow by covering neurons, synapses, brain chemicals and the rhythms that control our ability to focus, learn and sleep… and more. Thank you for your interest in science. We'll see you next week!
