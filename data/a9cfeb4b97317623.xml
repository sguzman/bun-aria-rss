			<description><![CDATA[<p>Some little girls dream of meeting a Care Bear or Barbie doll growing up, but not Bunnie. She dreamt of hanging out with today's guest - the bad ass legend, Air Force Amy. You don't really know Las Vegas until you know Amy, so Bunnie starts with how she went from serving in the Air Force to being a living legend in the industry and the top all-time earner at the Bunny Ranch. She and Amy also talk about the history of legal brothels, how her work has been affected during the pandemic, and the changing landscape of the industry to feature more collaboration than competition between girls. Amy also gives us a sneak peek into what we can expect from her tell-out book, out soon. </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bunnie:</strong> <a href="http://www.dumbblondeunrated.com">www.dumbblondeunrated.com</a></span></p> <p><strong>Air Force Amy: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/theairforceamy/?hl=en">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://onlyfans.com/airforceamy">OnlyFans </a> | <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQuic3pPFTTs8kbM4v5JPOw">YouTube</a> </strong></p> <div class="gmail_default"><a href= "https://chickenranchbrothel.com/">The Chicken Ranch </a></div> <div class="gmail_default"><a href="https://redrooster.vegas/">The Red Rooster</a></div> <div class="gmail_default"> </div> <ul> <li class="gmail_default">"What is too sexual to you?

She dreamt of hanging out with today's guest - the bad ass legend, Air Force Amy. You don't really know Las Vegas until you know Amy, so Bunnie starts with how she went from serving in the Air Force to being a living legend in the industry and the top all-time earner at the Bunny Ranch. She and Amy also talk about the history of legal brothels, how her work has been affected during the pandemic, and the changing landscape of the industry to feature more collaboration than competition between girls. Amy also gives us a sneak peek into what we can expect from her tell-out book, out soon. </p> <p>Bunnie: <a href="http://www.dumbblondeunrated.com">www.dumbblondeunrated.com</a></p> <p>Air Force Amy: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/theairforceamy/?hl=en">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://onlyfans.com/airforceamy">OnlyFans </a> | <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQuic3pPFTTs8kbM4v5JPOw">YouTube</a> </p> <a href= "https://chickenranchbrothel.com/">The Chicken Ranch </a> <a href="https://redrooster.vegas/">The Red Rooster</a>   <ul> <li class="gmail_default">"What is too sexual to you?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In Part 2 of the Girl Talk episode, Bunnie, Bugg, and Meme answer fan questions and talk about some of their most embarrassing moments. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong><strong> </strong></p> <ul> <li>“Most embarrassing losing your v card but couldn’t feel it; small equipment” <ul> <li>Bunnie knows how that goes! She popped her own cherry her first time</li> </ul> </li> <li>“I left my baby dad and he wanted me back so bad that he’d pay me to f*ck him” <ul> <li>The girls say make him! If you want him back, take him back, if not, take his money</li> </ul> </li> <li>“My girlfriend thinks if a girl likes or comments on my IG pictures, she wants me” <ul> <li>tough one; it’s a respect thing if you’re in a relationship. There’s nothing wrong with people finding you or your significant other attractive but be mindful of how your actions can make your partner feel.  If it’s that big of a deal, communication is key to finding a solution.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“I got so drunk, I forgot to take out the tampon and I got so embarrassed” <ul> <li>Bunnie forgot to take hers out one time during a really drunk night. Two weeks later it came out by itself. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“How many guys have you slept with?” <ul> <li>Never ask a girl her body count. If you do and she tells you, multiply that number by 10.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Found out me and my girl lost our baby last week, please send us positive vibes” <ul> <li>That’s so sad, The girls send their condolences</li> </ul> </li> <li>“My girlfriend decided we shouldn’t have sex anymore until we are married” <ul> <li>She’s worth it! If you really love3 her, you can wait!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“After diarrhea I clean myself so good; I love it licked, its relieving. It’s embarrassing and gross- it’s so embarrassing I shouldn’t have shared”</li> <li>“I choked on my boyfriend’s c*ck ring and threw up over the side of the bed” <ul> <li>Bunnie got a black eye one time from one of her ex’s rings.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Do you believe everyone has a soulmate?” <ul> <li>Absolutely! It doesn’t have to be a sexual partner; it can be a best friend or a mother or anyone!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“How is your love life with Jelly when you’re having sex with other people and doing porn?” <ul> <li>Bunnie and Jelly have a great relationship. She thinks it’d funny when people judge her relationship without even understanding it. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“My mom walked in on me losing my virginity in high school” <ul> <li>That must have been awkward. Bunnie and Meme would whoop their kids if they found them having sex.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Have threesomes ever opened bad doors in your relationships? How do you balance trust, a spicy love life, and yalls busy schedule?” <ul> <li>Bunnie comes from a different side of the world where threesomes are more accepted. Jelly would never let a girl disrespect Bunnie and go behind her back with him.  Threesomes can actually make you a lot closer. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Quotes:</strong></p> <ul> <li>“Yeah that’s my story, and I’m sticking to it” – Bunnie</li> <li>“Okay…yeah…okay….” – Meme</li> <li>“They make wipes for it though…” – Bugg</li> <li>“Stick that in your pipe and smoke it, Matt” – Bunnie</li> <li>“Post Traumatic Sex Disorder, that’s hilarious!” – Bunnie</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p> <p>Check out Bunnie</p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/xomgitsbunnie/?hl=en">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bunniexo/">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/omgitsbunnie?lang=en">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href="https://onlyfans.com/omgitsbunnie">OnlyFans</a></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong> </strong></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>From relationship advice to funny fan stories, Bunnie, her cousin Bugg, and Manager Meme hang out and dive into more questions from fans.   </p> <p>    </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Meme and her hubby Jason experienced their own embarrassing sex story while they were out of town on vacation. <ul> <li>Jason accidentally ripped while they were going at it and blood went everywhere. They had to go to the ER in a random city on the first day of their vacation.</li> <li>Jason was joking about the entire thing</li> </ul> </li> <li>Fan Q&A: <ul> <li>“How do I get my ex-wife of a 16-year marriage out of my head?” <ul> <li>That’s totally normal- you are going to have memories and feelings for a while. Bunnie says for every year you are with someone it takes just as long to get over them.  It also depends on why you broke up.  Meme says find the closure that you’re looking for; that might be the key to finally letting go. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“Don’t be afraid of public sex. Don’t be dumb about it- but it’s my favorite and so much hotter.” <ul> <li>Bunnie loves it! Switching up where you are having sex is an exciting way to spice up your sex life.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“I was giving a guy I had just met online a hand job in the Walmart parking lot, and I got caught.” <ul> <li>Meme and Jason’s first kiss was in the Walmart parking lot. Bunnie has lots of questions about why the Walmart parking lot- but it sounds like fun!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Not really my story but when my sister and I were younger we shared a room as teens. Grandma told me to go tell my sister dinner was ready and I walked in on her playing with a dildo in mid orgasm.  Went back out to the dinner table and Grandma asked, ‘Is she coming yet?’ and I busted out laughing and now everyone in my family knows.   No one will let my sister live that down; when Grandma was alive it was her favorite story to tell.” <ul> <li>Great story; Bunnie, Bugg, and Meme definitely got a few laughs out of that one!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Have you ever coughed when you’re sick and sharted? I did at work.”</li> <li>“I once got so into my man licking and sucking on my kitty cat, that I let out a loud, smelly fart in his face.” <ul> <li>We’ve all been there. Jelly won’t let Bunnie live it down that she did it to him years ago.  Bunnie can’t ever hold anything against Jelly because he has no shame. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“I had a one-night stand with a guy in the house, and I was filming a reality show and I kicked him out and didn’t realize I got period blood all over his shirt, but I was like ‘boy bye!’” <ul> <li>We want to know what reality show it was!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“My husband of six years cheated. I have tried to forgive him, please any advice to help?” <ul> <li>Meme has never taken anyone back after cheating. Bugg says you can’t forgive till you forget- and you might never truly forget.  Bunnie says it takes a lot of strength, your husband needs to be constantly reassuring you and be patient with you in the process of forgiveness.  You have to hurt, heal, and get over it if you truly want to grow together and evolve.  Everyone deserves a second chance and if you are willing to work on it together, it’s worth trying to fix.  But if there are other toxic traits in the relationship, don’t hurt yourself trying to fix it. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“When I was 21 and got really drunk at a bar, I ended up hooking up with a 48-year-old; she was a 48-year-old Grandma. We went back to her apartment and did it.  Then afterwards, I went to take a shower in her bathroom and used some Old Spice.  The Old Spice was her boyfriends. And when I went to put clothes on she was asleep, so I just left and went home.” <ul> <li>Kudos to her for getting with your young ass!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Would you have a threesome with you, J, and Felicia?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From relationship advice to funny fan stories, Bunnie, her cousin Bugg, and Manager Meme hang out and dive into more questions from fans.   </p> <p>    </p> <p>Takeaways:</p> <ul> <li>Meme and her hubby Jason experienced their own embarrassing sex story while they were out of town on vacation. <ul> <li>Jason accidentally ripped while they were going at it and blood went everywhere. They had to go to the ER in a random city on the first day of their vacation.</li> <li>Jason was joking about the entire thing</li> </ul> </li> <li>Fan Q&A: <ul> <li>“How do I get my ex-wife of a 16-year marriage out of my head?” <ul> <li>That’s totally normal- you are going to have memories and feelings for a while. Bunnie says for every year you are with someone it takes just as long to get over them.  It also depends on why you broke up.  Meme says find the closure that you’re looking for; that might be the key to finally letting go. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“Don’t be afraid of public sex. Don’t be dumb about it- but it’s my favorite and so much hotter.” <ul> <li>Bunnie loves it! Switching up where you are having sex is an exciting way to spice up your sex life.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“I was giving a guy I had just met online a hand job in the Walmart parking lot, and I got caught.” <ul> <li>Meme and Jason’s first kiss was in the Walmart parking lot. Bunnie has lots of questions about why the Walmart parking lot- but it sounds like fun!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Not really my story but when my sister and I were younger we shared a room as teens. Grandma told me to go tell my sister dinner was ready and I walked in on her playing with a dildo in mid orgasm.  Went back out to the dinner table and Grandma asked, ‘Is she coming yet?’ and I busted out laughing and now everyone in my family knows.   No one will let my sister live that down; when Grandma was alive it was her favorite story to tell.” <ul> <li>Great story; Bunnie, Bugg, and Meme definitely got a few laughs out of that one!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Have you ever coughed when you’re sick and sharted? I did at work.”</li> <li>“I once got so into my man licking and sucking on my kitty cat, that I let out a loud, smelly fart in his face.” <ul> <li>We’ve all been there. Jelly won’t let Bunnie live it down that she did it to him years ago.  Bunnie can’t ever hold anything against Jelly because he has no shame. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“I had a one-night stand with a guy in the house, and I was filming a reality show and I kicked him out and didn’t realize I got period blood all over his shirt, but I was like ‘boy bye!’” <ul> <li>We want to know what reality show it was!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“My husband of six years cheated. I have tried to forgive him, please any advice to help?” <ul> <li>Meme has never taken anyone back after cheating. Bugg says you can’t forgive till you forget- and you might never truly forget.  Bunnie says it takes a lot of strength, your husband needs to be constantly reassuring you and be patient with you in the process of forgiveness.  You have to hurt, heal, and get over it if you truly want to grow together and evolve.  Everyone deserves a second chance and if you are willing to work on it together, it’s worth trying to fix.  But if there are other toxic traits in the relationship, don’t hurt yourself trying to fix it. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“When I was 21 and got really drunk at a bar, I ended up hooking up with a 48-year-old; she was a 48-year-old Grandma. We went back to her apartment and did it.  Then afterwards, I went to take a shower in her bathroom and used some Old Spice.  The Old Spice was her boyfriends. And when I went to put clothes on she was asleep, so I just left and went home.” <ul> <li>Kudos to her for getting with your young ass!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Would you have a threesome with you, J, and Felicia? Yes or hell no?” <ul> <li>Bunnie totally would, they’ve made out before. J probably wouldn’t just because they have too much history together. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“Puked during drunk sex, then continued to go at it after the fact. Dude said it felt good.”</li> <li>“What’s the wildest place you’ve ever had sex in public?” <ul> <li>Bunnie’s was an orthodontist chair. You can get really good angles in them.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“What helps with your anxiety and depression?” <ul> <li>L’methylfolate, vitamin D, magnesium. St. John’s Wort, and SAM-e.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jelly Roll talks about his new song “Save Me” and his newest album that is in production.  Bunnie and Jelly answer questions from fans. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Jelly's new song “Save Me” was written in just a few hours on a Sunday afternoon. That Monday, they shot the video for it. </li> <li>The song hit 1 million views on Father’s Day on YouTube, in just four days. It also hit 2 million in less than a week on Facebook, and so far, has 100,000+ views on Twitter and Instagram.      </li> <li>On last week’s episode, Felicia, Jelly’s Baby mama, spoke out about her struggle with addiction. Jelly is so happy to see her sober and back in Bailee’s life.   </li> <li>Jelly is currently working on a new album. He has been writing constantly and now wants to let the album breathe and find a good balance.   </li> <li>Artists want to feel free to do what they want to do, and Jelly feels so blessed that his fan base allows him to have that creative freedom. </li> <li>Bunnie and Jelly answer more fan questions: <ul> <li>“What do you think a big turn off in the bedroom is?” <ul> <li>Smells- anything that doesn’t smell appealing</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Is Jelly still playing in NOLA on the 10th?” <ul> <li>Every show that has been booked and is still not cancelled is due to the fact that the state hasn’t cancelled it. Jelly and his team have never cancelled a show on this run.  A lot of the venues want to cancel but are waiting for the official word from the government. </li> <li>Jelly promises to put out more music this year than the last three years combined.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“What is your favorite scary movie?” <ul> <li>Jelly loves all the classic scary movies; The Halloween movies, Friday the 13th, etc.</li> <li>Bunnie likes the Devil’s Rejects</li> <li>Their favorite show is American Horror Story</li> </ul> </li> <li>“What’s up with Noah?” <ul> <li>Noah’s mother wants him to have a private life, and Jelly respects that. They love him very much.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“How do you spend the first hour of your morning to get ready for your day?” <ul> <li>Bunnie is a workaholic and she wants to get better at taking time for herself. Jelly sits at the kitchen table and will drink up to a half gallon of water to try to get his body ready for the day.  Bunnie is a slow riser in the morning, while Jelly likes to get up right away. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“How do you feel about women subscribing to your OnlyFans?” <ul> <li>Bunnie thinks it’s great! Sometimes the mass DM’s she sends out are geared more towards men, but she loves that women subscribe as well!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“What pick up line did you use to get Bunnie?” <ul> <li>Jelly didn’t use a pickup line at all. Bunnie and Jelly met at a show and they smoked a joint with some random girls and a friend of Bunnie’s.  Bunnie sensed that Jelly was sad and mad a lot, and she wanted to help fix him. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“Have you guys ever had to go to marriage counseling? Any tips on getting your partner to listen?” <ul> <li>Getting someone to listen is hard, if someone doesn’t truly comprehend what you’re trying to say, they’ll never get it- but that’s where counseling can help. Find a counselor together and don’t be afraid to see several before you settle on one. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“Jelly, will you get ordained and marry me and my future husband?” <ul> <li>Jelly is all about love- he’s totally down.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“How can I make myself enjoy anal a little more for my hubby? He loves it but it hurts me sometimes. Does Jelly like it?” <ul> <li>Jelly isn’t into it and Bunnie doesn’t find it enjoyable.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“My girlfriend wants to have a threesome and her bff wants to be in it, but her bff is like my little sister. What do I do?” <ul> <li>Jelly and Bunnie have brought a few of Bunnie’s friends into the bedroom. They enjoy it and it has always worked out better that way. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“Do you (Jelly) only get your dick sucked or do you fuck people?” <ul> <li>They’ve done both. They’ve even had a foursome before. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“When are you going to feature Bailee again?” <ul> <li>On Jelly’s next album</li> </ul> </li> <li>“When are you guys gonna make a porn on PornHub?” <ul> <li>PornHub doesn’t pay enough but check out Bunnie’s Only Fans for exclusive content!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“What’s your favorite physical feature of J and vice versa?” <ul> <li>Bunnie’s favorite feature on Jelly is his face. Jelly’s favorite feature on Bunnie is either her face or midriff. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“What are you and your family going to be for Halloween this year?” <ul> <li>They haven’t decided yet but they love Halloween- Jelly likes the gory costumes and specifically loves clowns.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“I want to know if Bunnie used that pocket pussy on Jelly yet” <ul> <li>They used it just the other night!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“How tall is Jelly Roll?” <ul> <li>About 6’ 1”</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Quotes:</strong><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>“</strong>If I had a big dick I‘d walk around with just a sock on my cock and flip flops…” - Jelly Roll</p> <p>“What’s better than having two girls to smoke a joint with?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bunnie and Manager Meme share embarrassing sex stories from their own lives as well as hilarious stories from fans for a much-needed laugh amidst the craziness of 2020.        </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Olivia walked in on Meme and her mans, they told her they were folding laundry</li> <li>Bunnie unintentionally circumcised someone during sex and he had to go the hospital</li> <li>Sex stories from fans: <ul> <li>A fan had a guy eat her out during sex and she thought her period was over until they guy pulled away and she saw a big blood clot in his beard. She never said anything to him, and they never spoke about it</li> <li>A fan and her ex-boyfriend, nick-named Ginger-Dick, were driving up to the hills to have sex near a boulder. When the deed was done, they talked about how it was fun while it lasted even though it was quick.  From about 8 feet away, someone laughed and said, “yeah, while it lasted”.  Apparently, a couple on the other side of the boulder witnessed the one-minute magic.  </li> <li>About five years ago, a fan and her boyfriend and now baby daddy tried out anal sex. When he was about to finish, she turned around and opened her mouth, and realized there were chunks going into her mouth.  She ran to the bathroom and immediately starting puking.  Luckily her boyfriend thought it was hilarious, and now they have a running joke about chili dogs. </li> <li>A drunken night with a friend from school led one fan to accidentally shit while they were getting it on. When she came back to the room, he said “You made a mess, punk.”  And she replied, “well you fucked the shit out of me”.   </li> <li>“I smashed my ex with a strap-on and when I pulled out, he sprayed shit on me”.</li> <li>“I queefed so loud he asked me if I could hear the neighbors farting”. You can’t help it when you queef, but it is hilarious.</li> <li>“I sucked some dude’s dick and the way it tasted just made me sick. I had to call quits for real.”</li> <li>“My man is the biggest I’ve had, and I’ve been throwing up during oral. It goes down way too far.”  According to manager Meme, grab your thumb and it might help keep the gag reflex at bay.  They also have throat spray you can use, or just get drunk!</li> <li>A fan was having drunk sex with a girl and she poured a shot of vodka on his dick and it started to burn. When he stood up quickly, she accidentally knocked a shot of tequila into his eye.  Bunnie’s pro tip: don’t juggle drinks while getting the nookie on- put the drinks down! When you’re drunk you get nasty: Bunnie started a fetish for herself when she drunkenly poured a bottle of baby oil on herself once, now she loves oiled up porn.   </li> <li>“I screamed another dude’s name out while getting the shit fucked out of me.” If you aren’t good at names, just call everyone baby so you don’t get mixed up. </li> <li>A fan was feeling gassy after eating Mexican food. After waiting a few months to have sex, they finally went for it, but she was bloated and when he flipped her over and put her legs above her head, she farted for 15 solid seconds.  She put her face in her hands and he started dying laughing and comforted her saying “shit happens”.</li> <li>After having a crush on a skater boy she went to middle school with, one fan finally hooked up with her crush. She didn’t realize she had started her period and they made a mess.  She didn’t see him until years later at a WICCA appointment.  He was there with his baby mama he kept looking at her like “I know who you are…” but never said anything.    </li> <li>A fan and an old fuck buddy parked on the side of the road at a dead end to get it on. They saw headlights approaching but thought nothing of it and kept on getting it on.  Two minutes later, a spotlight was shining in the car and up walked 3 cops, and she was butt ass naked, sitting on his dick, and the car smelled like straight sex.  They made them get out of the car and she was standing on the side of the road with nothing, but his daughter’s Frozen blanket wrapped around her.  The officers gave them a verbal warning and let them go. </li> <li>After her first time trying anal, this fan found discovered how hard it is to get the cum out of her ass. “Felt like I was pissing warm yogurt out of my ass and sounded like I was blowing up the bathroom.”</li> <li>After things got hot and heavy with this fan and a guy she was about to hook up with, she reached for his dick and it was only about as big as her thumb. She immediately texted her best friend to have her call her crying and ask to be picked up so she could find a way to politely bail her out of the awkward situation.  When her friend called, she politely declined the guy’s generous offer to drive her and waited for him to leave.  When he left she felt bad, but at least she spared his feelings!   </li> <li>“I was making out with this guy once and all of the sudden my legs get wet. Well, come to find out, he came on me.”  Bunnie said at first, she would have felt like “that bitch” but then she would have been pissed.  Let’s be real, most guys can’t get it up again for a while after they finish. </li> <li>“I took too many Percocet’s before a BBW was riding me cowgirl, she damn near broke my dick.”</li> <li>“I fucked in my car in a Walmart parking lot for my third time.” Get in where you fit in baby!</li> <li>“I took acid and the girl I was banging had large tits. I thought they were tentacles and I freaked out.”</li> <li>A fan wrote in that once when she didn’t have any toys, so she used a jar of pickles. She popped a condom on a pickle and went to town.  The condom burst and she had to squeeze the pickle out. </li> <li>“I was doing the stripper heel click with my legs in the air and farted…he’s now my husband.” These guys don’t care, they’ll take it how they can get it!</li> <li>The nastier you are, the more you’re gonna get wifed up!</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Quotes:</strong></p> <p>“Why is there so much blood involved with sex?!”- Meme</p> <p>“Gingers have no souls: we love gingers” – Bunnie</p> <p>“That’s an ATM baby, Ass To Mouth!” – Bunnie</p> <p>“That will open up the ole gaper”- Bunnie</p> <p>“You fart cum bubbles for like a week afterwards”- Bunnie</p> <p>“Where was the nose?!” – Bunnie</p> <p>“Bitches love cucumbers in the puss” - Bunnie</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p> <p>Sponsored by: Adam and Eve</p> <p><a href="https://www.adameve.com">Adam and Eve Official Website</a></p> <p><em>Use the Code BUNNIE for 50% off!</em></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Check Out Bunnie:</strong></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/xomgitsbunnie/?hl=en">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bunniexo/">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/omgitsbunnie?lang=en">Twitter</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bunnie and her favorite quarantine co-host in crime, Jelly, are joined this week by rapper and lyrical assassin Christian Webster, better known as Chris Webby. He and Jelly bond over their love of touring and the fans, and he shares how he is staying sane and creative while being at home.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webby also talks about why getting arrested helped propel his career, what it’s like being a rapper in the current age, and why he will never get tired of watching The Sopranos.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimate rock goddess Jackie LaPonza grew up with music in the home, and her gritty voice and beautiful looks are just a few of the reasons why people go crazy for her band Unsaid Fate.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackie joins Bunnie this week to talk about how she went from singing in bars at 10 years old to rock and roll stardom both with Unsaid Fate and her husband Skinny’s band Mushroomhead. Jackie talks about her musical influences, how she and Skinny met and fell in love, and why she’s perfect for the craziness that comes with life on tour. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"> Jackie has music in her blood and grew up immersed in the rock and roll scene. Her dad was a famous drummer who played with many legends such as Chuck Berry and Blue Oyster Cult. She was used to having music around her at all times, and it was no big deal to have future stars like Trent Reznor just hanging around her house. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Jackie is the lead vocalist of Unsaid Fate and also lends guest vocals to her husband’s band, Mushroomhead. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she is a total show stealer with her beauty and magnetism, Jackie always wants to give credit to the whole band. It’s a “we” instead of “me” operation, and she even outgrew the band featuring her own name to go with Unsaid Fate. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Jackie has been playing bars since she was 10 years old, and was gigging and rocking out on stage while other kids her age were at birthday parties. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Unsaid Fate mixes hard rock, metal, active rock, and some pop in a way that resonates with fans of all ages. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Jackie’s fiance Skinny is the founder and leader of Mushroomhead. He proposed 30 days into dating Jackie, and 16 years later they are still taking on the world together. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Jackie is built for the crazy life that comes along with touring thanks to sharing a home with 5 stinky brothers in tight quarters. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be new albums coming out soon for both UnSaid Fate and Mushroomhead, so hang tight. </span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Quotes: </strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you have a dream, follow your dream. Otherwise, you are going to be miserable.” </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I fit in so well because I grew up the same way as tour life on a bus.

Jackie talks about her musical influences, how she and Skinny met and fell in love, and why she’s perfect for the craziness that comes with life on tour. </p> <p> </p> <p>Takeaways:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"> Jackie has music in her blood and grew up immersed in the rock and roll scene. Her dad was a famous drummer who played with many legends such as Chuck Berry and Blue Oyster Cult. She was used to having music around her at all times, and it was no big deal to have future stars like Trent Reznor just hanging around her house. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Jackie is the lead vocalist of Unsaid Fate and also lends guest vocals to her husband’s band, Mushroomhead. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she is a total show stealer with her beauty and magnetism, Jackie always wants to give credit to the whole band. It’s a “we” instead of “me” operation, and she even outgrew the band featuring her own name to go with Unsaid Fate. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Jackie has been playing bars since she was 10 years old, and was gigging and rocking out on stage while other kids her age were at birthday parties. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Unsaid Fate mixes hard rock, metal, active rock, and some pop in a way that resonates with fans of all ages. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Jackie’s fiance Skinny is the founder and leader of Mushroomhead. He proposed 30 days into dating Jackie, and 16 years later they are still taking on the world together. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Jackie is built for the crazy life that comes along with touring thanks to sharing a home with 5 stinky brothers in tight quarters. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">There will be new albums coming out soon for both UnSaid Fate and Mushroomhead, so hang tight. </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Quotes: </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">“If you have a dream, follow your dream. Otherwise, you are going to be miserable.” </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">“I fit in so well because I grew up the same way as tour life on a bus. There are 14 of us and a dog on a bus, at all times.” </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">“Jelly and I didn’t have a big wedding, we literally eloped by a lady that looked like f*ckin ET in Vegas in a little white chapel, and I’m cool with that.” </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Mentioned: </p> <p>Jackie LaPonza: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/jackielaponza/?hl=en">Instagram</a> | <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/jackielaponzausf/">Facebook</a> | <a href= "https://twitter.com/JackieLaPonza">Twitter </a></p> <p>Unsaid Fate: <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/unsaidfate/">Facebook</a> | <a href= "https://twitter.com/unsaidfate">Twitter</a> | <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/unsaidfate/?hl=en">Instagram</a> | <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqVL35u7Q-E&feature=youtu.be"> YouTube</a></p> <p>Mushroomhead: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/mushroomheadofficial/?hl=en"> Instagram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/mushroomhead">Twitter </a></p> <p><a href="https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/">Cleveland Browns </a></p> <p> </p> <p>Check out Bunnie: </p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/xomgitsbunnie/?hl=en">@xomgitsbunnie</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/bunniexo">BunnieXo </a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/officialdumbblonde/">@officialdumbblonde</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does trainer and fitness model Whitney Johns have one of the best bodies in real life and on the socials, but she is a super smart and down to earth business badass. Bunnie and Whitney talk about how her app Fit With Whit is helping people at home now more than ever, a few of her health and fitness tips, what it was like to be a professional bodybuilder, and what she really eats in a day. Then, Whit and Bunnie play a hilarious game of ‘Would You Rather’. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"> Whitney grew up in Idaho in a Mormon family. She eventually broke away from religion, but her upbringing in Idaho gave her the background to be a hard worker and salt of the earth kinda gal. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Whitney has always been into working out and fitness, but found that nutrition and gut health is the most important foundation to true health and well being. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Looking to get in shape and get that quarantine body under control? Whitney’s app Fit With Whit helps people at all levels of health and fitness. She provides home workouts, subscription based plans, and nutrition and meal plan guidelines. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Bunnie, Whitney takes a holistic approach to health. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Whitney competed as a professional bodybuilder, and now adds it to the list of badass athletic accomplishments along with MMA and kickboxing. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spread about Whitney in</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Muscle and Fitness</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">magazine not only featured her incredibly amazing body, but gave a detailed background into her whole journey and what makes her so special and unique. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Whitney’s single, but too real and salt of the earth for the fake dating of LA. Maybe Bunnie will hook her up with some Nashville dudes when she comes to visit. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can do just one cheat meal instead of a cheat day or week, you will fulfill those cravings without derailing your whole diet. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Whitney eats more paleo style because that’s how she feels good and goes by the 80/20 rule with veggies, lean protein, and healthy fats. </span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Quotes: </strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"> “I have friends, but I walk my own path a little bit.” — Whitney</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">“Don’t you enjoy taking people by surprise?” — Whitney </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are all just trying to figure out this thing called life.” — Bunnie </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the morning, I’m not trying to swallow your kids before breakfast.” — Bunnie </span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Mentioned: </strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitney Johns:</span> <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/whitneyjohns/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">|</span> <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/TrainForIt.whitneyjohns/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">|</span> <a href= "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fit-with-whit/id1305091999"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fit With Whit App </span></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.nasm.org/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">NASM Certification </span></a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/girls/whitney-johns-abs-discipline-and-getting-hit-gym/"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muscle and Fitness Magazine </span></em></a></p> <p><a href="https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Coffee Meets Bagel </span></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0838283/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Step Brothers</span></a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/tommyvext/?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> @tommyvext </span></a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/official_axlrose"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> @axlrose</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Check out Bunnie: </strong></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/xomgitsbunnie/?hl=en"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">@xomgitsbunnie</span></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/bunniexo"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">BunnieXo </span></a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/officialdumbblonde/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">@officialdumbblonde</span></a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Bunnie and her gal FeFe King talk about all the hilarious and brilliant ways they are staying somewhat sane during this zombie apocalypse. They share their top five tips to get out of the Quarantine funk and into looking hotter, more fit, and tan than ever before. Then, Bunnie shares how much she made on OnlyFans in the first week alone, and FeFe gets a surprise guest appearance from her shoeless husband Al. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <div style="margin-left: 2em"> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to fight about the most ridiculous things when you are a couple in quarantine. For Bunnie and Daddy it’s just about a simple drinking cup, where FeFe and Al got into it over the TV remote. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">FeFe’s quarantine life hacks include setting up a hand sanitizer dispenser right at her door and spraying her grocery bags with alcohol even before they get in the car. Bunnie covers herself from head to toe before going anywhere, and showers non stop. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Bunnie’s first week on OnlyFans brought in even more money than she and Jelly expected. Mama can buy a lot of Lysol wipes and toilet paper with that kind of cash. </span></li> </ul> </div> <p> </p> <ul> <li><strong>Bunnie and FeFe’s Top 5 Rules To Get You Out of The Quarantine Funk:  </strong></li> </ul> <p> </p> <ol> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Exercise. Even if you have to carry around gallons of milk in your backyard. Use the time that we are allowed to be outside to go on long walks and jogs.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get outside and when the sun is out, make sure you are spending as much time outdoors as you can! Extra points if you are sunbathing topless in your backyard. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a new hobby and side hustle. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a vitamin regimen that works for you. Bunnie’s go to’s are: St. John’s Wort, L-methylfolate, Magnesium, Sam-E, and L-Theanine. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are having sex. It can be with your partner, with yourself, whatever. We aren’t here to judge - just make sure you are having it. Bunnie created the time and space to bean buzz herself into oblivion, and she has never felt better for it.   </span></li> </ol> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extra bonus Quarantine hack: make big meals for people to eat later in the day buffet style.

She joins Bunnie to talk about surviving childhood trauma and shares how she got into the adult entertainment business.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jelly switches the flip and takes this episode over, putting Bunnie in the hot seat to get real sweaty about some very personal questions. They get down to the real truth of how many times Bunnie has been married, what the relationship with her mother is like today, why she feels like an underdog, and why you shouldn’t be shocked he pulled a chick as hot as Bunnie. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Bunnie loves interviewing a wide array of people on the podcast - Instagram Model, prostitute, reality star, she’ll take them all. The same way Jelly is the underdog in the music industry, she loves raising up the underdogs in the podcast world. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Bunnie has always dreamed about being a radio DJ, with her on-air name starting out as Lacey Carter. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Bunnie’s advice to girls working as a call girl or in the industry - be sure you are smart about your business, and have an exit strategy. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Bunnie respects her mom because she was there during her darkest time of addiction, and stayed loyal and loving. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Believe Bunnie when she says she is white trash. She’s just a polished turd. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Expect some crazy fun back to back Jelly and Bunnie shows this early September in Nashville. More on that soon. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Bunnie has taken the Vegas lifestyle out of touring life just a bit. She used to show up in full glam with glitter and four bags, but now has no trouble packing light and throwing on a hat. </span></li> </ul> <p><strong>Quotes: </strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We represent the underdogs in life.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christy Monroe is not only a stripper, but a nationally touring headlining comedian, architect, author, martial artist, and so much more.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s had one of the wildest lives out there and talks to Bunnie about how she made positive out of the negative, including the somewhat illegal. She talks about her horrific childhood trauma, her book</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Something Ridiculous,</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">and how she blends her stripping and comedy together on stage. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <div style="margin-left: 2em;"> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"> Christy wrote her book,</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something Ridiculous,</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as a way to remind people they aren’t alone. Her father committed suicide when she was a child, and the domino effect from it all led to trauma with abuse, sex trafficking, and human slavery. </span></li> </ul> </div> <p> </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Something Ridiculous</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">discloses some pretty intense things, but it’s Christy’s truth and important to learn from it so we can protect and save others. </span></em></li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Christy escaped the pedophilia and being locked in a basement for 8 months, she attended school for architecture and paved her own path of healing and success. She also started teaching martial arts. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first stripper names are the best. Christy’s was the simple Katie, while Bunnie’s was Martell, after the liquor. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Christy thought she was just going to strip one night, but the $1400 she made on her first day certainly changed her mind quickly. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Christy is now a headlining stand-up comedian and just finished up a month-long tour.

She talks about her horrific childhood trauma, her book <em>Something Ridiculous,</em> and how she blends her stripping and comedy together on stage. </p> <p> </p> <p>Takeaways:</p>  <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"> Christy wrote her book, <em>Something Ridiculous,</em> as a way to remind people they aren’t alone. Her father committed suicide when she was a child, and the domino effect from it all led to trauma with abuse, sex trafficking, and human slavery. </li> </ul>  <p> </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Something Ridiculous discloses some pretty intense things, but it’s Christy’s truth and important to learn from it so we can protect and save others. </em></li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">After Christy escaped the pedophilia and being locked in a basement for 8 months, she attended school for architecture and paved her own path of healing and success. She also started teaching martial arts. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">The first stripper names are the best. Christy’s was the simple Katie, while Bunnie’s was Martell, after the liquor. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Christy thought she was just going to strip one night, but the $1400 she made on her first day certainly changed her mind quickly. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Christy is now a headlining stand-up comedian and just finished up a month-long tour. She loves performing and her comedy is just her being herself and saying out loud the thoughts she usually thinks on the pole or the stage. </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Quotes: </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">“The entire point of the book is to make people feel less alone.” </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">“If there is one thing that Brian the pedophile taught me, it’s that no one on the planet does their job.” </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a pretty lazy stripper, I work like once a week tops.” </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Mentioned: </p> <p><a href="http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/">George Church </a></p> <p><a href="https://www.scarlettscabaret.com/">Scarlett’s Cabaret </a></p> <p><a href="https://www.freemics.com/">FreeMics</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.strippercomedy.com/">Stripper Comedy</a> | <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/strippercomedy/">Instagram</a> | <a href= "https://twitter.com/thongtherapist">Twitter </a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Something-Ridiculous-Christy-Monroe/dp/1651615829"> <em>Something Ridiculous</em></a></p> <p> </p> <p>Check out Bunnie: </p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/xomgitsbunnie/?hl=en">@xomgitsbunnie</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/bunniexo">BunnieXo </a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/officialdumbblonde/">@officialdumbblonde</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenelle Eason is an OG of MTV,  where she was originally on the cast of MTV’s ‘16 and Pregnant’, and then rose to fame on ‘Teen Mom 2’. She joins Bunnie this week to set the record straight about what life really is like as a reality TV star, how she got involved in Teen Mom, and what she thinks about the current cast today. She also catches us up on what’s new in her world, including her kids, love life, and of course — her mom Barbara. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;"> Yes, she really is as cool in real life as she is on TV.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is Kristen Strout a beautiful woman who has won bikini and modeling contests, but this smokeshow is a tomboy at heart who can work on your car, flip your house, and then fix your toilet leak. She joins Bunnie to talk about settling into Nashville, weird stalkers, and the real price of dating a model. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Kristen grew up in Florida and is a tomboy at heart. She ran outside barefoot, played in the dirt, and is just like one of the guys minus the drop-dead gorgeous looks and killer body. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Kristen always had an infatuation with Nashville, and even though she is a self described introvert, she’s settling in quite nicely. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Kristen won her first bikini contest, she realized there was money to be made from contests and promo modeling. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Kristen is a biker chick at heart, and now is the proud owner of a custom detailed C7 Corvette. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Kristen has a huge passion for flipping houses and doing huge makeovers on properties. The last one, she and her fiance demoed themselves with a bunch of skill and a ton of elbow grease. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guys, take it from Bunnie and Kristen: trying to find someone’s location using instagram stories or screenshots is not attractive — it’s creepy. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Expect a bunch of new beautiful work from Kristen including her very own calendar. She also has a passion for music and singing, so maybe we will get lucky and have some new tunes from her as well. </span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Quotes: </strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">“Everyone wants to date a model, til they date a model.”</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I could show my labia lips and you don’t care, but if I’m cooking vegan food you all want to know the recipe.” - B</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would rather put my heart on a platter for people to stomp on than my butthole.” - B</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Mentioned: </strong></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/r1_vette_babe23/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instagram</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">|</span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/R1.Vette.Babe23/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Facebook </span></a></p> <p><a href="https://kristenstrout.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Kristen Strout </span></a></p> <p><a href= "https://kristenstrout.com/bwg_gallery/gallery/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Gallery </span></a></p> <p><a href="https://tropicbeauty.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Tropic Beauty</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Check out Bunnie: </strong></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/xomgitsbunnie/?hl=en"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">@xomgitsbunnie</span></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/bunniexo"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">BunnieXo </span></a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/officialdumbblonde/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">@officialdumbblonde</span></a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sami Lane (AKA Freak Daddy) is a TikTok star, musician, producer, and badass individual. They built a Freak Daddy cult on social media to give people a safe space to be curious instead of confused about whatever is happening in their life. They join the show this week to talk about their music and upcoming album, and to share the funniest Tinder story that made them a viral sensation on TikTok. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sami is non-binary and doesn’t associate with either gender, although they are exploring their trans masculinity. They are more comfortable not to be labeled and boxed in, and although they perform female, there are no limits or boundaries! </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sami’s podcast Impurity anything goes. They talk about anything taboo and give people a community to explore their own issues and experiences within a safe space. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sami also identifies as pansexual and doesn’t care much about gender or presentation in romantic partners. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sami is soon moving from Nashville to Portland, Oregon and we know they will do awesome at creating a new community-centred around open and accepting cool individuals. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freak Daddy produces their own music, and it’s going more in an industrial pop direction. You’ll have no choice but to dance to it when you hear it. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sami was shadowbanned on Instagram (something Bunnie can relate to) so they went over to TikTok. Their Tinder video sky-rocketed and their account now has over 240k followers with 3 million likes. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sami shares the most hilarious Tinder date story you have ever heard, that involves Adele, an engagement ring, and the two of them almost running away to New York. </span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Quotes: </strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m constantly trying to learn, so why not try to involve everyone else in the process?” - S</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m the black sheep in the family and I’m doing the best out of all of them, so go figure.” - B</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, we ruined Adele for me.

They talk about anything taboo and give people a community to explore their own issues and experiences within a safe space. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Sami also identifies as pansexual and doesn’t care much about gender or presentation in romantic partners. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Sami is soon moving from Nashville to Portland, Oregon and we know they will do awesome at creating a new community-centred around open and accepting cool individuals. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Freak Daddy produces their own music, and it’s going more in an industrial pop direction. You’ll have no choice but to dance to it when you hear it. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Sami was shadowbanned on Instagram (something Bunnie can relate to) so they went over to TikTok. Their Tinder video sky-rocketed and their account now has over 240k followers with 3 million likes. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Sami shares the most hilarious Tinder date story you have ever heard, that involves Adele, an engagement ring, and the two of them almost running away to New York. </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Quotes: </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m constantly trying to learn, so why not try to involve everyone else in the process?” - S</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m the black sheep in the family and I’m doing the best out of all of them, so go figure.” - B</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, we ruined Adele for me. I get triggered by Adele now because of this experience.” </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Mentioned: </p> <p><a href= "https://open.spotify.com/show/7tklcj0mTRMQaU9nrsh1NM">Impurity </a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/topfreakdaddy/?hl=en">Instagram</a> | <a href= "https://www.tiktok.com/@topfreakdaddy?lang=en">Tik Tok</a> | <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt1w6-hqDIcLRDkQaafX8tw"> YouTube </a></p> <p><a href="https://www.freakdaddyworld.com/">Freak Daddy World </a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsR4LtDt0kYyLwKT9cYyQbg"> Dorian Electra</a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chellaman/?hl=en"> @ChellaMan</a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.dieantwoord.com/baito-jou-sabella/">Die Antwoord</a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf99kdFw9b8">Ic3 Peak </a></p> <p> </p> <p>Check out Bunnie: </p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/xomgitsbunnie/?hl=en">@xomgitsbunnie</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/bunniexo">BunnieXo </a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/officialdumbblonde/">@officialdumbblonde</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bunnie asked for your deepest, darkest confessions and boy, did you guys deliver. She is joined with her main squeeze and co-host FeFe to read some of the juiciest, freakiest, and funniest confessions they’ve ever heard, and even give a few of their own stories along with them. Y’all never fail to amuse us. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Stripping is not a bad thing!

Bunnie and FeFe pulled it off, and have high hopes for you too. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people are really that hungry for cold hard cash that they will grab it right off poo. True story, and Bunnie witnessed it firsthand. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ball tickling as a solution to snoring? Bunnie and FeFe think it would just arouse their man, but of course are open to giving it a try. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may think you’re fooling people into thinking you don’t smoke anymore, but you can always smell cigarettes. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the happiest couple still fights, and it’s where you really get to know a person and see how they handle stress and conflict. Plus, fighting can be okay when you have great make up sex. </span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Quotes: </strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m an alpha bitch, I run shit all day long.” </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You gotta give him what he wants every now and then, and call it a night.” </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is why I don’t eat p*ssy.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bunnie is joined this week with two beautiful business ladies, Kimber and Ava, to talk about a subject near and dear to her heart, the world of companion services and sugar daddies. The girls break down what it’s really like to work as an escort, how they went from living on a cornfield to a dominating at strip clubs, and they shed some light on things to know before roping in a sugar daddy. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Bunnie got into stripping when one of her exes cheated on her with a stripper, and she knew she needed to show the world how it’s really done. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world of working girls there is a sisterhood amongst them (at least the good ones) and they look out for each other and show one another the ropes. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some clients want their balls crushed, others want GFE, or the Girlfriend Experience. Every experience is different. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many escorts and working girls start out as strippers, and get addicted to how much money there is to make. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Picturing the backstage of a strip club may seem hot, but if you saw what was really going on it’s enough to turn a straight man gay. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Having a Sugar Daddy has its perks, but also there are major drawbacks. They could feel like they own you, there are no “off” days, and you may have an angry wife chasing you down the street. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Kimber and Ava both have seen a different side of life as a working girl. They’ve been in some scary situations both emotionally and physically. The key is to remember the world stops for no one, and only the strong will get back out there. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For girls looking to get into the industry, Kimber and Ava recommend that you find a sugar daddy or some good regulars. It’s not just about sex anymore. Also, be aware of trafficking laws and don’t be stupid online or IRL.  </span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Quotes: </strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I’m dancing for you naked, it’s gonna be like a washcloth.” - B </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I swear to you, I found a dollar in my ass crack like 30 minutes after I got on stage.” </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of dudes that have a lot of money don’t dress like they do.” </span></li> </ul> <p><br /> <br /></p> <p><strong>Mentioned: </strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.cheetahlv.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cheetahs Las Vegas </span></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.redrooster.vegas/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The Red Rooster</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></a><a href= "http://www.eros.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Eros</span></a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/keepingupwithkimber_/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">@keepingupwithkimber_</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Check out Bunnie: </strong></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/xomgitsbunnie/?hl=en"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">@xomgitsbunnie</span></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/bunniexo"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">BunnieXo </span></a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/officialdumbblonde/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">@officialdumbblonde</span></a></p>]]></description>
