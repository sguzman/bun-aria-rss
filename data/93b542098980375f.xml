				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, I gave a talk at <a href="https://www.valleytechcon.com/agenda-2019/">Valley TechCon</a> in Harrisonburg, VA (where I live), which is a conference that features tech businesses and practitioners from the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and is in its 2nd year. There were a bunch of cool topics and speakers, and it was great to see what other great tech is being built in my part of the world!</p>
<p>I said I&#8217;d share my slides on my &#8220;SQL for Data Science&#8221; talk, so <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qOtT2M-rjYa9JzKNz6_CxvfbihmqcmG9Ax6LgIriz0Y/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here they are</a>!</p>
<p>I only had 40 minutes, so this wasn&#8217;t a full tutorial, and I couldn&#8217;t really teach many different concepts, but my main goal was to point out a bunch of different stuff you could do with SQL, and how to think about creating an analytical dataset, so attendees would be aware of what was possible and what they should look up if they wanted to start learning about SQL.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2019 iteration of <a href="https://tomtomfest.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tom Tom Fest</a> (named after Thomas Jefferson) starts in under a month, and the <a href="https://tomtomfest.com/machine-learning/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Applied Machine Learning Conference (AMLC)</a> is just over a month away, on April 11, in Charlottesville, VA!</p>
<p>This is a conference I&#8217;ve helped plan since the beginning, and it&#8217;s grown in 3 years from a single theater with a partial day of talks to 4 theaters with non-stop presentations all day, plus keynotes in an even larger venue!</p>
<p>An exciting announcement from me is that I will be recording a short episode of my Becoming a Data Scientist Podcast in front of a live audience for the first time at the AMLC! I&#8217;ll be interviewing <a href="https://twitter.com/therriaultphd" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andrew Therriault</a>, one of our keynote speakers, about how he became an Infrastructure Data Science Manager at Facebook, after starting out with degrees in politics, and working as the Director of Data Science for the Democratic National Committee, and the Chief Data Officer for the City of Boston, among other roles.</p>
<p>I am <a href="https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci/status/1099814149452976131" rel="noopener" target="_blank">featuring an AMLC speaker each day</a> with the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AMLCville?src=hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#AMLCville</a> hashtag on twitter. You can learn more about all of our speakers (still more to be added!) and get tickets on the <a href="https://tomtomfest.com/machine-learning/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">conference website</a>. Hope to see you there! </p>

		<description><![CDATA[The purpose of the Summer of Data Science is to learn a specific topic or complete a specific project or read a book or finish a course so you can check something off of your long data science “to learn” list, and have fun achieving goals along with other data science learners during a fixed period of time. The deadline should be motivating, to get you to start and finish something before the summer is over.

Week 1 was all about brainstorming ideas and gathering resources – dreaming up what you’d love to learn, and finding content that will help you learn it.

Week 2 (which started yesterday, but don’t worry, jump in any time even if you see this a month from now) is all about goal-setting.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of the <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2018/05/28/summer-of-data-science-2018-sods18-launch-day/">Summer of Data Science</a> is to learn a specific topic or complete a project or read a book or finish a course so you can check something off of your long data science &#8220;to learn&#8221; list (get used to it being long, data scientists always have more to learn, so it never gets shorter!), and have fun achieving goals along with other data science learners during a fixed period of time. The deadline should be motivating, to get you to start and finish something before the summer is over.</p>
<p>Week 1 was all about brainstorming ideas and gathering resources &#8211; dreaming up what you&#8217;d love to learn, and finding content that will help you learn it.</p>
<p>Week 2 (which started yesterday, but don&#8217;t worry, jump in any time even if you see this blog post a month from now) is all about <strong>goal-setting</strong>.</p>
<p>You should set a #SoDS18 goal that&#8217;s lofty enough to excite and motivate you, but not so out of reach that you&#8217;ll never complete it and only get disheartened when halfway through the summer you realize you are only 10% of the way there.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Make sure to keep goals attainable! Last year my goals were too expansive and by week 4 there was zero chance of accomplishing all of them which was super demotivating <a href="https://t.co/uXiwUFNYU5">https://t.co/uXiwUFNYU5</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Nick Heitzman <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f4ca.png" alt="📊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f4c8.png" alt="📈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@NickDoesData) <a href="https://twitter.com/NickDoesData/status/1001194480152776704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I also want to make sure you know what makes a good goal. I like the definition used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" target="_blank">SMART</a> approach:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your goal should be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>S</strong>pecific</li>
<li><strong>M</strong>easurable</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>chievable</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>elevant</li>
<li><strong>T</strong>ime-Bound</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of explaining each of these in detail (you can read more about it <a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals" target="_blank">elsewhere on the internet</a>), I&#8217;m going to give an example of things you can jot down for yourself for each of these, then an example summary tweet for 2 different #SoDS18 goals.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say the idea you had for what to learn this summer is <strong>&#8220;Start learning Python&#8221;</strong>, and the resource you found is <a href="https://www.dataquest.io" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DataQuest</a>. Let&#8217;s turn that into a SMART goal:</p>
<p><strong>Specific</strong> &#8211; Learn how to import, clean, and visualize data using python and pandas</p>
<p><strong>Measurable</strong> &#8211; Complete all courses in the DatQuest <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/" target="_blank">Data Scientist Path</a></p>
<p><strong>Achievable</strong> &#8211; I can spend at least 6 hours on this project every weekend, plus occasional weekday evenings, so I have enough time available to do the work [Note from Renee: I have not actually researched how long this course series would take to complete]. I have joined the #py4ds Slack community and will ask for help there and on DataQuest if I get stuck so I don&#8217;t get set far behind.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant</strong> &#8211; I want to add python and pandas to my resume, and it&#8217;s my first step on my new path to becoming a data scientist, so it&#8217;s relevant to my career goals and I&#8217;m motivated to accomplish it.</p>
<p><strong>Time-Bound</strong> &#8211; the Summer of Data Science ends on September 3, so I will finish this first goal by August 3 in order to have time to complete a small project during the last month of #SoDS18.</p>
<p>Example tweet to share this goal with the world:</p>
<blockquote><p>My 1st#SoDS18 goal: I will learn to import, clean, and visualize data with python &amp; pandas by spending 6-8 hours per week on the Data Scientist Path on DataQuest, and will complete it by August 3. I&#8217;ll ask in #py4ds Slack if I need help.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or, if your idea is to <strong>&#8220;do a machine learning project using at least 2 different algorithms on some kind of dataset that could help people&#8221;</strong>. That can be converted to a SMART goal like:</p>
<p><strong>Specific</strong> &#8211; Learn how to use random forest and logistic regression in R by experimenting with data from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/donorschoose/io/data" target="_blank">Kaggle DonorsChoose.org Dataset</a> to develop a list of donors to email about a particular type of project request</p>
<p><strong>Measurable</strong> &#8211; I will complete exploratory data analysis on the available DonorsChoose data files and write a blog post about my findings that includes at least 3 visualizations. Then I will find out what it means to submit a Kaggle Kernel, build 2 machine learning models using random forest and logistic regression algorithms and compare their model evaluation metrics to each other, submit the Kernel (even if the contest period is over), and find and study at least 2 other people&#8217;s submissions to understand different approaches to the problem. Then I will write another blog post summarizing my results and findings.</p>
<p><strong>Achievable</strong> &#8211; I have read about random forest and logistic regression online, and my friend gave me the <a href="https://amzn.to/2JwjsDb" target="_blank">Introduction to Statistical Learning</a> book so I can better understand these machine learning algorithms. I have a bunch of resources bookmarked online in case I need extra references to understand the book. I will tweet using the #rstats hashtag or talk to my friend if I need help. If I find out the dataset I found isn&#8217;t great for learning these 2 algorithms, I will search for another dataset as needed. I can dedicate 2 hours a day 4 days per week to working on the project and researching these topics.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant</strong> &#8211; I started learning R over the last year and have used it to complete labs at school, but want to expand my machine learning capabilities and apply my skills to a real-world dataset before I start applying for jobs in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>Time-Bound</strong> &#8211; I have 12 weeks to complete the project this summer.</p>
<p>Example tweet</p>
<blockquote><p>My #SoDS18 goals are to:<br />
-explore the DonorsChoose Kaggle dataset<br />
-use ISL book &amp; online resources to learn to build random forest and logistic regression models<br />
-create and submit a Kaggle Kernel to help DonorsChoose<br />
-write at least 2 blog posts about it over the next 12 weeks</p></blockquote>
<p>I think you get the idea!</p>
<p>I should also mention that you don&#8217;t want to over-plan. Notice the note about switching datasets if one doesn&#8217;t work out &#8211; plan to be flexible! You don&#8217;t yet know what you&#8217;re getting into, and you might need to find more time finding good resources to learn, getting help, or pivoting if your original plan doesn&#8217;t work out. That&#8217;s OK! Just go with the flow and try to achieve something comparable to your initial goal. But, you need an initial goal in order to figure out where you are relative to it!</p>
<p>So, finish brainstorming your learning ideas and finding resources this week, then narrow it down to a SMART goal, and tweet about it with the #SoDS18 hashtag so we know what you plan to learn during the Summer of Data Science 2018!</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re still looking for project ideas, check out <a href="https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1004176865618223104" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mara Averick&#8217;s post</a>, browse the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&#038;vertical=default&#038;q=%23SoDS18&#038;src=savs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#SoDS18 hashtag</a>, or join a data science learning community!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago, on a whim, I posted the <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2018/05/05/craftydataviz-contest/">#CraftyDataViz contest</a>, hoping for some beautiful and wacky homemade visualizations, and you all sure came through! The entries were gorgeous and the judging was super difficult!</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;d like to thank our awesome judges, who went through 2 difficult rounds of judging and discussion to help select the winners!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://twitter.com/devnatash" target="_blank">@devnatash</a></div>

<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging this was so difficult.  I was blown away by the creativity.“ &#8211; Karen Lopez</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every single entry was compelling.” &#8211; Natasha</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p>As described in the <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2018/05/05/craftydataviz-contest/">original post</a>, we had 3 categories to be won, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Most Beautiful</em> &#8211; depicted the original visualization&#8217;s data in a visually impressive way</li>
<li><em>Most Informational</em> &#8211; most effectively/readably communicates the data from the original visualization</li>
<li><em>Most Fun!</em> &#8211; made the judges smile</li>
</ul>
<p>There was no category where there was a clear winning crafty data visualization. Everyone who entered put their heart into it and had some creative, beautiful, fun, and informative handmade art! Without further ado, here are the top selections:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Most Beautiful</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In the Most Beautiful category, the 5 judges initially selected 5 different winners! Eventually, they came to agreement on <a href="https://twitter.com/pattithepotato/status/998336830662758409" target="_blank">Patti Shih&#8217;s submission</a>, comparing normal brain connectivity to connectivity &#8220;while tripping on magic mushrooms&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Patti was able to almost perfectly recreate the original dataviz using something as cozy as string. The choice of colors manages to make it even more visually appealing than the original.&#8221; &#8211; Emil Hvitfeldt</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Circos diagrams, although hard to gain insight from, are pretty. By sculpturing layers with string, Patti enhanced both their beauty and their informational value.” &#8211; Helena Jambor</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Honorable Mention</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The runner up in the Most Beautiful category was a twisted-metal tree representing a dendrogram of the students that <a href="https://twitter.com/DataVizToday/status/994955972807413763" target="_blank">Alli Torban&#8217;s</a> (Host of Data Viz Today Podcast) mother taught throughout her career.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The tree is very very beautifully done and photographed &#8211; serves both as reminder that tree-diagrams can be shown in 3D and is in itself almost a sculpture! “ &#8211; Helena</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Most Informational</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In this category, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=from%3A%40amycesal%20%23CraftyDataViz&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">Amy Cesal&#8217;s two entries</a> dominated; both of her Play-Doh-based visualizations won the most votes in the original round. They were also strong contenders in the Most Beautiful category. In the end, the judges selected the &#8220;joy plot&#8221; (aka ridgeline plot) of the Perceptions of Probability for its effectiveness in conveying the meaning of <a href="https://github.com/zonination/perceptions/blob/master/joy1.png" target="_blank">the original data visualization</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joy plots were recently re-popularized by @ClausWilke and are both fun and informative.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Honorable Mention</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://twitter.com/AmyCesal/status/999447156716195840" target="_blank">Amy Cesal&#8217;s 2nd entry</a> on birth time patterns was the other top choice in the Most Informational category.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I loved that this crafty version made the original data viz more understandable due to adding another dimension. “ &#8211; Karen Lopez</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Most Fun</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This subjective category also had multiple top picks in the first round of judging. After much deliberation, the judges chose <a href="https://twitter.com/jschwabish/status/926088197867753474" target="_blank">Jon Schwabish&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s entry</a> depicting her Halloween candy haul! Definitely fun, especially the mysterious &#8220;MEGA&#8221; category!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The author’s clear zest for each individual data point (ie piece of candy) really shone through!” -Natasha</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Honorable Mentions</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Memorial Day is the unofficial start of summer in the U.S., so in the past, we&#8217;ve also used it as the start date for the <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/category/sods/">Summer of Data Science</a>! The main goal of the Summer of Data Science is to learn something new during a fixed period of time, and share your progress and references to help and inspire others (and to get help from and get inspired by others, too!). If you want to learn more about the origin and history of the hashtag, I gave more background in <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2017/05/29/summer-of-data-science-2017/">last year&#8217;s post</a>.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m sure the main thing you&#8217;re here to find out is how to get involved yourself! So, here are the basics:</p>
<blockquote><p>How to participate in the Summer of Data Science:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Pick a thing or a short list of things related to data science that you want to learn more about this summer (or this winter if you&#8217;re in the southern hemisphere!)</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Make a plan to learn it (like an online course, a practice project, etc.).</li>
<li>Share that plan on social media, then post updates as you make progress, with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SoDS18" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#SoDS18</a>.</li>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/878277513130192896" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a twitter moment with a bunch of entries from #SoDS17</a> for reference!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll run this one from today &#8211; May 28, 2018 &#8211; through Labor Day in the U.S. &#8211; September 3, 2018. What you can realistically get done in that time depends on where you are in your data science learning journey, what your work schedule and family obligations are like, and many other factors &#8211; so think about what&#8217;s realistic for you to accomplish during this time.</p>
<p>Week 1 will be about brainstorming and researching possibilities and resources for summer projects, courses, etc. And in Week 2 we&#8217;ll set specific goals for the rest of the summer. So, start thinking of ideas now!</p>
<p>If you would like some ideas for beginners, here&#8217;s a list of beginner content on my site DataSciGuide:<br />
<a href="http://www.datasciguide.com/recommended-resources-for-beginners/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recommended Resources for Beginners</a><br />
You might want to pick a book or course and go through it, trying out the exercises this summer.</p>
<p>I also have a Flipboard where I have collected a bunch of <a href="https://flipboard.com/@becomingdatasci/data-science-related-tutorials-1h97ri85y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Data Science Tutorials</a> you might want to check out (note: these aren&#8217;t all aimed at beginners).</p>
<p>There are also a whole bunch of online communities where you can join others in a project, or ask questions if you get stuck on yours. I’ll be writing another post highlighting those this week!</p>
<p>Follow me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@becomingdatasci</a>, and tweet with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SoDS18" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#SoDS18</a> when you post updates about your progress! (It’s a good idea to “thread” your tweets throughout the summer, or add them to a Twitter Moment, so others can easily follow along!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be retweeting a bunch of people&#8217;s ideas and resources, so keep an eye out there for more ideas if you aren&#8217;t sure where to start!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple weeks ago, I started following the <a href="https://twitter.com/everytract" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@everytract</a> twitter bot account (by <a href="https://twitter.com/fitnr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@fitnr</a>), which is tweeting an aerial image of every census tract in America:</p>

<p>and imagined a census tract visualization made out of dried noodles and beans. Being as spontaneous as usual, I asked if anyone would be interested in having a #CraftyDataViz contest, and several people responded yes! So, here we are. Time to get creative! </p>

<p>Find a data visualization online, in a book, or create one yourself. We need a digital version of the viz you&#8217;re recreating, so save the link or take a photo of it. Now, gather up some goodies from around the house or yard and/or hit the craft store (or maybe the grocery store!) and recreate that data viz in craft form!</p>
<p>It does need to  be a physical end-product &#8211; no completely digital entries (though usage of printed elements is ok), but other than that there are no restrictions on materials or approach &#8211; get as creative as you want! At least part of it needs to be handmade or manually assembled (so no completely 3D-printed entries, for instance, but parts could be 3D printed) You can replicate the viz in detail, or do an abstract interpretation of it :)</p>
<p>I will find some judges that know something about data visualization, and they will pick winners in each of the following categories (we might do some sort of online vote to narrow down the entries, depending on how many there are):</p>
<ol><strong>Most Beautiful/Visually Impressive</strong> &#8211; as long as the judges can tell it&#8217;s related to the original data viz in some way, it qualifies, and the judges will pick the overall most gorgeous or awe-inspiring outcome to win this category</ol>
<ol><strong>Most Informational</strong> &#8211; to win this category, your visualization needs to be especially readable/interpretable. Judges will pick the one that most effectively communicates the point of the original data viz</ol>
<ol><strong>Most Fun!</strong> &#8211; the definition of this is up to the judges, but if it makes the judges laugh, it probably has a good chance at winning</ol>
<p>The winner of each category will be featured here and on my @becomingdatasci twitter account, and win their choice of item from the <a href="https://teespring.com/stores/becoming-a-data-scientist" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Becoming a Data Scientist store</a>! By then, I&#8217;ll have the 2018 <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/category/sods/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summer of Data Science</a> items up, since the end of this contest will also mark the launch of #SoDS18!</p>
<p><strong>How to Enter:</strong></p>
<p>Post a tweet (or a comment below if you don&#8217;t use twitter) that includes a link or image of the original dataviz, as well as a photo or video of your creation! On twitter, use hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CraftyDataViz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#CraftyDataViz</a> so I can find your entry!</p>
<p>The entry period starts today and ends on 11:59PM EDT on Sunday, May 27. I&#8217;ll plan to post the entries for viewing/judging on Monday, May 28 (Memorial Day in the United States).</p>
<p>HAVE FUN!! I&#8217;m excited to see what you create!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I presented a talk with this title at the <a href="https://tomtomfest.com/machine-learning/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Applied Machine Learning Conference at Tom Tom Fest</a> in Charlottesville (which I also helped plan) last Thursday April 12, 2018.</p>
<p>My interest in this topic started long ago, and I partially based this talk off of my blog post &#8220;<a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/11/22/a-challenge-to-data-scientists/">A Challenge to Data Scientists</a>&#8221; from 2015. There are a ton of links throughout, and I included the slide notes so you have those along with the presentation (I&#8217;m not sure why all of the URLS aren&#8217;t automatically linked, so you have to copy and paste some, sorry.) I&#8217;m prepping for another presentation right now and don&#8217;t have time to write a whole lot about it &#8211; so without further ado, here are the PDF files with the slides and the notes:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Can-a-Machine-Be-Racist-or-Sexist-Renee-Teate-2-per-pg.pdf" target="_blank">SLIDES</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Can-a-Machine-Be-Racist-or-Sexist-Renee-Teate-outline-view.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">[SOME] NOTES &#038; LINKS</a></p>
<p>Just noticed the link above still doesn&#8217;t contain all of the notes and links&#8230; I need to figure out how to save that to PDF in the right format from Powerpoint. For now, here&#8217;s the full slide + notes view with all links. Just don&#8217;t print it &#8211; it&#8217;s almost 100 pages long!<br />

<p>Update: There&#8217;s a video on YouTube of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZLGAOstE9w&#038;list=PLTnOXzOljuWa3xa3yf2FSFEh8mqj1q9KF&#038;index=7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this talk</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc_-ImDxIPE&#038;list=PLTnOXzOljuWa3xa3yf2FSFEh8mqj1q9KF&#038;index=8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the panel</a> that followed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been telling everyone that I&#8217;d do something &#8220;data fun&#8221; when I hit 20K Twitter followers, so I posted an analysis of my podcast listeners! I used python and pandas in a Jupyter notebook for the first part, then I did a dashboard in Tableau for the last part.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video of me explaining the analysis:</p>
<p><iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yvtlztnsrlk?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>A few notes as I skim through:</p>
<ul>
<li>That part that was broken is where I hadn&#8217;t changed from the real IP to the random IP (sorry search bot), so I fixed that in the file below</li>
<li>I pointed to the wrong thing when I was talking about how long I&#8217;d been around&#8230;Becoming a Data Scientist Podcast started in December 2015! So 1 year later there was a day larger than the 1st day for the 1st 3 episodes.</li>
<li> The top IP that got 36 views &#8211; I&#8217;ll have to look into it, but I think it could be multiple IPs getting assigned the same random number. I&#8217;ll take a look and come back when I have a chance.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/category/podcast/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here are all of the episodes</a>, so you can go back and listen to any you missed!</p>
<p>You can download the HTML versions of my Jupyter notebooks, and also play with the Tableau dashboards at these links:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back before I had so many followers, and it was less stressful to put goofy stuff &#8220;in the wild&#8221;, <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/06/08/monday-silliness/" target="_blank">I wrote data science parody lyrics to &#8220;Summer of &#8217;69&#8221; and &#8220;For the Love of Money&#8221;</a>. Well, a while ago, another idea popped into my head..</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Feeling another set of parody lyrics coming on. Maybe will write down this week. Guess the data science theme?<a href="https://t.co/flpIozxz8x">https://t.co/flpIozxz8x</a></p>

<p><center>Lyrics:</p>
<p>I can fit every point<br />
feature high info gain<br />
but I&#8217;m over you asking me when you know I&#8217;m not okay<br />
I learned really well<br />
from the training that night<br />
and though I can classify you know I&#8217;m just not right</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t generalize<br />
I&#8217;m overfit<br />
Too complex<br />
I&#8217;m overfit<br />
Tricked by noise<br />
I&#8217;m overfit<br />
I&#8217;m overfit<br />
I&#8217;m over</p>
<p>Wanting you to be wanting me<br />
But, my low accuracy<br />
To outliers I&#8217;m sensitive<br />
Because I&#8217;m so over<br />
I&#8217;m overfit<br />
Moving on, it&#8217;s too late<br />
I didn&#8217;t pass cross validate<br />
Tried so hard to relate<br />
and now I&#8217;m so&#8230; so overfit!</p>
<p>You can go get more points<br />
Build more models to help<br />
You can regularlize with layers that drop out</p>
<p>Oh that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m done<br />
I&#8217;m overfit<br />
Was fun but<br />
I&#8217;m overfit<br />
I&#8217;m not the one<br />
I&#8217;m overfit<br />
I&#8217;m overfit<br />
I&#8217;m over</p>
<p>Wanting you to be wanting me<br />
But, my low accuracy<br />
To outliers I&#8217;m sensitive<br />
Because I&#8217;m so over<br />
I&#8217;m overfit<br />
Moving on, it&#8217;s too late<br />
I didn&#8217;t pass cross validate<br />
Tried so hard to data relate<br />
and now I&#8217;m so&#8230; so overfit!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ask me to classify<br />
Ain&#8217;t no use don&#8217;t ask me why<br />
I&#8217;ll never change<br />
Unless&#8230; tweak my parameters and run me again</p>
<p>Wanting you to be wanting me<br />
But, my low accuracy<br />
To outliers I&#8217;m sensitive<br />
Because I&#8217;m so over<br />
I&#8217;m overfit<br />
Moving on, it&#8217;s too late<br />
I didn&#8217;t pass cross validate<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1. Sorry for the issues loading images and with logins on this site. I&#8217;ve had problems ever since I had bluehost set me up with HTTPS certificates, and apparently those certificates have expired or something and are causing issues with the images being able to load, etc. I&#8217;ll look into it, but I also have a busy week at work and wasn&#8217;t planning on site maintenance here this week, so it might be this way for a little bit. I am aware of it and a fix is on my to-do list, though! Thanks for your patience.</p>
<p>2. I published a post over on DataSciGuide about <a href="http://www.datasciguide.com/recommended-resources-for-beginners/" target="_blank">resources for data science beginners</a>. Check it out!</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued readership here!</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;m working on the podcast again, so the 2 already-recorded episodes are back in the work pipeline :)</p>

I'm sure this has been done before, but here are some common machine learning terms couched in the language of cooking and food. Feedback welcome!

<strong>Machine Learning Algorithm</strong>

A machine learning algorithm is a list of instructions to guide a computer to analyze some data to find patterns, and works much like a cooking recipe. You put some data in (ingredients), do some stuff to it (preparation and cooking), and then evaluate how the results compare to what you were hoping to accomplish (photo in your cookbook and expectations of taste).]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was just pondering some ways to discuss machine learning terminology in a way that would be accessible to beginners, and figured I&#8217;d share my semi-thought-out ideas here. I&#8217;m sure this has been done before, but here are some common machine learning terms couched in the language of cooking and food. Feedback welcome!</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Algorithm</strong></p>
<p>A machine learning algorithm is a list of instructions to guide a computer to analyze some data to find patterns, and works much like a cooking recipe. You put some data in (ingredients), do some stuff to it (preparation and cooking), and then evaluate how the results compare to what you were hoping to accomplish (photo in your cookbook and expectations of taste).</p>
<p><strong>Input Columns (Features) -> Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>Features are basically columns in your spreadsheet that you choose to input into an algorithm, and they&#8217;re like ingredients in a recipe. If you&#8217;re going to make cookies, you&#8217;ll need some ingredients like eggs, flour, and chocolate. These ingredients get stirred together and then baked, and the output is a (hopefully) edible cookie. </p>
<p><strong>Feature Engineering -> Ingredient Prep</strong></p>
<p>Some ingredients, like eggs, aren&#8217;t added to the recipe as-is. You have to crack the egg, sometimes separate the whites from the yolk, and maybe beat the egg before adding it to your recipe. The same goes for the features, or columns in your spreadsheet. For instance, you might have a column that contains categorical values in text form, and some algorithms will require you to first transform that column into a bunch of yes/no columns that &#8220;encode&#8221; the feature into binary values. If, for instance, you have category values listed in your original column like &#8220;category A&#8221;, &#8220;category B&#8221;, and &#8220;category C&#8221;, you might convert the 1 column to 3 columns &#8211; one for each category &#8211; and instead of the spreadsheet cells containing words, they now contain a 1 or a 0 in each category column indicating &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; for each category. An algorithm that couldn&#8217;t understand the phrase &#8220;category A&#8221;, can now understand it as a value of &#8220;1&#8221; in the Category A column.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Input Rows / Volume of Data -> Batch Size</strong></p>
<p>Changing the number of rows of data in your spreadsheet (each row containing a bunch of &#8220;features&#8221; &#8211; or columns) is like scaling the measure of ingredients in your recipe. If you want a double batch of cookies, you can add twice as much of each ingredient into your bowl, and get twice the cookie dough. If you only have half of the amount of flour called for by the recipe, you can halve all of the other ingredients to get half of a batch. You have to beware of modifying how many rows of data you input into your algorithm, though. Like in cooking, adding or removing rows can sometimes have an unexpected effect on the output. If you split a bowl of cookie dough in half, but almost all of the chocolate chips end up in one half and almost none are in the other half, you won&#8217;t get two identical batches of cookies! The distribution of values contained in the rows of data you input into your machine learning algorithm impacts the resulting model.</p>
<p><strong>Clean CSV -> Pre-prepared meal kit</strong></p>
<p>In data science courses, you often start assignments with a pre-cleaned spreadsheet. This is like receiving a meal kit delivered to your door. You get the correct amount of each ingredient, and they are often already prepared or just need a little chopping. This is great for learning, but don&#8217;t be surprised when you get to a real-world scenario and you are expected to shop for the ingredients, hope they are available for purchase at your local store, make some substitutes, and then figure out how each ingredient you bought needs to be transformed in order for the recipe to work! It makes sense to start out as a short-order cook before you learn the skills and art to being a chef, so there&#8217;s nothing wrong with using &#8220;meal kits&#8221; to start out!</p>
<p><strong>Type of Model/Algorithm -> Cooking method</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have all of your ingredients prepared, what do you do with them? If you&#8217;re cooking, that batter could be baked into a cake, or fried into a donut. If you&#8217;re doing data science, your spreadsheet could be run through a variety of algorithms to generate different types of models, to see how each turns out. This is called &#8220;model selection&#8221;. You might use linear regression or a decision tree, for instance. Just like with cooking, different &#8220;ingredients&#8221; (features) work better with certain cooking styles (types of models). And some people &#8211; machine learning researchers &#8211; are exploring entirely new methods of &#8220;cooking&#8221;!</p>
<p><strong>Model Parameters -> Cooking settings</strong></p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve chosen to bake your cookies, at what temperature do you bake them at? And for how long? This depends on what you are trying to optimize for. Do the people eating the cookies like them more caramelized and don&#8217;t mind them being a little burnt around the edges? Or do they like them soft with no dark spots? Some of that is affected by the ingredients you put in, but it&#8217;s important to find a good oven temperature and cooking time combination. In machine learning, this is called &#8220;parameter tuning&#8221; or &#8220;hyperparameter optimization&#8221;. There are methods for working through different combinations of parameters (settings) to find the best one for the outcome you want to achieve. Note that if you change the ingredients (features), the settings that worked with your last batch of dough may not be the best for your new one. And a good temperature for frying might not be a good temperature for baking!</p>
<p>Also note that I mentioned you have to choose what to optimize for. If you have an audience that has different cookie preferences, you can tweak your model toward one or the other, or try to balance between the two. There are always human choices made in &#8220;machine learning&#8221;, and every choice is a trade-off! (same goes for choosing which rows and columns to input into your model, not just parameters)</p>
<p><strong>Output Features / Target Variable -> Ideal Cooked Food Outcome</strong></p>
<p>We talked about input features (ingredients), but why are we doing all this &#8220;cooking&#8221;? We&#8217;re trying to achieve some sort of target, which we mentioned a bit earlier when talking about parameter tuning. How do we know what target we&#8217;re trying to hit? In supervised machine learning, you have some rows where the output is known, so you can train your model. This is like having a photo of the finished product in a cookbook, and having tasted what a good outcome of the recipe tastes like. You have a target toward which you are trying to optimize. If you say it is &#8220;too salty&#8221;, you&#8217;re comparing the saltiness of your result to some ideal saltiness. That ideal is the &#8220;target&#8221;, and in supervised machine learning, is encoded in the &#8220;output feature&#8221; &#8211; a column in your spreadsheet that contains a value for each row that identifies how that row should be categorized by the resulting model, or what number the algorithm should generate.</p>
<p><strong>Model Evaluation -> Tasting/Looking at Result, Comparing to Recipe Expectations</strong></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve run your features through a model (cooked your ingredients with a particular method and settings), you need to evaluate how well the results turned out. In cooking, you&#8217;ll often have some taste-testers and you can also compare how the final plated dish looks when compared to the photo in the cookbook. As mentioned before, you can optimize for different things. You might make a dish that looks beautiful &#8211; exactly like the photo! &#8211; but tastes horrible. (Maybe they staged the photo with fake food and no one can make it look like that with the given recipe!)</p>
<p>So, if your &#8220;evaluation metric&#8221; of taste is way off, you go back and tweak your ingredients (features), ingredient prep (feature engineering), parameters (oven settings), and batch size (volume of data and which rows are included) until your outcome meets your chosen ideal. Or, if you think the outcome is just fine, it might be the taste testers (metrics) that need rethinking!</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p><em><strong>Types of machine learning algorithms.</strong></em></p>
<p>These next few examples get away from the &#8220;recipe&#8221; example I&#8217;ve been using so far, but still use food to attempt to explain the concepts.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have a big bowl of trail mix. Your job is to teach a child to separate the trail mix into its components. This is like taking a big spreadsheet of data, and figuring out how to group the rows into categories. Each piece in the trail mix corresponds to one row in your spreadsheet.</p>
<p>You notice that the bowl of trail mix contains nuts, candy, and pieces of cereal. You point out each ingredient to the child, explaining &#8220;see, this is a peanut, a type of nut&#8221;, &#8220;this is an M&#038;M, a type of candy&#8221;, tell the child to separate them out into piles, and walk away. (Don&#8217;t be surprised if some of your &#8220;data&#8221; is missing after this project!)</p>
<p><strong>CLASSIFICATION</strong></p>
<p>You come back and see that the child has created two piles: One has peanuts, cashews, and almonds in it. The other has M&#038;Ms, chex, cheerios, and raisins in it. This child understood the task as a classification task, and acted as a &#8220;nut or not&#8221; classifier! He heard you describing the items as nuts, candy, or cereal, ignored the specifics, and decided to do a simple separation into 2 piles: one with nuts, one with non-nuts. </p>
<p>I could go into detail here about confusion matrices and evaluating this child&#8217;s performance, categorizing true positives (nuts correctly identified as nuts), false positives (non-nuts identified as nuts), true negatives (non-nuts identified as non-nuts), and false negatives (nuts identified as non-nuts), but getting into the details of these measures would make this article way longer than it needs to be, and I&#8217;m just trying to cover the high-level types of algorithms.</p>
<p>This &#8220;nut classification&#8221; algorithm worked because the child identified features of the items that made certain pieces nut-like (hard, brown, salty), and features that made them non-nut-like, and categorized them into piles based on how nut-like they were.</p>
<p>Even though you left the child unsupervised during this process, the type of machine learning is called &#8220;<strong>supervised learning</strong>&#8220;, because you first told the kid what each item was, so he had &#8220;labels&#8221; for what was a nut and what was not a nut, to learn which features went with each classification.</p>
<p><strong>CLUSTERING</strong></p>
<p>You call over another child. You decide not to tell her anything about the items in the bowl, but tell her that she needs to divide the items in the bowl into piles, hoping she&#8217;ll separate them into nuts, candy, and &#8220;other&#8221;, but not telling her that. You want her to do more than just the &#8220;nut or not&#8221; that the first kid did, so you tell her to divide them into at least 3 groups. <strong>Because you didn&#8217;t tell her information about how to categorize each item in the bowl, this is an example of &#8220;unsupervised learning&#8221;</strong> (even if you watch her do it).</p>
<p>She stares at the bowl for a while, and you leave her alone to do the task. When you come back, there are 3 piles. One has nuts, raisins, cereal, and brown M&#038;Ms in it, and then there is a pile for each color of M&#038;Ms! She has &#8220;clustered&#8221; the items based on color similarity. She gave you more than 3 groups, but since you didn&#8217;t label the items, she picked color as what made the items most similar to one another. So you got a large brown pile that contained most of what was in the bowl (since most of the trail mix was brown), then small piles of blue, red, orange, yellow, and green M&#038;Ms.</p>
<p><strong>REGRESSION</strong></p>
<p>You decide to try the same exercise and call over a third child. This time, you just tell the kid to organize the bowl however she wants, and watch from a distance. To your dismay, she is licking every piece! You rush over and see that she has lined up all of the pieces on the ground. Most of the M&#038;Ms are toward one side of the line, and as you go down toward the other end of the line, you see mostly nuts and cereal. &#8220;What were you licking them for?,&#8221; you say. &#8220;Well duh, I had to see how sweet they each were!&#8221; she replies. She has sorted them in one dimension &#8211; testing only for sweetness, and ordering every piece into a line based on how sweet it was. </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the best example of regression &#8211; but the point is that you got a value as an output &#8211; sweetness level &#8211; as opposed to a category. It&#8217;s possible to use this sweetness level to then create categories &#8211; like creating a &#8220;candy&#8221; category by picking a certain sweetness level, and saying that anything above that is candy.</p>
<p>If you are given a new piece of trail mix, you could compare it to trail mix in the already-licked line, and probably make a good guess about how sweet it is based on how much it looks like the pieces in a particular part of the line.</p>
<p><em>I hope this helps clarify some machine learning terminology for people who like food metaphors! Add your own food-machine learning metaphors or ask questions in the comments!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since Memorial Day in the U.S. is the unofficial start of the summer season, I figured today would be a good time to launch the SUMMER OF DATA SCIENCE 2017!!!</p>
<p><strong>The Summer of Data Science is a commitment to learn something this summer to enhance your data science skills, and to share what you learned.</strong> (Those of you in the Southern Hemisphere will have to pick up the excitement when we&#8217;re winding down during our fall/your spring and keep it going! Or, join us during your Winter of Data Science!)</p>
<p>For those of you who haven&#8217;t been following me for years, a hashtag I started back in 2015, #SoDS, is actually one of the things that started growing my twitter following. Here&#8217;s the history:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/05/18/summer-of-data-science-2015/" target="_blank">Coming up with the hashtag</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/06/09/may-2015-sods-storify/" target="_blank">1st month of tweets, May 2015 Storified</a></p>
<p><a href="https://storify.com/BecomingDataSci/sods-june-2015" target="_blank">June 2015 #SoDS Storify</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t keep up the &#8216;Storification&#8217; after that, but you get the idea. It brought a bunch of us together to share our learning progress. We learned from each other, encouraged each other, and most of all geeked out about data science together!</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t launch one last year, because I was starting a new job and taking a break from recording the podcast, and just didn&#8217;t want to take on too much. But I missed it, so I didn&#8217;t want to let another year pass without a Summer of Data Science, so we&#8217;re going to do it together again this year!</p>
<p>So, here are the only &#8220;rules&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>How to participate in the Summer of Data Science:</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Pick a thing or a short list of things related to data science that you want to learn more about this summer.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Make a plan to learn it (like an online course, a practice project, etc.).</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Share that plan on social media, then post updates as you make progress, with the hashtag #SoDS17.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s it! (And yes, there&#8217;s a chef competition that used the same hashtag. No worries! Enjoy the food pics.) </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for ideas for learning projects or topics, check out the <a href="http://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/" target="_blank">Data Science Learning Club</a>! Please write about your learning experiences and share in the <a href="http://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-30.html" target="_blank">Data Science Learning Club #SoDS forum</a>, and/or on your own blog, and share on social media. I&#8217;ll check out the hashtag on twitter regularly and RT others. I&#8217;ll be participating myself, too!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the hashtag on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SoDS17" target="_blank">#SoDS17</a>. See you there!</p>
<p>P.S. Did you know that there is a <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/06/08/monday-silliness/" target="_blank">&#8220;Summer of Data Sci&#8221; song</a>? :D</p>
<p>P.P.S. There are now <a href="https://teespring.com/stores/becoming-a-data-scientist" target="_blank">Summer of Data Science 2017 t-shirts and tanks</a> in the Becoming a Data Scientist teespring shop!</p>
<p>UPDATE: Here is a twitter Moment with a selection of tweets from the #SoDS17 participants this year! (It starts out with a bunch of intro tweets from me, but click through to twitter and keep scrolling!)<br />

<p>The design is a combination of those submitted to our contest by <a href="http://twitter.com/AmarendranathD" target="_blank">Amarendranath &#8220;Amar&#8221; Reddy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/harrybelli" target="_blank">Ryne</a> &amp; <a href="http://alexisbrittany.com/" target="_blank">Alexis</a>. You can see their design submissions and read more about them on the <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2017/01/16/t-shirt-contest-finalists/" target="_blank">finalists post</a>! They are each receiving prizes for being selected. Thanks Amar, Ryne, and Alexis for the awesome design!</p>
<p>There are a variety of styles and colors available. The Premium Tee is 100% cotton. The Women&#8217;s Premium is a 50/50 cotton/poly blend, and is cut to fit more snugly. They are available in navy blue, gray, purple, and black. There&#8217;s even a long-sleeve version!</p>
<p>I make anywhere from $2-$7 on each order (it&#8217;s print-on-demand, so not cheap enough for me to make a significant profit yet, and my proceeds will be lower with the free shipping offer, but I want to reward those of you who are excited to flaunt your Becoming a Data Scientist status!) and every dollar earned from these will be going to the fund that helps support my new small team of assistants, who you&#8217;ll meet soon! Also, the more of them I sell, the lower the cost to print is per shirt, so please share with all of your friends!</p>

Here are photos of me wearing the shirt, but this was before I made the front design slightly smaller (so it doesn&#8217;t wrap into armpit), and I moved the back design slightly higher and also made the gray dots (data points?) transparent so the color of the shirt will show through there now (see store images above for current design). You can see that the teal came out as a lighter blue in printing. This is the &#8220;Premium Tee&#8221; style in &#8220;New Navy&#8221;.</center></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here&#8217;s a model wearing a simulated version of the shirt.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I still haven&#8217;t heard from one of the 3 finalists, but I wanted to go ahead and post the first two, and I&#8217;ll update here with the final one later. These finalists win a data science book and a t-shirt, and I&#8217;ll choose from the three (I&#8217;m actually considering combining elements from two of them!) and announce the final t-shirt design when they are available for sale.</p>
<p>Without further ado, the top 3 vote-winners after 94 votes, in no particular order, are&#8230;.</p>
<h2>1) Ryne</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ryne1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1276"><img src="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ryne1.jpg" alt="ryne1" width="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1276" srcset="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ryne1-300x263.jpg 300w, https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ryne1-768x672.jpg 768w, https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ryne1.jpg 896w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/harrybelli" target="_blank">Ryne</a> is an analyst for an economic consulting firm in Salt Lake City looking to transition to a career in data science. Lucky for him, his wife Alexis is a graphic designer and entered the competition in his name so he could win a book! She had a baby a few months ago and is just doing freelance design as time permits.</p>
<p>Alexis&#8217; website is <a href="http://alexisbrittany.com" target="_blank">alexisbrittany.com</a>. (Feel free to reach out if you need a designer!)</p>
<h2>2) Amarendra</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/amarendra2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1294"><img src="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/amarendra2.jpg" alt="amarendra2" width="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1294" srcset="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/amarendra2-293x300.jpg 293w, https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/amarendra2.jpg 690w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/AmarendranathD" target="_blank">Amarendra</a> (Amar) has recently moved to Philadelphia to pursue an MS in Business Intelligence and Analytics at Saint Joseph&#8217;s University. He believes in continuous learning and aspires to contribute to the field of data exploration. Upon graduation, Amar would like to work in the field of data visualization. He loves working with tableau and one of his resolutions for 2017 is to get appreciated by one of the Tableau Zen Masters. </p>
<h2>3) coming soon</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll update here as soon as I hear back from the 3rd finalist! If I don&#8217;t hear back, I may give the prizes to the 4th place winner.</p>
<p>Amar and Ryne both selected the same data science book, so I thought I&#8217;d share that here for others that may be interested. They will both be receiving The Python Data Science Handbook by <a href="https://twitter.com/jakevdp" target="_blank">Jake VanderPlas</a>:</p>

<p>For the ones that aren&#8217;t t-shirt-print-ready, I&#8217;ll get a graphic designer to tidy them up, so don&#8217;t worry about whether they&#8217;re printable when you vote. We can also vary colors and things like that later. Just pick the design you like!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve decided that I want to have Becoming a Data Scientist t-shirts to sell and to give out to podcast guests and contest winners, but I am not a graphic designer, so I need some help! So I&#8217;m going to have a t-shirt design contest!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15229-illustration-of-a-white-shirt-pv.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1216"><img src="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15229-illustration-of-a-white-shirt-pv-300x242.png" alt="15229-illustration-of-a-white-shirt-pv" width="300" height="242" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1216" srcset="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15229-illustration-of-a-white-shirt-pv-300x242.png 300w, https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15229-illustration-of-a-white-shirt-pv-768x620.png 768w, https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15229-illustration-of-a-white-shirt-pv.png 958w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Here are the rules/guidelines for entry</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Create a design that prominently says &#8220;Becoming a Data Scientist&#8221; and can be easily scaled to fit in on the front or back of a t-shirt. If you create a design for the back, also create a small &#8220;pocket sized&#8221; text or design for the front of the shirt. But I don&#8217;t have a preference &#8211; front or back of shirt designs are both fine!</p>
<p>If it can be incorporated into the design without looking too cluttered, you can also add &#8220;Podcast and Learning Club&#8221; and/or &#8220;@becomingdatasci&#8221;, but that is not a requirement. </p>
<p>The design can be just text, text with an image, more abstract, use your imagination! As long as &#8220;Becoming a Data Scientist&#8221; is clearly readable, your design will be considered. Obviously, vulgar designs will not be considered, and I&#8217;ll also remove them (or anything spammy) from the comments on this post.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t use more than 2 colors in your design itself, as more can be cost-prohibitive. The background color can be a different 3rd color.</p>
<p>Here is a site with some guidance for preparing a design for t-shirts: <a href="https://gomedia.com/zine/tutorials/pro-tips-preparing-artwork-t-shirt-printing/" target="_blank">https://gomedia.com/zine/tutorials/pro-tips-preparing-artwork-t-shirt-printing/</a><br />
(Note &#8211; I don&#8217;t expect the design to be complex or super-artistic, and a text-only design could be created in a simple text or image editor!)</p>
<p>You can even use an online shirt design program like <a href="https://www.customink.com/services/t-shirt-maker" target="_blank">CustomInk</a>, as long as the design can be extracted for use at another printing site (I&#8217;m not sure what the rules or capabilities of most of those t-shirt design websites are).</p>
<p>2. Please submit 2 files: your design itself (in a format that can be read on multiple platforms, like a PDF), large enough that it can be zoomed in to &#8220;life size&#8221;, and then also a smaller image of your design as you imagine it on a shirt &#8211; choose a shirt color and location for your design and create a little &#8220;shirt preview&#8221; image I can share with readers for the vote (this one doesn&#8217;t have to be zoomable to full size &#8211; the largest size I&#8217;d post it at is about 500&#215;500). Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions about this!</p>
<p>You can submit the files by posting a comment below. Don&#8217;t put your email in the text of the comment, I&#8217;ll be able to see it behind the scenes from the form. Make sure to include your name (it can be just your first name if you want) as you want it shared along with your design if you get selected for the voting round, along with the links to the 2 files and any link you want to point people to &#8211; your blog, your portfolio, your twitter account, etc.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 12/5/2016</strong>: It looks like I made the turnaround time short (I&#8217;d like to have at least 10 designs before the voting), and I know some people may have great ideas but not great graphic design skills, so I&#8217;m making 2 changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t need to be a &#8220;print-ready&#8221; design. If you sketch it out and your design wins, I&#8217;ll get a graphic designer to help turn it into a file to send to the t-shirt printer</li>
<li>The deadline is now extended to the end of the calendar year (see below)</li>
<p>Thank you to those of you who have entered already!!</ul>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how the contest will go</strong>:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll accept entries until 11:59pm Saturday, December 31, 2016. Over the next week, depending on how many entries there are, I&#8217;ll narrow down the selection to maybe 5-10 choices. I&#8217;ll create a blog post with the t-shirt images and names of the designers, with a way to vote on your favorite, and advertise it on <a href="https://twitter.com/becomingdatasci" target="_blank">@becomingdatasci</a> to get as many votes as possible.</p>
<p>The top 3 vote-winners will win:</p>
<ul>
<li>A t-shirt</li>
<li>A data science related book of their choice up to $60</li>
<li>Will be featured in a &#8220;finalists&#8221; blog post with their design, a little blurb about them, and a link to their website</li>
<li>A tweet with their design and a link to their site on my <a href="https://twitter.com/becomingdatasci" target="_blank">@becomingdatasci</a> twitter account.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the finalists, I&#8217;ll choose my favorite to be printed. The final winner will also get:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-3 extra t-shirts with their design to give out to friends</li>
<li>Name credited as designer wherever the t-shirt is sold</li>
<li>Additional tweets with their design announced as the winner, with a link to their site, on <a href="https://twitter.com/becomingdatasci" target="_blank">@becomingdatasci</a>.
<li>A shout-out on the Becoming a Data Scientist podcast</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know if there&#8217;s anything I forgot to detail here or if you have any questions! I look forward to seeing the submitted designs!!</p>
<p>Update: I should probably mention that any proceeds from sales of the shirts will go to support the maintenance and creation of more content at this site <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/">BecomingADataScientist.com</a>, <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/category/podcast/" target="_blank">the podcast</a>, <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/" target="_blank">the Data Science Learning Club</a>, <a href="http://www.datasciguide.com/" target="_blank">DataSciGuide</a>, and my other data science sites and social media accounts. I&#8217;ll be posting a Patreon campaign soon to raise money to hire help to keep these sites updated, and money I earn from selling t-shirts will go toward that as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just got back from <a href="http://pydata.org/dc2016/" target="_blank">PydataDC</a>, where I learned a lot, had fun, and met a bunch of awesome people! I&#8217;ll definitely write about it more later, but I wanted to share my slides here since I told the attendees they could find them on my website. I got good feedback on the talk, and I&#8217;m so glad that my message resonated with some people!</p>
<p>The talk was recorded and video should be out within a few weeks!</p>
<p>Here are the slides: <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Becoming-a-Data-Scientist-Advice-PyDataDC-shared.pdf" target="_blank">Becoming a Data Scientist &#8211; Advice from my Podcast Guests</a><br />
and the <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Becoming-a-Data-Scientist-Advice-PyDataDC-notes.pdf" target="_blank">slide notes</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is the 1st batch of results from the Becoming a Data Scientist Survey. Because of the sample size and unscientific casual nature of this survey, we can't make any broad generalizations about the industry from these results, but you can see some general preliminary trends in the breakdowns that would be interesting to study more.

95% of the 158 respondents who gave answers about their jobs follow at least one of my twitter accounts, so you can think of these results as representing my twitter followers.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is the 1st batch of results from the Becoming a Data Scientist Survey. Because of the sample size and unscientific casual nature of this survey, we can&#8217;t make any broad generalizations about the industry from these results, but you can see some general preliminary trends in the breakdowns that would be interesting to study more.</p>
<p>95% of the 158 respondents who gave answers about their jobs follow at least one of my twitter accounts, so you can think of these results as representing my twitter followers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m mostly going to let the tables and graphs speak for themselves. There&#8217;s a lot to unpack in the survey (over 50 questions), and a ton of ways to slice and dice it. Because I wanted to show various breakdowns, I did this in simple Excel pivot tables and didn&#8217;t spend a ton of time formatting (I know they&#8217;re kinda ugly &#8211; sorry).</p>
<p>If any of the tables or charts below are particularly hard to understand, please let me know and I&#8217;ll annotate further or improve! Click to view full-size.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Educational Field<br />
vs Job Title of Data Analyst or Data Scientist (yes/no)</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Computer Scientist <em>or</em> Data Sci / Statistics / Analytics Degree<br />
vs Job Title of Data Analyst or Data Scientist (yes/no)</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">30 (19%) of respondents had CS degrees, which was the most common degree name, and 27% of them had a job title that I categorized under Data Analyst or Data Scientist.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">8.3% of respondents had Data Science, Statistics, or Analytics degrees, and 38.5% of them had job titles that I categorized as Data Analyst/Scientist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Percentage of Respondents by &#8220;Considers Self Data Scientist&#8221; with each Salary Range</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">About 20% (28) of those that do not consider themselves to be Data Scientists make $50-75K. About 17% (7) of those that do consider themselves to be Data Scientists make under $25K.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/results_jobs_salary_table.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1176" target="_blank" ><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1176" src="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/results_jobs_salary_table.png" alt="salary by data scientist or not" width="500" height="269" srcset="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/results_jobs_salary_table-300x161.png 300w, https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/results_jobs_salary_table-768x413.png 768w, https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/results_jobs_salary_table.png 796w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Because the numbers above looked surprising to me, I filtered the same table to those in North America (assuming that many of the low-salary data scientists might be outside of the U.S.).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In North America, about 21% (22) of those that do not consider themselves to be Data Scientists make $50-75K. But now 25% (5) of those that do consider themselves to be Data Scientists make $125-150K. This also shows that 22 of the 42 people above (52%) that considered themselves Data Scientists live outside of North America.</p>

<p>I may release some of this data at the end of my analysis. If you&#8217;re interested in diving in yourself, let me know in the comments and I&#8217;ll work on it for a future post.</p>
<p>More results on the way in the near future! Next up, how many respondents follow each twitter account and whether more people watch or listen to the podcast!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note &#8211; I wrote this article in one sitting, and definitely want to come back later to improve it and add references, but I don&#8217;t want to hold it up from being published just because I&#8217;m hungry for dinner. :) So I&#8217;m hitting publish, but please be aware that the content may change later. And feel free to give suggestions in the comments. -Renee</strong></p>
<p><em>tl;dr: Boosting ensemble algorithms in Machine Learning use an approach that is similar to assembling a diverse team with a variety of strengths and experiences. If machines make better decisions by combining a bunch of &#8220;less qualified opinions&#8221; vs &#8220;asking one expert&#8221;, then maybe people would, too.</em></p>
<p><strong>Why is this post on this blog?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about diversity in tech lately. After the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FBNoExcuses" target="_blank">#FBNoExcuses</a> conversations on twitter, I was motivated to start <a href="http://www.untappedpipeline.com/" target="_blank">UntappedPipeline.com</a> (on twitter:<a href="https://twitter.com/untappdpipeline" target="_blank">@untappdpipeline</a>) because I know so many awesome women and people of color in tech, and it amazes me that some companies seem to think they are so rare and hard to find (hence <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-blames-lack-of-available-talent-for-diversity-problem-1468526303" target="_blank">using the &#8220;pipeline problem&#8221; as an excuse</a> for not having a diverse workforce).</p>
<p>Of course, &#8220;diversity&#8221; can mean a lot of things: gender diversity, racial/ethnic diversity, diversity of educational backgrounds, etc. &#8211; but it all really comes down to diversity of culture/thoughts. If you are interested in learning more about diversity in tech and the benefits of hiring diverse teams, check out <a href="http://www.untappedpipeline.com/resources/" target="_blank">the Resources page on UntappedPipeline.com</a>. Here&#8217;s one study in particular that highlights the economic benefits of a diverse tech workforce: <a href="http://www.dalberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Diversity_report_6.20.16x.pdf" target="_blank">Decoding Diversity</a> (Dalberg/Intel, PDF).</p>
<p>So if this post is about diversity, why am I writing it on my &#8220;Becoming a Data Scientist&#8221; blog instead of at Untapped Pipeline? Because I&#8217;ve been doing some machine learning lately that I just realized is a great metaphor for the benefits of hiring diverse teams, and this is also an opportunity to explain a data science concept. Additionally, <a href="https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci/status/547479599303892992" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve been talking</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci/status/731689507691487233" target="_blank">about data science</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci/status/714167833781862400" target="_blank">teams for a</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci/status/636745462486278144" target="_blank">long time</a>, and one of my motivations for starting the <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/category/podcast/" target="_blank">Becoming a Data Scientist podcast</a> was to feature the many paths people take to data science, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science" target="_blank">data science in itself is an interdisciplinary job</a> that requires a variety (diversity) of experience: primarily in statistics, computer programming, and &#8220;business&#8221; (or domain knowledge), but really there is a very broad set of skills that come into play when doing data science, and no one has them all (<a href="https://ironholds.org/blog/data-science-is-not-magical-unicorn-foo/" target="_blank">relevant rant</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/quominus" target="_blank">@quominus</a>). I will list some references about building Data Science teams at the end of the post.</p>
<p>There are two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">machine learning</a> algorithms I&#8217;ve used recently that illustrate the specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ensemble_learning" target="_blank">&#8220;ensemble learning&#8221;</a> concept I want to focus on: <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html" target="_blank">Random Forest</a> and <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier" target="_blank">Gradient Boosting</a> Classifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Random Forest</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest" target="_blank">Random Forest</a> Classifier works like this: You may have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree" target="_blank">Decision Trees</a>, which are pretty much just &#8220;if then&#8221; classifiers that end up generating a set of rules: &#8220;If Attribute 1 is in this range of values, and Attribute 2 is this boolean value, and Attribute 3 is greater than this value, then out of all of the possible results, this one is most likely.&#8221; Every example you feed into it will drop into one of the possible outcomes, with a certain probability of being correct. The article &#8220;<a href="http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/" target="_blank">A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning</a>&#8221; has a great animated illustration of how decision trees work.</p>
<p>What a Random Forest does is build up a whole bunch of &#8220;dumb&#8221; decision trees by only analyzing a subset of the data at a time. A limited set of features (columns) from a portion of the overall records (rows) is used to generate each decision tree, and the &#8220;depth&#8221; of the tree (and/or size of the &#8220;leaves&#8221;, the number of examples that fall into each final bin) is limited as well. So the trees in the model are &#8220;trained&#8221; with only a portion of the available data and therefore don&#8217;t indivisually generate very accurate classifications. </p>
<p>However, it turns out that when you combine the results of a bunch of these &#8220;dumb&#8221; trees (also known as &#8220;weak learners&#8221;), the combined result is usually even better than the most finely-tuned single full decision tree. (So you can see how the algorithm got its name &#8211; a whole bunch of small trees, somewhat randomly generated, but used in combination is a random forest!) </p>
<p>When you combine multiple methods to determine a result in machine learning, it is called ensemble learning. In particular, when you use a bunch of weak learners and combine them by having them vote on the outcome (whichever outcome occurs most often for a particular record wins), iteratively improve the outcome, or average the results in some way to create a result that is stronger than any single-pass approach, that is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning)">boosting</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Gradient Boosting</strong></p>
<p>Another type of boosting is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting">Gradient Boosting</a>. The approach is actually very similar to the Random Forest algorithm, except (as far as I understand it), it uses a type of optimization called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent" target="_blank">Gradient Descent</a>, which minimizes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function" target="_blank">loss function</a>. Basically, each time it generates a decision tree, it&#8217;s using what it learned the last time it generated one to make the next one a little less bad (reducing cost/loss). </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to go to far into the technical details here, partially because that&#8217;s not really the point of this article, and partly because I start having flashbacks to my Optimization class in grad school, which was not a happy experience.</p>
<p>There are other boosting algorithms like Adaptive Boosting (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost" target="_blank">AdaBoost</a>) and other ensemble methods in machine learning to explore. Some of them are described in the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html" target="_blank">scikit-learn (machine learning python package) documentation</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>So back to my original point</strong></p>
<p>Now that I have the explanations out of the way, I can get back to the point I wanted to make. Notice how these algorithms work. Each &#8220;weak learner&#8221; only has some of the information needed to make a good guess to classify something. In fact, they&#8217;re often incorrect on their own, because they just don&#8217;t have the experience that a big &#8220;solo&#8221; algorithm has with the data. (Imagine a bunch of weird-looking small trees vs one big gorgeous well-developed oak tree.) However, when you combine the wide variety of partial experiences that the &#8220;weak learners&#8221; provide, their combined guess turns out to actually be better than the guess made by the one big fully-formed tree.</p>

<p>So, think of the same concept for building a Data Science Team. There is currently a shortage of &#8220;experts&#8221; in data science, and most companies don&#8217;t seem to know what kind of data scientist they need anyway. Some companies are lamenting the lack of &#8220;qualified&#8221; data scientists (i.e. &#8220;unicorns&#8221; that have all of the necessary skills and experience already), while in the meantime, there are plenty of business analysts, software developers, UX designers, subject matter experts, people that do similar work in other fields (like biotechnology, cognitive science, etc etc etc), and people that are on their way to becoming data scientists and only have a portion of the requisite skills and knowledge. Some companies are just &#8220;pattern matching&#8221; and trying to hire people that are exactly like their existing successful employees (though it&#8217;s unlikely they have even defined what they mean by &#8220;successful employees&#8221;).</p>
<p>However, if you know how to find creative and motivated &#8220;go-getters&#8221; that want to learn on the job and contribute to a team, and each person on the team has a portion of the needed experience and skills, there is a good chance that in combination (if given good support and resources!) that a small group of &#8220;junior data scientists with other relevant skills&#8221; will actually turn out better than hiring one or two &#8220;experts&#8221; in the first place. Plus, they cost less. Plus, they are likely very trainable. Plus, they really want to make a difference and prove themselves as capable data scientists.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m making a lot of generalizations here, and need to go back and fill in some of my comments in this last section with references, but you can see what I&#8217;m getting at. For those in tech that have a really hard time believing that that &#8220;scrappy new business analyst&#8221; with a non-terminal non-computer-science degree from a non-ivy-league school that doesn&#8217;t have many years of experience doing the exact kind of work you want them to do at your company won&#8217;t be &#8220;qualified&#8221; to fill a Data Science position, maybe it will help to think of the problem as one that Boosting will solve. Create an &#8220;ensemble&#8221; of &#8220;learners&#8221; that may individually only have a subset of the experience and may be self-taught and not do everything the &#8220;right&#8221; way when tasked to do it alone, but can each contribute their wide variety of experiences and skills to come up with a final solution as a team. I&#8217;m willing to bet that the solutions generated by a diverse group with less-than-ideal credentials (but a wider breadth of experience) will turn out better than what an &#8220;expert&#8221; (or homogenous group) would come up with on their own anyway, because <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/03/21/292225798/does-diversity-on-research-team-improve-quality-of-science" target="_blank">the research shows</a> that <a href="http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/better_decisions_through_diversity" target="_blank">it usually does</a>. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16385.full" target="_blank">Just do the math</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For anyone that hasn&#8217;t yet joined the Becoming a Data Scientist Podcast<a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/index.php" target="_blank"> Data Science Learning Club</a>, I thought I&#8217;d write up a summary of what we&#8217;ve been doing!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-2.html" target="_blank">The first activity</a> involved setting up a development environment. Some people are using R, some using python, and there are several different development tools represented. <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-2.html" target="_blank">In this thread</a>, several people posted what setup they were using. I posted a &#8220;hello world&#8221; program and the code to output the package versions.</p>
<p>Activities 1-3 built upon one another to explore a dataset and generate descriptive statistics and visuals, culminating with a business Q&#038;A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-8.html" target="_blank">Activity 1</a> &#8211; Find &#038; Explore a Dataset</li>
<li><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-10.html" target="_blank">Activity 2</a> &#8211; Visuals for Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
<li><a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-11.html" target="_blank">Activity 3</a> &#8211; Business Questions &#038; Data Answers</li>
</ul>
<p>I analyzed a subset of data from the <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/eBirdReports" target="_blank">eBird bird observation dataset</a> from Cornell Ornithology for these activities. Some highlights included:<br />
<br />&#8211; <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/thread-65.html" target="_blank">Learning how to use the pandas</a> python package to explore a dataset (<a href="https://github.com/paix120/DataScienceLearningClubActivities/blob/master/Activity01/Activity1b.py" target="_blank">code</a>)<br />
<br />&#8211; Learning how to create cool exploratory visuals in <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/thread-89-post-343.html" target="_blank">Seaborn</a> and <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/thread-89-post-404.html#pid404" target="_blank">Tableau</a>. Here is an example scatterplot matrix made in Seaborn:<br />
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paix120/DataScienceLearningClubActivities/master/Activity02/Seaborn_ScatterplotMatrix_SelectCols.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paix120/DataScienceLearningClubActivities/master/Activity02/Seaborn_ScatterplotMatrix_SelectCols.png" width="500"></a><br />
<br />&#8211; I was most excited to learn <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/thread-116.html" target="_blank">how to build interactive Jupyter Notebook inputs</a>, which I used to control Bokeh data visualizations to display Ruby-Throated Hummingbird migration into North America (<a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/paix120/DataScienceLearningClubActivities/blob/master/Activity03/Hummingbird%20Migration%20Interactive%20Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb" target="_blank">notebook</a>). Unfortunately, until I host them on a server where you can run the &#8220;live&#8221; version, you won&#8217;t be able to see the interactive widgets (a slider and dynamic dropdowns), but you can see a video of the slider working here:<br />
<iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKu4tSWfc3M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my final output for Activity 3, a Jupyter Notebook (with code hidden, and unfortunately interactive widgets disabled) with the Q&#038;A about the hummingbird migration:<br />
<a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/paix120/DataScienceLearningClubActivities/blob/master/Activity03/Hummingbird%20Migration%20Interactive%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20-%20Code%20Hidden.ipynb">Ruby-Throated Hummingbird Migration into North America<br />
<img src="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/jupyter_notebook_1.jpg" width="500"></a><br />
<br />
Activity 4 was built as a catch-up week for those of us who were behind, but had some ideas of <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-12.html">math concepts to learn</a> for those who had time.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re currently working on <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-13.html" target="_blank">Activity 5</a>, our first machine learning activity where we&#8217;re implementing Naive Bayes Classification.</p>
<p>All of my work is available in this github repository: <a href="https://github.com/paix120/DataScienceLearningClubActivities" target="_blank">https://github.com/paix120/DataScienceLearningClubActivities</a></p>
<p>I strongly encourage you to <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/index.php" target="_blank">click through the forums</a> and look at some of the other data explorations the members have been doing, including analysis of NFL data, personal music listening habits, transportation in London, German Soccer League data, top-grossing movies, and more!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never too late to join the Data Science Learning Club! If you aren&#8217;t sure where to start, check out <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/thread-1.html" target="_blank">the welcome message</a> for some clarification.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post again when I complete some of the machine learning activities!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I'm working on the last of my recording and editing for "Episode 0" of the new Becoming A Data Scientist Podcast, which I'm planning to launch tomorrow! I've already recorded the interviews for episodes 1-3, which will be airing over the next month or so - so exciting! The guests all had interesting and informative things to share, I believe you'll like it a lot.

At the end of each podcast episode, I'll be "assigning" a "Learning Activity" for the Data Science Learning Club. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m working on the last of my recording and editing for &#8220;Episode 0&#8221; of the new Becoming A Data Scientist Podcast, which I&#8217;m planning to launch tomorrow! I&#8217;ve already recorded the interviews for episodes 1-3, which will be airing over the next month or so &#8211; so exciting! The guests all had interesting and informative things to share, I believe you&#8217;ll like it a lot.</p>
<p>At the end of each podcast episode, I&#8217;ll be &#8220;assigning&#8221; a &#8220;Learning Activity&#8221; for the Data Science Learning Club. So that is starting tomorrow, too! There won&#8217;t be anyone teaching the content, but we&#8217;ll be exploring it together for 1-2 weeks between podcast episodes (usually 2 weeks). I&#8217;ll post some resources to get everyone started and help out data science beginners, then we&#8217;ll each explore the activity on our own with whatever tools and techniques we choose, and we can post our results so we can all learn from one another. If anyone gets stuck, you can post a question to the forum and hopefully someone will be able to help you through it.</p>
<p>I just got the Data Science Learning Club forum set up today, and it&#8217;s at this URL: <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub" target="_blank">https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub</a></p>
<p>Go check it out, register so you can participate, read the <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-7.html" target="_blank">Welcome thread</a>, and introduce yourself in the <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-4.html" target="_blank">Meet &#038; Greet section</a>! Then tomorrow, the first learning activity will launch and you can get started. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m so excited about launching this podcast and data science learning club, and hope this turns out to be a valuable experience for all of us! Keep an eye out on the blog for the podcast post, which should go up tomorrow!</p>
<p>Renee</p>
