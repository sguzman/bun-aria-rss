      <title>Land of the Giants – “Facebook Gets a Face Lift”</title>
      <description>We are sharing the first episode of Land of the Giants: The Facebook/ Meta Disruption. Long before Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook Meta and made an unprecedented pivot into the metaverse, he invented a feature that turned Facebook into a social network behemoth. The News Feed, which put your friends’ status updates onto your homepage, changed how we interact online. It was a strong statement of Zuckerberg’s values: that connecting and sharing at scale would be de-facto good for the world. It was also his first public controversy. Follow Land of the Giants to get new episodes every Wednesday.

We are conducting a short audience survey to hear from you. To participate, head to vox.com/podsurvey, and thank you!

Air conditioning is one way, but depending on what kind of AC unit you have, it could be actually polluting the air and making the problem worse. Umair Irfan, climate reporter at Vox, has been looking into this (extremely frustrating) air conditioning paradox.

      <title>What can you learn from the guy who built the iPod?</title>
      <description>Peter Kafka talks with Tony Fadell, who helped bring the iPod and iPhone to life, and then built and sold Nest, the smart home company. 
His new book is “Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making.” Fadell talks about how developing a product begins with creating its “story,” and why he fought so hard to include a $3 screwdriver in Nest thermostat boxes. He also touches on some high-profile failures, unintended consequences, and why he doesn’t want to dance in the metaverse.
Featuring: Tony Fadell (@tfadell), Tech Investor &amp; Entrepreneur, author of "Build"

      <title>Is there a hack for enlightenment?</title>
      <description>Vox's Sigal Samuel talks with scholars and authors Wesley Wildman and Kate Stockly about their book, Spirit Tech: The Brave New World of Consciousness Hacking and Enlightenment Engineering. They discuss high-tech tools like brain stimulation and neurofeedback-guided meditation that purport to enrich our spiritual lives, what possible risks they may pose to our psyches, and the ethical implications of technology-induced shortcuts to transformative meditative states. They also talk about whether such spiritual experiences are authentic rather than simulated, and whether brain-based spirit tech might help humans evolve as a species.

      <title>In your off-time, Slack off</title>
      <description>In the modern era, there are a glut of ways for us to communicate with one another. In our professional lives, this can create an expectation that we are all always reachable. So as we try to create more room for our personal lives, could simply ignoring that email or Slack message from work be the best way to say “not right now?” Our guest, Erica Dhawan, author of Digital Body Language, thinks so.

      <title>Covering Russia-Ukraine, online and on the ground</title>
      <link>https://megaphone.link/VMP1667956332</link>
      <description>Recode Media's Peter Kafka talks to three reporters about the realities of covering the war in Ukraine and sorting truth from disinformation -- from the ground, from afar, and online.
In Ukraine: CNN’s Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward discusses the challenges of war reporting in 2022, everything from planning food and exit routes to working with a remote team to analyze online videos.
In DC: Puck co-founder and Washington correspondent Julia Ioffe talk about how hard it is to learn what Russians think about what's going on, and how long she expects the war to hold the American people's interest.
Finally, Jane Lytvynenko, a senior research fellow at Harvard's Shorenstein Center, gives us a crash course on Russia’s history of disinformation dissemination. She also tells us about Telegram, which essentially functions as “Eastern European Twitter."
Featuring: Clarissa Ward (@clarissaward), Chief International Correspondent for CNN
Julia Ioffe (@juliaioffe), Co-Founder and Washington Correspondent for Puck
Jane Lytvynenko (@JaneLytv), Senior Research Fellow at Harvard's Shorenstein Center

      <title>Uber, but for TV</title>
      <description>When Recode’s Peter Kafka advises you not to write your book, WRITE THAT BOOK. That’s the lesson Mike Isaac learned: His book “Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber” is now a Showtime series starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Not only that, Showtime announced that Mike’s next, yet-to-be-finished book about Facebook will be the basis of season 2. Peter talks to Mark about what it’s like to shift from the world of reporting to prestige TV drama.

      <title>America needs more internet</title>
      <description>The bipartisan infrastructure bill that passed in late 2021 includes substantial funds for expanding broadband internet access to close the digital divide in America. How much money is going to be spent? How and when will the funds be allocated? And in what ways can this process best serve the communities that need it the most? Blair Levin from The Brookings Institution explains.
Blair Levin’s series: 


Steps the states should take to achieve the infrastructure bill's broadband goals 

States' best chance for permanent broadband affordability requires action now


Steps the Commerce Department should take to achieve the infrastructure bill's broadband goals

      <title>Why we can't pay attention anymore</title>
      <description>Sean Illing talks with the author Johann Hari about his new book Stolen Focus, which explores what's happening — and what's already happened — to our attention. They discuss how exactly Big Tech "stole" our ability to focus, what many leading scientists say about how we are psychologically and physiologically changed by the powerful new draws on our attention, and whether or not we need an "attention rebellion" to fight back against the tech giants, whose business models depend on us getting easily distracted.

      <title>Are we living in a simulation?</title>
      <description>Sean Illing talks with philosopher David Chalmers about virtual worlds and the nature of reality, and other topics that stem from Chalmers's new book Reality+. In this far-reaching discussion, Sean and Prof. Chalmers get into the makeup of human consciousness, the question of whether we're living in a computer simulation, and — of course — The Matrix. Are digital worlds genuine realities, or will their proliferation lead to a troublesome turning away from the physical world?
Host: Sean Illing (@seanilling), Interviews Writer, Vox
Guest: David Chalmers, University Professor of Philosophy and Neural Science, NYU; co-director, Center for Mind, Brain, and Consciousness

      <title>Jill Lepore on Elon Musk's imaginary world</title>
      <description>Sean Illing talks with historian Jill Lepore about her new podcast: The Evening Rocket explores Elon Musk and the new form of extravagant, extreme capitalism — which Lepore dubs "Muskism" — that he has ushered in. They discuss the formative role played by science fiction stories, why the super-wealthy are drawn to space travel, and why, according to Lepore, Elon Musk is not much of a futurist after all.

      <title>How social media threatens humanity</title>
      <description>Social media has, in an incredibly short period of time, drastically restructured the way we communicate. But there's a problem: We know very little about its dangers. A new paper in the scientific journal PNAS argues that if left misunderstood and unchecked, we could see unintended consequences of new technology. Recode's Shirin Ghaffary spoke with Mirta Galesic and Jay Van Bavel, two co-authors of the paper, to learn more.

      <title>TikTok is making tax policy cool</title>
      <description>TikTok is the go-to place for memes and dance videos.

      <title>The inside story of HBO</title>
      <description>For nearly 50 years, HBO has kept us riveted with movies and TV shows. But its behind-the-scenes stories are equally compelling.
James Andrew Miller is the author of definitive oral histories of media institutions like Saturday Night Live, ESPN and, most recently, HBO. He explains how the company ascended to power; why attempts to combine the company with Apple and other suitors never happened; what really happened when AT&amp;T decided to buy and then sell HBO’s parent company; and what happens to HBO in a world where it competes with deep-pocketed rivals like Netflix and Disney.
﻿Featuring: Jim Miller (@jimmiller), Journalist and Author ofTinderbox: HBO’s Ruthless Pursuit of New Frontiers.

      <title>The highs and lows of the "creator economy"</title>
      <description>Vox's Rebecca Jennings talks with Taylor Lorenz, tech culture reporter for the New York Times, about the creator economy: what it is, who's in it, and why more people are paying attention to it. They also talk about the hidden toll of running your own individual media company, the elusive term "cheugy," and the perils of reporting on internet culture and becoming (as Taylor occasionally has) part of the story.

      <title>Facebook’s secret research, explained</title>
      <description>Recently, the Wall Street Journal uncovered some damning internal research at Facebook regarding the impact of social media on our mental health, democracy, and society at large. 

The WSJ’s Jeff Horwitz (@JeffHorwitz) joins Recode Daily to break down his reporting: “This research made it to me because the people who I worked with were very clear that it wasn't getting acted on appropriately in the first place.”

      <title>Instagram is bad for teens’ self-esteem, and it knows it</title>
      <description>New reporting from the Wall Street Journal confirms what many teens already knew: Instagram can be harmful to their body image and self-esteem. And as it turns out, the company knows it too. Recode Media’s Peter Kafka (@pkafka) asked Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, about these revelations.

Players say it’s all fun and games, but the lines are blurred when adult users get involved. E.J. Dickson (@ejdickson) with Rolling Stone joins Recode Daily to explain.

      <title>How the levees held</title>
      <description>Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana on Sunday, August 29. The powerful storm grew to Category 4 by the time it crashed into the coast, and with a storm this strong, one big question was on everybody’s mind: Will the levees hold this time? They did, and here to explain how they worked is Associated Press reporter Jeff Amy (@jeffamy).

Jeff wrote an explainer about the new levee system in New Orleans.

      <title>Mandating vaccines shouldn’t be a restaurant worker’s job</title>
      <description>In some parts of the US, customers in bars and restaurants are now required to show proof of vaccination against Covid-19 in order to enter the business. This can give servers, hosts, and bartenders peace of mind when they go into work, but it also puts the burden of enforcing the rules on those same employees. As Recode’s Rebecca Heilweil (@rebheilweil) explains, this can mean less tip income and an increasingly hostile work environment.

She sits down with Recode’s Peter Kafka to discuss some of her latest stories in her column like why “Tech Can’t Fix Everything”, how society rather than social media itself is more to blame for the spread of misinformation.

      <title>Big Tech’s Taliban problem</title>
      <description>For the first time in 20 years, the Taliban controls Afghanistan. This change in power raises questions for companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as they have to figure out how to handle what was once considered an insurgent, terrorist-affiliated group now potentially governing an entire country. Vox’s Jen Kirby (@j_kirby1) explains.

      <title>Is the future of work in employees’ hands?</title>

Do American workers have the motivation – and opportunity – to change the status quo? These are all questions we had, so Recode’s Rani Molla asked them for us. She talked to Tsedal Neeley, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, and here is part of their conversation.

      <title>TikTok is making tax policy cool</title>
      <description>TikTok is the go-to place for memes and dance videos. But sometimes those pieces of content can play a critical role in letting lawmakers know which policies are working and which ones are not. Today, the Washington Post’s Dave Jorgenson (@davejorgenson) and Vox’s Dylan Matthews (@dylanmatt) join Recode Daily to discuss how TikTok is influencing American democracy and encouraging civic engagement.

      <title>Why am I so invested in Alabama sorority TikTok?</title>

      <title>Tesla is in trouble with the US government</title>
      <description>Tesla is in trouble. The US government is investigating Autopilot, a feature that Elon Musk says could turn Teslas into fully self-driving cars. Tesla has had numerous issues with the Autopilot program, but this investigation — the biggest one yet — is specifically looking at crashes involving emergency vehicles. What does this inquiry mean for the company? Andrew Hawkins (@andyjayhawk), a senior transportation reporter at The Verge, explains. 

Read some of Recode’s coverage of Tesla.

      <title>Why it’s always moms</title>
      <description>We know that working mothers had a really hard time during the pandemic. It was untenable. Three million women left the workforce last year, and less than half have returned. But why was it so common for moms to quit instead of dads? Recode’s Rani Molla talks with sociologist Jessica Calarco about the structural and cultural forces that make it easier for women to quit their jobs to take care of the kids.

Read Rani’s story here. 

If you’re interested in Jessica Calarco’s work, you can find her recent paper here.

      <title>Apple’s plan to protect kids by scanning your iPhone</title>
      <description>Apple announced new child safety features for the upcoming iOS 15 update. But, one of the measures has privacy advocates in an uproar: the ability to scan photos for child sexual abuse material on the iPhone itself. Recode’s Sara Morrison (@saramorrison) breaks down this new technology. 

Read Sara’s story about Apple’s new features here.

And John Gruber wrote an excellent, in-depth analysis of the new updates.

      <title>On tonight’s menu: Your personal data</title>
      <description>QR codes have been around for almost 30 years, but they’ve seen renewed interest during the pandemic. They’re convenient for customers, and they can help restaurant owners sell more. But they’re also a useful tool for collecting customers’ private data, and that’s raising red flags. Erin Woo (@erinkwoo) with the New York Times talks with Recode’s Adam Clark Estes about the privacy concerns behind QR codes.

      <title>Facebook banned researchers studying ... Facebook</title>
      <description>At this point, it’s old news that Facebook has a misinformation problem. Not just in user posts and comments, but within advertiser content, too. And a research team at the NYU Ad Observatory project has been studying exactly that — misinformation in ads on Facebook — since 2018. But then, last week, Facebook deleted their accounts. Recode’s Shirin Ghaffary (@shiringhaffary) talks to the lead researcher, Laura Edelson (@LauraEdelson2), about what happened.

      <description>Citizen, the controversial safety app, has a new feature called Protect. For $20 a month, you get extra security and access to Protect Agents, who can monitor your location and call for help. It’s kind of like OnStar, but not for your car. Is this service worth paying for? Recode’s Sara Morrison (@saramorrison) explains.

Read Sara’s story about Citizen Protect.

      <title>The risks of “buy now, pay later” apps</title>
      <description>Square just announced they’re buying out Afterpay, a “buy now, pay later” app. The move could mean CashApp will soon offer the option to pay for everything in four easy payments. It’s a trend that’s gaining traction among young shoppers, but as Vox’s Terry Nguyen (@terrygtnguyen) explains, it comes with risks.

      <title>Tech companies: No shot, no coming back to the office</title>
      <description>Without a federal mandate in place, tech companies have started requiring their employees to get the Covid-19 vaccine before they return to work in person. First, it was Google and Facebook. Now, more companies in other industries are following suit. Recode’s Shirin Ghaffary (@shiringhaffary) joins Rani Molla to talk more about this trend.

      <description>The best place to watch the Olympics this year is TikTok. The videos – including behind-the-scenes clips of the Olympic Village, the training centers, and those cardboard beds that quickly went viral – have amassed billions of views on the popular social media app. As Vox senior reporter Rebecca Jennings (@rebexxxxa) wrote, “This year’s Olympics may be cursed, but on TikTok, they’re fun as hell.”

      <title>A priest’s cautionary tale in dating and data privacy</title>
      <description>Earlier this month, a Catholic media outlet published a story exposing a priest for using the dating app Grindr, costing him his job. The article was based on private location data that was traced to a phone belonging to the priest. 
The incident highlights the shortcomings of the country’s inadequate privacy laws. Recode’s Sara Morrison (@SaraMorrison) joins us today to break down what happened.

      <title>Big Retail is watching you</title>
      <description>Some of the country’s biggest retailers are being accused of using face recognition technology without customers’ knowledge. Stores can use this biometric data to predict people’s shopping habits and send targeted ads their way. Privacy advocates say the technology should be kept out of the hands of private companies.

      <title>Congress vs. Covid lies</title>
      <description>Well over a year into the pandemic, and major social media platforms are still failing to moderate Covid-19 misinformation. With cases rising in all 50 states, the delta variant rapidly spreading, and the vaccination rate slowing… things appear to be getting worse. But, a new bill proposed in the senate targeting health misinformation online could change that. Recode’s Shirin Ghaffary (@shiringhaffary) explains.

      <title>Why Netflix wants to be a gaming app</title>
      <description>Netflix is betting on gaming to be its next big offering. The company saw lackluster growth as the world began to come out of the pandemic lockdown, so now it’s hoping a free library of video games will be enough to get users to stick around — and to bring in new ones. Recode senior correspondent Peter Kafka (@pkafka) talks with Rani Molla about the company’s latest venture.

      <title>The rest stop doctor’s appointment</title>
      <description>When you were stuck at home last year, did you visit a doctor online? For some people, it was a convenient option; for others, it gave them potentially life-saving care from out of state. But what happens now that states are ending the lockdown-era provisions that made those telehealth visits possible? Katie Palmer (@katiempalmer), health tech correspondent at Stat News, explains.

      <title>Roblox: 40 million games in one</title>
      <description>Roblox is one of the fastest growing games in the world right now. But depending on who you ask, some would say it’s more than a game. The app lets users not only play, but also join virtual birthday parties, attend real-time concerts, or just roam around a seemingly infinite digital world.

Developers of Roblox say the app is more focused on creating “experiences” than “games.” The Verge’s Jay Peters (@jaypeters) joins Rani Molla to help explain what that means.

      <description>The new documentary Roadrunner takes a look at the life of Anthony Bourdain, the late celebrity chef, author, and travel show host. But one decision by the filmmakers is raising questions: The film uses artificial intelligence to recreate Bourdain’s voice. Vox’s Alissa Wilkinson joins Recode’s Rani Molla to discuss the ethical dilemma the documentary poses.

      <title>Yes, iPhones can be hacked</title>
      <description>iPhones have a reputation for being unhackable. But that’s not exactly the case. This weekend, we learned about Pegasus, software specifically designed to hack iPhones. This raises questions about who is using this software and why, but raises an even bigger question: are iPhones actually that secure? Recode’s Sara Morrison (@saramorrison) explains.

The Washington Post also had a great Q&amp;A about Pegasus

      <title>How much does it cost to leave Earth?</title>
      <description>Rich entrepreneurs have taken significant steps in recent weeks to make civilian space travel a reality. But that reality is only accessible to those who can afford the staggeringly expensive ticket.

New York magazine’s Paola Rosa-Aquino (@prosaaquino) joins Recode’s Rani Molla to discuss billionaires’ latest space efforts and break down the cost to board a rocket to the stars.

      <title>Bring on the 4-day workweek</title>
      <description>The pandemic changed where we work and how we work — and our work-life balance pretty much disappeared. That’s especially true for working mothers, who did more child care and household labor than their male partners. Now, as people start to reevaluate the meaning of work, American work culture is in the spotlight. Recode’s Rani Molla (@ranimolla) and Vox’s Anna North (@annanorthtweets) discuss.

      <title>Social media’s racial bias problem</title>
      <description>Social media has a problem with racism, and it knows it. But as social media giants like Facebook and Twitter promise to make things better, their users still have to deal with the consequences, whether that’s being exposed to racist trolls or having their content unfairly flagged. Today on Recode Daily we are talking about two recent events that highlight these problems: the European soccer championship and a recent accusation that Black creators are being censored on TikTok. Recode’s Shirin Ghaffary (@shiringhaffary) explains.

      <title>Why is everything so expensive right now?</title>
      <description>Lots of consumer products and services have gotten more expensive over the last year, when the pandemic threw prices out of whack. Some have worried this could signal a coming period of stagnation, or even an economic collapse. But economists say these unstable costs are likely just the economy working itself out. Vox’s Emily Stewart (@EmilyStewartM) and Rani Molla explain.

      <title>How social media threatens humanity</title>
      <description>Social media has, in an incredibly short period of time, drastically restructured the way we communicate. But there's a problem: We know very little about its dangers. A new paper in the scientific journal PNAS argues that if left misunderstood and unchecked, we could see unintended consequences of new technology. Recode's Shirin Ghaffary spoke with Mirta Galesic and Jay Van Bavel, two co-authors of the paper, to learn more.

      <title>The real reason Trump is suing Big Tech </title>
      <description>Donald Trump filed lawsuits against Facebook, Twitter, and Google last week, accusing the companies of violating his and other conservatives’ First Amendment rights. The cases likely won’t hold up in court, but winning these lawsuits seems to be beside the point for the former president. Recode’s Shirin Ghaffary (@shiringhaffary) explains. Read her story here.

      <title>A billionaire, a cryptocurrency, and a disaster in India</title>
      <description>Crypto philanthropy is a burgeoning field, and one with lots of unique complications. Take the case of Vitalik Buterin, the programmer who co-founded the cryptocurrency ethereum, and his recent donation to a charity in India to help respond to the Covid-19 crisis there. He gave $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency, including $1 billion in a memecoin called Shiba Inu coin. And, well, that gift didn’t work out as planned. Former Recode senior reporter Teddy Schleifer discusses what happened with Buterin’s donation and what it might mean for other crypto donations like it.

Vox senior correspondent, Anna North, explains what’s behind a growing movement to love the skin we’re in, no matter what age.

      <title>What does “monopoly” mean in the internet age?</title>
      <description>A Washington, DC, judge dismissed a lawsuit that accused Facebook of behaving like a monopoly, claiming the suit did not have enough detail. It’s a big win for the social media giant, but it’s also become a rallying cry for lawmakers who say it’s time to update the country’s outdated antitrust laws. Recode’s Shirin Ghaffary (@shiringhaffary) explains.

        <![CDATA[<p>A Washington, DC, judge dismissed a lawsuit that accused Facebook of behaving like a monopoly, claiming the suit did not have enough detail. It’s a big win for the social media giant, but it’s also become a rallying cry for lawmakers who say it’s time to update the country’s outdated antitrust laws.

Recode’s Rani Molla (@ranimolla) talks with Mark Muro from the Brookings Institution about his latest research on this topic.

      <description>When you buy or use a product that’s connected to the internet, you don’t necessarily have full control. Companies that make these gadgets — phones, home security cameras, smart speakers — can access their products, and if they want, change how they work. Some Peloton users recently experienced this firsthand. Recode’s Sara Morrison (@saramorrison) explains.

      <title>Should Instagram influencers unionize?</title>
      <description>Content creators and online business owners have benefited from an influx of customers during lockdown, and companies like Instagram are taking notice. As Vox’s Terry Nguyen (@terrygtnguyen) explains, Facebook and Instagram have started implementing new features to help creators maximize profits, but in the process, they’re also tightening their grip on the influencer economy.

      <title>Big Tech is scared of Lina Khan</title>
      <description>For a few years now, Congress and regulatory agencies have been issuing warnings for Big Tech. And in the past week, those threats got more real. On June 11, Congress introduced five antitrust bills that target Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, and could potentially break up their core businesses. A few days later, the White House appointed Lina Khan, a big enemy for Big Tech, as a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that enforces antitrust laws. Then they made her the leader. Recode’s Shirin Ghaffary (@shiringhaffary) explains.

      <title>Why UFOs are back</title>
      <description>Later this month, Congress is expecting to receive a long-awaited report from the Pentagon revealing their investigations into unidentified flying objects. But there’s also been a handful of examples of pretty compelling video footage captured by the US Navy that’s behind this current wave of interest in UFOs. Vox’s Dylan Matthews explains

      <title>Where on the internet is Donald Trump?</title>
      <description>The former president was kicked off social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube in the wake of the Capitol riots, and it’s not clear when — or if — they’re going to let him back on. There’s been buzz about Trump starting his own platform, but he’s had a hard time getting it off the ground thus far: The blog he launched in May folded in less than a month. In a way, Trump canceled himself. Shirin Ghaffary, a senior reporter at Recode, discusses life on the internet without the man who used to be one of its most ferocious voices

      <title>Why the internet is a luxury</title>
      <description>Think about everything you did yesterday. Now imagine how the day would have gone if you didn’t have the internet. Access to the internet isn’t as universal as you might think. Millions of Americans don’t have access to broadband, because of either where they live or what they can afford. But there’s another big, more insidious factor: politics. Vox senior reporter Emily Stewart (@emilystewartm) is here to discuss.

References: 
Rani wrote about low-income Americans’ access to broadband.

      <itunes:subtitle>America already had a problem with internet access. The pandemic showed us just how bad that problem was. </itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Think about everything you did yesterday. Now imagine how the day would have gone if you didn’t have the internet. Access to the internet isn’t as universal as you might think. Millions of Americans don’t have access to broadband, because of either where they live or what they can afford. But there’s another big, more insidious factor: politics. Vox senior reporter Emily Stewart (@emilystewartm) is here to discuss.

      <title>Congress’s plans to break up Big Tech</title>
      <description>Last week, House Democrats on the Antitrust Subcommittee announced legislation aimed to check the power of Big Tech: namely Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. As a number of Republicans co-sponsored the bills, things seem promising that congress may soon upend the business models of these tech giants. Recode’s Shirin Ghaffary, who’s been following antitrust reform explains which bill seems most promising.

      <title>I got my (digital) driver's license last week</title>
      <description>We’ve all done it, we’ve all left the house without our wallet. And that used to be a big problem. You couldn’t buy anything, and certainly couldn't get that after-work bottle of wine without your ID. But thanks to mobile wallets, you can now pay with your phone. And coming this fall, people in certain states will be able to store a copy of their driver’s license on their iPhone, meaning that after-work bottle of wine? It’s yours, even if you forget your wallet. Here to explain digital driver’s licenses is Recode’s Rebecca Heilweil.

      <title>The ugly truth about credit card points</title>
      <description>If you’re like most Americans, you probably have a credit card that offers rewards such as points, cash back, or miles. Credit card rewards programs are extremely popular: Nearly seven in 10 Americans use at least one rewards-earning card. Many people even have multiple cards. But what you might not know is how those rewards are paid for. No, it’s not the credit card companies—it’s the person in line behind you at the corner store who used cash to pay for their items. Vox’s Emily Stewart (@emilystewartm) explains.

      <title>Elon Musk is a stonckfluencer</title>
      <description>Back in 2018, Elon Musk tweeted about taking Tesla private. The SEC fined him and his company $40 million, he lost his Tesla chairmanship, and he was ordered to have his tweets reviewed by company lawyers. Three years later, his tweets are still influential. Whether about Tesla’s solar roof manufacturing plans or his opinion that Tesla’s stock is “too high,” his tweets continue to push the market up and down. Now, Musk has taken to tweeting about cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and dogecoin, sending those prices spiraling. Recode’s Rani Molla (@ranimolla) explains.

References: 

Rani wrote about Elon’s market-moving tweets. 

She also wrote about the Elon effect on the price of popular cryptocurrencies.

      <title>Why you should be wary of AI and your insurance claim</title>
      <description>Have you heard about Lemonade? The insurance company, not the drink or the album by Beyoncé. Lemonade is an insurance company that prides itself for being technology-forward, and promises to process claims efficiently thanks to chatbots and artificial intelligence. In fact, the company is so proud of its technology-driven mission that it tweeted about how it uses AI to review insurance claims. And, no surprise, it didn’t go over well. Here to explain the saga is Recode’s Sara Morrison (@saramorrison).

      <title>Hot beach summer</title>
      <description>Memorial Day weekend is the unofficial official start of summer. And after a year of being stuck inside, many Americans are ready to get out of the house. Very ready. They’re booking flights, renting cars, and snagging rental homes for the summer. While a rush of vaccinated Americans heading for the beach or a national park is good, will it be enough to jump-start the travel industry? Recode’s Rani Molla (@ranimolla) explains.

      <title>How Instacart’s harsh ratings system hurts grocery deliverers </title>
      <description>From the Recode Daily archives (March 25 2021): Instacart is a gig economy app, similar to Uber or Airbnb, but for grocery deliveries. It has two sets of users: the people who order groceries, and the people who shop for them, deliver them and hope for a five-star rating in return. 
Recode’s Peter Kafka talks with Ehud Sopher, a New York filmmaker who works full-time for Instacart and earns a commission for every completed order. Sopher recently wrote a first-person essay for Vox.com about a four-star rating he received, which in the world of Instacart shoppers, meant that he was effectively facing a massive pay cut. He explains why customers deserve more transparency from Instacart about the financial repercussions of how they rate shoppers and drivers.

      <title>Bill Gates will never be the same</title>
      <description>Bill and Melinda Gates shocked the world when they announced their divorce in early May. It left many people wondering about the future of their global philanthropic work through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has an endowment of nearly $50 billion. The couple pledged to continue working together, but the waterfall of scandalous reports that have emerged about Bill threatens to shatter the carefully constructed public persona the Microsoft cofounder has built for decades. Recode’s Teddy Schleifer (@teddyschleifer) explains.

      <title>The Colonial Pipeline, hacked</title>
      <description>Last week, a major US oil pipeline was hacked and held for ransom. The Colonial Pipeline shut down in an effort to stop the hackers, causing a major disruption in the oil industry. The pipeline serves 14 states, and stretches from Texas to New Jersey. If shut down long enough, gas prices could rise amid fuel shortages. But why would hackers target an oil pipeline? Recode’s Sara Morrison (@saramorrison) explains.

      <title>India's Covid censorship</title>
      <description>If you remember how bad the coronavirus pandemic was in the US about a year ago, right now in India … it’s worse. In fact, it’s the worst outbreak the world has seen since the beginning of the pandemic. People are turning to Twitter and Facebook to ask for help, crowdsource medical supplies, and demand the government take better action. But then some of their posts disappeared ... at the request of the government. Zack Beauchamp (@zackbeauchamp) explains.

Recode’s Shirin Ghaffary also wrote about the social media censorship.

      <title>The housing boom, but for renters</title>
      <description>America’s high-flying housing market might mean you’ll be renting forever — or, at least, for quite some time. Housing prices have soared during the pandemic as people have rushed to buy homes to escape cities and secure space for themselves and their families. Big companies have scooped up houses as well, sometimes outcompeting would-be homebuyers. As a result, more people may be pushed toward rentals because they can’t find or afford houses to buy. Recode’s Rani Molla explains whether the housing boom is turning America into a nation of renters.

      <title>Why you should be skeptical of Jeff Bezos’s worker satisfaction stat</title>
      <link>https://vox.com/recode</link>
      <description>Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos released his last annual letter to shareholders, it's his final farewell. Bezos mentioned a stat that said 94% of warehouse employees like working for Amazon so much that they'd recommend it to a friend as a place to work. But how did Amazon get to that number? Recode's Jason Del Rey did some digging.

Recode’s Sara Morrison (@SaraMorrison) explains.

      <title>If an atmospheric scientist had a billion dollars</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>Billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, and Bill Gates have made pledges to commit their earnings to saving our heating planet, but are they going about it in the best way possible? And do we want the fate of our planet to rest in their hands?
Atmospheric science professor, Kerry Emanuel explains how he’d spend a billion dollars.

      <title>Is remote work better for the environment?</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>Working from home seems like it could be great for the climate. You don’t need to drive a car to work, and companies won’t need to heat and power large offices. But as Professor William O’Brien explains, the reality is much more complicated, and without proper planning, remote work may lead to greater emissions in the future.

      <title>A wealth tax for tech billionaires</title>

      <title>Is AI really a national security threat?</title>
      <description>What do you think about when you're asked about artificial intelligence? You might think about search algorithms or social feeds or robots, but what you might not be thinking about is national security. That’s right, AI can be used for things like drone targeting and missile detection. A report by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence wants the US to be a world leader in AI development, but what does it even mean to be a leader wielding this technology? Vox’s Kelsey Piper (@kelseytuoc) explains.

      <title>Twitter doesn't want Trump's tweets, but the National Archives does</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>When a presidency ends, the National Archives and Records Administration's work begins. They play a key role in transferring millions of records and artifacts from the White House. And they even archive the Twitter accounts belonging to members of the previous administration. We first saw this happen with the Obama administration, and those archived accounts are still around. But President Trump has created a kind of thorny problem for the National Archives: how do you preserve the tweets of a president who's been banned from Twitter? Politico’s Quint Forgey (@QuintForgey) explains.

      <title>Supreme code</title>
      <description>For years, two tech giants have been locked in a legal battle over lines of code. When Google built the Android operating system, it used software created and copyrighted by Oracle. So, Oracle sued Google. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court sided with Google, ruling that it counts as lawful fair use. But how can computer code be fair use, and what does this mean for future programmers? Vox’s Ian Millhiser (@imillhiser) explains.

      <title>Vaccine passports, explained</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>One way that America can get “back to normal” is through what's called a digital vaccine passport. America is well underway with its covid vaccination rollout and while we still have a long way to go, more and more people are getting vaccinated. But while carrying a digital vaccine record sounds like a useful idea, experts warn of privacy issues and serious ethical concerns. Vox’s Rebecca Heilweil explains.

      <title>How Instacart’s harsh ratings system hurts grocery deliverers </title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>Instacart is a gig economy app, similar to Uber or Airbnb, but for grocery deliveries. It has two sets of users: the people who order groceries, and the people who shop for them, deliver them and hope for a five-star rating in return. 
Recode’s Peter Kafka talks with Ehud Sopher, a New York filmmaker who works full-time for Instacart and earns a commission for every completed order. Sopher recently wrote a first-person essay for Vox.com about a four-star rating he received, which in the world of Instacart shoppers, meant that he was effectively facing a massive pay cut. He explains why customers deserve more transparency from Instacart about the financial repercussions of how they rate shoppers and drivers.

      <title>This 28-year-old billionaire wants to give away all his money</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>Over the weekend, Recode’s Teddy Schleifer talked with Sam Bankman-Fried, a young cryptocurrency zealot who, seemingly out of nowhere, has a net worth of $10 billion. He cut a low profile until last year, when he became one of Silicon Valley’s biggest contributors to groups supporting Joe Biden, at least in terms of disclosed giving. Bankman-Fried, like many entrepreneurs, thinks obsessively about becoming rich. But he has a two-part plan: First, make a tremendous amount of money by any means necessary. Next, give it all away.

      <title>How influencers monetize every aspect of their lives</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>By now, you’ve probably heard of the influencer economy — high-profile figures on social media platforms who get paid to, you know, influence their followers. Brands will pay them to post ads for trendy things like fashion or beauty products and for much more obscure things like medical devices. But as more people hop on the influencer train, we are seeing more means of making money. Vox’s Rebecca Jennings, who covers internet culture for The Goods, is here to explain.

      <description>S-P-A-C. It’s an acronym we’ve been seeing everywhere. But what is it? Don’t worry, we had the same question. The quick answer is SPACs are a new(ish) part of the stock market and investment ecosystem. But since we like to explain things here at Vox, we asked Recode reporter Rani Molla to help us catch up with the trend that’s taking Wall Street by storm.

      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode/22311987/paramount-netflix-streaming-wars-charts-antenna</link>
      <description>Paramount+ launched last week, becoming the latest platform to join the crowded pool of streaming services. But even with more options to choose from, users are paying for fewer of them: With streaming options at an all-time high, US consumers only pay for an average of 1.25 services. Today on Recode Daily, we dig into Paramount+ and what this new platform means for the streaming wars.

      <title>Facebook bans Myanmar’s military</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>Nearly a month after a military coup in Myanmar, Facebook announced a ban on Facebook and Instagram accounts run by the Myanmarese military. The social media platform functions as the de facto internet in Myanmar, and has been used by the military for its propaganda campaigns and by pro-democracy activists to organize protests. Facebook took a pro-democracy side, but is the move too little too late? Joining today to discuss is Alex Ward, a White House reporter for Vox and co-host of the Worldly podcast.

      <title>What it means to make music in 2020</title>
      <description>The pandemic has upended the art and business of making music. Producing, performing and releasing — every aspect is new and uncharted. The need for social distancing means that it’s unsafe to collaborate in small studios or perform for large crowds — not to mention finding the right thing to sing about in such a charged moment. We’re telling three stories about how artists are working within these constraints: Ricky Reed and John-Robert have found a way to generate a creative spark remotely, Jacob Collier has defied the laws of physics to master live performance over the internet, and Dua Selah has released a powerful new track that helps support the protests in Minneapolis. Everything is radically different than it was a few months ago, but these stories shine a light on why making music matters more than ever 2020.

      <title>Why lo-fi is the perfect background music</title>
      <description>Lo-Fi hip-hop has emerged as a hugely popular genre and internet subculture. Its millions of loyal fans rely on curated lo-fi playlists and live-streams to write to, study to and even fall asleep to.

We trace lo-fi from its godfathers to its moments in the sun, to the complex creative ecosystem playing out on streaming platforms today.

      <title>How to get a treatment for your toddler’s rare disease</title>
      <link>https://art19.com/shows/reset/episodes/56992968-0e15-4d0c-94d1-dc82ee490d4a</link>
      <description>The story of a mother's race against time to find a genetic treatment for her son, and the technology that's helping her do it - CRISPR mice from China.

Correction - January 8th, 2020: An earlier version of this podcast episode stated that the gene therapy method that’s being developed to treat Maxwell would alter his genetic map. That is incorrect. The gene therapy method in question, which is called AAV9, won’t alter Maxwell’s mutation. We regret the error.

      <itunes:summary>The story of a mother's race against time to find a genetic treatment for her son, and the technology that's helping her do it - CRISPR mice from China.

Correction - January 8th, 2020: An earlier version of this podcast episode stated that the gene therapy method that’s being developed to treat Maxwell would alter his genetic map. That is incorrect. The gene therapy method in question, which is called AAV9, won’t alter Maxwell’s mutation. We regret the error.

Three Years of Misery Inside Google, the Happiest Company in Tech
Google walkout organizer quits company after alleged retaliation
Google’s attempt to shut down a unionization meeting just riled up its employees

      <link>https://art19.com/shows/reset/episodes/47b88e5c-3e44-453f-b996-78dea20a558f</link>
      <description>Josiah Zayner is a biohacker who’s famous for, among other things, injecting himself with the gene-editing tool CRISPR. At a time when the technology exists for us to change, or hack, our own DNA, what are the ethics of experimenting on ourselves, and others at home? Arielle Duhaime-Ross has been following Zayner’s story and talks to him about how he’s thinking about human experimentation today. Plus: new efforts to come up with a code of conduct for biohackers, from legislation to self-regulation.
