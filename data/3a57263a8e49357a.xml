		<description>A LITTLE MORE OBSESSION by Gemma Weir

Obsessed – to be preoccupied or fill the mind with someone continually and to a troubling extent.

As soon as I realized she existed, I lost the ability to look away. She was always destined to be mine.

I’m Sebastian Lockwood; a king among men. And kings get to take what they want.

My little bird disagreed. She fought me, disobeyed me even though we both know she belongs to me.

So I broke her, bent her to my will.

I pushed too hard, loved too much and she ran from me.

But letting her go was impossible. So I chased; hiding in the shadows, silently pulling the strings that would bind her to me.

Two years have passed, I’ve waited long enough. It’s time to reclaim my queen; to take what’s mine.

The trap is set, a gilded cage worthy of royalty and only I have the key.

I’ll make her pay for leaving me. I’ll make her love me, want me as much as I do her.

I couldn’t stop if I tried.

She’s my obsession.

		<description>OUR SNOWY NIGHT by Ella Goode

It took one look for Rowan to fall for Charlee. He wifed her immediately—as in two weeks after their first meeting. Shocked by his own lack of self-restraint and the dark thoughts of possession and ownership that filled him, Rowan fears his precious wife will leave him if she finds out how he really feels, how crazy in love with her he really is.

It took one look for Charlee to fall for Rowan. She said yes when he asked her to marry him—even though it was only two weeks after they met. It was her fairy tale in the making. Her happily ever after doesn’t last long though. The ink is barely dry on their marriage certificate when her hard pursuing husband suddenly becomes cold and distant, off on business more than he’s at home. Fed up, she hands him divorce papers.

Rowan knows he’s in for a fight but he’s not signing those divorce papers and he’s not letting Charlee get away, even if it means kidnapping her to a small cabin in her hometown in the dead of winter. If she’s snowed in, she can’t leave him. He knows he can never let her go and all the control he’s barely held onto snaps. His wife is about to find out how truly obsessed he is with her.

		<description>OUR SNOWY NIGHT by Ella Goode

It took one look for Rowan to fall for Charlee. He wifed her immediately—as in two weeks after their first meeting. Shocked by his own lack of self-restraint and the dark thoughts of possession and ownership that filled him, Rowan fears his precious wife will leave him if she finds out how he really feels, how crazy in love with her he really is.

It took one look for Charlee to fall for Rowan. She said yes when he asked her to marry him—even though it was only two weeks after they met. It was her fairy tale in the making. Her happily ever after doesn’t last long though. The ink is barely dry on their marriage certificate when her hard pursuing husband suddenly becomes cold and distant, off on business more than he’s at home. Fed up, she hands him divorce papers.

Rowan knows he’s in for a fight but he’s not signing those divorce papers and he’s not letting Charlee get away, even if it means kidnapping her to a small cabin in her hometown in the dead of winter. If she’s snowed in, she can’t leave him. He knows he can never let her go and all the control he’s barely held onto snaps. His wife is about to find out how truly obsessed he is with her.

		<description>FORBIDDEN EDUCATION: A SEXY ROMANTIC SERIES SHORT STORY

Jared and Cooper thought they knew everything about pleasing a woman, but a chance encounter with their former teacher opened their eyes to more. A pact was made between the three of them, and by the end of the night, their teacher will give them a lesson they’ll never forget.

Please note: This short contains some original series spoilers, but I make up for it with the extra steamy scenes.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is FIT TO BE STAPLED by Lauren Smith

He’s the CEO and she’s off limits…

Spencer Howe can’t let anyone know what’s going on in his head, especially when he daydreams about bending his junior ad account manager over her desk and showing her what her sass does to him. Cate Cross isn’t just sassy though, she’s beautiful, brilliant, and perfect for the senior account manager position at his advertising firm.

He knows he gets under her skin when he calls her his assistant. He does it to get a rise out of her, and she throws it right back at him. There is so much chemistry between them, but he knows it won’t work. She can’t stand him most of the time. If he doesn’t get her to accept his company’s promotion soon, he’s afraid another company will take her away from him when she finishes her MBA. He’ll do anything to show her that she’s his, in the office and out, even if that means breaking a desk or two to prove his point.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our audiobook this week is FIT TO BE STAPLED by Lauren Smith</p>
<p>He’s the CEO and she’s off limits…</p>
<p>Spencer Howe can’t let anyone know what’s going on in his head, especially when he daydreams about bending his junior ad account manager over her desk and showing her what her sass does to him. Cate Cross isn’t just sassy though, she’s beautiful, brilliant, and perfect for the senior account manager position at his advertising firm.</p>
<p>He knows he gets under her skin when he calls her his assistant. He does it to get a rise out of her, and she throws it right back at him. There is so much chemistry between them, but he knows it won’t work. She can’t stand him most of the time. If he doesn’t get her to accept his company’s promotion soon, he’s afraid another company will take her away from him when she finishes her MBA. He’ll do anything to show her that she’s his, in the office and out, even if that means breaking a desk or two to prove his point.</p>

		<description>Our audiobook this week is HIDE AND SEEK by Mila Crawford

My name is Stella Adams and I&#039;m in love with three men.

Axel is an animal. His desires are visceral and come from the most debased human needs.

Ronan is sweet and nurturing. He takes care of me, showing me how precious I am even when no one ever taught him how.

Kian is a monster. He needs to invoke pain to feel anything.

They’re all different but they are mine and I am theirs.

And now my men want to tie me to them.

Forever.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is DILLON’S HEART by Loni Nichole

Jules
I don&#039;t have time to date, especially not the infuriatingly bossy, ridiculously hot sheriff. But Dillon Armstrong won&#039;t take no for an answer. And the more he shows up at my office, the harder it is to resist him and his high-handed, insufferable, oddly endearing ways. He&#039;s going to make me fall for him, I just know it.

Dillon

		<description>Our audiobook this week is HARD PART by Mayra Statham

Damien Benitez and Paz Alva blurred the lines of friendship with one passionate night.

But instead of telling Paz how he felt, Damien shied away, afraid to give in to his dad’s expectations, and he’s regretted it ever since.

When his dad dies unexpectedly, Damien returns to his hometown of Desert Rose, CA. He’s planning to stay and open a barber shop with his brother and cousins. He finally has something more to offer Paz than following him from army base to army base.

He knows he has his work cut out for him if she’s going to give him a chance. But he doesn’t mind. Anything worthwhile takes work. The hard parts in life usually lead to the sweetest rewards, and he’s more than ready to lay his heart on the line

		<description>Our audiobook this week is YES, DADDY by Natalie Knight 

He wanted to play a game; he called it Daddy says.

What do three eighteen-year-old girls do on a Thursday night when no one’s home?

They play a simple game of truth or dare.

Except, there was nothing simple about mine.

With my dad out of work, no money in the bank, and a depleted college fund, things were looking pretty dire when it came to my college education and future.

I picked dare, and my friend laid out the terms. All I had to do was go on Cam, make some money, and log off. Easy, considering I could use the funds.

But then he came online, and I knew my little one-time cam stunt would be anything but easy because he wanted to play a game, and I wanted to play along.

He wanted to play a game; he called it Daddy says.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What do three eighteen-year-old girls do on a Thursday night when no one’s home?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They play a simple game of truth or dare.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Except, there was nothing simple about mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With my dad out of work, no money in the bank, and a depleted college fund, things were looking pretty dire when it came to my college education and future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I picked dare, and my friend laid out the terms. All I had to do was go on Cam, make some money, and log off. Easy, considering I could use the funds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But then he came online, and I knew my little one-time cam stunt would be anything but easy because he wanted to play a game, and I wanted to play along.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is YES, DADDY by Natalie Knight 

He wanted to play a game; he called it Daddy says.

What do three eighteen-year-old girls do on a Thursday night when no one’s home?

They play a simple game of truth or dare.

Except, there was nothing simple about mine.

With my dad out of work, no money in the bank, and a depleted college fund, things were looking pretty dire when it came to my college education and future.

I picked dare, and my friend laid out the terms. All I had to do was go on Cam, make some money, and log off. Easy, considering I could use the funds.

But then he came online, and I knew my little one-time cam stunt would be anything but easy because he wanted to play a game, and I wanted to play along.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is FINDING FOREVER by JLynn Autumn

Roger

“Be my fake boyfriend for ten minutes, please.” Those eight words haunt me. I was at a buddy’s bar to watch a concert. Pretending to be a boyfriend wasn’t part of my plans, but she was scared. I dropped my arm over her shoulder and played the part of the doting boyfriend. I should have made sure she got home safely by calling her a cab or rideshare. But after an unexpected night laughing more than I had in months, I couldn’t say no when she asked if I wanted company in my hotel room.

When I realized the next morning that she wasn’t twenty-one, I bailed. I regret it. But what am I supposed to do? I only know her first name and where she goes to college. College! She’s in college. I’m over thirty and the only person who has ever made me think I’d want more than a night or two isn’t old enough to buy a beer.

Lily

I’ve never understood why age differences matter as long as you’re both consenting adults. Roger and I had fun and the chemistry was off the charts. Why does it matter that I’m not twenty-one and I’m still in college? All I know about him is his first name, he lives a couple of hours away, he’s friends with the owner of the bar we were at, and he has some impressive ink work. I also overheard him telling the bartender that he could squeeze him in for a cover-up next week. Roger may not have told me he’s a tattoo artist, but I paid attention and figured it out. Now, I just have to find him and prove to him that age is just a number. He’s going to marry me. He just doesn’t know it yet

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SAVING THE BRIDE by Alexa Riley

Emma is running out of time. She’s in school on a student visa, but it’s coming to an end. There’s no way for her to stay or get to know the mystery man she can’t get out of her head.

Beckett is going through the motions of life until one day everything changes. The moment he meets Emma, there’s no going back. She’s got a little problem, but that’s easy to solve. All he has to do is marry the woman of his dreams and live happily ever after. That should be easy, right?

Warning: Could you make the ultimate commitment after only knowing someone 24 hours? What do you wanna bet our hero can? Bet on love, because this one is forever.

&lt;br /&gt;
Emma is running out of time. She’s in school on a student visa, but it’s coming to an end. There’s no way for her to stay or get to know the mystery man she can’t get out of her head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beckett is going through the motions of life until one day everything changes. The moment he meets Emma, there’s no going back. She’s got a little problem, but that’s easy to solve. All he has to do is marry the woman of his dreams and live happily ever after. That should be easy, right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Warning: Could you make the ultimate commitment after only knowing someone 24 hours? What do you wanna bet our hero can? Bet on love, because this one is forever.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is PALPITATION by Ofelia Martinez

The kiss I stole from Leonardo Moreno on my eighteenth birthday must have been the worst kiss of his life because, within months, he enlisted in the army, and I never saw him again.

Talk about ghosting.

I did everything I could to forget the tall, dark, and handsome soldier with soulful, brown eyes. Instead, I focused on getting my medical degree and starting my emergency medicine residency.

When a family emergency leads me back home, the last person I think I’ll see as a civilian is Leo.

Sparks fly when we reconnect, and this time, instead of pushing me away, he holds on tight.

Now all we have to do is keep us a secret from his best friend—my over-protective older brother.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is TOUCH ME by Angelina Lopez

Marisol Gutierrez had it all – an amazing husband, great kids, and a successful investment firm. But when you’ve got it all, you’ve got it all to lose, and the stress she’s trying to manage all on her own is why she cries in her corner office for an exact half hour every Thursday before her one-hour massage with the best hands in San Francisco.

When the hands touch her body this Thursday, however, they’re not the hands of her masseuse. Instead, it’s the huge superhero hands of movie star Ray Morgan, her newest client and a man whose desire to take care of her has made him harder and harder to resist

		<description>Our audiobook this week is LAST CALL CASANOVA by Karla Doyle

I’m back in Hope Harbor, the little town I can’t stay away from, for my buddy’s wedding to the love of his life. They’re perfect together. I’m happy for them, but that kind of relationship isn’t in my wheelhouse. Not anymore. Everything changes once there’s a picture of you holding an oversized check splashed across the internet. When it’s public knowledge you won the lottery and have ten million in the bank, everybody wants a piece of you.

Been there, got burned, and have the scorch marks to prove it. Money’s not the only thing I keep locked up now. My heart’s in the vault too. But there’s one piece of me I’ve been happy to share since then, and it’s guaranteed to satisfy. Looking for a good time? I’m your man. Just don’t look for more. That’s the rule. Or it was, until I met Mya.

Hope Harbor is full of gorgeous fish happy to hop on my hook anytime I’m in town. Too bad the only one I want doesn’t fall for my lines, and has no interest in my pole. Pretty sure she’d be happy if I took a long walk off the end of the short pier and never resurfaced.

The more Mya pushes me away, the more I want to reel her in. The truth is—I’m the one who’s hooked. And one night together is all it takes to know I never want to be released.

I’m happy for them, but that kind of relationship isn’t in my wheelhouse. Not anymore. Everything changes once there’s a picture of you holding an oversized check splashed across the internet. When it’s public knowledge you won the lottery and have ten million in the bank, everybody wants a piece of you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Been there, got burned, and have the scorch marks to prove it. Money’s not the only thing I keep locked up now. My heart’s in the vault too. But there’s one piece of me I’ve been happy to share since then, and it’s guaranteed to satisfy. Looking for a good time? I’m your man. Just don’t look for more. That’s the rule. Or it was, until I met Mya.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hope Harbor is full of gorgeous fish happy to hop on my hook anytime I’m in town. Too bad the only one I want doesn’t fall for my lines, and has no interest in my pole. Pretty sure she’d be happy if I took a long walk off the end of the short pier and never resurfaced.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The more Mya pushes me away, the more I want to reel her in. The truth is—I’m the one who’s hooked. And one night together is all it takes to know I never want to be released.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is TWO WRONGS by Dani Wyatt

I don’t even know her name, but I already know she’ll be taking mine, and the sooner the better.

Ending marriages has been my life’s focus. I’m an expensive, pay-by-the minute legal predator for my clients wishing to end their former happily ever afters. The work suits me and until I saw the little brunette, pin-up princess sitting at the bar I never thought I’d find mine.

I put the period at the end of the world’s worst blind date and watch her eat a panna cotta like It’s changing her life.

What she doesn’t know is she’s changing mine.

Unfortunately, this brazen beauty disappears before I can secure her into my life or even find out her name. Enter fate. When I walk into my mandatory anger management training the next day, guess who’s the holding my career in her hands?

Soon, I’ll be the one with my hands on her and this time, I’ll make sure she doesn’t get away.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SAVING MASON by Kaci Rose

I had one night with him. One incredible night.

This wasn’t a situation where I didn’t know him. I knew his name, Mason. He was deployed the next day, and we had mutual friends, so… I knew him. But I didn’t know him at all.

Then the letters started. He agreed. I agreed. It was a done deal–Pen pals and in the old school way.

I wasn’t prepared.

The texture of the paper. His words. The ink. He touched what I was holding. The magic. It was a window into his soul.

Until he’s hurt. Until he comes back. Until everything changes. Mason needs to decide if he’ll let me in or push me away because I already knew.

I’d fallen in love with my pen pal, but will he love me back?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SAVING MASON by Kaci Rose

I had one night with him. One incredible night.

This wasn’t a situation where I didn’t know him. I knew his name, Mason. He was deployed the next day, and we had mutual friends, so… I knew him. But I didn’t know him at all.

Then the letters started. He agreed. I agreed. It was a done deal–Pen pals and in the old school way.

I wasn’t prepared.

The texture of the paper. His words. The ink. He touched what I was holding. The magic. It was a window into his soul.

Until he’s hurt. Until he comes back. Until everything changes. Mason needs to decide if he’ll let me in or push me away because I already knew.

I’d fallen in love with my pen pal, but will he love me back?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is ALPHA RANGER by Anna Fury

Liv

I’ve been in love with Thatcher Forrest from the moment he walked into my pharmacy, seven feet of quietly dimpled smiles and southern charm. He’s everything I could ever want in a man–a little older, full of confidence, and with a body made for cold winter nights in bed.

You’d think he’d make a move after three years of intense flirting, but I’m done waiting.

I’m gonna bake up a batch of my best cookies and finally show Thatcher how perfect we are for one another, one chocolate chip at a time.

Thatcher

For three years, I’ve been picking up a prescription I don’t even need anymore just to lay eyes on my town’s beautiful young pharmacist. I probably shouldn’t fantasize about a woman fifteen years my junior, but time hasn’t done a single thing to get her off my mind. If anything, the desire to possess and mark her only increases every time I see her. She’s an omega, I’m certain of it.

Imagine my surprise when she shows up at my home with freshly baked cookies. Turns out the beautiful omega wants something only I can give her. Can I rein in my dominance long enough to avoid scaring her away? I don’t know. But if I get a taste of Liv, one thing’s for certain–I’m never letting her go.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is PARTY PRINCESS by Lana Dash

What happens in Vegas…isn’t always what you expect.

BETH
As the bride’s younger sister, I’ve always found myself hidden in her long casting shadow. But when we all head out to a club in Vegas, I’m mistaken for the pop princess, Fiona Day. When I’m ushered past the velvet rope into the VIP section, I come face to face with my celebrity crush growing up. Can I keep up the ruse that I’m not who they think I am, or will the spotlight I’ve always wanted reveal the truth?

SHAWN
After becoming a household name when I was ten, I’ve lived my life in a fishbowl. Everything about my life is managed by other people, including who I&#039;m supposed to date. So when my manager tells me that he&#039;s set up a publicity relationship with pop star Fiona Day, I&#039;m less than thrilled. But when we meet, she&#039;s nothing like I expected. Will this fake relationship for the press actually turn into something real?

&lt;br /&gt;
What happens in Vegas…isn’t always what you expect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BETH&lt;br /&gt;
As the bride’s younger sister, I’ve always found myself hidden in her long casting shadow. But when we all head out to a club in Vegas, I’m mistaken for the pop princess, Fiona Day. When I’m ushered past the velvet rope into the VIP section, I come face to face with my celebrity crush growing up. Can I keep up the ruse that I’m not who they think I am, or will the spotlight I’ve always wanted reveal the truth?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SHAWN&lt;br /&gt;
After becoming a household name when I was ten, I’ve lived my life in a fishbowl. Everything about my life is managed by other people, including who I&#039;m supposed to date. So when my manager tells me that he&#039;s set up a publicity relationship with pop star Fiona Day, I&#039;m less than thrilled. But when we meet, she&#039;s nothing like I expected. Will this fake relationship for the press actually turn into something real?&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is REVVED UP by Cameron Hart

Her brother put her up for collateral. Lucky for her, I was the one to collect…

It was just another night in this seedy bar, working the books and collecting bets. Then one of my slimy clients put his sister up for collateral, shoving her in my direction before backing away.

Briar. A curvy little angel with hazel eyes.

She’s too young, too innocent to be in this dingy place. She doesn’t belong in the underworld of gambling. She belongs with me.

When the angel passes out in my arms, her fate is sealed. She’s mine to take care of now. Mine to protect. Mine to cherish. Mine to avenge.

I hope she’s ready for me when she wakes up…

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SADDLED by Shaw Hart

She’s a princess locked away in a wooden tower.

Twyla Grace should love her life.

She has a nice house, a wealthy father, and just graduated from college.

What more could a girl want?

For Twyla, the answer has always been Seth.

He’s always wanted to be her white knight.

When Seth Avery first met Twyla, he instantly knew two things.

One, she was the one for him, and two, she was also way too good for him.

When she left, he let her go. He thought that college was what she wanted, and he just wanted her to be happy.

Do the Princess and the Pauper only get their happily ever after in fairy tales?

Now that she’s back in Sequoia though, will Seth be able to let her go again?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SADDLED by Shaw Hart

She’s a princess locked away in a wooden tower.

Twyla Grace should love her life.

She has a nice house, a wealthy father, and just graduated from college.

What more could a girl want?

For Twyla, the answer has always been Seth.

He’s always wanted to be her white knight.

When Seth Avery first met Twyla, he instantly knew two things.

One, she was the one for him, and two, she was also way too good for him.

When she left, he let her go. He thought that college was what she wanted, and he just wanted her to be happy.

Do the Princess and the Pauper only get their happily ever after in fairy tales?

Now that she’s back in Sequoia though, will Seth be able to let her go again?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Tempting You by S.A. Clayton

Sometimes you need to be tempted…

I knew getting involved with someone right after a breakup was a bad idea. Yet Ian did something to me the second our eyes met across the bar. When those piercing eyes met mine, when his hands gripped my body in a way I’d never experienced before, I fell for him. Hard. He knew my body better than anyone ever has, showed me things I never experienced before, and made me crave more. So much more.

But what happens when reality comes crashing down and we both have to face the fact that real life isn’t a fantasy. Will we be able to leave behind our pasts or will the temptation of the future be enough?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is RING YOUR NECK by Jaycee Wolfe

Pierce:

Baseball and Milly—the only two things I’ve cared about since I was five years old. I may have lost her, but if I have to lose the other to get her back, then so be it. Being forced to leave her the first time nearly killed me. Once I find her again, I’m binding her to me forever.

Milly:

Watching my best friend, the other half of my soul, and the only boy I would ever love drive off, leaving me alone in a town where no one, and I mean no one, understands me. Yeah, that rocked me to my core. I thought I had finally gotten over it, over him. Then he waltzes back into town, revealing old secrets and opening even older wounds. Once the answers to the questions I have been fighting against for so long are revealed, I only hope they are enough to fix my shattered heart and bind us together again. Forever this time.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is STUCK WITH A DATE by Georgia Coffman

It’s all fun and games… until my ex-girlfriend wins a date with me.

I only agreed to do the bachelor auction because it’s for a good cause. But I never signed up to go out with the woman who up and ran out on me, taking our dog—and my heart—with her.

At first, I refuse. I don’t trust her, or myself.

Because the moment I lay eyes on Micah again, I’m too easily reminded of how good we were together.

Our chemistry is still undeniable.

And Micah has a few surprises up the sleeve of her fitted shirt.

She’s persistent. Gorgeous and confident too. Which is all a dangerous combination.

After all, I’m only human, and the temptation is too much to ignore as we share unexpected laughs over drinks and a show.

If I’m not careful, I might end up with more than just a fun night out with an entertaining woman.

I may even give her my heart… again.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is STUCK WITH A DATE by Georgia Coffman

It’s all fun and games… until my ex-girlfriend wins a date with me.

I only agreed to do the bachelor auction because it’s for a good cause. But I never signed up to go out with the woman who up and ran out on me, taking our dog—and my heart—with her.

At first, I refuse. I don’t trust her, or myself.

Because the moment I lay eyes on Micah again, I’m too easily reminded of how good we were together.

Our chemistry is still undeniable.

And Micah has a few surprises up the sleeve of her fitted shirt.

She’s persistent. Gorgeous and confident too. Which is all a dangerous combination.

After all, I’m only human, and the temptation is too much to ignore as we share unexpected laughs over drinks and a show.

If I’m not careful, I might end up with more than just a fun night out with an entertaining woman.

I may even give her my heart… again.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Assist by Claire Hastings

She had no idea what had come over her, but she felt like she was floating on air. Almost as if she had drunk too much champagne and her head was swimmy. The only difference was, she hadn’t had anything to drink. This was all from being in Chance’s arms, listening to him whisper in her ear.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is GIRL&#039;S. NIGHT OUT by Ember Davis

AMELIA
After four years of having everything that I’ve ever wanted, including the love of a man I never thought would look at me twice, I still have doubts sometimes.  I know Beckett loves me; he shows me every day.  Still, how long will it last?

Who will I be if the day comes when he no longer wants me?  What happens to the rest of our family if that day arrives?  Who will be responsible for everyone then?

A girl’s night out might help some of the stresses and worries fall away.  I should have known my husband, my own personal caveman, wasn’t going to simply let me out of his sight.  Not in the dress I’m wearing where other men can see me.

It’s a good thing he’s so sexy or I might find him infuriating.  Turns out, he knows exactly what I need, and it isn’t a girl’s night out.

BECKETT
My wife is a lot of things, including transparent when it comes to her thoughts and emotions.  I can read her as easily as I can love her fiercely.  I know she’s been battling her own inner demons, the ones which tell her not to get too comfortable and to prepare for the worst.

She forgets that I will slay her dragons because it wins me the heart of the only woman I want, the only woman who is mine.  She’s been stuck in her head lately while giving too much of herself to everyone else.  It’s my job to take care of her and I’m damn good at it.

A girl’s night out isn’t what she needs.  She needs a little time away from the kids, from the family, from all the things she thinks she is responsible for.  I’m not the only one crashing the party, but when I cart off my wife, we’re not going home.  I have plans for her which will get her to shut off her brain and kill her doubts.

It’s time she and I had a little heart-to-heart.  Being naked during it is only a bonus.

Who will I be if the day comes when he no longer wants me?  What happens to the rest of our family if that day arrives?  Who will be responsible for everyone then?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A girl’s night out might help some of the stresses and worries fall away.  I should have known my husband, my own personal caveman, wasn’t going to simply let me out of his sight.  Not in the dress I’m wearing where other men can see me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s a good thing he’s so sexy or I might find him infuriating.  Turns out, he knows exactly what I need, and it isn’t a girl’s night out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BECKETT&lt;br /&gt;
My wife is a lot of things, including transparent when it comes to her thoughts and emotions.  I can read her as easily as I can love her fiercely.  I know she’s been battling her own inner demons, the ones which tell her not to get too comfortable and to prepare for the worst.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She forgets that I will slay her dragons because it wins me the heart of the only woman I want, the only woman who is mine.  She’s been stuck in her head lately while giving too much of herself to everyone else.  It’s my job to take care of her and I’m damn good at it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A girl’s night out isn’t what she needs.  She needs a little time away from the kids, from the family, from all the things she thinks she is responsible for.  I’m not the only one crashing the party, but when I cart off my wife, we’re not going home.  I have plans for her which will get her to shut off her brain and kill her doubts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s time she and I had a little heart-to-heart.  Being naked during it is only a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is GIRL&#039;S. NIGHT OUT by Ember Davis

AMELIA
After four years of having everything that I’ve ever wanted, including the love of a man I never thought would look at me twice, I still have doubts sometimes.  I know Beckett loves me; he shows me every day.  Still, how long will it last?

Who will I be if the day comes when he no longer wants me?  What happens to the rest of our family if that day arrives?  Who will be responsible for everyone then?

A girl’s night out might help some of the stresses and worries fall away.  I should have known my husband, my own personal caveman, wasn’t going to simply let me out of his sight.  Not in the dress I’m wearing where other men can see me.

It’s a good thing he’s so sexy or I might find him infuriating.  Turns out, he knows exactly what I need, and it isn’t a girl’s night out.

BECKETT
My wife is a lot of things, including transparent when it comes to her thoughts and emotions.  I can read her as easily as I can love her fiercely.  I know she’s been battling her own inner demons, the ones which tell her not to get too comfortable and to prepare for the worst.

She forgets that I will slay her dragons because it wins me the heart of the only woman I want, the only woman who is mine.  She’s been stuck in her head lately while giving too much of herself to everyone else.  It’s my job to take care of her and I’m damn good at it.

A girl’s night out isn’t what she needs.  She needs a little time away from the kids, from the family, from all the things she thinks she is responsible for.  I’m not the only one crashing the party, but when I cart off my wife, we’re not going home.  I have plans for her which will get her to shut off her brain and kill her doubts.

It’s time she and I had a little heart-to-heart.  Being naked during it is only a bonus.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is LANE TO FAME by Andie Fenichel

Mathew

Sadie Baker is the most beautiful, kind, talented, and out-of-reach woman I’ll ever know. Rockstars don’t date small-town photographers. Rockstars date other celebrities and live miserably ever after. I know it, but I can’t get her out of my head. So, when she needs a little time away from the roar of the crowds, I’m all in. I’ll take her to my beach house to write her next album. Forever might be out of reach, but a few stolen moments in heaven is worth the risk.

Sadie

Mathew Lane is the best medicine for my busted-up heart. With my label looking for the next big album, and my band counting on me to feed their families, I’m torn in a million directions. Songwriting used to be my greatest pleasure, but now I’m in an artistic death spiral. A few days at the beach with a hunk is just what the doctor ordered. It can never last. Nothing ever does.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is DESTINED by Laura Pavlov

Harper Wallace is my best friend’s little sister.
She’s completely off-limits.
We’d crossed that line once, and I’d done everything I could to forget that it happened.
But some things can’t be forgotten.
Some secrets can’t be kept forever.
And when Harper moves back home, all bets are off.
The feelings I had for her are stronger than ever.
Harper Wallace is the first girl I ever loved…
I just didn’t realize she’d be the last.

With a storm brewing, CL stands in the center of it, waiting for chaos to ricochet around her.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is V-Day Auction by Emma Bray

Valentine is a no-nonsense businessman, but a chance encounter with pretty little Victoria leaves him with more than business on his mind. The only problem? He doesn’t have a clue who the cute little angel is. She bumps into him and then slips away before he’s ever able to utter a word.

Fate steps in when he comes across her again. But fate is an evil temptress because his little angel is being auctioned.

And there’s no way he’s going to let anyone else buy her.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is HIS SWEETNESS by Leah Sharelle

The only priority in Deck Johnston’s life was to get a wedding ring on Charlie’s finger and make her his in every way possible. Having her in his bed and his baby in her belly wasn’t enough, he needed complete and total ownership of his pretty blonde ballet dancer. Only that can calm the storm raging deep inside him.

With the developing drama brewing at the Wounded Souls compound, the Rogue soldier who was wreaking havoc on the women, Deck had only one thing on his mind.

To give his Sweetness his last name and keep her until the end of time.

The only priority in Deck Johnston’s life was to get a wedding ring on Charlie’s finger and make her his in every way possible. Having her in his bed and his baby in her belly wasn’t enough, he needed complete and total ownership of his pretty blonde ballet dancer. Only that can calm the storm raging deep inside him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the developing drama brewing at the Wounded Souls compound, the Rogue soldier who was wreaking havoc on the women, Deck had only one thing on his mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To give his Sweetness his last name and keep her until the end of time.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is LOVE LETTERS by Sarah Ready

Enemies in life…in love by letter. For fans of You’ve Got Mail and The Shop Around the Corner.

Do you remember those stories where a lonely, single, yet surprisingly attractive woman finds a romantic letter and starts writing a hunky man from the past, only to fall in love?

Yeah. That’s not this story.

Believe me. I spend my days archiving stunningly romantic three-hundred-year-old love letters. If it could happen to anyone, it would be me.

But these archived letters have given me the basis for a list of true-love requirements. The man I fall for must be: sensitive, smart, love history, be kind to little old ladies and stray dogs alike, and…be the exact opposite of Corbin Ryan – lover of finance, efficiency, and crushing dreams.

Plenty of people, aka everyone, says my list is unrealistic. I may have agreed, except I’m holding a letter in my hand. I found it in a library book, written by a stranger, and he’s everything I’ve ever said I wanted.

Unlike all the stories, he’s real. The only trouble is, the more we write, the more I begin to question, can you really, truly fall in love with a man you’ve never met? And what happens when you finally write, P.S. Let’s Meet.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is LIKE IT’S 1999 by Karen Grey

Love ‘em and Leave ‘em Alice Kim and “Hot” Steve Lowell are perfect for each other. It’ll only take them ten years to figure that out.

Just because they throw the most bodacious wedding party ever…

Just because they’re perfect partners in pranks…

Just because they love all the same boss movies…

Just because they share one totally bangin’ night of sex together…

Does not mean they’ll break the One Time Rule.

Even if they do… they don’t do relationships.

And they’re never getting married.

Like, ever.

In this friends-to-lovers, marriage-pact novella spanning the last decade of the 20th century, life forces a playboy and a playgirl grow up—and grow apart—before giving them a chance to create a happy-ever-after they can actually be happy about.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is THE BRATVAS HOSTAGE by Jagger Cole

Taking her was only the beginning…

A hit gone wrong. My partner, the future King of the Kashenko Bratva, bleeding out. There’s only one choice left for me:

Kidnap the daughter of the rival mob boss, and take her as my hostage.

Now, she’s my temptingly innocent, beautifully forbidden bargaining chip.

Talia is a pretty little bird, trapped all her life in a gilded cage. Too good for me. Too young for me, too. A softness I’ve never touched. A sweetness I’ve never tasted.

We’re trapped together, and time is running out.

But the solution might be just as forbidden as she is…

This extra-steamy novella is a *standalone* prequel to the Bratva’s Claim series. Absolutely no cheating, no cliffhanger, and a happy ever after.

		<itunes:summary>Our audiobook this week is THE BRATVAS HOSTAGE by Jagger Cole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taking her was only the beginning…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A hit gone wrong. My partner, the future King of the Kashenko Bratva, bleeding out. There’s only one choice left for me:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kidnap the daughter of the rival mob boss, and take her as my hostage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, she’s my temptingly innocent, beautifully forbidden bargaining chip.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Talia is a pretty little bird, trapped all her life in a gilded cage. Too good for me. Too young for me, too. A softness I’ve never touched. A sweetness I’ve never tasted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We’re trapped together, and time is running out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But the solution might be just as forbidden as she is…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This extra-steamy novella is a *standalone* prequel to the Bratva’s Claim series. Absolutely no cheating, no cliffhanger, and a happy ever after.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is The Wrong Blue Eyes by B.B. Reid

Noelle is far from a good girl. In fact, she can be downright bad.

Everyone she meets adores her wild antics. Well, everyone except for her boyfriend.

When Paxton suggests a trip to Aspen for the weekend, Noelle decides to find that missing spark.

But what Noelle thinks is a romantic getaway turns out to be a party for four.

If two’s company and three’s a crowd, what do you call a sexy fourth wheel with blue eyes and a killer smile?

Answer: Your boyfriend’s twin brother.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is RULES OF THE FRIEND ZONE by Kat Baxter

You know those stories you hear about the chubby, awkward geeky girl in glasses who’s stupidly and secretly in love with her hot jock of a best friend? Yeah, that’s my life. I am a walking cliche of unrequited love.

When a freak Texas snow storm hits, we’re forced to cuddle and share body heat to stay warm. There are some things you just can’t hide when you’re pressed skin-to-skin. Now I have to figure out if we’re truly just friends or if maybe he’s been in love with me too.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SHY VIRGIN by Alexa Riley

Shy Wells was always an outsider, but now that the Crew family has taken him in, he’s learning what it’s like to have a family. One thing that he’s seeing for the first time is that a happily ever after might be possible for him too. That’s if he can convince his neighbor Carrie to give him a chance.

Carrie Smith lives down the hall from Shy, and her thoughts about him have become less than pure. When a stalker turns her apartment upside down, it just so happens Shy has a little extra room for her to squeeze in close.

Warning: Did we save the dirtiest story in the Craven Cove Series for last? Get to clicking and find out!

		<description>Our audiobook this week is MY EX GIRLFRIEND’S BROTHER by Harlow Layne

Falling for my ex-fiancée’s brother was not the plan when I proposed…
After traveling to Vegas to elope, I ended up leaving with a broken heart.
I never expected to see my ex-girlfriend, Camilla, again. Or for her older brother to be the one to pick up the shattered pieces and make me feel whole again.

But I felt more for him from the moment we met than I did for Camilla during our entire relationship.
All my life, I’ve liked girls. Then Cash walked in, and all the air was sucked out of the room… or maybe it was just my lungs.

I was confused. Suddenly feeling things I’ve never felt before was messing with my head and my heart.
Should I give in to my heart or fight what could be the best thing to ever happen to me?

But the best part is that it’s just what Liam Brooks needs. Because Caroline Whitmore is the one that got away. But this Hillcrest charmer never makes the same mistake twice. You can find out how these enemies become lovers in Vicious Little Snakes.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is OUT OF SIGHT by Giana Darling

Out of sight, out of mind.
I’d been running for so long, I didn’t have anyone to leave behind.
I liked it that way. No strings, no responsibilities, no one to even remember my name when I was gone.

The world was my oyster and I was sucking it down.

Until a dark night behind a bar when a stranger saves my life and pays a price that should have been mine to give.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is OUT OF SIGHT by Giana Darling

Out of sight, out of mind.
I’d been running for so long, I didn’t have anyone to leave behind.
I liked it that way. No strings, no responsibilities, no one to even remember my name when I was gone.

The world was my oyster and I was sucking it down.

Until a dark night behind a bar when a stranger saves my life and pays a price that should have been mine to give.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Julia’s Desire by Aila Glass

Julia

When I got called into his office, I for sure thought that I was going to get kicked out. I mean, he has clearly noticed the way I stare at him. But then I am greeted by a dominant hand and a handsome smile, taken into the arms of my professor and swept away in a fantasy that I also dreamed about. My only hope now is that this fantasy turns into reality.

Anthony

Wanting your shy and sweet student is against the rules. Craving to feel her skin under your hand is totally not allowed. Calling her into your office to talk about what you found in her room? Probably crossing a line. That is, until I look into her eyes and see that she needs what I can give. It would be wrong not to give her what she wants, right?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is CLOSING TIME by C. G. Burnette and narrated by James Cheatham

Ever been friend zoned by the love of your life?

I have. The girl who has owned my heart since she sat across from me at the lunch table and pinned me with those ocean blue eyes, friend-zoned me.

After ten years of waiting and wanting, I finally get my chance to show her I’m not only her best friend but a man worth her time. I’m not letting this opportunity slip between my fingers.

I’m going to show her what she needs has been right in front of her all along.

When the bartender calls closing time, there is no turning back. She’s mine.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is The A-List by Evie Mitchell

“I think my husband wants to explore kink.”

Rune owns a bookstore, which means he supplies me with all my reading needs.

Only, lately, those books aren’t your momma’s reading list. They aren’t even your best friend’s reading list. They’re the kind of reads that you finish in bed with one hand under the covers, then talk about with other reading-obsessed people in closed book groups on the internet.

But here’s the catch, I’m kind of into it.

Satan better help me, ’cause God’s ready to forsake this little deviant.

		<description>Eben had one job at Elysium--keep the barrier wall lit at all cost. As a Dusk Guard, he was safe from the war raging across the country, from the rebels, and the new world--safe from the battle over power, water, and electricity. He was safe from the laws that would see him dead if they knew his one secret. But when he’s called inside Elysium to watch over one of the rebel prisoners, every wall he’d created to protect himself comes tumbling down.

Cale never thought he’d survive the virus that had turned the world dark and had flipped his country upside down. He never thought his last days would be drawn out inside a cell in one of the most notorious prisons in the west. Elysium was a place for the dead. But in the pitch of night, the one person he’d thought he couldn’t trust becomes his savior and so much more.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is ROADSIDE ATTRACTION by Abby Knox

After escaping a bad marriage, Juniper is on the run. A little car trouble is to be expected on her cross-country road trip to nowhere in particular but breaking down and being stuck in a strange little town called Fate was not in the plan. Neither was meeting a surly tow truck driver/mechanic who arrived just in time. Rex is broody, bossy, and strong, and the connection between them is instantaneous. Putting down roots in Fate might seem simple, but it’s only a matter of time before Juniper’s complicated past catches up to her and brings with it a whole tangled mess of trouble.

Neither was meeting a surly tow truck driver/mechanic who arrived just in time. Rex is broody, bossy, and strong, and the connection between them is instantaneous. Putting down roots in Fate might seem simple, but it’s only a matter of time before Juniper’s complicated past catches up to her and brings with it a whole tangled mess of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is HEART CAMPAIGN by Rebecca Gallo

Like any good politician, Sean Wallace is always campaigning for something.

This time, it’s me.

He’s the Chief of Staff to the President of the United States of America and my co-worker.

After two years of working side-by-side, he thinks he knows me.

He doesn’t know the pain and heartache I’ve endured.

Or that I’m a widow.

Am I ready to move on?

The thought of forgetting the man I loved terrifies me.

But so does the idea of being alone for the rest of my life.

Is Sean my second chance at love?

There’s only one way to find out.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is JAKEN by Joanna Blake

I’ve been on the run for years. I never had a reason to take a stand. Not until I met her.

She’s in trouble when I first meet her. A damsel in distress. I can’t stop myself from rescuing her, and I lose my heart in the process.

I find out everything I can about the girl. She’s a survivor. A warrior. Raising five siblings on her own, kicking butt, and looking great doing so.

I set a plan in motion to make her mine. But when she finds out the truth about who I am and where I came from, the house of cards I built falls to pieces. I’m going to have to come clean and clear my name once and for all.

The question is, even if I can fix the past, am I good enough for an angel like her?

		<description>Event coordinator Gemma Davenport is in the business of love…literally. She loves her job, and she&#039;s good at it. Still, Gemma has never had the opportunity to try love out for herself. There&#039;s only one man who&#039;s tempted her enough to consider it, and he&#039;s a jerk. The sexiest jerk she&#039;s ever met. So, why does her body come alive when she walks into a blind date to find…him?

Fergus Digby hates incompetence. He is meticulous and runs his company with an iron fist. Fergus is used to getting what he wants. And he wants Gemma Davenport. Since she turned down his advances not once, but twice, he can&#039;t stop thinking about her. Fantasizing about having her in his bed.

When Fergus finally gets Gemma alone, the sparks between them grow into fireworks. Can they look past the reasons they shouldn&#039;t be together and embrace the once-in-a-lifetime passion they&#039;ve ignited? Or will their relationship go up in flames before it&#039;s really begun?

		<itunes:subtitle>Event coordinator Gemma Davenport is in the business of love…literally. She loves her job, and she&#039;s good at it. Still, Gemma has never had the opportunity to try love out for herself. There&#039;s only one man who&#039;s tempted her enough to consider it,</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>Event coordinator Gemma Davenport is in the business of love…literally. She loves her job, and she&#039;s good at it. Still, Gemma has never had the opportunity to try love out for herself. There&#039;s only one man who&#039;s tempted her enough to consider it, and he&#039;s a jerk. The sexiest jerk she&#039;s ever met. So, why does her body come alive when she walks into a blind date to find…him?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fergus Digby hates incompetence. He is meticulous and runs his company with an iron fist. Fergus is used to getting what he wants. And he wants Gemma Davenport. Since she turned down his advances not once, but twice, he can&#039;t stop thinking about her. Fantasizing about having her in his bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Fergus finally gets Gemma alone, the sparks between them grow into fireworks. Can they look past the reasons they shouldn&#039;t be together and embrace the once-in-a-lifetime passion they&#039;ve ignited? Or will their relationship go up in flames before it&#039;s really begun?&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Her Alien Collector by Aurora Caine &amp; Nova Edwins

Working in a tavern is not the best job for a human woman living on a space station amongst thousands of aliens, but it’s also not the worst. That is until my boss gets replaced by a bunch of debt collectors. The new owner of the tavern wants me to do a different kind of work.

Luckily for me, one of the regulars of the tavern steps in to save me. And by “saving” I mean that he takes me with him without even asking what I want.

Dark-ish sci-fi romance. Contains a bossy alien, a feisty human woman and a lot of snarling. No cheating. HEA.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is RISE OF THE ANIMALS by Jisa Dean

Athea is having a tough year, her parents died leaving her as the sole provider for her two sisters and large, hairy monsters are attacking her village. To make things worse – she’s been trapped outside the walls and one of the monsters wants her for more than just a midnight snack. It just so happens he’s their leader – the biggest and cruelest of them all. Things go from bad to worse when her sisters become involved. These beasts are scary and dangerous, but could they hold the key to saving her village? And how far is she willing to go to make that sacrifice for her people and keep her sisters safe?

This is the beginning of the Metamorphs story. It’s not historically accurate by any means but it’s quick, dirty, and fun. And you finally get to travel to the town everyone was talking about in The Human Between and it’s set 1000 years earlier. This little nugget will take us back to the origin of a family line that has wound in and out of the Metamorphs history throughout time. It is the beginning of a series but can be read as a stand-alone. Hot virgin love, sexy man-beasts, and the time period where you took what you wanted, what could be better?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is ANYONE BUT YOU by Mae Harden 

Sutton

It was supposed to be a quick boat trip out to the island. One morning, just enough time to get the photos I need for my research grant. But nothing ever goes according to plan. The ship captain I’m expecting is replaced at the last minute, leaving me stuck with Dean Carpenter. Cocky, charming, and unfairly sexy, my best friend’s older brother is six-and-a-half-feet worth of thorn in my side.

The more time I spend with Dean, the more I can grudgingly admit he’s not the teenager I remember. He still loves to push my buttons, but he’s found new ones. In places I can’t resist.

Dean

Filling in for my brother has never had a better view. When Sutton O’Brien turns up on my pier, the mouthwatering curves are all-new, but her fiery spirit is just as intoxicating as I remember.

Stranded by a heart-pounding accident and a storm of biblical proportions, I’m given the one thing I want more than anything else: more time with my uptight little historian.

Now I just have to show her how right we can be for each other. In bed and out.

Anyone But You is a safe, quick, and steamy novella.

I didn’t know him the night I climbed into his chair and under his tattoo machine. I didn’t know him when he taught me about the kind of pleasure I’d only read about in kinky millionaire romances.

I didn’t know that when I walked into my college classroom the next morning the man who’d inked my skin and dirtied my body would be sitting in front of me.

Dean Shaw is my student. My secret. And my downfall if the truth about us comes out.

The problem is, he’s also everything I crave and can’t let go…

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Without End by Jenna Hartley

Turquoise waters.
Endless sand.
Just married.
As an event planner, I’m not used to relinquishing control.
But my new husband makes me want to try.
And I’m coming to realize that when I give in to Harrison, paradise isn’t far behind.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Love You Always by Lucy Darling

Just when I thought I had it all, Kimmy Kennedy falls right into my lap and makes me realize my life is empty, because all this time it’s been missing her.

I knew it would be a fight to have her. She is young, beautiful, and full of life that she only just began. That isn’t the only problem. She&#039;s also my best friend’s little sister.

When our spark ignites far brighter than we could’ve ever known, it brings attention. She wants to keep us a secret. I want the world to know she&#039;s mine.

There’s no hiding the fact that I want her with a desperate need I can&#039;t ignore. She’s all mine, and nothing and no one will ever change that. Not her or her brother.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Their Second Chance by Katee Robert

When Noemi Huxley was forced to choose between love and duty…she chose duty. Three years later, the last thing she expects when she accepts the invite to attend the Thalanian royal wedding is to come face to face with her ex—or to find out he’s assigned as her security detail for the event.

https://amzn.to/2RvbOPy Isaac Kozlov let the love of his life get away once before, and he’ll be damned before he does it a second time. He’s got three days to bring Noemi around to his way of thinking, and Isaac’s pulling out all the stops to make it happen. He’ll play dirty to convince Noemi that happily ever after doesn’t just belong in fairy tales.

Narrated by Virginia Rose &amp; Tristan James

		<description>Our audiobook this week is PLAY THE HAND YOU WERE DEAL by M. Jay Granberry.

There is a new player in the Naked City, and I want it all. The money. The casinos.  The power... that so few can handle and even less deserving. There are obstacles. Rules of engagement that limit my action and shorten my reach. But the fates have been shuffled, and the cards now dealt. It is time to begin. One treacherous game. Seven reluctant players. Destiny will crown one. And luck will destroy the others. Let’s play.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is BREW LOVE by Piper Rayne

I’ve lived in the small town of Sunrise Bay, Alaska, my entire adult life. I have a successful business, great friends, and a community I feel a part of. I never felt like I was missing… well, anything.

Until the day Craig walks into my coffee shop, The Grind. Then he jogs by my coffee shop—shirtless. That was when I knew I was in trouble. Not only was he a nice guy, but he also had a killer body—a by-product of his job as a trainer to MMA fighters, I guess.

When he asks me out, I’m flattered, but the man is almost ten years my junior and only a temporary resident of this town. But flattery gets you everywhere, as they say, and in this case, it got him into my bed.

It’s all fun between us until I start to wonder if we could possibly make this last.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Breath of Fire by Kathryn Nolan

Inhale.
My name is Sage McAllister and my life is about to change remarkably.
I own a thriving yoga studio in Los Angeles.
I have a celebrity client list a mile long.
I’m followed. Fawned over. Adored.
And I’ve just been offered a TV show that could rocket me to stardom.

Exhale.
The choice should be easy.
I have absolutely nothing to lose.
Until a student walks into my class that sets my heart aflame.
Olivia Nguyen, my high school sweetheart.
And the woman I’ve loved my entire life.

Inhale. Exhale.
My name is Sage McAllister and I’ll be your yoga teacher this evening.
Let’s begin.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is HIS DEADLY DARLING by MINK

Luke Knight thinks he can own me, can hurry me into a wedding and then into his bed. He seems to know everything about me. But he’s missed the most important point—I’m dastardly. But I like his estate and all his money, so I’ll bide my time. I don’t obsess over his good looks and the way he makes me feel. Not a bit. Once he’s dead, I’ll be more than happy to be the grieving widow … on a yacht … in the Seychelles … drenched in diamonds.

Cassandra truly believes I’m the bad guy in her world. She’s wrong. I can show her how much she means to me. It will take time and coaxing, but I’ll prove to her our love is deep and true. If she tries to knife me a few times along the way, what of it? After all, a spirited woman is exactly what I need, and Cassandra Carlisle was made for me.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Sweet Enough to Eat by Alexa Riley

Nikki’s been crashing weddings with her bestie Sugar as she tries to find the one. When she least expects it, Dean pops up, and he’s on the same page as she is. But a catastrophe involving a piercing, an IUD, and a trip to the emergency room has her running for the hills.

Dean always knew that when he found the woman that was meant to be his, he would know it. And the second he saw Nikki, he was ready for the white picket fence. But when they get separated, she takes off… But not to worry – he loves the chase.

Warning: This quick follow-up to Wedding Cake Crasher gives you the whole story on Dean and Nikki. Read their side of the story and fall in love all over again.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is I Look Good On You by Olivia Turner

So I was using the pool. Big deal.
It’s not like anyone was living at the house.
Since my neighbors moved out and put it up for sale, I like to hop the fence and study there.
But what I wasn’t expecting was for someone to study me.

Vance Keller.
He comes to see the house, but he sees something he likes even better.

Me.
Now, this rich silver fox is my neighbor.
He bought the house to be close to me.
And now I can’t stay away.
This boring neighborhood just got a whole lot more interesting…

To save her family from a tyrant king, Mara of Aremond must win a tournament—and she won’t let anyone stop her from claiming the prize. Especially not Strax, the barbarian warrior who has tormented her every step of the way. But when a sorcerer’s trap binds them together, Mara must decide whether Strax is her greatest enemy, or if everything she seeks can only be found in the barbarian’s arms…

		<description>Our audiobook this week is The Midnight Bride by Kati Wilde

To save her family from a tyrant king, Mara of Aremond must win a tournament—and she won’t let anyone stop her from claiming the prize. Especially not Strax, the barbarian warrior who has tormented her every step of the way. But when a sorcerer’s trap binds them together, Mara must decide whether Strax is her greatest enemy, or if everything she seeks can only be found in the barbarian’s arms…

Narrated by Cassandra Myles &amp; Brandon Utah

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Jax by Tory Baker

Jax Griffith has been a dick to Sloane Watson from the moment he walked into the shop where she works.|
Jax is a friend of the owner, but that’s not why he keeps coming back to the store.
There’s just something about Sloane that keeps getting his attention.
The problem is, she’s way too young. He’s fourteen years older and that’s a hell of an age gap. He may want her, but Sloane needs to see the world and experience life.
Logically Jax knows that, but he can’t stop thinking about her, dreaming about her, wanting her.
Eventually, Sloane tempts him way too much. When Jax finally gets his head out of his ass, will she even give him a chance? Or will she walk away?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Between Us and Forever by Dylan Allen

Narrated by Tracy Marks &amp; Aaron Shedlock

Once upon a sultry summer night, a princess and a pariah shared a forbidden kiss that neither would
ever forget.

But, very quickly, Carter and Elizabeth learn that there are some rules, that even love won’t allow them to break.

Ten years later he’s back in town.

He’s no longer the outcast

She’s no longer the sweetheart.

And, this time, nothing will get between them and their forever.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Hushed by Lauren Smith

There were three things Henley Cunningham knows about Russell Rawlings.

 	He was gorgeous. He was the kind of hot and sweet sort of golden boy that made a girl simultaneously want to dance and sing like she was in an old-time musical number and drop her panties.
 	She hadn’t seen him since she was fifteen.


 	He was her stepbrother. But looking at him now and remembering all of the things she’d wanted him to do to her… her infatuation had been the worst idea in the history of ideas.

He’s home for the summer after her first year of college and the last thing she needs to do is let her childhood crush cause trouble…but that’s just what Russell Rawlings is…TROUBLE.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Hushed by Lauren Smith

There were three things Henley Cunningham knows about Russell Rawlings.

 	He was gorgeous. He was the kind of hot and sweet sort of golden boy that made a girl simultaneously want to dance and sing like she was in an old-time musical number and drop her panties.
 	She hadn’t seen him since she was fifteen.


 	He was her stepbrother. But looking at him now and remembering all of the things she’d wanted him to do to her… her infatuation had been the worst idea in the history of ideas.

He’s home for the summer after her first year of college and the last thing she needs to do is let her childhood crush cause trouble…but that’s just what Russell Rawlings is…TROUBLE.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Step-Scandal by K Webster

I’m a lawless bad boy with a dark secret.
My heart belongs to a girl I can never have.

She’s beautiful and perfect.
A cop’s daughter.
Pageant princess.
On top of it all, she’s my best friend.

I wish I were worthy of someone like her, but the real reason I can’t have her goes beyond all that.

She’s my sister.|
Step if you want to get technical.

Loving her like I do is wrong.
If anyone finds out, it’s a scandal my family won’t survive.

I’m known in this town for breaking all the rules…
But if I break this one, I’ll break everything.
Our family. Myself. Her.
That’s one thing I could never forgive myself for—something I refuse to do.

My heart, though, has plans of its own.

		<description>Our audiobook teaser this week is Wicked Embrace by Olivia Boothe

Narrated by Tim Paige &amp; Kelsey Navarro

I wanted one thing—to never fall in love again. But the universe had other plans. One look into Tom Wright’s olive-green eyes, and I free-fell crazy in love with the one man destined to break my heart. I know, because I’ve yet to learn my lesson. The past never dies, and mine is ready to rear its ugly head. Question is, will I be strong enough to survive the fallout?

She wasn’t supposed to happen. I’d vowed to never let anyone in, but with one curve of her lips, Sara Hart bulldozed through my heart. I’m happier than I’ve ever been yet scared as hell of how much I love her. Despite my best intentions, I haven’t been one-hundred percent honest. My biggest torment still lurks within, threatening to unwind the strings holding us together. And if I lose her now, it might as well be the end of me.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Spade’s Queen by Loni Ree

I run my own little kingdom with my three best friends-Wild Aces.

One look at her and I take a blow right to the chest. I’m not even sure she’s real. As my world instantly changes, everything in the room disappears except for her.

Jace Spade

I have one little problem-it’s obvious she’s too young to be in my bar. My heart doesn’t care. This girl belongs to me and I’ll find a way to deal with the obstacles.

I’m not thinking clearly when I leave her alone in my office. Why didn’t I get her name? My little spitfire disappears into the night, taking my heart with her.

Dani

That was close. I’m never letting my friends talk me into sneaking into bars again. Between college classes and my job at the local coffee shop, I don’t have time to spend a weekend in jail. Although the hot bar-owner did make my palms sweaty and my heart race. Too bad, he was about to have me locked up.

After weeks of searching, a chance meeting brings Dani back into Spade’s life. This time, he won’t let her slip away. He’s going to fight for his girl and make her his queen.

If you like over-the-top, insta-love romance with a little bit of humor, this short romance is the perfect story for you.

		<title>Podcast Episode 113.2 &#8211; HARD TO HOLD by K. Bromberg</title>

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is HARD TO HOLD by K. Bromberg

Narrated by Shane East &amp; Vanessa Edwin

New York Times bestselling author, K. Bromberg, is back with a heartfelt, standalone romance and a new hero to steal your heart . . .

The contract with Major League Soccer was supposed to help repair my damaged reputation.

Then I discovered that I’d made a deal with the devil: the player I’m supposed to recruit is none other than the bad boy, star Premier League footballer, Rush McKenzie.

British. Tattooed. Sexy. A man currently at the center of a huge scandal.

The goal? To convince him to stay in the States.

But what’s wrong with a little fun in the meantime? No strings. No sweet nothings. Just a way to pass the time while we’re both struggling to prove our true selves to the world.

If someone found out our relationship was anything more than professional, it would only serve to prove all our critics right.

***

I never should have agreed to take the fall.

But I did and I’m a man of my word.

Even if it means risking everything I’ve worked for.

The only bright side is Lennox Kincade.

Gorgeous. Defiant. Rumor-tainted. Totally off-limits.

Sharing a house with the gorgeous sports agent should have been a fun distraction from the turmoil. Someone to help pass the time while the tensions back home die down.

But what started as nothing, ends up as something I never saw coming.

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is HARD TO HOLD by K. Bromberg

Narrated by Shane East &amp; Vanessa Edwin

New York Times bestselling author, K. Bromberg, is back with a heartfelt, standalone romance and a new hero to steal your heart . . .

The contract with Major League Soccer was supposed to help repair my damaged reputation.

Then I discovered that I’d made a deal with the devil: the player I’m supposed to recruit is none other than the bad boy, star Premier League footballer, Rush McKenzie.

British. Tattooed. Sexy. A man currently at the center of a huge scandal.

The goal? To convince him to stay in the States.

But what’s wrong with a little fun in the meantime? No strings. No sweet nothings. Just a way to pass the time while we’re both struggling to prove our true selves to the world.

If someone found out our relationship was anything more than professional, it would only serve to prove all our critics right.

***

I never should have agreed to take the fall.

But I did and I’m a man of my word.

Even if it means risking everything I’ve worked for.

The only bright side is Lennox Kincade.

Gorgeous. Defiant. Rumor-tainted. Totally off-limits.

Sharing a house with the gorgeous sports agent should have been a fun distraction from the turmoil. Someone to help pass the time while the tensions back home die down.

But what started as nothing, ends up as something I never saw coming.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Renaissance Man by Tessa Bailey

The last place ex-Special forces soldier, Kyle Musgrave, expected to find himself was in a joust at a renaissance fair. There&#039;s a prize for winning, however--her name is Cameron and she&#039;s just as horrified by her medieval circumstances as Kyle. She needs his help badly to escape her would-be suitors. For Kyle, that means donning uncomfortable armor, galloping to victory on a stubborn steed and claiming a reward he never expected. If she&#039;ll have him.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Untouched by Alexa Riley

When Alexander buys the land for his new airstrip, he never imagines the home on it is still occupied. But after he lays eyes on Liliana, he decides she’s his property now.

Eighteen-year-old Liliana has been tucked away her whole life. After her grandmother dies, she’s left alone with only her romance books to keep her company. She’s been surrounded by females her whole life, but when Alexander walks in the door, she knows he’s there to save her.

He’s claiming her, no matter how untouched she is.

Will Liliana fight or let Alexander have his way? Will Alexander keep her locked away or set her free? Will there be enough steam in this book to start your own sauna? Only one way to find out!

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is Follow Me Darkly by Helen Hardt

She’s a take-charge woman. But he’s a master of control.

Skye Manning knows what she wants. Her job as assistant and photographer for a major social media influencer isn’t perfect, but it’s a rung on the ladder to bigger and better things. She’s confident she’ll one day take feature photos for National Geographic.

Self-made billionaire Braden Black didn’t get where he is by taking no for an answer. When a chance encounter with the refreshingly innocent and beautiful Skye piques his interest in more ways than one, he’s determined to make her submit.

Dating a billionaire soon has Skye in the middle of a Cinderella story…until the clock strikes midnight and Braden reveals his dark side. Heat sizzles between them, and Skye finds herself falling hard.

But Braden Black is no Prince Charming, and his dark desires are far from his only secret.

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is Caught for Christmas by Skye Warren

Fair warning: Contains a sweet, sexy, honorable man who is ruthless when it comes to catching the woman he wants.

I’ll be home for Christmas…

The plan is simple. Break into the club and steal the money I need to save my father. The ex-military bouncer isn’t going to stop me, even if he is hot as hell.

If only in my dreams…

Except he has a curious knack for knowing my next step.

And there’s something dark underneath his desire, something dangerous. If he catches me, he might not let me go.

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is Because You’re Mine by Claire Contreras!

When my sister asked me to take a course for her while she went out of town for work, I reluctantly agreed. I wasn’t expecting to step into a university auditorium filled with overactive libidos lusting after the professor. And I certainly wasn’t expecting to become one of those women myself, but there’s something about Lorenzo Costello that makes him irresistible. He’s the kind of man mothers warn their daughters about – mysterious, gorgeous, experienced, wild – and for some crazy reason he wants me.

I should run far away and save myself from the impending heartache. So why am I racing toward him? I’m totally going to get burned. A man like Lorenzo won’t leave me unscathed. He’ll make ashes of me.

Because You’re Mine is NOT a dark romance! It’s sexy and will keep you listening.

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is The Girl He Used to Know by Tracey Garvis Graves!

New York Times bestselling author of On the Island, Tracey Garvis Graves, presents the compelling, hopelessly romantic novel of unconditional love.

Annika Rose is an English major at the University of Illinois. Anxious in social situations where she finds most people&#039;s behavior confusing, she&#039;d rather be surrounded by the order and discipline of books or the quiet solitude of playing chess.

Jonathan Hoffman joined the chess club and lost his first game—and his heart—to the shy and awkward, yet brilliant and beautiful Annika. He admires her ability to be true to herself, quirks and all, and accepts the challenges involved in pursuing a relationship with her. Jonathan and Annika bring out the best in each other, finding the confidence and courage within themselves to plan a future together. What follows is a tumultuous yet tender love affair that withstands everything except the unforeseen tragedy that forces them apart, shattering their connection and leaving them to navigate their lives alone.

Now, a decade later, fate reunites Annika and Jonathan in Chicago. She&#039;s living the life she wanted as a librarian. He&#039;s a Wall Street whiz, recovering from a divorce and seeking a fresh start. The attraction and strong feelings they once shared are instantly rekindled, but until they confront the fears and anxieties that drove them apart, their second chance will end before it truly begins.

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is Forbidden by Lauren Smith!

Kat Roberts has a plan. Love doesn’t fit into it.

Move to England.

Study at Cambridge.

Become a history professor.

See? No room for dating or love. Life is going exactly according to plan….until she met him one snowy night in an English pub. Tristan Kingsley, the future Earl of Pembroke. He’s as gorgeous as a god, funny, sweet, and oh-my-god that accent… With a chiseled jaw, bewitching eyes, and a voice as smooth as a glass of brandy…he’s every woman’s dream. He tempts Kat to leave her carefully laid plans behind as she falls head over tea kettle for this British playboy.

Tristan Kingsley went into the bar that night to avoid the duties of his future as a titled lord. When a gorgeous American girl kisses him on a dare from her friends, that kiss turns his world upside down. Oh, he’s used to having exactly what he wants: women, money, notoriety. But now he wants Kat. In his arms, in his bed—and the more time he spends with her, the more he wants her in his life. Tired of shallow, social climbing English debutantes, Tristan can’t get enough of his brilliant, sweet Yank.

But not everyone is happy with the situation. His father, the Earl of Pembroke, has other plans for Tristan, and getting rid of Kat is number one on the list. If you thought this was a fairytale of a girl finding her Prince—er, Earl, and living happily-ever-after…then prepare yourself for one heck of an American Revolution.

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is Unforgettable by Delaney Diamond 

She offered everything he never knew he needed…


Ivy Johnson is stunned when Lucas Baylor makes an appearance at her family’s event in Seattle. She hasn’t seen him in nine years and never expected to again. Avoiding him is a must. She can’t let him uncover her secret, but Lucas won’t be denied. When her deception is revealed, it throws his life into a tailspin and forces them to face the truth of their feelings for each other—feelings they’ve both tried in vain to forget.

		<title>Podcast Episode 104 &#8211; HITCHING THE COWBOY by Kennedy Fox</title>

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is HITCHING THE COWBOY by Kennedy Fox

Wedding bells are the last thing on twenty-two year old Riley Bishop’s mind, but that’s exactly what he hears after waking up in Vegas next to a woman he just met—his new wife.

He never saw her coming, but she might be worth the risk.

Zoey Mitchell is high on life, free spirited, and adventurous. However, learning she married a rowdy cowboy after a night of partying is not what she expected—even for her.

She’s risking it all, gambling with her heart.

Deciding to give their instant marriage a chance, Zoey moves from her big city life to a small town Texas ranch. She has to know if their connection is based on more than just a wild one-night stand before announcing to her family that she got hitched.

One moment changes everything—for better or worse—and a secret could destroy them both.

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is Queen Move by Kennedy Ryan!

The boy who always felt like mine is now the man I can&#039;t have...

Dig a little and you&#039;ll find photos of me in the bathtub with Ezra Stern.

Get your mind out of the gutter. We were six months old.
Pry and one of us might confess we saved our first kiss for each other. The most clumsy, wet, sloppy . . . spectacular thirty seconds of my adolescence.

Get into our business and you&#039;ll see two families, closer than blood, torn apart in an instant.

Twenty years later, my &quot;awkward duckling&quot; best friend from childhood, the boy no one noticed, is a man no one can ignore.

Finer. Fiercer. Smarter.

Taken.

Tell me it&#039;s wrong.

Tell me the boy who always felt like mine is now the man I can&#039;t have.

When we find each other again, everything stands in our way--secrets, lies, promises.

But we didn&#039;t come this far to give up now.

And I know just the move to make if I want to make him mine..

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is Alpha Bully by Renee Rose! 

Narrated by Kai Kennicott &amp; Wen Ross

She ruined everything.... I will make her pay.

Her mom robbed my dad of his job. Destroyed his life.

Now I have to look at her every day.

The girl next door. A human. A hot little nerd.

She doesn’t belong here - not in Wolf Ridge, not at our high school, definitely not in my life.

She doesn’t know what I am.

Which makes it all the easier to take revenge.

I will bring her to her knees. Pierce her heart.

Make her bleed. For me.

All for me.

She ruined everything.... I will make her pay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her mom robbed my dad of his job. Destroyed his life.&lt;br /&gt;

The girl next door. A human. A hot little nerd.&lt;br /&gt;

She doesn’t belong here - not in Wolf Ridge, not at our high school, definitely not in my life.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is Burn Down the Night by Molly O’Keefe

 Narrated by Lee Samuels &amp; Samantha Brentmoor

The only thing that matters to me is rescuing my sister from the drug-cooking cult that once enslaved us both. I’ve run cons my whole life, and I’ll use my body to get whatever I need. Max Daniels is the last connection I have to that world, the one person reckless enough to get involved. Besides, now that his brothers have turned on him, he needs me too.

The deal was supposed to be simple: a place to hide in exchange for rescuing my sister. Now he’s my prisoner. Totally at my mercy. But I’m the one captivated. Enthralled. Doing everything he asks of me until I’m not sure who’s in control.

We both crave the heat. The more it hurts, the better. But what if Max wants a different life now, to leave the game...to love me? I thought I knew better than to get burned. Now I’m in too deep to pull away. And the crazy thing is...I don’t want to.

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is Wealthy &amp; Wanted by Alexa Riley!

Narrated by John Strike.

Dotty Spencer is desperate. She’s been promised to a man she doesn’t love and is looking for a way out. When she answers an ad for a cleaning woman, she never expects her new boss to be the one.

Clay Walker takes one look at Dotty and knows this was a mistake. He isn’t ready for a woman to steal his heart and make him feel things he doesn’t want to. He’s mad as hell that she’s forcing him to open up to what could only be described as love.

		<description>Our audiobook tease this week is Notice by K Webster!

Narrated by Kylie Stewart &amp; Eric Roilon

I didn’t notice her before…but now I do.
The shiny strands of gold in her silky brown hair.
Tiny crinkles between her eyebrows when she frowns.
Her passion for neatness.

Once I focus on her, I can’t take my eyes from my newest obsession. Ever.
I need to know everything about her.
Her past. Her present.
The way she takes her coffee.
Exactly how she smells after a spritz of perfume in the mornings.

She’s perfect in every way and I was blind.
But, God, now do I see.

I notice the organized way she arranges her clothes in her closet.
How she visits the same market each Saturday.
The sounds of her breathing as I lie beneath her bed in silence.

Violet is mine.
She just doesn’t know it yet.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is a preview of TOOLS OF ENGAGEMENT by New York Times Bestselling Author Tessa Bailey!

Narrated by Charlotte North

Hair, makeup, clothing, decor... everything in Bethany Castle&#039;s world is organized, planned, and styled to perfection. Which is why the homes she designs for her family&#039;s real estate business are the most coveted in town. The only thing not perfect? Her track record with men. She&#039;s on a dating hiatus and after helping her friends achieve their dreams, Bethany finally has time to focus on her own: flip a house, from framework to furnishings, all by herself. Except her older brother runs the company and refuses to take her seriously.

When a television producer gets wind of the Castle sibling rivalry, they’re invited on Flip Off, a competition to see who can do the best renovation. Bethany wants bragging rights, but she needs a crew and the only member of her brother&#039;s construction team willing to jump ship is Wes Daniels, the new guy in town. His Texas drawl and handsome face got under Bethany&#039;s skin on day one, but the last thing she needs is some cocky young cowboy in her way.

As the race to renovate heats up, Wes and Bethany are forced into close quarters, trading barbs and biting banter as they remodel the ugliest house on the block. It&#039;s a labor of love, hate, and everything in between, and soon sparks are flying. But Bethany&#039;s perfectly structured life is one kiss away from going up in smoke and she knows falling for a guy like Wes would be a flipping disaster.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is OVER THE FALLS by Carmel Rhodes!

Narrated by Lacey Laurel

Note to self: never lie on your resume. At least not about important stuff.
Can you speak Japanese? Sure.
Drive a stick shift? No problem.
Scale a mountain? Hard pass.
Now, because of the creative liberties I’d taken when I’d been offered the role my agent said would lead to an Oscar, I’m trapped in the middle of nowhere Alaska.
My only hope is a very grumpy, potential serial killer,  who plucked my unconscious body out of the river just before I followed my crew over the waterfall.
Cam is a hulk of a man. Surly, angry, mysterious. I don’t know if I can trust him, but I do know, without him, I’m as good as dead.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is HIS MOUNTAIN HOSTAGE by USA Today Bestselling Author Jane Henry!

Narrated by by Faith Clark

Leila
I work for myself,
I follow my own rules,
And I do both well.
Until the day Ransom comes for me.

A dark alley.
A stranger in the night.
I wake up in a cabin in the mountains.
Tied to his bed.
He demands payback.
Submission.
Obedience.

But nothing is as it seems,
and I’m hiding a secret.
Now I’m bound to him…
His captive.
His plaything…
His mountain hostage.

Asher Woods doesn’t deserve to be in prison.
He didn’t murder in cold blood; he saved her.
He saved her life.
How was this fair?
He doesn’t deserve to be there and I’m going to prove it.
I’m going to get him out of prison.
And then, I’m going to f*ck him.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is A Bride Worth Fighting For by Tracy Lauren!

Narrated by Leigh Allison

Abducted by aliens, Evie thinks the only thing she has to strive for in her hellish new life is
survival. Dragged halfway across the galaxy to the newly colonized farming world of Ipoch, she’s intended to be awarded as a prize to the winner of a barbaric gladiator fight. She hopes the champion isn’t cruel, she hopes he doesn’t have the capacity to harm her, but never once, does she hope to fall in love.

Serif is done with fighting. He’s done with the threat it poses to his people. When he sees the beautiful Evie, however—there’s no turning back. He’ll agree to one last tournament to save the girl, and when he wins she’ll belong to him. Because this is more than just a battle, he soon realizes. This time, Serif is FIGHTING FOR HIS BRIDE.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is HIS VIRGIN QUEEN by MINK! 

Narrated by Lance Greenfield and Mackenzie Cartwright

I knew I was going to be sold by my father. A bride offered to forge an alliance or seal a deal. Even so, I still held onto the hope of living free of the families. But when I’m given to Antonio Tuscani, I realize my thin dreams of escaping this life were just that—dreams. Giving up, I accept my fate … Until a fierce-eyed boss, Nick DaVinci, shows up on my wedding day to exact lethal vengeance.

I came for Tuscani blood, and I took it. The doe-eyed bride in her white dress and veil of innocence doesn’t bat an eyelash when I do what I was born to do. I’m the head of the most powerful mafia family in the city, and I didn’t get here by sparing enemies. But Sophia’s demeanor intrigues me, and soon I realize she is far more than a mafia princess. She is a queen, and I will stop at nothing to keep her by my side.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is HIS VIRGIN QUEEN by MINK! 

Narrated by Lance Greenfield and Mackenzie Cartwright

I knew I was going to be sold by my father. A bride offered to forge an alliance or seal a deal. Even so, I still held onto the hope of living free of the families. But when I’m given to Antonio Tuscani, I realize my thin dreams of escaping this life were just that—dreams. Giving up, I accept my fate … Until a fierce-eyed boss, Nick DaVinci, shows up on my wedding day to exact lethal vengeance.

I came for Tuscani blood, and I took it. The doe-eyed bride in her white dress and veil of innocence doesn’t bat an eyelash when I do what I was born to do. I’m the head of the most powerful mafia family in the city, and I didn’t get here by sparing enemies. But Sophia’s demeanor intrigues me, and soon I realize she is far more than a mafia princess. She is a queen, and I will stop at nothing to keep her by my side.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is DEVASTATE ME by Emma Castle! 

Narrated by PJ Morgan

A hot next-door neighbor romance…

The last thing Ophelia Westcott expects when she moves into her new home is to see a drop-dead gorgeous bearded hulk of a man mowing his lawn. She doesn’t have the heart for love or even lust, not after her last boyfriend dumped her. No, she’s here to focus on living a quiet life, working as an online clothing stylist and avoiding men like the hottie next door. It doesn’t matter that her new neighbor is a former Navy SEAL, or that he grows the most beautiful azaleas and looks like he might just be capable of killing a woman with pleasure in bed. Yeah, she’s hands off on this one—no matter how much he tempts her.

Colt Henshaw has a thing about women. He loves them, but he can’t trust them with his heart. Not after his ex-fiancée slept with his best friend while he was serving his country. After moving to a small town, fending off the housewives and divorcées on his quiet little street is the only thing he wants to worry about. But one look at the woman who moves in next door has him rethinking his vow of solitude. He can’t help but imagine all the things he would do to her if she belonged to him. Better for him to stick to his fantasies, because the last thing he should do is steal a kiss. Uh-oh . . . it might be too late for that.

Narrated by Gloria Tsai

An Alpha Billionaire and Curvy Woman Romance

Owen
I’m a billionaire that doesn’t have time for fun, dating, or anything else.
But when I accidentally get on a call with Emily, a phone sex operator,
my life changes.
Now instead of chasing dollars and companies,
I’m chasing her.

Emily
Don’t get attached.
That’s the rules.
But after the first time I talked to him, I knew he was special.
He’s gone out of his way to find out who I am and then to help my family.
He’s too powerful.  Too rich.  Too much.
I may be crazy, but all I want is him.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN by Frankie Love!

Narrated by Jay Alder and Heather Firth

As a forest ranger in Fox Hollow Forest, I spend my days in the woods alone.

Until now.

A baby has been abandoned at the station and it’s my duty to get her somewhere safe.

When Katie, the cute and curvy social worker comes to take the baby, a storm sweeps in.

Now she’s stuck here at my cabin until the weather turns.

But by then it will be too late.

Katie is mine now. Heart and soul.

I just have to convince her that a baby doesn’t just change me.

This baby is changing everything.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is LOVELY BAKER by New York Times Bestselling Author Alexa Riley!

Narrated by Kit Swann and Matthew Maddux

Jenna has been running the bakery for a while now and she doesn’t need her grouchy boss telling her what to do. No matter how big his muscles are or how dark those eyes can be when he’s staring into her soul. Wait, what were we talking about? Oh yeah, she’s busy taking care of her little brother whom she’s raised since he was a baby and she doesn’t have time for men. No matter how sexy they are.

Reed has been playing the long game with Jenna because he knows she has a responsibility to her son. But from the first time he saw her, he’s been counting down the seconds until he can make her his. Her time of playing games is over, and a weekend away at a friend&#039;s wedding is just the opportunity he needs.

Warning: He’s pressing his luck and she likes the way it feels against her. Hot and dirty at the speed of happily ever after. What more could you want? Epilogues? Good thing the ebook has plenty!

		<description>Our audiobook this week is LOVELY BAKER by New York Times Bestselling Author Alexa Riley!

Narrated by Kit Swann and Matthew Maddux

Jenna has been running the bakery for a while now and she doesn’t need her grouchy boss telling her what to do. No matter how big his muscles are or how dark those eyes can be when he’s staring into her soul. Wait, what were we talking about? Oh yeah, she’s busy taking care of her little brother whom she’s raised since he was a baby and she doesn’t have time for men. No matter how sexy they are.

Reed has been playing the long game with Jenna because he knows she has a responsibility to her son. But from the first time he saw her, he’s been counting down the seconds until he can make her his. Her time of playing games is over, and a weekend away at a friend&#039;s wedding is just the opportunity he needs.

Warning: He’s pressing his luck and she likes the way it feels against her. Hot and dirty at the speed of happily ever after. What more could you want? Epilogues? Good thing the ebook has plenty!

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Changing Her Luck by Ella Maven!

Narrated by Lacy Laurel and Jack Wesley

I have lousy luck. Like, the worst. I could list all the reasons this is true except my journal is

back on Earth. Where I’m not. Because I fell asleep in the wrong bed and woke up on an alien planet. To make matters worse, a massive blue alien with fangs and muscles takes me hostage. Now I’m stuck on a spaceship with him, but instead of taking off my head, he’s promising to protect

me and care for me. I want to believe him, but my former captors are after us space-chase style.

I wish I could relax with my new blue guy and maybe see what else about him is large and in

charge, but I’m Lousy Luck Lea. Unless something goes my way for once in my life, we’re doomed.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Moravian Rhapsody by KD Robichaux!

Narrated by Mackenzie Cartwright &amp; Leo Barnabas

Is this my real life? Or is this just a fantasy?

Bucket list cruise from Berlin to Prague—check.

An excursion to hear Czech folklore and live music and to try authentic cuisine—check.

A chance to pull up my big-girl panties, face my fears, and give in to my wanderlust just this once—check, check, and check.

And it doesn’t even matter I ended up being the only person on our cruise under the age of seventy. I’m here for the adventure, the history… the food.

Until the very moment my eyes land on the heart-stoppingly handsome violinist of the traditional Moravian band.

Nothing could’ve prepared me for the instant attraction, the immediate connection we had without even speaking a word.

And after dinner and the show, he had already made up his mind about me.

I was his.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Moravian Rhapsody by KD Robichaux!

Narrated by Mackenzie Cartwright &amp; Leo Barnabas

Is this my real life? Or is this just a fantasy?

Bucket list cruise from Berlin to Prague—check.

An excursion to hear Czech folklore and live music and to try authentic cuisine—check.

A chance to pull up my big-girl panties, face my fears, and give in to my wanderlust just this once—check, check, and check.

And it doesn’t even matter I ended up being the only person on our cruise under the age of seventy. I’m here for the adventure, the history… the food.

Until the very moment my eyes land on the heart-stoppingly handsome violinist of the traditional Moravian band.

Nothing could’ve prepared me for the instant attraction, the immediate connection we had without even speaking a word.

And after dinner and the show, he had already made up his mind about me.

I was his.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is JUSTICE FOR CORA by L.B. Dunbar!

Narrated by Sophie James

Corabelle Conrad has lived a pampered life until the upheaval of divorce and an empty nest makes her reckless one night. After an unfulfilling marriage, she’s out to get what she hasn’t had in years—an orgasm or three. The night held no promises after those twelve hours, but it’s been difficult to let go of the connection she had with a man so unlike her. A man who shows up on her doorstep a year later.

Justice lives by a code of brotherhood. Bikes first. Babes second. When a classy lady enters the Devil’s Den, she’s in the wrong place looking for the right thing and he wants to be the one to give it to her. He can’t explain it. She’s everything opposite him, but after a year separation, he’s wondering if she’ll open the door for him again.

Narrated by Emily Ellet

Old vs. Young
Experience vs. Attitude
No Teeth vs. Also No Teeth…
It’s the game some of these players have been waiting a lifetime for. The veterans of the Nashville
Assassins versus the new generation of players—their sons.
As part of their prewedding festivities, Aiden Brooks and Shelli Adler have invited the retired Assassins
to play a friendly game against the Stanley Cup-winning current team.

And while the guys are battling it out on the ice, the women are running the show from the stands.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is STRIPPED BARE by NY Times Bestselling Author Tessa Bailey!

Narrated by Karen White

A one-night stand with a male stripper? You’ve never done anything like this—and for good reason. Your father is a well-known megachurch pastor and your one night of passion could hurt his image. There’s just one problem. The sensual, hungry man you can’t stop thinking about refuses to leave you alone. He’s already addicted and wants more. And he’s going to get it. But just how far is he willing to go to make you his wife?

A one-night stand with a male stripper? You’ve never done anything like this—and for good reason. Your father is a well-known megachurch pastor and your one night of passion could hurt his image. There’s just one problem. The sensual, hungry man you can’t stop thinking about refuses to leave you alone. He’s already addicted and wants more. And he’s going to get it. But just how far is he willing to go to make you his wife?&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is UNDENIABLE by NY Times Bestselling Author Aleatha Romig!

Narrated by Daniel James Lewis and Elle Sonali

Forbidden love…is undeniable.

When she was younger, like all little girls, Sophie Hawkins believed in fantasies. She believed in happily-ever-after and that one day her prince would come. What made Sophie’s dreams a bit different was that the man of her dreams wasn’t a fictional prince but her best friend’s dad.

Matt was handsome and nice, the kind of man every woman would want.

Time passes, and through the years, Sophie’s reality changes, yet her attraction and memories of Matt Hamilton never fade. Where boys and men are concerned, Matt remains her gold standard.

When his daughter was young, Matt Hamilton had it all: a family and success.

With the ticking of the clock and changing of the calendar, seasons pass and situations adjust. Business success remains, but personally, his world changes…until the day fate sets the undeniable in motion.

Sophie was a sweet little girl, his daughter’s best friend, and a ray of undeniable sunshine. That was before. Now she’s more. She is a grown woman.

Who can deny the undeniable?

Narrated by Mollie Stark and Jack Callahan

My job is to keep people safe, keep my mouth shut, and blend into the shadows so the clients can get exactly what they’re paying for. But when sweet Claire comes to my boss asking for help relieving herself of the pesky little issue of her virginity, staying in the shadows is no longer an option. From first sight, I know Claire’s mine. And I’ll be damned if I let another man pop that cherry.

She’s a woman with a past. He’s a man on a mission. Can he get her to the altar before she bolts and runs?

Paige has a new life and is marrying the man of her dreams. But that dream turns into a nightmare when her grifter family crashes her rehearsal dinner. A big problem, since her District Attorney fiancé, Will doesn’t know about her criminal past.

Narrated by Pippa Jayne&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She’s a woman with a past. He’s a man on a mission. Can he get her to the altar before she bolts and runs?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paige has a new life and is marrying the man of her dreams. But that dream turns into a nightmare when her grifter family crashes her rehearsal dinner. A big problem, since her District Attorney fiancé, Will doesn’t know about her criminal past. The only way for Paige to save the man she loves from the family she hates is to run and never look back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will’s found the perfect woman to build a future with, but when an accidental surprise causes Paige to run from the life they planned together. He knows he’ll do anything to get her back, even if he has to arrest her whole family and have the town’s sheriff deliver his bride to the altar, cuffs, and all.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is GENERAL JOE by NY Times Bestselling Author Alexa Riley!

Narrated by Alicyn AImes and David Brenin

Kayla may have pulled on the tiger&#039;s tail one too many times. She’s been in love with Joe her whole life, and when he leaves for the military she has the bright idea to send him dirty letters and pictures the whole time. When he comes back from his time away, he makes it clear he’s coming for her. But has she gone too far?

Joe has been teased by Kayla for years and it’s about time she made good on her filthy words. He’s been counting down the days until he can make her his…and now the wait is over. She’s going to admit to him and herself that this is what’s right. No matter their age difference or their time apart.

Warning: He’s a great American hero coming home to claim his reward. Don’t worry…it’s the dirty happily ever after we know you want!

		<title>Podcast Episode 74.2 &#8211; FIREMAN DADDY by Taryn Quinn</title>

		<description>Our audiobook this week is FIREMAN DADDY by USA Today Bestselling Author Taryn Quinn! 

Narrated by Lola James and Wesley Paul I got my happily-ever-after…except it wasn’t. 

My HEA ended when my formerly star quarterback husband slept with—no, not our old head cheerleader. Someone else. Hello, this isn’t a Lifetime movie.

So, I left New York City and went home to small-town Crescent Cove. I’d inherited a bar that was apparently the watering hole for local firemen. Super hot firemen, namely one in particular.

Okay, so maybe this is a Lifetime movie.

Especially since the fire code chief—and my ex’s high school friend—keeps hassling me about getting the bar up to code, when all I want to do is get the place fixed up so I can go back to the city.

Don’t I?

But Jake is making me remember why I love my hometown. And it turns out he isn’t only good at preventing fires, he’s even better at starting them.

And the one between us may just burn forever…

Author’s note: Jake isn’t a daddy yet, but if he has his way, he’ll be knocking up Erica faster than you can say five-alarm blaze. Fireman Daddy is a 18K novella with no cliffhanger and a happily-ever-after.

My HEA ended when my formerly star quarterback husband slept with—no, not our old head cheerleader. Someone else. Hello, this isn’t a Lifetime movie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, I left New York City and went home to small-town Crescent Cove. I’d inherited a bar that was apparently the watering hole for local firemen. Super hot firemen, namely one in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Okay, so maybe this is a Lifetime movie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Especially since the fire code chief—and my ex’s high school friend—keeps hassling me about getting the bar up to code, when all I want to do is get the place fixed up so I can go back to the city.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t I?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But Jake is making me remember why I love my hometown. And it turns out he isn’t only good at preventing fires, he’s even better at starting them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the one between us may just burn forever…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Author’s note: Jake isn’t a daddy yet, but if he has his way, he’ll be knocking up Erica faster than you can say five-alarm blaze. Fireman Daddy is a 18K novella with no cliffhanger and a happily-ever-after.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is THE FEAR OF FALLING by B. Cranford!

Narrated by Kit Swann and Rock EngleEveryone knows love is a battlefield. For Lenny Johnstone, it’s more like a challenge.

Actually, everything is kind of a challenge for her. In comparison to her stunning—yet flighty—twin sister, Lenny’s awkwardly tall, painfully shy, and not so good at putting herself out there. Which is why she’s decided it’s high time she faced her demons. Starting with the one thing that’s always terrified her most: roller coasters.

Meeting a man was not on her summer to-do list. Falling for the tall, dark, and handsome stranger who wants to help her overcome her fears wasn’t either.

But Lenny’s about to learn that the only thing with more twists and turns than a roller coaster is love.

		<title>Podcast Episode 72.2 &#8211; SLAKE HIS THIRST by Setta Jay</title>

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SLAKE HIS THIRST by Setta Jay!

Narrated by Kit Swann and Curt BonnemSage has always been a little restless. From bounty hunter to bar owner, she still hasn’t found a purpose she truly enjoys. So, when she’s given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to visit the ultra-exclusive Aletheia resort, Slake, she jumps at the chance to get away and think. As a Mageia whose power is centered in plants and the earth, Sage assumes she’ll be more tempted to see Slake’s magical one-of-a-kind gardens than play with the sexy vampire-like Immortals all over the resort. Only, one beautiful man catches her eye, right before she inadvertently unleashes a savage magic best left dormant.

Lucius is constructing new security plans when he finds himself drawn to a seductive mortal guest at his father’s resort. When he realizes the sexy blonde is a security threat his sister has allowed onto the island, he sets out to learn all her secrets. When Sage raises ancient magic that could threaten her life, Lucius rushes to save his tempting mystery woman. Only when he nears her does he realize she is the woman he has been waiting thousands of years to find. She is his. Will the power Sage unleashes destroy her, or does fate have other plans?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is TOASTY by New York Times Bestselling Author Alexa Riley! 

Narrated by Curt Bonnem and Elizabeth Hart

Myra Michaels has been a personal slave to Kace Cox for far too long. She’s tired of him making her work all hours of the night and taking long work trips with just the two of them that could have been an email. She’s also really tired of the uncontrollable attraction she feels for him and she’s got to get away from it. But the day she quits, she makes an even bigger mistake and now she’s got a secret baby bump to think of. Hiding out in a reclusive billionaire&#039;s castle sounds like a great plan. That is until Kace comes knocking.

Kace Cox has wanted Myra since the moment she walked into his office. But his policy of not sleeping with employees leaves no room for his desires. He’s waited all this time and hasn’t touched another woman since the day he laid eyes on her. So when Myra quits she’s finally fair game. He gets just one taste of her and then she disappears, but she has no idea how determined he can be.

Warning: What could possibly happen when he finds her?! Get toasty with us, because you know it’s a steamy happily ever after!

		<description>Our audiobook this week is TOASTY by New York Times Bestselling Author Alexa Riley! 

Narrated by Curt Bonnem and Elizabeth Hart

Myra Michaels has been a personal slave to Kace Cox for far too long. She’s tired of him making her work all hours of the night and taking long work trips with just the two of them that could have been an email. She’s also really tired of the uncontrollable attraction she feels for him and she’s got to get away from it. But the day she quits, she makes an even bigger mistake and now she’s got a secret baby bump to think of. Hiding out in a reclusive billionaire&#039;s castle sounds like a great plan. That is until Kace comes knocking.

Kace Cox has wanted Myra since the moment she walked into his office. But his policy of not sleeping with employees leaves no room for his desires. He’s waited all this time and hasn’t touched another woman since the day he laid eyes on her. So when Myra quits she’s finally fair game. He gets just one taste of her and then she disappears, but she has no idea how determined he can be.

Warning: What could possibly happen when he finds her?! Get toasty with us, because you know it’s a steamy happily ever after!

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Belong to Me by Lucy Darling!

Narrated by Mackenzie Cartwright and Lance Greenfield

Some things never change, I think as I listen to my sister’s crazy idea. There is no way this will work. We may have been able to pull off the old switcheroo when we were younger, but I doubt it will work now. Even though we’re identical twins, we are far from the same. I work from home and keep to myself while she works a corporate job and deals with an overbearing boss. Yet, I know without a doubt that I’m going to agree to her crazy plan.

Pretend to be her for a week was the favor she’d asked for. It would be easy, she said. Her boss would never notice, she insisted. I beg to differ. It’s only day one, and all he seems to notice is me.

He doesn’t want me as his assistant. He wants me in his bed permanently. He says I belong to him, but is it me or my sister that he’s claiming?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is MEAN RIGHT HOOK by Michele Mills!

Narrated by Lauren Sweet

Leah’s first day at her new job is turning into a complete fiasco. She’s spilt coffee all over her work uniform, and then the elevator breaks down. Now she’s stuck in a tenuous mining cage with a silent, rugged miner with mighty fists, shocking fangs and a mean right hook—who keeps pulling her into his massive arms and inhaling her scent.

When the cage starts hurtling towards certain disaster she finds her bare hand accidentally clasped within his rough claw…and Leah’s about to discover the true meaning of the term, “mating compatible.”
But is she ready for this commitment, or is a human about to break an alien miner’s heart?

Narrated by Lauren Sweet&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leah’s first day at her new job is turning into a complete fiasco. She’s spilt coffee all over her work uniform, and then the elevator breaks down. Now she’s stuck in a tenuous mining cage with a silent, rugged miner with mighty fists, shocking fangs and a mean right hook—who keeps pulling her into his massive arms and inhaling her scent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the cage starts hurtling towards certain disaster she finds her bare hand accidentally clasped within his rough claw…and Leah’s about to discover the true meaning of the term, “mating compatible.”&lt;br /&gt;
But is she ready for this commitment, or is a human about to break an alien miner’s heart?&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SCANDALOUS BILLIONAIRE by USA Today Bestselling Author Sierra Cartwright! 

Narrated by Kit Swann

Money can&#039;t buy love...

Elizabeth Ryan grew up in the shadows of wealth. As the daughter of an affluent family&#039;s housekeeper, she knows all too well that happiness can&#039;t be bought. So she&#039;s worked hard to secure the life of her dreams. The only thing missing is her Prince Charming.

She&#039;s looking for a man who&#039;s solid and reputable--and the handsome playboy Braden Gallagher is not that man. Lizzie has tempted Braden for years, but she wasn&#039;t just off-limits—she was forbidden. Now she&#039;s standing in his closet, holding his red tie, while his mind races with indecent thoughts.

More than a billionaire, he&#039;s different than she remembers--haunted by secrets that have hardened his soul. Braden is committed to tearing down the walls around Lizzie&#039;s heart, but to win her love, he will have to prove he&#039;s changed his ways.

Will it be enough?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is FATED by Stephanie Rose! 

Narrated by Curt Bonnem and Kit Swann

Time has passed, but the longing hasn’t. 

Patrick Miller cut off the only girl he’d ever loved, believing he had no other choice. More than a decade later, he’s never forgotten her. Now, he’s got a whole new life—but no room for love.

Arianna Cole loves her job and the children in the day care center she owns, but that’s the only love she’ll allow into her life—that she can allow.

But then the boy who was once her everything walks through the doors of her center.

With his son.

Patrick broke her heart right after she’d handed it to him, and she can’t go back. Her yearning for him still smolders, but it’s trapped behind twelve years of hurt.

Are Patrick and Arianna still in the wrong place at the wrong time, or are they fated?

&lt;br /&gt;
Narrated by Curt Bonnem and Kit Swann&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Time has passed, but the longing hasn’t. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Patrick Miller cut off the only girl he’d ever loved, believing he had no other choice. More than a decade later, he’s never forgotten her. Now, he’s got a whole new life—but no room for love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Arianna Cole loves her job and the children in the day care center she owns, but that’s the only love she’ll allow into her life—that she can allow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But then the boy who was once her everything walks through the doors of her center.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With his son.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Patrick broke her heart right after she’d handed it to him, and she can’t go back. Her yearning for him still smolders, but it’s trapped behind twelve years of hurt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are Patrick and Arianna still in the wrong place at the wrong time, or are they fated?&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is DOUBLE BOOKED by New York Times Bestselling Author Tessa Bailey! 

Narrated by Kit Swann

Uh oh. You’ve just shown up for your date with a straight-laced police officer. One problem, though. There’s a tough biker there, too. That’s right. You’ve accidentally booked two dates for the same night, in the same place. And both of these men are very interested in keeping the evening going. They want you. Badly. So badly, in fact, they’re not going to make you choose one or the other…

		<description>Our audiobook this week is THICK by New York Times Bestselling Author Alexa Riley! 

Narrated by Lauren Sweet and Matthew Maddux

Teeny has just moved into a brand new place and curiosity has gotten the better of her. When she meets her new neighbor she’s not prepared for how big or how hot he is. The gentle giant has her fantasies running wild and she’s learning what it means to love thy neighbor.

Bull has always been the biggest in the room and it’s annoying. He’s a former security guard who now does online consulting to stay away from the stares. But when his young little neighbor wants to make friends he can’t help himself. He’s tearing down all his walls and breaking the rules just to have a shot at what he never thought was possible.

Warning: Will Bull be too big to make Teeny his? Will it somehow work anyway? You betcha! Find out what happens when this bull meets his china shop…because it’s wild!

		<description>Our audiobook this week is THE NEIGHBOR by Brighton Walsh! 

Narrated by Mackenzie Cartwright

On a day when nothing seems to be going my way, I just want to binge my favorite show and inhale a couple—okay, a dozen—cupcakes. But the black cloud that’s followed me all day comes back when I realize I’m out of sugar. I resign myself to the fact that I’ll have to—*shudder*—ask a neighbor for some neighborly help and set out to harass my fellow apartment-dwellers, all in the name of chocolate.

When a dripping wet and freshly showered hottie I’ve definitely never seen before answers my impatient knock, I’m rendered speechless. Okay, not speechless, because that’d be far too easy for me. Instead I humiliate myself in typical Lucy fashion, then bail, certain if I try hard enough I can go the rest of my life without running into Hot Neighbor Guy again.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is THE NEIGHBOR by Brighton Walsh! 

Narrated by Mackenzie Cartwright

On a day when nothing seems to be going my way, I just want to binge my favorite show and inhale a couple—okay, a dozen—cupcakes. But the black cloud that’s followed me all day comes back when I realize I’m out of sugar. I resign myself to the fact that I’ll have to—*shudder*—ask a neighbor for some neighborly help and set out to harass my fellow apartment-dwellers, all in the name of chocolate.

When a dripping wet and freshly showered hottie I’ve definitely never seen before answers my impatient knock, I’m rendered speechless. Okay, not speechless, because that’d be far too easy for me. Instead I humiliate myself in typical Lucy fashion, then bail, certain if I try hard enough I can go the rest of my life without running into Hot Neighbor Guy again.

Narrated by Brad King and Maxx Power

Boy meets boy, boy kisses boy, boy loses boy. Is it finally time for boy to get boy? It’s been five years since Chris and I graduated from the conservatory. Five years since I kissed my best friend and sent him running into someone else’s arms. Now Chris is back, and he wants a do-over. But that means opening myself up to being hurt again. And I’m not sure I can take it if Chris walks away from me this time.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Snow Angel by MINK

Narrated by Lance Greenfield and Mackenzie Cartwright

My house may be small, but its Christmas lights are the best on the street. Perfectly coordinated each year, my holiday display can’t be beat. I reign supreme. At least I did. Until he moved in across the street. Brendan. Who does he think he is? Just because he’s handsome and makes my parts tingly doesn’t mean I’ll let him beat me. This Christmas, he’s going down.

Ariadne waits for the clock to tick over to December 1. She’s poised over there, ready to spring into action with her curvy body and Christmas spirit. She goes all out for the holidays. This Christmas, I intend to go all out for her.

MINK’s note: Snow Angel is an instalove, steamy, and sweet romance with a HEA, perfect for reading with a kitty in your lap and a coffee sitting next to you.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is CHRISTMAS IN BLACKWOOD by Celia Aaron! 

Narrated by Kit Swann &amp; Curt Bonnem

Azalea Attorney Ella King has a case. Browerton Attorney Hart Blackwood does, too. Too bad they’re adversaries. When Ella and Hart clash, sparks fly in and out of the courtroom. But with the holidays approaching, the judge wants their troublesome case off his docket. Despite the giving season, Hart and Ella’s clients can’t agree on anything, and Ella and Hart are locked in a head-to-head battle. It would take a Christmas miracle to thaw relations between the parties. But could the memory of one night years ago reignite an even bigger flame between Hart and Ella?

It would take a Christmas miracle to thaw relations between the parties. But could the memory of one night years ago reignite an even bigger flame between Hart and Ella?&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is ADRIAN by USA Today Bestselling Author Ella Fox &amp; Rochelle Paige! 

Narrated by Kit Swann and Curt Bonnem

Adrian Clarke quickly discovered there were drawbacks to playing the hero from the bestselling romance trilogy of all time. It was difficult to have any privacy when everyone knew who you were.

Casey Smythe knew nothing about Hollywood heartthrobs or celebrity gossip. The beautiful college student had plenty of other things to keep her busy, including the dogs she was paid to play within the park.

Little did she know, the handsome man she tried to get fired after he swore at one of her favorite dogs wasn’t a dog walker at all. He was Hollywood’s newest sensation and Duke’s owner.

And now his sights were set on the one woman who couldn’t care less about his fame.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is Doctor Dave by Abby Knox! 

Narrated by Matthew Maddux and Lauren Sweet

Working the graveyard shift at a local shopping mall isn’t as bad as you think, and 29 year old security guard Millie has plenty of hobbies to help her pass the lonely hours each night. Need a hand-knit animal hat? She’s got you covered. But the best part of her late night job is tuning in to hear bad boy radio personality, Doctor Dave, give out unorthodox dating and sex advice on his live call-in show. With her 30th birthday fast approaching, she’s quickly giving up on finding true love for herself. Tonight, however, she’s giving it one more chance before taking extreme measures. Will dialing up the sexy Doctor Dave finally provide the right prescription?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is WYNTER’S CAPTIVE by New York Times Bestselling Author Milly Taiden! 

Narrated by Kit Swann

Lili&#039;s life had never been very exciting, so she hoped her cousin&#039;s wedding would provide some entertainment in her life. What she didn&#039;t expect was to almost kill a man on her way to the ceremony. She definitely didn&#039;t expect to get chased by naked men in middle of the forest. Oh, and she sure as hell didn&#039;t foresee a hot mountain of a man giving her the hottest sex of her life. But, hey, shit happens.

Cade Wynters wants revenge. He&#039;s got the perfect plan: Abduct his former friend&#039;s fiancee and keep her past the wedding date. He never thought he&#039;d find his mate in the abducted, sassy-mouthed, curvy goddess. Lili&#039;s giving him a run for his money and he loves every second of it. Shit definitely hits the fan when he realizes he took the wrong woman, and she doesn&#039;t handle being lied to very well.

Cade&#039;s brother is working behind the scenes to take control of his pack. Someone&#039;s trying to hurt his mate and he still hasn&#039;t told Lili she&#039;s probably going to grow fur out of her ass. It&#039;s the final countdown and Cade needs to get Lili to forgive him while keeping her safe. Easier said than done. He&#039;s ready to give up his pack to keep his mate...and he might have to.

Narrated by Kit Swann&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lili&#039;s life had never been very exciting, so she hoped her cousin&#039;s wedding would provide some entertainment in her life. What she didn&#039;t expect was to almost kill a man on her way to the ceremony. She definitely didn&#039;t expect to get chased by naked men in middle of the forest. Oh, and she sure as hell didn&#039;t foresee a hot mountain of a man giving her the hottest sex of her life. But, hey, shit happens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cade Wynters wants revenge. He&#039;s got the perfect plan: Abduct his former friend&#039;s fiancee and keep her past the wedding date. He never thought he&#039;d find his mate in the abducted, sassy-mouthed, curvy goddess. Lili&#039;s giving him a run for his money and he loves every second of it. Shit definitely hits the fan when he realizes he took the wrong woman, and she doesn&#039;t handle being lied to very well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cade&#039;s brother is working behind the scenes to take control of his pack. Someone&#039;s trying to hurt his mate and he still hasn&#039;t told Lili she&#039;s probably going to grow fur out of her ass. It&#039;s the final countdown and Cade needs to get Lili to forgive him while keeping her safe. Easier said than done. He&#039;s ready to give up his pack to keep his mate...and he might have to.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is HIS MIMOSA by Jamie Schlosser! 

Narrated by Mackenzie Cartwright &amp; Matthew Maddux

Carter doesn’t believe in love at first sight or happily ever after. When he goes to Vegas for his brother’s bachelor party, the last thing he expects is Brynne, the beautiful cocktail waitress who nurses his hangover with a drink just as bubbly and sweet as she is. Brynne’s optimism and unfailing faith in love is a breath of fresh air, and it makes him think maybe he’s had it wrong all along. They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. And Carter’s heart? It might be taking up permanent residence there.

		<itunes:summary>Our audiobook this week is HIS MIMOSA by Jamie Schlosser! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Narrated by Mackenzie Cartwright &amp; Matthew Maddux&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carter doesn’t believe in love at first sight or happily ever after. When he goes to Vegas for his brother’s bachelor party, the last thing he expects is Brynne, the beautiful cocktail waitress who nurses his hangover with a drink just as bubbly and sweet as she is. Brynne’s optimism and unfailing faith in love is a breath of fresh air, and it makes him think maybe he’s had it wrong all along. They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. And Carter’s heart? It might be taking up permanent residence there.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is RIDE A RANCHER by bestselling author Elle Christiansen!  

Narrated by Kit Swan and Matthew Maddux

Sometimes the perfect person for you is the one you least expect it to be.

Stone Kensington is no stranger to hard work, and he knows what it takes to make a ranch a success. Determination and grit—something he figures a city girl like Helena Robinson will never have.

Helena left all the shallow and fake people in her life behind to start fresh. She’s not a softie playing rancher as Stone assumes, and it doesn’t take long for her to prove it to him…and so much more.

Stone quickly realizes Helena is not what he thought, and she belongs to him. The only problem is Helena doesn’t believe love and marriage are for her, even though she wants to be with Stone. He’ll have to convince her that he’s for real and what they have will last.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is TEXTIN’ UP MY HEART by Teagan Hunter!  

Narrated by Elizabeth Hart

I never thought I was the type of girl to give a hoot about marriage. I didn’t fantasize about my wedding as a little girl. I’ve always firmly been in the “If it happens, it happens” camp. Even after I met Zach and decided to move in with him, I still felt that way.

Until last month.

I want to get married. I want to purchase a home that’s completely ours, to draw up our wills and get serious about our future. Want to do all the husband-and-wife things.

As silly as it sounds, I want the piece of paper saying he’s mine forever.

I just have no idea how to tell him that.

		<title>Podcast Episode 50.2 &#8211; THE MAJOR&#8217;S WELCOME HOME by Tessa Bailey</title>

		<description>Our audiobook this week is THE MAJOR’S WELCOME HOME by New York Times Bestselling Author Tessa Bailey! 

Narrated by Lauren Sweet

When Kenna Sutton is tasked with driving home newly returned Beck “True Blue” Collier, she expects the strategic Army mastermind to be a pasty number cruncher. Never at a loss for words, Kenna is nonetheless rendered speechless by the gorgeous, hard-bodied and utterly inexperienced Army Major that lands in her passenger seat. Outraged by Beck’s lack of a welcome home after seven long years overseas, Kenna takes matters into her own hands, giving Beck something he’s only ever fantasized about in his bunk.

Beck has never shied away from a test of will and Kenna gives new meaning to the word challenge. One problem? Kenna’s father is the Lieutenant General presenting Beck with a Silver Star and Beck is determined to treat Kenna with the respect she deserves. Kenna has other ideas, however, tempting Beck’s resolve at every turn. But how long can one lonely, starving man hope to resist the woman he craves?

Narrated by Lauren Sweet&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Kenna Sutton is tasked with driving home newly returned Beck “True Blue” Collier, she expects the strategic Army mastermind to be a pasty number cruncher. Never at a loss for words, Kenna is nonetheless rendered speechless by the gorgeous, hard-bodied and utterly inexperienced Army Major that lands in her passenger seat. Outraged by Beck’s lack of a welcome home after seven long years overseas, Kenna takes matters into her own hands, giving Beck something he’s only ever fantasized about in his bunk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beck has never shied away from a test of will and Kenna gives new meaning to the word challenge. One problem? Kenna’s father is the Lieutenant General presenting Beck with a Silver Star and Beck is determined to treat Kenna with the respect she deserves. Kenna has other ideas, however, tempting Beck’s resolve at every turn. But how long can one lonely, starving man hope to resist the woman he craves?&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Our audiobook this week is WANTING MY STEPSISTER by New York Times Bestselling Author Alexa Riley! 

Narrated by Mackenzie Cartwright and Matthew Maddux

Libby Moore is trying to figure out what to do with her life. She has graduated high school, but there’s only one thing she’s ever truly wanted in life…the one thing she can’t have…her stepbrother, Jasper.

Jasper Lewis tried to get away from the one person he shouldn’t want. But moving only a couple of miles away was a pitiful effort, and he’s tired of resisting what he wants. He’s coming back to claim what’s been his since day one, no matter what the consequences.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SWEETER by Eve Dangerfield!

Narrated by Melissa Schwairy &amp; Alan Morrison

What’s better than romance? How about cold hard cash…
Marley Ellis doesn’t have time for love, she’s got an artistic empire to build and a sugar daddy to charm. At least she did, until a late night catfishing introduces her to insanely hot and very bored tech bro, Will.
Will’s been treading water, searching for something to believe in. He’s sure Marley’s the answer, but convincing her that he’s
a) not a douche
b) a daddy she can believe in is going to be a challenge. Luckily, he’s bringing his A-game because the good life is sweet, but love is sweeter.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is DEFINITELY KINKY by NYT Bestselling Author Annabel Joseph! 

Narrated by Ava Lucas

Andie’s known the guys in her string quartet forever. There’s Jonathan, the bossy lead violinist, and Steve, the cellist, who plays ref when they’re at each other’s throats. Then there’s Ethan, the viola player. After five years, he’s still a mystery: quiet, unassuming, and intensely dedicated to the music they create.

Who would’ve thought he’d be the one to step up and comfort her after a wedding reception gig goes haywire? Who would’ve thought they’d end up in each other’s arms?

And who would’ve thought he’d know how to tilt her world sideways using only his voice, his fingers, and fifteen feet of rope?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SHE’S THE ONE by Ella Goode!

Narrated by Lori Prince

Whenever her friends talk about the hot guys on campus, Mallory is bored. Not only does she not think that these particular guys are hot, she doesn&#039;t think men are attractive in general. Besides, she has more important things to do than chase after men such as gaining the friendship of Star. Star&#039;s a brilliant, intriguing, captivating girl whose very nearness makes Mallory&#039;s heartbeat a little faster. After spending time with Star, Mallory begins to realize that her feelings aren&#039;t very sisterly. Has she discovered something important far too late?

		<description>Our audiobook this week is I’M YOURS, BABY by Fiona Davenport! 

Narrated by Anastasia Watley &amp; Jason Carpenter

Guy Rule: Don’t knock a girl up and disappear for a year.

Weston Davis was a jaded CIA operative who didn’t believe in love at first sight—until the moment he laid eyes on Aspen Kennedy and knew she was meant to be his. With an undercover operation only days away, the timing was horrible. But he didn’t let it get in the way of spending an explosive weekend with her before he has to leave.

Aspen believed Weston when he told her he’d be back. Twelve months, a positive pregnancy test, and countless emails later, she’s given up hope on ever hearing from him again. She’s left alone to raise their baby, a treasured gift from the man who’d stolen her heart and smashed it to pieces.

When Weston comes storming back into her life, he has a new mission: claim his family, find the person who’d almost caused him to lose them, and make them pay.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is PLUMBING THE VIRGIN by USA Today Bestselling Author Tia Louise!  

Narrated by Beth Roeg &amp; Lance Greenfield

The first thing Liam Walsh sees when he moves to sleepy Oceanside Village is Donna White sucking on a dip cone. He’s a big guy, and she’s a petite young woman, but when their eyes meet, she almost drops her cone.

Donna White has been sheltered from everything from the minute her mother put her in home school for asking what the F-bomb meant. Everybody in town knows her mamma’s crazy. No boy has ever dared approach her until the sexy new stranger in town asks her name…

Will this sweet plumber successfully install his pipe in some virgin soil? Will an innocent virgin spread her thighs for his thick snake? You bet she will. Fall in love with this sweet story of true love and happily ever after.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SOMETHING ABOUT A HOT GUY by New York Times Bestselling Author A.L. Jackson!

Narrated by Meg Sylvan &amp; Tim Paige

Kyle Love is the bane of my existence.
Arrogant jerk.
Obscenely gorgeous.
Completely out of my league.

Did I mention he&#039;s my best friend&#039;s big brother?

Oh yeah, and I&#039;ve been in love with him my entire life.

Kenna Myer drives me insane.

Adorably shy.
Painfully awkward.
Ridiculously sexy.

And my sister has made it clear on multiple occasions that she&#039;s completely off-limits.
When I show at the apartment she shares with my sister for a surprise visit to find my sister away for the weekend, I know a should walk.

I don&#039;t.
It turns out my sweet Kenna has herself a secret...a blog called Something About a Hot Guy.

I&#039;m ninety-nine percent sure its top subject is me.

One thing I’m certain of? Things are about to get interesting...

		<description>Our audiobook this week is ROUGH SKETCH by USA Today Bestselling Author Kate Canterbary! 



Narrated by Christian Fox and Savannah Peachwood 



Smart, successful, and sitting pretty at the top of her game, Neera Malik has it all figured out. Save for the small issue of Gustavo Guillmand.



The artist with a cult—and Instagram—following has a problem and it&#039;s not his preference for shirtless selfies.



No, he has an attitude problem, a minding his own business problem, an infuriatingly sexy problem.



They can&#039;t stand each other and they can&#039;t stay away from each other.

		<description>Our audiobook this week is SMOLDER by USA Today Bestselling Author Aly Martinez! 



Narrated by Andi Arndt &amp; Romualdo Palacios 



Mateo Rodriguez was something of an anomaly. The majority of the world viewed him as a ruthless criminal with no respect for life or law. However, the man I knew was gentle and caring, catering to my every desire.



He would have been the perfect man, if only he would have left his life of crime behind and



chosen me.



So there we were—for five years—in love and at a stalemate.



When three armed men dragged me out of my bed in the middle of the night, I realized just how right I’d been to fear his lifestyle.



Or, maybe I’d been wrong. Because Mateo was the only man powerful enough to save me.

		<description>Our audiobook this week
is TEMPT THE EX by Natasha Madison! 



Narrated by Caitlin Elizabeth &amp; James
Larceny



Dani



I dumped the man I
thought I would marry because my roommate told me these are the years to be
wild and free. 



College isn’t for getting serious, it’s for letting loose. 



Except it’s not all
it’s cracked up to be and I’m miserable. 



John



I was on top of the
world.



In college at the
top of my game, living with my two best friends and I had the love of my life
by my side. 



It felt like I had
it all. 



Then she dumped me
out of the blue. 



With nothing else
to lose I listened to my roommates and set out a plan to tempt the ex.

		<description>Our audiobook this week
is TEMPT THE EX by Natasha Madison! 



Narrated by Caitlin Elizabeth &amp; James
Larceny



Dani



I dumped the man I
thought I would marry because my roommate told me these are the years to be
wild and free. 



College isn’t for getting serious, it’s for letting loose. 



Except it’s not all
it’s cracked up to be and I’m miserable. 



John



I was on top of the
world.



In college at the
top of my game, living with my two best friends and I had the love of my life
by my side. 



It felt like I had
it all. 



Then she dumped me
out of the blue. 



With nothing else
to lose I listened to my roommates and set out a plan to tempt the ex.

		<description>Our audiobook this week
is WHEN SHE’S READY by Ruby Dixon! 



Narrated by Victoria Mei &amp; Cary Hite



To
get amnesty on a remote farm planet, ex-con Tassar has to marry an alien –
specifically, a strange looking creature called a ‘human’. When he sees
gorgeous, delicate Leilani, though, all of his plans change. He wants more than
just a marriage of convenience. He wants her forever, but only when she’s ready.

Bestselling Author Tessa Bailey! 



Narrated by Stephanie Rose &amp; CJ
Mission



When
Hope scores front row tickets to see her favorite band, she never expects the
lead singer, Johnny Scott, to stop singing halfway through his first song and
ask for her name. And she definitely never expects him to request her presence
backstage after the show. 



Johnny
has forgotten why he loves music. Thankfully the rock gods have sent him a
beautiful muse who breathes new life into his world with one word, one touch.
He’s never met anyone like Hope and he’s not letting her go. 



But
when Johnny wakes up alone after the best night of his life, he has no idea how
to find a missing Hope. Did he dream her? His heart refuses to believe it and
he’ll tear the town apart to prove she—and their love—is real.

		<description>Our audiobook this week
is THE MIDNIGHT BRIDE by Kati Wilde! 



Narrated by Cassandra Myles &amp; Brandon
Utah



To
save her family from a tyrant king, Mara of Aremond must win a tournament—and
she won’t let anyone stop her from claiming the prize. Especially not Strax,
the barbarian warrior who has tormented her every step of the way. But when a
sorcerer’s trap binds them together, Mara must decide whether Strax is her
greatest enemy, or if everything she seeks can only be found in the barbarian’s
arms… 

Don’t miss Pretty Bride, featuring Aruk’s story!
