      <title>Live Show - Hiring, Firing, and Scaling: Creating a Workplace Culture</title>
      <description>A big part of building a business is hiring and then creating a workplace culture where your team members want to stay and grow with you.
Maybe you're a business of one, and you're thinking about making your first few hires. Or maybe you’re a team of 20 trying to double your staff to meet new demand. Whatever your situation, how you hire can impact who you hire and who you hire can impact your company culture in a big way.
In this episode of Open for Business recorded before a live audience in Austin:  How to create a company where people want to work and then scale that culture as your company grows.

      <title>#12 Who You Are, Not What You Sell</title>
      <description>Every company knows what they sell. What’s harder to define sometimes is why? What motivates you beyond...money?  A great mission captures that reason behind why your business exists today. But it also leaves room for your company to aspire for more in the future. It can guide every single decision you make - whether you’re a business of one or one-thousand. In this episode we hear two very different businesses who have figured out how to present their company to the world and one that’s just starting out.
