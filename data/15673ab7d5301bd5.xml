Don&apos;t forget to send in your questions to&amp;nbsp;@ThePodPMI on Instagram and Twitter. We appreciate you&apos;se guys for listening. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

The guys also chat more about the Coronavirus and try to decide whether or not they are in harm’s way and try to figure out what Coronavirus porn is. The boys also discuss the students at Princeton whining that Marshawn Lynch will speak at their graduation which spills into a conversation about how the TikTok generation is the worst. The guys also pay homage to the victims of the Boston Massacre, chat about Foxy, Zito, and Connor looking for a new place to live, give a few picks for Check It Aht, and they receive a call from a special guest.

			<title><![CDATA[Ep 129 - Dancing With The Devil]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an incredible interview with retired DEA agent Louis “Lou” Diaz. Lou spent 22 of his 28 years in the DEA working undercover. In that time he was largely responsible for the arrest and conviction of Nicky Barnes who was an African-American crime boss that controlled the heroin trade in the 1970’s. Nicky Barnes was portrayed by Cuba Gooding Jr. in the movie <em>American Gangster</em>. Lou sets the story straight about that movie and it’s portrayal of Nicky Barnes and Frank Lucas. He also, talks about other investigations he worked and about life growing up in a neighborhood that left him two career options...become a gangster or a cop.</p>
<p>Lou Diaz is also the author of <em>Dancing with the Devil: Confessions of an Undercover Agent</em>, which is available on Amazon.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ep 121 - The Voice Of Culpable]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In today’s episode, Todd takes a deep dive into Season 1 of the hit, true-crime podcast Culpable with the host of Culpable, Dennis Cooper. Season 1 tells the story of the suspicious death of Christian Andreacchio of Meridian, MS, the controversial death investigation that was ruled a suicide and Christian’s mother’s uphill battle to get the case re-opened and investigated as a homicide.</p>
<p>As you’ll learn in this episode, Dennis, who is also the founder of Black Mountain Media, and his team not only do a brilliant job of telling this compelling story but they also, with the help of a team of private investigators, cast even more doubt on the integrity of the police investigation and the coroner’s ruling. It’s a story we felt compelled to share and we’re grateful to Dennis for coming on the show to do so.</p>
<p>You can listen to Culpable anywhere you listen to podcasts. You can follow them at @culpablepodcast on Twitter and Instagram and you can visit their website at <a href="http://culpablepodcast.com/" target="_blank">culpablepodcast.com</a>.</p>
<p>Black Mountain Media is offering a $100,000 reward to anyone who provides information that helps solve this case. You can submit a tip by emailing them at <a href="mailto:tips@blackmountainmedia.net" target="_blank">tips@blackmountainmedia.net</a> or leave a message at (470) 300-4915.</p>
<p>We take care of each other. It’s what we do.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with retired DEA agents Steve Murphy &amp; Javier Pena. Murphy &amp; Pena are the agents who brought down Pablo Escobar. Their story inspired the hit Netflix series Narcos. As you'll hear in this interview, there are some differences between what really happened and what was portrayed in the series. This is one of our favorite interviews thus far so we hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn more about the investigation that ended the reign of Pablo Escobar you can get Steve and Javier's new book Manhunters: How We Took Down Pablo Escobar at <a href="http://www.deanarcos.com/" target="_blank">www.deanarcos.com</a>.

			<title><![CDATA[Ep 109 - Our Friend Gary Gulman]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Gary had a weekly segment on Heartland Radio for quite some time where he’d test new material out on us and the listeners but we’ve never really had the chance to interview him in depth. So, after the release of his new comedy special “The Great Depresh” released on HBO this past weekend Gary was nice enough to give us the opportunity. (7:35 - 44:13)</p>
<p>This is a 40 minute interview that dives deep. It dives deep into Gary’s life-long struggle with depression. It dives deep into how he almost lost that struggle. It dives deep into how he was able to not only get healthy enough to leave in-patient treatment, but how he got healthy enough to resume his standup career and build a special that tells the story of his victory over this horrible&nbsp;disease. Oh, and Judd Apatow produced it. No big deal.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Our friend and most requested guest to have back on the show, Dan Cummins was our guest for this episode. The greatest thing about Dan is he just loves shooting the shit and letting it rip and that's what this podcast is all about. If you're not familiar with Dan Cummins, he's an incredibly talented standup comedian who's appeared on Comedy Central, Conan, The Tonight Show and The Late Late Show. He's best known for his hit podcast "Timesuck" where Dan dives deep into serial killers, cults, conspiracies, history, and the paranormal in a way that's both educational and hysterical. He also just launched a new podcast called "Scared to Death" where Dan terrifies his wife with alleged-to-be-true horror stories about Demonic possession, poltergeists, shadow people and more. See why we love him?</p>

It&apos;s not The Pat McAfee Studio but it is the new Heartland Radio studio and we dig it. Today the boys talked about their favorite bite-size oven snacks, their favorite bands from high school and detail plans for the future as far as this podcast is concerned.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, standup comedy legend, Margaret Cho, joins the crew live in studio for 30 minutes of pure hilarity. She gives her thoughts on Robert Kraft, what it was like working with Will Smith on "Bright," her thoughts on Nicolas Cage from their time on set together while filming "Face/Off," and gives a little sneak peek of her set (3:27-35:28). The guys also cover the potential Cartel tunnel system from LA to Mexico, Gorms tells a few stories about his time working at the popular nightclub, Tatou, in Los Angeles, dive into what they think the witness protection system is like for famous people, and Pat gives a documentary recommendation as the guys discuss "Operation Odessa," dealing with a man trying to sell a Cold War era Soviet submarine to the Cartel in order to smuggle drugs into the United States. The guys also discuss their preference on binging TV shows as opposed to watching them every week, and they look ahead to the final two Game of Thrones episodes. As always, the guys close out the show with another edition of Friday Bangerz to help propel you into the weekend. It's a fun one, come and have a good time with us.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, the guys hold the first ever penitentiary pen pal draft. The rules are simple; each participant selects two people currently in prison to write letters to and the first person who successfully receives two correspondences wins, and some of the picks will definitely surprise you. The guys also cover Jock Jams and uncover the truth about Gary Glitter, waiting until the last minute to plan Pat's charity golf outing (which is tomorrow), talk about the release of today's new OCW (Mexican Celebration), talk about the white kid who smashed the amateur 100m dash record, which snowballs into a conversation about Oscar Pistorius, try to decide what is the appropriate amount of time before people can start discussing spoilers from Avengers: End Game without having to worry about someone knocking your teeth out, and Gorms checks in on an Italian man from Pennsylvania who had a rough time accepting a break up. Today's a fun one, come and have a good time with us.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ep. 55 - Trampoline Dreams]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, the guys discuss The Hardy Boys coming to the office and buying a trampoline for the occasion. They cover the death defying stunts they did off ladders onto the trampoline, Jeff Hardy teaching everyone how to paint their faces, and the setup process that it required. Pat also discusses a couple of his previous houses and the different things that forced him to move to different locations. They also chat about what age you become an adult, what the guys would keep in their purses if it were socially acceptable for men to carry them around, they chat about the NCAA tournament and the PMI bracket challenge on ESPN (#McAfeeForMNF), a man going into a Subway and acting like he worked for another store in order to make himself a sandwich and shorten the cash register and Gorms wonders if he could pull the same stunt. They also dive into whether or not you can get in hot water for flipping off a cop after receiving a ticket, at what age do you become an adult, and debate who the best tag team partner in the office would be. It’s a fun episode, come and have a good time with us.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ep. 52 - #LetGumpWork]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, the guys dive into the dilemma of trying to get Gump into this country legally with a working visa or green card. He and Todd break down their tussle with ICE as they went for a sit down with an immigration lawyer to see what the odds are that Gump gets to stay in the country in what is a much more complicated situation than anyone realized. The guys also chat about whether or not it's possible to separate any of Michael Jackson's music from his deplorable actions or if we are deep in #MuteMike season, give their best wishes to Alex Trebec as he prepares for a battle with pancreatic cancer, debate the hypothetical sports teams that @ZitoThoughts set up for the office, discuss how much better Nickelodeon's programming was when shows like Double Dare and Legends of the Hidden Temple were on TV, and chat a little bit about the World's Strongest Man competition and who some of their favorite strongmen were to watch, plus a lot more. As is tradition, each of the guys picks a song for Friday Bangerz to help send you into the weekend in fabulous fashion. This one goes off the rails a little bit, but it's a great time. Come and have a good time with us.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, the guys touch on several different things including the news that Jason Witten decided to abruptly leave the Monday Night Football booth and go back to the Cowboys to play, so the guys do a deep dive into the likelihood and chance that Pat becomes the 3rd man in the booth for Monday Night Football, and discuss some of the other guys they wouldn’t mind seeing in the booth if Pat doesn’t get the opportunity. They also cover robots delivering FedEx packages, Bryce Harper signing a 13-year $330 million contract with the Phillies that doesn’t include an opt out clause, Jimmy Kimmel addressing Lady Gaga about her sexual tension/love/chemistry with Bradley Cooper, a new group of robbers in England who have been knocking off parking meters, whether or not Ray Liotta needs to quit the Chantix ahead of his role in the new Sopranos prequel, some of the other TV shows the guys are excited for to return, a Nesquik chocolate milk shortage that has been ravaging Indianapolis, a potential bill being passed in Utah that would allow drivers to run red lights after 10 seconds if no one else is around, and what sickness that keeps you home from work is the most desirable. As always, the guys throw together a couple of tunes for Friday Bangerz to help launch you into this weekend. It’s a fun one. Come and have a good time with us.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, while Pat and Foxy take care of some business in Orlando, the guys play around with a different format, as they just shoot the breeze. They cover a range of topics including the difference between watching movies while streaming and on TV, the lingering after effects of the Choco Challenge, some dweeb starting a KickStarter to get the rat removed from the end of The Departed, Syracuse basketball coach, Jim Boeheim killing a guy, Casey Anthony potentially taking her talents to Hustler, what has happened to rap music over the course of the last 15 years, and some of the different experiments that the military has spent money on including skateboarding marines, bomb collared bats, "gay bombs," and more. They also give an important PSA regarding the St. Paddy's Day sale going on right now at store.PatMcAfeeShow.com where everything St. Patrick's Day related is 20% off until midnight on Saturday (2/23). As always, to close out the show, the guys each pick a few Friday Bangerz to help send you into the weekend. It's a good time, come and enjoy it with us.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, the guys open it up and bounce around from conversation to conversation. They cover dogs, cats, and horses, and some of their individual pets, work through a Last Survivor type contingency plan for who would take over Pat McAfee Inc. if something were to happen to Pat, and discuss whether or not they want kids in the future and how many. Todd wants to know what the names of the horses would be for everyone in the office, which spawns a conversation about whether or not they should get into the owning horses game. They also answer some listener questions including what movie they would choose to be on set for, and the guys get into a long conversation when discussing which three TV shows they would like to bring back. To close out the show, the guys each give out some vitamin thoughts.</p>
