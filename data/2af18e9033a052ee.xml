    <language>en</language>
    <copyright>Camo Camille and Studio71</copyright>
    <description>Millions of eyes watching, the pressure, the need to be engaging, funny, and relatable. Some days it’s living your best life, some days it feels like a crushing burden. 
Camo exposes the reality of social media and the mental health struggles that come along with “being on.” Challenging conventional thinking and the status quo, candidly opening up about their life experiences/trials they’ve faced, shamelessly. 
Camo is a content creator, singer/songwriter and the host of ‘Unfazed &amp; Unbothered,’ the podcast where they rant, rave and ramble about any and everything from social media, mental health, sex, drugs and self discovery. Join Camo every Thursday for unscripted, no filter realness as she sips and spills on the latest!

Tasia talks about the time she met a random stranger in a Walmart parking lot, him freaking out and choking her for no reason, and the cops arriving only to arrest her. Plus, Tasia gives a part 2 to last week's story which involves her cousin trying to blackmail her by sending Tasia's OnlyFans pictures to her dad.

      <title>Drugs, Guns, &amp; Drama: Traumatic Stories from Our Past pt. 1</title>
      <description>Tasia and Camo are back with more stories where they had brushes with death and others that are just plain embarrassing. Tasia talks about her days of doing drugs with the wrong people, ending up having to call her mom to bail her out of a meth den and a creepy old man rubbing up on her, as well as a multi-day bender that she barely remembers. Plus, Tasia discusses getting to a point of doing drugs to the point of not caring if she lives or dies. Camo talks about the time he possibly met a serial killer through Grindr while on a family vacation and how a simple DoorDash delivery ended up with a few guys threatening to shoot him dead. But even with all these traumatic experiences, they talk about how their past doesn't define them and neither should your past define you.

      <title>Catching You Up on the Past and the Future</title>
      <description>It might've just been a week for you, but it's been a minute since Tasia and Camo have sat down and recorded. On this week's episode, Tasia and Camo catch you (and each other) up on everything that's been going on in their lives. From how they spent their holidays, the movies they've seen (shoutout to Lady Gaga in "House of Gucci") and so much more. Tasia details how she will be getting her license soon, but all of the required upgrades for her car might make it not worth getting back on the road. Camo explains how he's been working on his self-control when it comes to weed and food, as well as hitting the gym to prep that 2022 bod. Plus, they both set some goals for next year and how they'll be back and better when New Year's comes around.

      <itunes:summary>It might've just been a week for you, but it's been a minute since Tasia and Camo have sat down and recorded. On this week's episode, Tasia and Camo catch you (and each other) up on everything that's been going on in their lives. From how they spent their holidays, the movies they've seen (shoutout to Lady Gaga in "House of Gucci") and so much more. Tasia details how she will be getting her license soon, but all of the required upgrades for her car might make it not worth getting back on the road. Camo explains how he's been working on his self-control when it comes to weed and food, as well as hitting the gym to prep that 2022 bod. Plus, they both set some goals for next year and how they'll be back and better when New Year's comes around.

      <title>Instagram vs. What Goes on Behind the Scenes</title>
      <description>Everything might look cute and gorgeous on IG, TikTok and YouTube, but there's a lot of work and lot more going on behind the scenes that you might not know about. This week, Tasia and Camo pull back the curtain on posting content on various social media platforms and how the constant pressure can really get to you. They also call people out for posting only to get attention and as a misguided form of therapy. Plus, Camo talks about how jealous she is of Tasia for having a baby.

      <title>How the Past Has Affected Our Present</title>
      <description>This week, we take a look at Tasia and Camo's past and how this has influenced where they are in their lives now. Tasia and Camo discuss how having a criminal record made it difficult to find a job, but how it eventually led them to social media. On the flip side, they touch on how haters who can't let go of the past don't deserve a spot in their current life.

      <itunes:summary>This week, we take a look at Tasia and Camo's past and how this has influenced where they are in their lives now. Tasia and Camo discuss how having a criminal record made it difficult to find a job, but how it eventually led them to social media. On the flip side, they touch on how haters who can't let go of the past don't deserve a spot in their current life.

      <title>Leaving Toxic Relationships &amp; Keeping Healthy Relationships</title>
      <description>This week, Tasia and Camo discuss some of the toxic relationships in their lives (cheating, backstabbing, etc.), how they finally recognized it, and how they ultimately cut those people out of their lives. On the other side, they give advice as to not be a toxic friend/partner and the work it takes to maintain healthy relationships, both platonic and romantic. They also talk about how some people can't let go of the past even when you're trying to improve yourself, and how that can be triggering and bring negative energy into your life.
Plus, Camo talks about past heartbreaks and Tasia explains how past bad relationships has made her appreciate her marriage.

      <title>Overcoming Health Issues, Eating Disorders and Body Dysmorphia</title>
      <description>This week, Tasia and Camo discuss their journey with issues with eating disorders, especially when living your life in front of the camera, and also how it's more of a mental struggle than a physical one.
Camo discusses their years of health related trauma battling a one in a million blood disease PNH, paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, chemo/radiation and life after the bone marrow transplant that saved their life.
Plus, Tasia addresses some negative comments from last week's episode and reminds you to be kind to others, because we never know what someone is going through.

      <title>How We Confronted Some Serious Issues</title>
      <description>People can be nasty online and even IRL. This week, Tasia and Camo discuss their low points and how they eventually overcame it. Tasia spills the tea on her drug addiction stemming from serious self-esteem issues, how people would put her business on blast after obtaining Vine fame, and the background on her criminal charges beyond what you can Google.
Camo talks about how they used to steal (sometimes with mom) and party, which ultimately led to getting arrested and some less-than-fun-times. Plus, they both talk about how maybe internet culture is getting nicer and encourage all of you to make better decisions.

      <title>From Childhood Traumas to Social Media Fame</title>
      <description>Before we look forward, we must look towards the past. This week, Tasia and Camo run through their troubled upbringings, all the run-ins with the law (and guns), and family issues. Tasia breaks down how she dropped out of high school, landed a few drug charges and got stuck in a really toxic relationship. Camo talks about some terrifying encounters with firearms, a family that didn’t understand them, and admits to a sexual assault at a very young age.
But it's not all bad news, they also talk about how they've learned from their past and how they built themselves up to the superstars they are today.

      <title>How We Met &amp; Where We're Going - Premiere Episode</title>
      <description>You may know Tasia Alexis and Camo from Vine, IG and TikTok, but you may not know the people behind the music and funny videos. In this first episode, Tasia and Camo get into a self-therapy session by telling their backstories and catching you up to where they are today. Tasia discusses getting out of rehab and going to prison, her pregnancies and getting bullied in high school. Camo talks about growing with a serious illness, doing some petty theft, and her crippling anxiety.
They also tell the story of meeting being servers at the Top Dog restaurant, which Camo is now banned from, and being drunk at work during almost every shift (don't worry, the statute of limitations has passed on this one). Plus, Camo and Tasia answer some seriously deep fan questions ranging from their thoughts on religion, what they dislike about each other, and finding peace. So if you want to hear more insane stories and tracking their growth, keep tuning in to Unfazed and Unbothered. Period muffins.
