		<description>
		&lt;p&gt;Everything is on the line next week. From Congress to down-ballot races and a record-breaking number of abortion measures on the ballot, we have an unprecedented opportunity to send a clear message to out-of-step politicians that we won’t let them take away our right to abortion. Given the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn &lt;i&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/i&gt;, a federal right we have relied on for 50 years, we must send a clear message by voting for candidates and on measures that reflect our values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an historic year for abortion measures on the ballot. In August, Kansas voters resoundingly defeated a ballot measure that would have paved the way for extreme politicians to ban abortion in the state. More abortion measures are on the ballot next week in several states, including in Michigan and Kentucky where measures would significantly alter state constitutional protections for abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need everyone who believes in the right to abortion and reproductive freedom more broadly to make a plan to vote, ensure your friends and family understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/vote-your-values&quot;&gt;what’s at stake&lt;/a&gt; in the upcoming election, and even if you have just one hour to spare, &lt;strong&gt;lend your time to critical campaigns&lt;/strong&gt; to encourage people to vote their values in the final days of the election. In particular, you can sign up to volunteer on our friends’ Mobilize pages, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobilize.us/mireprofreedom/&quot;&gt;Reproductive Freedom for All in Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/477383/&quot;&gt;Protect Kentucky Access&lt;/a&gt;, to make a difference in the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Given the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn &lt;i&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/i&gt;, a federal right we have relied on for 50 years, we must send a clear message by voting for candidates and on measures that reflect our values.&lt;/p&gt;
      
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

					&lt;h2 id=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-heading-h2 with-mark&quot;&gt;Yes on Michigan Proposal 3&lt;/h2&gt;
		
			&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t be more enthusiastic about Proposal 3 in Michigan, spearheaded by the Reproductive Freedom for All campaign. This first-of-its-kind, citizen-led ballot measure would cement the right to reproductive freedom in the state constitution. It has seen overwhelming support in Michigan, from the historic number of signatures submitted to qualify for the ballot to the outpouring of volunteers and grassroots contributions. And the stakes couldn’t be higher for Michiganders, with a 1931 abortion ban threatening to eliminate care entirely in the state and put doctors in jail for serving their patients. The Michigan measure, championed by Reproductive Freedom for All, would not only secure the right to abortion in the state and block the arcane 1931 abortion ban, it would also ensure protections for birth control and for safe and respectful care during childbirth and protect people from punishment for having a miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the impact won’t stop there. Folks from all over the country are supporting this campaign because if we win, we will have a tested path to securing our fundamental right to reproductive freedom in more states with gerrymandered legislatures. In other words, we believe that when we appeal directly to voters, the majority of whom &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/support-for-legalized-abortion-grows-since-dobbs-ruling-wsj-poll-shows-11662210020&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; the right to abortion and abortion access, we can win and protect access in states where citizens have the ability to pass ballot measures. That’s why at the ACLU, we have donated nearly $5 million to this campaign and involved our whole organization in supporting the Reproductive Freedom for All ballot committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, opponents in Michigan have used every trick in the book to confuse voters and spread misinformation about Proposal 3, even using trans youth as pawns in their cruel crusade to ban abortion. This race may come down to just a few votes, a testament to the extraordinary momentum this campaign has built despite anti-abortion deception and a stark reminder that we must all do everything we can to push it across the finish line.

					&lt;h2 id=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-heading-h2 with-mark&quot;&gt;No on Kentucky Amendment 2&lt;/h2&gt;
		
			&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kentucky, voters face an anti-abortion ballot measure that is similar to the one Kansans rejected in August. This measure would make it impossible for state courts to strike down a total abortion ban on the books that has pushed care out of reach in the commonwealth for months, forcing countless Kentuckians to carry pregnancies against their will and suffer the life-altering, and life-threatening for some, consequences of forced pregnancy and childbirth. The impacts have been devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: The politicians who put this measure on the ballot don’t just want to assert that there is no constitutional right to abortion in the state, they want to keep abortion banned entirely. The ACLU has filed a challenge against two abortion bans in the state, and we’ll be arguing before the state supreme court exactly one week after Election Day. This is a one-two punch: we must defeat this anti-abortion amendment so that we can then win in court and restore access to abortion care in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we can shut down this amendment just like we did in Kansas, but it will take all of us banding together to get the job done. Sign up to volunteer with Protect Kentucky Access on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/477383/&quot;&gt;Mobilize page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person has a role to play in this election to ensure our laws and the people elected to represent us reflect the overwhelming majority of people who want to protect the right to abortion. Whether you talk to your friends and family about the election using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/vote-your-values&quot;&gt;conversation guides&lt;/a&gt; like the one we developed in the lead up to the election or are able to volunteer with the campaigns directly, we need your energy and activism in this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to show up with everything we have and fight for our rights — too much is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The midterm elections are just a few days away, and it’s more important than ever to make your voice heard by casting your ballot. Our votes on Nov. 8 will determine who represents us at the local, state, and federal levels, impacting everything from racial justice, to LGBTQ rights, to reproductive rights. Lawmakers around the country are also pushing various &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/block-the-vote-voter-suppression-in-2020&quot;&gt;voter suppression efforts&lt;/a&gt; that make it harder for individuals to exercise their constitutional right to vote, so it’s critical to have a voting strategy in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACLU wants to provide voters with as much information as possible ahead of the midterms. Below, you can learn more about the issues and offices that will be in play this election cycle. Take the quiz to make sure you’re as equipped as possible before casting your ballot!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Are Gun Detectors the Answer to Mass Shootings?</title>

		<description>
		&lt;p&gt;A number of companies have responded to recent horrific mass shootings by touting technology that can ostensibly detect people with guns. Two companies in particular have attracted a lot of press attention for their products: one that makes AI-enhanced metal detectors, and another that sells video analytics software that “watches” surveillance camera feeds and sounds an alarm when the machine vision thinks it sees a person holding a gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such technologies can have their place, we need to think carefully as a society about if, how, and where we want to deploy them. And at the end of the day, surveillance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/student-surveillance-versus-gun-control-school&quot;&gt;cannot be the answer&lt;/a&gt; to our gun problem.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;wp-heading mb-md&quot;&gt;
		
					&lt;h2 id=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-heading-h2 with-standard&quot;&gt;Enhanced metal detectors&lt;/h2&gt;
		
			&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One product, made by a company called Evolv, is a metal detector enhanced with machine learning, which the company claims increases accuracy. Metal detectors and other body scanners are already deployed in various venues in the United States, and in our view, many of these deployments are unjustified and harmful. Still, where scanners nonetheless exist, making them more accurate and less intrusive is a good thing, all other things being equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, all other things are not equal. Evolv is pushing for a sharp expansion of metal detectors in American life, not simply an upgrade of existing deployments. The company, which has &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipvm.com/reports/evolv-public&quot;&gt;raised&lt;/a&gt; half a billion dollars in funding, claims that it currently scans over three quarters of a million people each day, and has &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipvm.com/reports/evolv-objects&quot;&gt;ambitions&lt;/a&gt; to install thousands of new detectors around the U.S. and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving current scanners is one thing, but expanding the number of scanning checkpoints is another matter. We don’t want to see America turned into a big airport — a checkpoint society where we have to undergo searches at every gathering, including little league games and up from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And metal detectors don’t operate themselves. Wherever a search checkpoint is set up, there are going to be guards. They may bark orders at you, demand you open your bags, remove your jacket, etc. However common such scans may already be, we should never lose sight of the fact that they are a significant invasion of privacy. You may have private things on your person, such as medical equipment, that are nobody’s business but yours. Guards may also engage in racial profiling, or simply gruff and rude behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the worst place for these checkpoints to spread further is in our schools, which companies view as a large market. School metal detectors are in keeping with a broken approach to student well-being — the same approach that has led to the U.S. having &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/030419-acluschooldisciplinereport.pdf&quot;&gt;more police officers than social workers&lt;/a&gt; in our schools. Metal detectors are expensive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d3dw5/the-least-safe-day-rollout-of-gun-detecting-ai-scanners-in-schools-has-been-a-cluster-emails-show&quot;&gt;disruptive&lt;/a&gt;, alienating, come hand-in-hand with aggressive police tactics, and have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/09/when-school-feels-like-prison/499556/&quot;&gt;racially disparate impact&lt;/a&gt; on students of color. Like other surveillance methods, they are not good for kids. And ample research suggests that metal detectors don’t improve school safety; even the U.S. Secret Service has &lt;a href=&quot;http://powerreporting.com/files/shoot.pdf&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that the devices are unlikely to stop school shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of metal detectors is dubious outside schools as well, and for the same reasons. As Motherboard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d3dw5/the-least-safe-day-rollout-of-gun-detecting-ai-scanners-in-schools-has-been-a-cluster-emails-show&quot;&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;, “Security experts broadly believe body scanners and metal detectors do not prevent mass shootings.” Although the independent security analysis publication IPVM found that Evolv is better than traditional (and far cheaper) metal detectors at not alarming at keys and cellphones, Evolv’s overall accuracy claims have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipvm.com/reports/evolv-no-stop&quot;&gt;sharply&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipvm.com/reports/evolv-objects&quot;&gt;questioned&lt;/a&gt; by IPVM. In particular, an investigation by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipvm.com/reports/bbc-evolv&quot;&gt;IPVM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63476769&quot;&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt; found that the company had worked with an “independent” testing lab to exaggerate the performance of their scanners, which was actually worse than regular metal detectors in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;wp-heading mb-md&quot;&gt;
		
					&lt;h2 id=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-heading-h2 with-standard&quot;&gt;ZeroEyes video gun detection&lt;/h2&gt;
		
			&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company called ZeroEyes is marketing video analytics techniques that can purportedly identify when someone is holding a firearm in a surveillance camera feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many contexts, there is no reason that anybody should ever be holding a firearm, and it is usually legitimate for security staff to be alarmed at the sight of someone brandishing a gun in a public place. (In many states, it may be legal to have a holstered firearm, either in concealed or open carry, but holding a gun in one’s hands in public is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uslawshield.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-brandishing/&quot;&gt;typically illegal&lt;/a&gt; under state brandishing and assault laws.) So at first blush, many people may see no issues with a system that alarms only when that happens. There are several issues that I see with this concept, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this concept incentivizes the installation of surveillance cameras everywhere. And because gun detection analytics acts as an add-on to existing cameras, it’s not as if the cameras involved will only be used to look for guns. They can simultaneously be used for the full range of surveillance uses, including face recognition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/a-scary-demonstration-of-what-unchecked-face-recognition-could-look-like&quot;&gt;forensic search&lt;/a&gt;, and even marketing and “business intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, like all alarm systems, and especially AI systems, there will be false positives — potentially a lot of them. Blanketing public spaces with buggy gun detectors may increase the incidence of tragic confrontations sparked by people holding &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=police+shoot+man+holding+cell+phone&amp;amp;t=ha&amp;amp;va=j&amp;amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;cell phones&lt;/a&gt;, toy guns, or other everyday objects that police have mistaken for firearms. ZeroEyes has humans in the loop that review camera images before alarms are sent, which is helpful — but that’s no guarantee against errors. And if this concept is successful, we’re likely to see this company or competitors discard the expensive and complicated element of human review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, as with Evolv’s gun detectors, there are also questions about effectiveness. The system is premised on a gun being visible for some significant period of time before any shooting starts. How often does that happen? In addition, if this technology becomes widespread, future shooters will simply keep their gun(s) hidden from the AI (which might be easier than hiding it from a human) until the last moment. As the industry analysts at IPVM &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipvm.com/reports/zeroeyes-presents&quot;&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;, video analytics “cannot stop [violent] events and will not add significant advance warning time to an event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, it&amp;#8217;s also important to understand a larger context here: Video gun detection is part of a larger trend of using machine vision as a cheap replacement for humans in enforcement and monitoring work. We’re already starting to see AI-enhanced cameras being deployed to monitor driving behavior and cell phone use, for example, and (as we explored in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/061819-robot_surveillance.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;) that’s likely just the tip of the coming iceberg that could lead to intrusive and oppressive levels of monitoring throughout our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, both ZeroEyes and Evolv raise questions about transparency. It’s hard for policymakers and the public to make decisions about technologies if they don’t have accurate and complete information about their false negative and false positive rates. Evolv has actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipvm.com/reports/evolv-objects&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to let IPVM buy a scanner for independent accuracy testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, ubiquitous surveillance is not the solution to gun violence. Americans should say no to intrusive technologies that threaten privacy, bring dubious benefits, and have negative side effects such as racial profiling and disrupting education.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;After over a hundred years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unc.edu/story/black-history-month/#:~:text=When%20they%20set%20foot%20on,they%20were%20just%20the%20start.&quot;&gt;total&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/9/11/welcome-black-harvard/#:~:text=Harvard%20College%20admitted%20its%20first,the%201847%2D48%20school%20year.&quot;&gt;near total&lt;/a&gt; exclusion of Black students and other students of color, the University of North Carolina and Harvard began admitting larger numbers of students, including students of color, in the 1960s and 70s. For decades, Harvard, UNC, and other universities have had the ability to consider a student’s race along with a wide range of other factors — academic merit, athletics, extra curriculars, and others — when it comes to deciding whether to admit a student. But now, the Supreme Court could change all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear two cases concerning affirmative action today. If the court strikes down affirmative action — also known as race-conscious admissions policies — it would make it unconstitutional for universities across the country to consider a student’s race as one factor in a holistic admissions review process. The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Massachusetts, and ACLU of North Carolina filed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/students-fair-admissions-v-president-and-fellows-harvard-and-students-fair-admissions&quot;&gt;amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; urging the Supreme Court to uphold universities’ ability to consider race in college admissions earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If the court strikes down affirmative action — also known as race-conscious admissions policies — it would make it unconstitutional for universities across the country to consider a student’s race as one factor in a holistic admissions review process.&lt;/p&gt;
      
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, we answer some of the key questions that you need to know about how race conscious admissions policies work, how students and universities benefit from them, and what’s at stake at the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What is affirmative action, or race conscious admissions policies? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;Race conscious policies, such as affirmative action, aim to address racial discrimination by recognizing and responding to the structural barriers that have denied underrepresented students access to higher education. Race-conscious admissions practices allow universities to consider a student’s race as one factor in the admissions process in order to help create a diverse student body that enriches the educational experiences of all students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What cases are before the Supreme Court concerning race conscious admissions policies?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;There are two cases in which the Supreme Court will consider whether to uphold universities’ ability to consider race in college admissions: &lt;i&gt;Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard, &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina. &lt;/i&gt;In both cases, the organization Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), led by anti-affirmative action crusader Edward Blum, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-981_4g15.pdf&quot;&gt;once again&lt;/a&gt;, after previous failed efforts, seeking the elimination of all race-conscious admissions practices. Twice already, the Supreme Court has rejected Blum’s arguments and ruled that universities can consider race in admissions to promote diversity on campus and enrich students’ learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What legal rights do universities and colleges have to consider race in the admissions process? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;Colleges have an important interest in student body diversity that furthers the values of academic freedom and equal protection. A holistic, race-conscious admissions process is the extension of a university’s academic freedom to assemble a diverse student body. Removing the consideration of race in admissions conflicts with the ability of a university to select its student body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the consideration of race in college admissions furthers the values of equal protection under the Constitution by helping to diminish stereotypes, promoting integration on college campuses, and improving the ability of students of all races to participate in the academic community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Has the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action before?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Yes. In &lt;i&gt;Fisher v. University of Texas&lt;/i&gt;, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that diversity is a “compelling governmental interest,” permitting schools to consider race as a contributing factor to admissions in higher education. Time and again, lower courts and the Supreme Court have recognized this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: How do colleges, universities and students benefit from affirmative action? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;Race-conscious admissions policies help create a diverse student body, promote integration on college campuses, and create an inclusive educational environment that benefits all students. Students from diverse backgrounds who learn from each other and are exposed to a variety of experiences, backgrounds, interests, and talents are better prepared to be successful in our society. Banning any consideration of race would hamper the growth of generations of students who will be unprepared for an increasingly diverse nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What’s at stake if the Supreme Court moves to block race conscious admissions policies? Will this impact affirmative action efforts in other areas, suchs as workplaces? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;A decision blocking universities’ ability to consider race will almost certainly mean a significant drop in the number of students of color being admitted to selective universities. In fact, that’s what lower courts in both cases found after closely studying several race-neutral alternatives like a class-based affirmative action or plans similar to Texas’s top 10 percent plan, which guarantees Texas students who graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school class automatic admission to all state-funded Texas universities. Less diverse campuses will harm students of color and white students alike, and take us backward in our efforts to overcome the country’s shameful legacy of racism and racial inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision outlawing consideration of race in college admissions could also make it harder for employers to take steps to promote equity and diversify their workforce. Dozens of government programs that address past and current discrimination, advance racial equity, and seek to close the racial wealth gap, such as business incubator programs, could also be jeopardized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What actions can colleges and universities take if the Supreme Court does rule to block race conscious admissions policies? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;Higher ed institutions will still be able to do outreach and recruit students from all backgrounds. Universities will still be able to stop considering factors that have been proven to create unjustifiable barriers for historically underrepresented students of color. For example, many schools have already stopped considering SAT and the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what happens, we continue to advocate for race conscious admissions and ensuring higher education is accessible to all.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday marked a historic and joyful day in DeSoto County, Mississippi. The county’s first mosque, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abrahamhouseofgod.com/&quot;&gt;Abraham House of God&lt;/a&gt;, finally broke ground in the City of Horn Lake. While the occasion was celebratory, it was also a relief to the mosque’s founders, who were forced to sue last year after city officials — motivated by anti-Muslim prejudice — denied them a critical zoning authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Represented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Mississippi, and Simpson Thacher &amp;amp; Bartlett LLP, the mosque and its founders argued in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/horn_lake_mosque_complaint_filed.pdf&quot;&gt;2021 lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; that the zoning decision violated both the First Amendment, which prohibits singling out one faith for discriminatory treatment, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/crt/religious-land-use-and-institutionalized-persons-act&quot;&gt;Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA)&lt;/a&gt;, a federal law that provides heightened protections for religious groups seeking to establish a house of worship or to use property for other religious purposes. In a decisive victory, our clients quickly won a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/consent-decree-abraham-house-god-v-city-horn-lake&quot;&gt;consent decree&lt;/a&gt; (a court order to which the parties agree) requiring the city to approve their construction site plan and prohibiting further discrimination against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that didn’t stop Horn Lake from once again trying to thwart our clients’ right to develop their property. In April, our clients applied for a conditional-use permit to establish an Islamic cemetery next to the mosque. Although the city’s Planning Commission staff “strongly and categorically” recommended approval of the application, some commissioners balked. Echoing the biased sentiments expressed nearly a year before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/religious-liberty/a-mississippi-city-blocked-a-proposed-mosque-due-to-anti-muslim-prejudice-were-suing&quot;&gt;by a city Alderman who voted against the mosque’s site plan&lt;/a&gt;, one planning commissioner complained, “I am assuming that Muslims nationwide will be coming to Horn Lake to bury their dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only after we intervened, yet again, and reminded the city that it must comply with the First Amendment, RLUIPA, and the consent decree, that the Planning Commission voted 4-3 to recommend approval of the permit. And, last week, the Board of Aldermen voted in favor of the recommendation, ensuring that the mosque will be able to offer vital funeral and burial services for the local Muslim community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Horn Lake matter is not the only recent incident in which minority-faith groups or houses of worship have faced discriminatory hurdles in zoning proceedings. In some instances, as in Horn Lake, the prejudice is overt and unmistakable. In others, the bias may be more veiled, cloaked in vague — and unsupported — allegations that the proposed land use will cause problems with parking, traffic, or noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past summer, the ACLU and the ACLU of Rhode Island stepped in to represent the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hornandcauldron.com/&quot;&gt;Horn and Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, Church of the Earth, a small Wiccan church located in Coventry, Rhode Island. Wicca is a nature-based religion, and the church’s religious services, educational classes, and other faith-based activities focus on the relationship between the earth and the divine. As in Horn Lake, the Coventry Planning Commission staff recommended approval of our clients’ permit application, noting that the application met all requirements and that “the church has been holding activities on the property for many years and the Planning and Zoning department has not received any complaints since the church’s founding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, during a public hearing, members of the Coventry Zoning Board of Review declined to approve the permit, citing inaccurate parking concerns (the church has more-than-adequate parking for visitors) and unsubstantiated allegations about fire safety (the church follows all fire-safety laws, and the facilities comply with the fire marshal’s directives). When we became involved, it was clear that town officials either were not aware of, or did not care about, their obligations under RLUIPA, let alone under the First Amendment. Earlier this month, in response to our advocacy, the zoning board granted the church’s permit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some zoning discrimination matters are not resolved so quickly. In 2016, the Thai Meditation Association of Alabama, a Buddhist religious organization, filed suit after the City of Mobile repeatedly stymied its attempts to develop a meditation center on a 100-acre parcel of property. The complaint argued that’s the city’s denial of zoning approval bowed to community animus against Buddhism — to some, an unfamiliar faith. The case has dragged on for years, with a court recently finding that city officials made deceptive statements, violated local ordinances, failed to account for the religious nature of the proposed use, and “manipulated the reasons that the planning approval was denied,” including by drafting false meeting minutes. As the lawsuit proceeds, the ACLU and a number of other civil-rights and religious-freedom groups recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/thai-meditation-association-alabama-v-city-mobile-amicus-brief&quot;&gt;filed an amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, supporting the Association’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;wp-sizing-container sizing--wide&quot;&gt;
      &lt;figure class=&quot;wp-image mb-md&quot;&gt;
		  &lt;img width=&quot;1110&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; src=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RELIGIOUS_DISCRIMINATION-Blog-V2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;attachment-original size-original&quot; alt=&quot;Two smiling men (members of the Abraham House of God, the first mosque in DeSoto County Mississippi) shake hands as they greet each other while another smiling man looks on.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RELIGIOUS_DISCRIMINATION-Blog-V2.jpg 1110w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RELIGIOUS_DISCRIMINATION-Blog-V2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RELIGIOUS_DISCRIMINATION-Blog-V2-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RELIGIOUS_DISCRIMINATION-Blog-V2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RELIGIOUS_DISCRIMINATION-Blog-V2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RELIGIOUS_DISCRIMINATION-Blog-V2-1000x667.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1110px) 100vw, 1110px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the Association ultimately prevails, however, it will come at great cost, as we have seen with our own clients. Challenging discriminatory zoning decisions often requires religious groups to tap into limited financial reserves. Moreover, every day that zoning approvals are wrongfully denied is another day that the religious groups or houses of worship are prevented from fully exercising their faith in fundamental ways. And because zoning matters are deeply rooted in and tied to the local community, the distress and dignitary harm that minority-faith applicants suffer from discriminatory denials hits that much closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’ll continue to defend the right of all faiths — especially those that may be unfamiliar to some or unpopular in the eyes of others — to be free from unfair treatment in zoning proceedings. It’s not only the law; it’s the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four families of transgender youth and two doctors have &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/cases/brandt-et-al-v-rutledge-et-al&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;challenged an Arkansas law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; that would prohibit healthcare professionals from providing or even referring transgender young people for medically-necessary health care. A trial &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/brandt-v-rutledge-what-to-know-about-the-arkansas-trial&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;began last week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Here, one of our plaintiffs shares how the law would impact her daughter and family. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband, Aaron, and I are raising our three daughters in Arkansas. Our entire family and community are here and we love our home state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My oldest daughter, Sabrina, is transgender and the medical treatment she has received for her gender dysphoria has changed her life. At one time, Sabrina shrank from the world. She was anxious and unsure of herself and struggled with severe dysphoria. Today, Sabrina is confident and has hopes for her future and a joy that we had not seen in her before she started this care. We are fighting to ensure the medical treatment that has given her the life she has today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Sabrina was younger and before she started receiving medical treatment for her gender dysphoria, she expressed to us, the best she could at the time, that she couldn&amp;#8217;t see a future for herself and didn&amp;#8217;t know why. As parents, we were in agony watching her struggle. We saw her as a brilliant, gifted mind, with a very gentle soul. It was heartbreaking that she didn’t see the beautiful person that we saw in her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After she came out to us and began to receive medical treatment for her gender dysphoria, we began to notice her confidence. She began to smile again and found joy in shopping and styling outfits for not only herself, but her two sisters. They love to swap clothes and accessories, which is really fun to watch. She is also a gifted artist who has created some pretty amazing self-portraits that emphasize her beautiful red curls. Sabrina, who once was a very shy, reserved, and unhappy person, is now our confident social butterfly who loves a good selfie opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a parent, I never imagined I’d have to fight for my daughter to be able to receive medically necessary health care. I never imagined having to watch my child suffer and then get better only to have lawmakers take away the treatment she needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;alignfullwidth mb-md wp-pullquote &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As a parent, I never imagined I’d have to fight for my daughter to be able to receive medically necessary health care.&lt;/p&gt;
      
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of Arkansas has suggested that people are rushing into this care, but nothing could be further from the truth for us. My husband and I are very careful and thoughtful people. We had many long, serious discussions with each other, with Sabrina, and with her medical providers. We prayed about the decisions we all had to make as a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkansas is our home. We have lived here our entire lives, and our parents, siblings, grandparents, church, and entire support system are all here in Arkansas. We do not want to have to leave our home simply to be able to provide necessary medical care for our daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabrina is an amazing, smart, beautiful person and an incredible daughter. I wish that those politicians who passed this law would take the time to listen to the experiences of trans youth and to get to know people like our daughter. I can’t imagine anyone who truly got to know and understand how this care has impacted Sabrina could take action that would jeopardize her joy, her smile, and her sense of possibility for her future.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>
		&lt;p&gt;People with disabilities have long faced some of the greatest barriers to voting in our elections. From inaccessible polling places and a lack of working accessible voting machines to onerous restrictions on absentee voting, our right to the ballot has often been ignored or forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, over &lt;a href=&quot;https://smlr.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Centers/Program_Disability_Research/FactSheet_Disability_Voter_Turnout_2020.pdf&quot;&gt;11 percent&lt;/a&gt; of voters with disabilities reported that they faced some type of difficulty casting a ballot — more than any other group and despite expanded access to mail-in voting due to the pandemic. But instead of embracing the more accessible forms of voting that sparked record turnout, including among voters with disabilities, states have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/04/12/voters-with-disabilities-face-new-ballot-restrictions-ahead-of-midterms&quot;&gt;doubled down&lt;/a&gt; on new and more restrictive voter suppression laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021 alone, more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-december-2021&quot;&gt;400 anti-voter measures&lt;/a&gt; were introduced by states across the country, many of which are most burdensome to people of color and voters with disabilities. These measures run the gamut from restricting access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/arizona-legislature-passes-law-purge-infrequent-mail-voters-n1267025&quot;&gt;absentee voting&lt;/a&gt;, eliminating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ktvh.com/news/montana-politics/gianforte-signs-bills-eliminating-election-day-registration-tightening-voter-id&quot;&gt;Election Day registration&lt;/a&gt;, and making it more difficult to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/08/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-shortening-early-voting-closing-polls-earlier-election-day/6869317002/&quot;&gt;vote early in person&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2021/12/28/texas-new-election-law-challenged-over-provision-making-it-a-crime-to-encourage-voting-by-mail/&quot;&gt;criminalizing &lt;/a&gt;the act of assisting voters with disabilities to vote. We’re challenging some of the measures that have become law in court in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/cases/sixth-district-african-methodist-episcopal-church-v-kemp&quot;&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/groups-file-lawsuit-against-state-texas-over-voter-suppression-bill-sb1&quot;&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where egregious restrictions illegally burden the right to vote for people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you choose to vote in person early or on Election Day, or vote absentee, you’ll have to navigate a complex web of state and local election rules and deadlines regarding voter registration, absentee ballots, and fixing or “curing” a ballot that was rejected, often due to missing or incorrect information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This election season, we’re fighting back against voter suppression and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/vote-your-values&quot;&gt;urging all Americans&lt;/a&gt; to vote for their values and fight for their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For voters with disabilities, we’re making sure you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights&quot;&gt;know your rights&lt;/a&gt; and can find resources about how to vote, including voting absentee and curing a ballot if it’s rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vote.gov/&quot;&gt;Vote.gov&lt;/a&gt; helps you quickly register to vote if you haven’t already. &lt;b&gt;Register early&lt;/b&gt;, as some states require you to register to vote 30 days or more before an election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re already registered, double check that your registration, including current address, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote/voter-registration-status&quot;&gt;up to date&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2 id=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-heading-h2 with-mark&quot;&gt;Request an Absentee Ballot&lt;/h2&gt;
		
			&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All U.S. states and Washington, D.C. permit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-2-excuses-to-vote-absentee.aspx&quot;&gt;people with an illness or disability&lt;/a&gt; to vote absentee, allowing you to mail in your ballot or drop it off at a drop box or polling location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to voter registration, each state has its own set of deadlines and rules for voting absentee. Check out the deadlines here on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/&quot;&gt;Vote.org&lt;/a&gt;. Some states require you to complete an application in order to receive an absentee ballot, and the deadline to apply may be as early as two weeks before the election. New voter suppression laws may require you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vote.org/voter-id-laws/&quot;&gt;provide proof of ID&lt;/a&gt; to request an absentee ballot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find information about how to request an absentee ballot in your state using this tool from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/absentee-early-voting&quot;&gt;National Association of Secretaries of State&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you plan to vote in person or return your absentee ballot in a drop box, locate your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/&quot;&gt;polling place&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vote.org/dropbox-locator/&quot;&gt;drop box&lt;/a&gt;. Many states do not allow you to vote in person at a location that is not designated as your assigned precinct. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vote.org/voter-id-laws/&quot;&gt;Check&lt;/a&gt; to see if your state requires an ID to vote in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you plan to submit your ballot by mail, &lt;b&gt;send it at least a week before the election&lt;/b&gt; to be sure it arrives by Election Day. Your absentee ballot will likely require you to sign the ballot and/or ballot envelope, and may require &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-14-how-states-verify-voted-absentee.aspx&quot;&gt;one or more witnesses&lt;/a&gt; to sign as well. Your ballot will be rejected if the signature is missing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your ballot is in, use your state’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vote.org/ballot-tracker-tools/&quot;&gt;ballot tracker&lt;/a&gt; to see if it’s been counted. Ballots may be rejected if there is a missing signature on the ballot envelope or a discrepancy in the signature matching process, or if your voter file is missing identifying information like your social security number or driver&amp;#8217;s license number. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.texastribune.org/2022/04/06/texas-mail-in-ballot-rejection-voting/&quot;&gt;One in eight&lt;/a&gt; mail-in ballots were rejected in the Texas primary earlier this year, so make sure your voter file is up to date with all the required information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your ballot is rejected, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-15-states-that-permit-voters-to-correct-signature-discrepancies.aspx&quot;&gt;24 states will allow you&lt;/a&gt; to correct your ballot in a process &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/Cure_period_for_absentee_and_mail-in_ballots&quot;&gt;known as “curing.”&lt;/a&gt; These states are required to notify you via mail, phone, or email, that your ballot has been rejected and you need to correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most states will notify you within days of the election if your ballot has been rejected, and you will be given between 3 days and two weeks to prove your identity for your ballot to be counted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ada.gov/ada_voting/ada_voting_ta.htm&quot;&gt;Federal law&lt;/a&gt;, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and Voting Rights Act, require election workers to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make polling places fully accessible to voters with disabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have at least one voting system at each polling place that allows people with disabilities to vote privately and independently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow voters with disabilities to receive in-person help at the polls (except from an agent of your employer or union).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make other reasonable accommodations if possible for them to do so.&lt;/li&gt;

		<description>
		&lt;p&gt;Among the many responsibilities that come with raising a child, standing in a federal courtroom and defending your child’s constitutional rights isn’t likely what most parents plan for. But in a federal courthouse in Little Rock this week, a historic trial against Arkansas’ ban on gender-affirming care brought four families together to defend the rights and well-being of their transgender adolescent children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first in a two-part trial, the week-long hearing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/cases/brandt-et-al-v-rutledge-et-al&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brandt v. Rutledge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; focused first on the safety and efficacy of gender-affirming health care: an individualized, evidence-based approach to reducing gender dysphoria that can include counseling, hormone therapy, and, in some more exceptional cases for adolescents, top surgery. Experts with decades of research and practice told the court about widely accepted treatment protocols that are supported across the medical community — including by endocrinologists, pediatricians, general practitioners, and bioethicists, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;wp-link__title&quot;&gt;
              Brandt et al v. Rutledge et al          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;wp-link__description mt-xs&quot;&gt;Doctors and families of transgender youth are fighting an Arkansas law that would prevent them from getting medically necessary care. &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court also heard from two providers who’ve worked with transgender youth in Arkansas: Dr. Michele Hutchison and Dr. Kathleen Stambough, the former and current medical directors of the Gender Spectrum Clinic at Arkansas Children’s Hospital. In the language of professionals quite used to describing complex medical concepts to children, the doctors explained to the court the careful balance they and families strike when making decisions about a child’s medical needs related to gender dysphoria, weighing carefully the risks and benefits of treatment for each individual child’s current and future well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also spoke about the impact of the law banning this widely accepted treatment. Dr. Hutchison — who testified against the bill in the Arkansas General Assembly — noted four of her own patients were hospitalized for suicide attempts shortly after the bill was introduced, and anxiety scores of patients being seen at the clinic climbed from 40 percent to 60 percent in the wake of the bill’s introduction. Even after the law was blocked by a preliminary injunction, Dr. Stambough explained that the clinic was forced to decline medically-necessary care like puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in anticipation of the law potentially going into effect at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, however, this trial was about the constitutional and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/transgender-and-non-binary-leaders-tell-federal-court-trans-people-deserve-joy-at-any-age&quot;&gt;civil rights of the parents and transgender youth&lt;/a&gt; impacted by Act 626, an Arkansas law banning this evidence-based medicine passed in 2021 and currently blocked by a federal injunction. Four parents — Donnie Ray Saxton, Aaron Jennen, Amanda Dennis, and Joanna Brandt — took the stand to share their experience of watching their children suffer from dysphoria, come out as transgender, and flourish with the help of medical providers who prescribed treatment the state they are proud to call home now seeks to ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donnie Ray Saxton, who operates a plumbing business while raising his five children, spoke about the confidence his 17-year-old transgender son Parker gained after starting testosterone treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We&amp;#8217;re a family, and we&amp;#8217;re not a family without Parker,” Donnie told the court. “We&amp;#8217;d have to pick up and leave if this took effect. This is home. Our small town transitioned with us.” Asked what would happen if Parker could no longer access this care, Donnie replied tersely, “I&amp;#8217;m not going to think about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Jennen, a government attorney and father of 17-year-old Sabrina, described his transgender daughter as “smart, gifted, beautiful.. [she] easily has the most envied hair in the courtroom.” Sabrina, who has struggled with depression, anxiety, and a noted lack of confidence, now proudly shares selfies and “even put her name in the hat to be homecoming queen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denying Sabrina this care is simply not an option, said Aaron. Through tears, he stared across the courtroom at his daughter sitting in the gallery. “I promise you,” he said emphatically, “that will not happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Dennis, an advertising technology specialist and mother of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/bio/brooke-dennis&quot;&gt;10-year-old Brooke&lt;/a&gt;, said her young transgender daughter “was one of the most incredible humans I know.” While Brooke is too young for any endocrine treatments for her gender dysphoria, she is already wary of the coming effects of puberty; she sees her older brother growing taller and his Adam’s apple becoming more prominent, and is growing more and more anxious, leaving Amanda gravely distressed her daughter may be forced to undergo her endogenous puberty with the potential irreversible changes that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;#8217;ve always promised all of my children that we will care for you,” said Amanda. “It fills me with so much sorrow that this would happen where I live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanna Brandt took the stand and spoke of her 17-year-old transgender son Dylan, who began testosterone in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“His capacity for empathy for others — but more importantly for himself — has been remarkable,” said Joanna. “Dylan is the most emotionally intelligent person I know. The kid that Dylan was [before transitioning] would not be in this courtroom today. It is because of this care he is able to fight for himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And fight he did. Dylan Brandt &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chasestrangio/status/1583097402663133188&quot;&gt;took the stand&lt;/a&gt; as the lone transgender person to testify in any of the hearings. Calmly and stoically, he told the court of his experiences with dysphoria, his family’s “right off the bat” acceptance when he came out, and the relief gender-affirming care has brought him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The thought of going back is just not an option,” said Dylan. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;d probably have to leave the state. I have a job, my mom has a business. I still have a year and a half of high school left. Being pushed out of the place I&amp;#8217;ve lived my entire life is hard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last person called to the stand by the plaintiffs challenging this ban, Dylan was asked by ACLU attorney Chase Strangio how he would sum up the way his treatment made him feel. Leaning into the mic, he said “hopeful.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>
		&lt;p&gt;From the Boston Tea Party to the Montgomery bus boycott to the boycott of apartheid South Africa, politically motivated consumer boycotts have long been part and parcel of American politics. But are they protected by the First Amendment? For 40 years, the answer has been an unequivocal &amp;#8220;yes.&amp;#8221; But in a recent case from Arkansas, a federal court of appeals ruled otherwise. If the right to boycott is to be preserved, the Supreme Court must step in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.&lt;/em&gt;, the Supreme Court in 1982 unanimously upheld the First Amendment right of Black Mississippians to boycott local businesses in protest against segregation and racial inequality. The decision established that politically-motivated consumer boycotts are fully protected by the Constitution. As a result, today, people of all political stripes can proudly exercise their right to boycott — from right-wing boycotts of companies that support Planned Parenthood to left-wing boycotts of companies that support the National Rifle Association. Now, that long-standing precedent has been called into question.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;alignfullwidth mb-md wp-pullquote &quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot; wp-pullquote-inner&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the First Amendment does not protect &amp;#8220;the purchasing decisions at the heart of a boycott&amp;#8221; — even if a law selectively penalizes boycotts on a specific topic, like boycotts of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
      
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, 28 states have &lt;a href=&quot;https://legislation.palestinelegal.org/state-legislation/#statistics&quot;&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; laws requiring individuals and businesses that receive government contracts – from substitute teachers to construction workers — to certify that they will not participate in boycotts of Israel or Israeli settlements in the West Bank. My client, the Arkansas Times, was asked to sign such a certification in order to renew its advertising contract with a state technical college. Although the Arkansas Times does not boycott Israel, it refuses to be bullied by the state into disavowing its civil liberties. As Alan Leveritt, the publisher, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/22/opinion/israel-arkansas-bds-pledge.html&quot;&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;: “If we signed the pledge, I believe, we’d be signing away our right to freedom of conscience. And as journalists, we would be unworthy of the protections granted us under the First Amendment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These anti-boycott laws have affected Americans from all walks of life. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/cases/koontz-v-watson-challenge-kansas-law-targeting-boycotts-israel&quot;&gt;teacher&lt;/a&gt; in Kansas was told that she could not participate in the state’s teacher-training program because she refused to sign the anti-boycott form. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/cases/jordahl-v-brnovich-challenge-arizona-law-targeting-boycotts-israel&quot;&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona was told that he could not be paid for his work on behalf of incarcerated people because he refused to sign the certification. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.texastribune.org/2019/04/26/Texas-bahia-amawi-speaks-out-against-anti-israel-boycott/&quot;&gt;child speech pathologist&lt;/a&gt; in Texas lost her contract with a local school district because she refused to sign. Engineers, writers, journalists, and even university students who want to judge high school debate tournaments have all been asked to certify that they do not participate in boycotts of Israel or Israel-controlled territories. One town in Texas even briefly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/10/20/texas-town-makes-hurricane-harvey-aid-applicants-pledge-not-to-boycott-israel/&quot;&gt;required&lt;/a&gt; victims of Hurricane Harvey to sign the anti-boycott certification as a condition of receiving disaster relief funds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;alignfullwidth mb-md wp-pullquote &quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot; wp-pullquote-inner&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the right to boycott is to be preserved, the Supreme Court must step in.&lt;/p&gt;
      
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the federal courts that have addressed these anti-boycott laws have recognized that they violate the First Amendment. Unfortunately, the Arkansas Times’ case came out differently. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the First Amendment does not protect “the purchasing decisions at the heart of a boycott” — even if a law selectively penalizes boycotts on a specific topic, like boycotts of Israel. Under the Eighth Circuit’s reasoning, Alabama could have suppressed the Montgomery bus boycott by outlawing boycotts of municipal buses or segregated businesses. That notion is in direct conflict with the precedent set in &lt;em&gt;Claiborne Hardware &lt;/em&gt;affirming our right to participate in political boycotts, as well as a long line of Supreme Court cases recognizing that the government cannot take sides and distort public debate by selectively penalizing disfavored viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court of appeals reasoned that because one can’t know the meaning of a decision not to purchase from a business unless it is accompanied by speech, the boycott itself is not protected, and the state is free to single out and penalize the boycotts it disfavors. The same reasoning applies to marches. One can’t know the meaning of a group of people walking together unless it is accompanied by placards, chants, and speeches. But surely the government could not selectively ban marches protesting the Israeli government’s policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why the ACLU just filed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/arkansas-times-lp-v-waldrip-scotus-cert-petition&quot;&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; asking the Supreme Court to take up the Arkansas Times’ case and reaffirm that the First Amendment still protects the right to boycott. While we await their decision, states have started to &lt;a href=&quot;https://justvision.org/boycott/legislation-tracker&quot;&gt;pass similar laws&lt;/a&gt; suppressing boycotts of the fossil fuels, firearms, mining, timber, and agriculture industries. All sorts of special interests are pushing anti-boycott laws to stifle protest against them. If the court does not step in, a form of protest dating back to the American Revolution itself will remain in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Celia Banos calls her son, Jhean, a born musician. Ever since he was a little boy, Jhean loved music. He learned the guitar, and after high school, he played in a band called The Parallels. At the age of 21, Jhean had his first episode of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhean is 28 now, and — like thousands of people with serious mental illness — he cycles in and out of the Los Angeles County jail system. This cycle repeats itself because the county does not fund robust mental health services and alternatives to incarceration. Jhean’s family has tried to get him the help he needs, but they cannot find affordable, quality care for him. In moments of crisis, the family’s only option has been to call the Los Angeles Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling the police, however, causes the family even more trauma. In one recent incident, LAPD officers tased Jhean multiple times. In another incident, Celia says the police made fun of Jhean and laughed at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is someone’s son. Someone’s brother. He&amp;#8217;s our family member, and he’s sick,” said Celia. “Being sick doesn’t mean that he is a criminal, and you have no right to laugh at someone like that, especially in front of a mother.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Jhean and Celia over the summer while investigating conditions at the LA County jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, I get updates from the jail telling me how many people are stuck in processing at the Inmate Reception Center (IRC) for more than 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get these updates because, since 1978, the ACLU has served as a court-appointed monitor of the LA County jail system. In that capacity, we gather information from the county and from incarcerated people in order to advocate on their behalf when jail conditions fall below basic constitutional standards of safety, hygiene and decency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this summer, one of these daily updates showed exceptionally long wait times at the IRC. On that day in June, at least 28 people had been stuck at the IRC for more than 49 hours. That same day, I went down to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I saw shook me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IRC was filthy. My shoes stuck to the floor. Two toilets were overflowing with human waste. More than a dozen people were trying to sleep on the floor. In an area known as the “front bench,” five individuals were sitting chained to their chairs as is required. The daily report noted that two of those five had been chained to the front bench for more than 24 hours. People called out to me that they had only been given peanut butter sandwiches to eat. Others called out that they hadn’t been provided with their medication and were awaiting psychiatric evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, I went back to the IRC with my ACLU colleagues to investigate the conditions, talk to people detained at the IRC, and talk to the LA County Sheriff Department’s staff about improving conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditions worsened throughout the summer, and by August people were stuck in the IRC for four to five days, and some chained to the Front Bench for over 72 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when Celia called the ACLU, and I eventually met Jhean. Celia was concerned that Jhean had been arrested and taken to the IRC but had not received housing for days, even though he had been diagnosed with a severe mental illness. I checked our reports and discovered that Jhean had spent almost 100 consecutive hours chained to the front bench. I went to visit Jhean, who had finally been transferred to a cell in the Twin Towers Jail. I saw that his wrists were swollen, cut and bruised — consistent with being handcuffed for so many hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tragically, Jhean was just one of many who suffered from pervasive abuse in the IRC in late summer. My colleagues and I saw and heard reports of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with serious mental illness chained to chairs for days at a time, where they slept sitting up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dozens of people crammed together, sleeping head-to-foot on the hard concrete floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People defecating in trash cans and urinating on the floor or in empty food containers in shared spaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unhygienic conditions, including floors littered with trash, overflowing sinks and toilets, no access to showers or clean clothes for days, and lack of adequate access to drinking water and food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of adequate health care, including failure to provide people with serious mental illness or chronic medical conditions their medications, or to provide care to people dangerously detoxing from drugs and alcohol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the ACLU of Southern California and the ACLU National Prison Project sought an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/cases/rutherford-v-villanueva&quot;&gt;emergency order&lt;/a&gt; from a federal judge to make LA County and the LA sheriff limit wait times and provide adequate hygiene and medical care at the IRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of daily suffering and misery experienced by people in the IRC is unspeakable. The LA County Board of Supervisors — the people ultimately responsible for the jails — know about the suffering, and the county’s attorneys even conceded in court that the horrors we recounted were true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of suffering and misery could be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, the LA County Board of Supervisors committed to a “care first, jails last” approach to mental health treatment and meeting the needs of our unhoused community. But the Board of Supervisors has yet to commit to a timeline for establishing the thousands of community beds and services needed to reduce overcrowding and stop the cycle of people coming in and out of jail because they cannot access necessary mental health care, substance use treatment, or housing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhean remains in jail, as of this writing. Celia hasn’t been able to visit him, because the sheriff’s office keeps canceling her visits. She believes it is in retaliation for speaking out about Jhean and the nearly 100 hours he spent chained to a chair in IRC. Celia wishes her family could access consistent treatment for Jhean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why jail?” said Celia. “My son does not belong in jail. He has an illness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She worries for his safety. “I&amp;#8217;m scared for my son,” she said. “This is an everyday thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
