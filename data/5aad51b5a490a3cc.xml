      <title>The Longest Game </title>
      <link>https://30for30podcasts.com/</link>
      <description>Baseball holds its records sacred. Most home runs, strikeouts, career wins. But what about the longest game ever? That honor goes to a 1981 AAA game, when the Pawtucket Red Sox and Rochester Red Wings slugged it out from dusk to dawn. The record-breaking 33 innings brought hope, despair and drama on and off the field. Radio Diaries and 30 for 30 Podcasts take listeners to that frigid, surreal night with the voices who lived it – including Hall of Famers Wade Boggs and Cal Ripken Jr. Most heroes of The Longest Game never made it big, but their unflagging endurance made history.

      <title>Mina Kimes and the First Pitch</title>
      <link>https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/27852002/the-espn-daily-podcast-how-listen-episode-guide-more</link>
      <description>The ceremonial first pitch is a tradition almost as old as baseball itself, with presidents, celebrities and non-MLB athletes taking to the mound to aim for home plate. But the only person who may truly care about any first pitch…is the one throwing it, with the gut-wrenching feeling that they might biff. Our very own Mina Kimes will be in that position soon, throwing a first pitch for her beloved Seattle Mariners. So we called up MLB Insider Jeff Passan and enlisted legendary pitching coach Tom House to help us understand just what Mina’s getting into.

      <title>Gabe Kapler: The Most Interesting Man in Baseball</title>
      <link>https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/27852002/the-espn-daily-podcast-how-listen-episode-guide-more</link>
      <description>Picture a baseball manager. Whatever image you’ve conjured in your mind of, say, a slightly out of shape, older man who’s all business - it probably doesn’t match Gabe Kapler, who manages the San Francisco Giants. Kapler is an enigma: an uber-buff fitness geek who only eats red meat. He sports well manicured facial hair and speaks in verse, sounding more like a poet than a baseball player. Tim Keown introduces us to Kapler, and how he’s rewriting baseball’s unwritten rules…and reimagining what it means to be a manager.

      <title>After Jackie: What Happened with Baseball and Black America?</title>
      <description>It’s been 75 years since Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in baseball, becoming the first Black player to take the field in Major League Baseball in 1947. Jackie was a specific player chosen at a specific time, when baseball was highly aligned with Black popular culture. But what happened between baseball and Black America in the decades after Jackie’s pivotal act? Why didn’t baseball become a majority Black sport, like basketball and football? Why didn’t MLB follow the culture into hip hop or grow its Black fan base? Jesse Washington uses his own lapsed baseball fandom to explore these questions with guests like Public Enemy’s Chuck D, Jackie’s son David Robinson, and current players and executives.

      <title>“The Most Important Puerto Rican Ever”</title>
      <description>Buster Olney remembers the life and tragic passing of Roberto Clemente on New Year’s Eve of 1972 with three distinct voices. First, Buster talks to former Pirates pitcher Steve Blass about meeting Clemente as an 18-year-old minor leaguer, when he heard the news of the plane crash, spring training of 1973 feeling like an extension of the memorial, what Clemente was like in the clubhouse and why no one could take their eyes off of him. Then David Maraniss, author of Clemente: The Passion and Grace of Baseball's Last Hero, stops by to talk about his live broadcast relaying the news of Clemente’s death, why he decided to write a Clemente biography, the awe Clemente inspired in fellow players and Manny Sanguillén searching for Clemente’s body. Finally, longtime MLB player and coach Joey Cora discusses learning of Clemente’s death at the age of seven, Clemente putting Puerto Rico on the map, how Clemente paved the way for all Puerto Rican players in MLB and his favorite Clemente highlight.
