      <title>Control: Eugenics And The Corruption Of Science</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 1859, Charles Darwin published <em>On the Origin of Species, </em>a book about the evolution of non-human animals by natural selection.<em>  </em>In its wake, a political idea arose — eugenics.  Reading Darwin's book, Sir Francis Galton proposed that humans should be bred to give more "suitable" characteristics a "better chance of prevailing."  Today, producer Rebecca Ramirez talks to Adam Rutherford about his new book, <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324035602/about-the-book/product-details"><em>Control: The Dark History and Troubling Present of Eugenics</em></a>, which traces the inextricable link between political ideology and science, and the enduring shadow of eugenics.]]></description>

      <title>He Had His Father's Voice: Tracking A Rare Bird Hybrid</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When Steve Gosser heard the song of a scarlet tanager in the woods, he knew to look for a bright-red bird with black wings. But when he laid eyes on the singer, he saw instead a dark-colored head, black-and-white body, with a splash of red on its chest. "Well, that sort of looks like a first-year male rose-breasted grosbeak," he said. The song of one bird coming out of the body of another suggested this little guy could be a rare hybrid. Gosser enlisted the help of some pros, including biologist David Toews, who conducted a genetic analysis to see if this was truly the offspring of two species that diverged 10 million years ago, and today run in very different circles. On today's episode, Gosser and Toews fill Aaron in on this avian mystery, and what hybrid animals can teach us about evolution. ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[When Steve Gosser heard the song of a scarlet tanager in the woods, he knew to look for a bright-red bird with black wings. But when he laid eyes on the singer, he saw instead a dark-colored head, black-and-white body, with a splash of red on its chest. "Well, that sort of looks like a first-year male rose-breasted grosbeak," he said. The song of one bird coming out of the body of another suggested this little guy could be a rare hybrid. Gosser enlisted the help of some pros, including biologist David Toews, who conducted a genetic analysis to see if this was truly the offspring of two species that diverged 10 million years ago, and today run in very different circles. On today's episode, Gosser and Toews fill Aaron in on this avian mystery, and what hybrid animals can teach us about evolution. ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New Discoveries In Underwater Plant Sex </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Plants living underwater can't count on pollinating insects to get it on. The prevailing theory has been that pollen moves underwater simply by floating around in water currents. But a team of researchers co-led by Dr. Vivianne Solís-Weiss, have discovered a helper organism pitching in to pollinate seagrasses: marine worms. In today's episode, Vivianne tells <em>Short Wave</em> Scientist in Residence Regina G. Barber how she happened to catch these worms, called polychaetes, in the act of pollinating seagrass flowers underwater, and how the discovery is shedding new light on evolution in the oceans. ]]></description>

      <title>Choose Your Own (Math) Adventure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Ever read those Choose Your Own Adventure books of the 80s and 90s? As a kid, Dr. Pamela Harris was hooked on them. Years later she realized how much those books have in common with her field: combinatorics, the branch of math concerned with counting. It, too, depends on thinking through endless, branching possibilities. She and several students set out to write a scholarly paper in the style of Choose Your Own Adventure books. Dr. Harris tells Regina G. Barber all about how the project began, how it gets complicated when you throw in wormholes and clowns, and why math is fundamentally a creative act. ]]></description>

Years later she realized how much those books have in common with her field: combinatorics, the branch of math concerned with counting. It, too, depends on thinking through endless, branching possibilities. She and several students set out to write a scholarly paper in the style of Choose Your Own Adventure books. Dr. Harris tells Regina G. Barber all about how the project began, how it gets complicated when you throw in wormholes and clowns, and why math is fundamentally a creative act. ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Quest To Save The California Condor</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The California condor used to soar across the western skies of North America, but by the 1980s, the bird was on the edge of extinction — just 22 remained. Thanks to decades of conservation work, the California condor population has rebounded to a couple hundred birds in Central California and Arizona. <br/><br/>This past May, a large partnership led by the Yurok Tribe re-introduced the birds to Northern California. Today, host Aaron Scott talks to Yurok biologist Tiana Williams-Claussen about the years-long quest to return the birds to their ancestral skies, and the importance of condor — who the Yurok call <em>Prey-go-neesh</em> — to the Yurok people and the natural world.

      <title>A New Drug For A Relentless Brain Disease</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALS is a disease that destroys the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord we need for voluntary movement. There is no cure, but now there is a newly approved medication that may slow down the disease and extend patients' lives. The drug, called Relyvrio, got its start with a couple of college students, some "ice bucket challenge" money, and a new approach to targeting this disease. Neuroscience correspondent Jon Hamilton checks in with host Emily Kwong about why some advisors aren't persuaded the drug works and how you weigh promising but limited evidence against the backdrop of a 100% fatal disease with hardly any other treatment options? ]]></description>

      <title>Asteroid Deflection Mission, Activate!</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In movies, asteroids careening towards Earth are confronted by determined humans with nuclear weapons to save the world! But a real NASA mission wants to change the course of an asteroid now (one not hurtling towards Earth). The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart/dart-news">Double Asteroid Redirection Test</a>, or DART, launched in 2021 and on Monday, September 26, 2022, makes contact with the celestial object. In 2021, NPR science correspondent <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/4494969/nell-greenfieldboyce">Nell Greenfieldboyce</a> talked about what it takes to pull off this mission and how it could potentially protect the Earth in the future from killer space rocks, and that's what you'll hear today. And stay tuned - when NASA has the results of contact in a few weeks, Short Wave will bring Nell back to tell us all about it!]]></description>

It's part of a push across the federal government to increase the level of tribal co-stewardship over public lands. Aaron talks with Sams, the first Tribal citizen to head the agency, about how he hopes this will change the way parks are managed, how the parks are already incorporating Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and what national parkland meant to him growing up as a member of the Cayuse and Walla Walla tribes on the Umatilla Indian Reservation in eastern Oregon. <br/><br/>Listen to more episodes about all the amazing research taking place on public lands, where we hike up sky islands and crawl into caves in search of fantastical creatures, by visiting the series website: <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/1120432990/road-trip-short-wave">https://www.npr.org/series/1120432990/road-trip-short-wave</a>]]></description>

      <title>How Freaked Out Should We Be About Ukraine's Nuclear Plant?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The world has been warily watching the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. The nuclear complex is being held by Russian forces, while the plant itself is being run by an increasingly ragged and exhausted Ukrainian workforce. Shells have fallen on the complex, and external power sources have been repeatedly knocked out, endangering the system that cools the nuclear reactors and raising the specter of a meltdown. NPR's Kat Lonsdorf reports from inside Ukraine. ]]></description>

      <title>The Race To Rescue The Guadalupe Fescue</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ Big Bend National Park in Texas is home to the only remaining Guadalupe fescue in the United States. The grass is tucked away in the Chisos Mountains, high above the Chihuahuan Desert. These mountaintops form a string of relatively wet, cool oases called "sky islands" — unique, isolated habitats. But as the planet warms, species that depend on "sky island" habitats tend to get pushed even higher up the mountain — until they eventually run out. Carolyn Whiting, Park Botanist at Big Bend, talks to host Aaron Scott about why the little things are worth preserving. <br/><br/>Check out all the <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/1120432990/road-trip-short-wave">other episodes</a> in our series on the research happening in U.S. public lands.<br/><br/>We're on Twitter now!

      <title>'Scallop Discos': How Some Glitzy Lights Could Lead To A Low-Impact Fishery</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Scientists in the UK have discovered that if they take a pot meant for catching crabs and just add some bright lights, scallops flock through the door like it's Studio 54. Scallops are normally fished via trawling or dredging—methods that can cause lasting damage to delicate seafloor ecosystems. So this accidental discovery (the lights were initially added to attract crab) could have a significant impact on scallop fishing. We talk with one of the scientists, Robert Enever of Fishtek Marine, a company that creates sustainable fishing gear, about this collaboration between science, industry and conservation.<br/><br/>Follow Short Wave on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/NPRShortWave?s=20&t=7EqCVnuGq5utlbl2_B-KDg">@NPRShortWave</a>.

      <title>Worm Blobs From The Bowels Of The Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the toxic waters of Sulphur Cave in Steamboat Springs, Colo. lives blood-red worm blobs that have attracted scientific interest from around the world. We don special breathing gear and go into the cave with David Steinmann, the spelunking scientist who first documented the worms, along with a trio of science students from Georgia Tech, to collect worms and marvel at the unique crystals and cave formations (ever heard of snottites??) that earned Sulphur Cave a designation as a National Natural Landmark in 2021. Then we learn about how extremophiles like these worms are helping scientists search for new antibiotics, medicines, or in the case of the Georgia Tech team, models for worm blob robots that can explore uneven, dangerous terrain, like caves on other planets.]]></description>

      <title>Sweating Buckets... of SCIENCE! </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Sweating can be unpleasant, but consider the alternatives: You could roll around in mud. You could spend all day panting. You could have someone whip you up a blood popsicle. Sweating turns out to be pretty essential for human existence, AND arguably less gross than the ways other animals keep from overheating. <br/><br/>On today's episode, a small army of NPR science reporters joins host Emily Kwong to talk about how humans developed the unique ability to perspire, how sweat works in space and the neat things other animals do to beat the heat. <br/><br/>How have you (and the animals in your life) stayed cool this summer?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sweating can be unpleasant, but consider the alternatives: You could roll around in mud. You could spend all day panting. You could have someone whip you up a blood popsicle. Sweating turns out to be pretty essential for human existence, AND arguably less gross than the ways other animals keep from overheating. <br/><br/>On today's episode, a small army of NPR science reporters joins host Emily Kwong to talk about how humans developed the unique ability to perspire, how sweat works in space and the neat things other animals do to beat the heat. <br/><br/>How have you (and the animals in your life) stayed cool this summer?

      <description><![CDATA[Grab your towels and flip flops, because we're heading to the beach. Whether you love playing in the sand, or dread getting it off your feet, building a sandcastle is an often underappreciated art form. In today's encore episode, Emily Kwong asks, scientifically, what <em>is</em> the best way to make a sandcastle? What's the right mix of water and sand to create grand staircases and towers? <br/><br/>Sedimentologist <a href="https://staffprofiles.bournemouth.ac.uk/display/mbennett">Matthew Bennett</a> shares his research and insights. ]]></description>

      <title>Eavesdropping On A Volcano</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Volcanoes are "talking" to us all the time. Scientists say the sooner we learn to interpret their normal chatter, the quicker we'll know when something unusual — and potentially dangerous — is happening.

Today: What Adela's research tells us about ticks and the diseases they carry, and why she's dedicated her career to understanding what makes these little critters... tick. ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Brazilian Scientists Inventing An mRNA Vaccine — And Sharing The Recipe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When Moderna and Pfizer first came out with their mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, supply was limited to rich countries and they did not share the details of how to create it. That left middle income countries like Brazil in the lurch. But for Brazilian scientists Patricia Neves and Ana Paula Ano Bom, that wasn't the end. They decided to invent their own mRNA vaccine.

      <title>TASTE BUDDIES: The Controversial World Of Taste Science</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Not much is known about why people experience tastes differently and why some people can detect certain tastes and not others. There also might be other tastes out there to add to the list beyond the five known ones now. In this finale to <em>Short Wave</em>'s Taste Buddies series, we're tackling the science of the five tastes, and in this episode, we look at why there is so much more research to be done. <br/><br/>Host Aaron Scott talks to <a href="https://monell.org/danielle-reed/">Danielle Reed</a> from the Monell Chemical Senses Center about the controversy in taste science and about what other tastes might exist beyond sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. <br/><br/>To listen to more episodes about how we taste, check out our Taste Buddies series: <a href="https://n.pr/3sSOgDB">n.pr/3sSOgDB</a><br/><br/>Email the show at <a href="mailto:shortwave@npr.org">shortwave@npr.org</a>. <br/>]]></description>

      <title>The Universe's Baby Pictures (Squee!) From The James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Earlier this week we got a look at one of the highest-profile scientific photo dumps of all time. The James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful telescope ever sent into space, and it is producing some of the most detailed, rich, and far-reaching images of the universe we have seen – including the birth of stars, galaxies colliding, and the bending of space-time itself. Today, Host Emily Kwong talks with Short Wave Scientist-in-Residence Regina G. Barber and NPR's Joe Palca about these mind bending new portraits of our universe and our origins. <br/><br/>You can follow Emily on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/emilykwong1234?s=20&t=uBtB65D0HRqCURMxl2laHg">@EmilyKwong1234</a> and Regina <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceRegina?s=20&t=uBtB65D0HRqCURMxl2laHg">@ScienceRegina</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this week we got a look at one of the highest-profile scientific photo dumps of all time. The James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful telescope ever sent into space, and it is producing some of the most detailed, rich, and far-reaching images of the universe we have seen – including the birth of stars, galaxies colliding, and the bending of space-time itself. Today, Host Emily Kwong talks with Short Wave Scientist-in-Residence Regina G. Barber and NPR's Joe Palca about these mind bending new portraits of our universe and our origins. <br/><br/>You can follow Emily on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/emilykwong1234?s=20&t=uBtB65D0HRqCURMxl2laHg">@EmilyKwong1234</a> and Regina <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceRegina?s=20&t=uBtB65D0HRqCURMxl2laHg">@ScienceRegina</a>.

      <title>Real Life 'Goonies'? A Mysterious Shipwreck Found Off the Oregon Coast</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For centuries, mysterious blocks of beeswax and Chinese porcelain have washed up on the Oregon coast, leading to legends of pirates, treasure, and a sunken Spanish galleon. It became known as the Beeswax Wreck, and it inspired centuries of treasure hunters—and maybe even Steven Spielberg, as he created <em>The Goonies</em>. Now, researchers have found nearly 330-year-old timbers from the ship in a hard-to-access cave. This is the story of how a team of volunteer archeologists are working to solve one of the most enduring mysteries of the Pacific Northwest, using old-school detective skills and one well-timed natural disaster. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[If you're not so fond of spiders, you may find kindred spirits in other spiders! Researcher Daniela Roessler worked with jumping spiders and found that they know to get away from the presence of other possible predator spiders, even if they've never encountered them before. She talks with host Maria Godoy about her research and what Halloween decorations do to the poor spiders, if arachnids can have arachnophobia.

But by the 1980s, the bird was on the edge of extinction — just 22 remained.<br/><br/>Thanks to decades of conservation work, the California condor population has rebounded to a couple hundred birds in Central California and Arizona. And this May, a large partnership led by the Yurok Tribe re-introduced the birds to Northern California. <br/><br/>Today, host Aaron Scott talks to Yurok biologist Tiana Williams-Claussen about the years-long quest to return the birds to their ancestral skies, and the importance of condor — who the Yurok call <em>Prey-go-neesh</em> — to the Yurok people and the natural world. ]]></description>

      <title>The Public Health Implications Of Overturning Roe V. Wade</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday. We're revisiting an episode that may give us insight into pregnant people's lives in a post-Roe United States. <br/><br/>We talked to Dr. Diana Greene Foster, the lead researcher on the interdisciplinary team behind The Turnaway Study. For over a decade, she and her fellow researchers followed just under a thousand women who sought an abortion across 21 states. These data reveal the outcomes of unwanted pregnancies and compare the physical, mental and financial consequences of having an abortion to those of carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term.  ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday. We're revisiting an episode that may give us insight into pregnant people's lives in a post-Roe United States. <br/><br/>We talked to Dr. Diana Greene Foster, the lead researcher on the interdisciplinary team behind The Turnaway Study. For over a decade, she and her fellow researchers followed just under a thousand women who sought an abortion across 21 states. These data reveal the outcomes of unwanted pregnancies and compare the physical, mental and financial consequences of having an abortion to those of carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term.  ]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Ranalda Tsosie grew up in the Navajo Nation, close to a number of abandoned uranium mines. The uranium from those mines leached into the groundwater, contaminating some of the unregulated wells that Ranalda and many others relied on for cooking, cleaning and drinking water. Today on the show, Ranalda talks to host Aaron Scott about her path to becoming an environmental chemist to study the extent of contamination in her home community using a blend of western and Diné science methods. ]]></description>

      <title>Planet Money: How Manatees Got Into Hot Water</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Today we share the mic with our colleagues at Planet Money to talk about one of our favorite aquatic creatures: manatees. Decades ago, manatees nearly went extinct as their habitat dwindled and boats threatened their lives. But power companies noticed something: manatees were hanging out near their power plants, seeking out warm water. So, the power companies teamed up with environmentalists to turn the warm waters near power planets into manatee refuges — saving manatee lives and the power companies money in the process. Now, there's a new conundrum: manatees that are hooked on fossil fuels.]]></description>

      <title>Hal Walker: The Man Who Shot The Moon</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In addition to flying, landing, and returning from the moon in 1969 — NASA's Apollo 11 crew helped with a series of scientific experiments. One of them was to leave a special instrument with lots of little reflectors on the surface of the moon. The goal of that experiment was to beam a laser at the moon. Today on the show, Scientist-In-Residence Regina G. Barber talks to host Aaron Scott about the lunar laser ranging experiment — and how shooting that laser helped us better understand one of Einstein's theories. <br/><br/>Follow Aaron on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronscottNPR?s=20&t=LZC5iZ-kLp3mGuhgDIdYbA">@AaronScottNPR</a> and Regina <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceRegina?s=20&t=LZC5iZ-kLp3mGuhgDIdYbA">@ScienceRegina</a>.

      <title>Can Nuclear Power Save A Struggling Coal Town?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A struggling Wyoming coal town may soon go nuclear with help from an unlikely partner, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. NPR Correspondent Kirk Siegler takes us to Kemmerer, Wyo., where Gates' power company, supported by public funds, plans to open a new type of nuclear energy plant in hopes of replacing a closing coal plant. The model facility would create jobs and provide the flexible baseline energy needed to back up solar, wind and other renewables. But is it a good fit for rural Kemmerer? ]]></description>

      <title>What Mount Kilimanjaro Has To Do With The Search For Alien Life</title>

      <description><![CDATA[In the 1950's, a particle physicist made a landmark discovery that changed what we thought we knew about how our universe operates. And Chien-Shiung Wu did it while raising a family and an ocean away from her relatives in China.

      <description><![CDATA[A few years ago, ecologist <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/professor/eclare/">Elizabeth Clare</a> had an idea--what if she could study rare or endangered animals in the wild without ever having to see or capture them?

That eventually led her to a career in marine science studying sharks and rays. But until relatively recently, she had never met another Black woman in her field. <br/><br/>That all changed in 2020 when she connected with a group of Black women studying sharks through the Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/CarleeMJ_/status/1267492308745945088">#BlackInNature</a>. Finding a community was so powerful that the women decided to start a group. <br/><br/>On today's show, Jasmin talks with host Maddie Sofia about Minorities in Shark Sciences (MISS) and how it's supporting women of color through hands-on workshops and community building.

      <title>How to Talk About Hair Like a Scientist </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Humans have scalp hair. But why is human scalp hair so varied? Biological anthropologist Tina Lasisi wanted to find out. And while completing her PhD at Penn State University, she developed a better system for describing hair — rooted in actual science.

      <description><![CDATA[Deep below our city streets lie intricate networks of underground piping built to carry away excess rainfall run off. These stormwater systems mostly go unnoticed until heavy rains overwhelm them, causing streets to flood.  Now, with rising rainfall averages in much of the nation, cities need to plan for more water. Guest host Dan Charles talks to climate correspondent Lauren Sommer about the challenges of such planning and why many cities aren't set up to handle the coming rains. ]]></description>

      <title>Should Big Oil Pick Up The Climate Change Bill?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals is deciding whether a Baltimore case against more than a dozen oil and gas companies will be heard in state or federal court. The city argues the companies are liable for the local costs of climate change. It wants the case heard in state court, which is governed by robust consumer protection laws.

      <title>Omicron Ebbing Gives Time to Boost Vaccinations</title>
      <description><![CDATA[As COVID-19 cases in the U.S. drop, the hospitalization rate remains high — as does the death rate. Experts say getting a COVID vaccine booster is key to maintaining immunity, but only about half of all vaccinated people in the U.S. have gotten the booster, which increases protection against both serious illness and death from the Omicron variant. Still, many infectious disease experts are cautiously optimistic for the coming months, pointing to it as a time to bolster our defenses against the virus. <br/><br/>Reach the show by emailing <a href="mailto:shortwave@npr.org">shortwave@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

      <title>Megadrought fuels debate over whether a flooded canyon should reemerge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the 1960s, the Bureau of Reclamation built a dam that flooded a celebrated canyon on the Utah-Arizona border. Today, it's known as Lake Powell — the second-largest reservoir in the U.S.<br/><br/>A half billion dollar tourism industry has grown in the desert around the reservoir but a decades-long megadrought is putting its future in question. <br/><br/>With what some call America's 'lost national park' reemerging, an old debate is also resurfacing: should we restore a beloved canyon or refill a popular and critical reservoir? Environmental and American West correspondent Nathan Rott brings this story to guest host Dan Charles. Read Nate's full story and see pictures by photojournalist Claire Harbage of their recent trip to Lake Powell <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/07/1067716380/western-megadrought-climate-lake-powell-glen-canyon-reservoir">here</a>.  <br/><br/>This episode was produced by Berly McCoy, edited by Stephanie O'Neill and fact checked by Katherine Sypher.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the 1960s, the Bureau of Reclamation built a dam that flooded a celebrated canyon on the Utah-Arizona border. Today, it's known as Lake Powell — the second-largest reservoir in the U.S.<br/><br/>A half billion dollar tourism industry has grown in the desert around the reservoir but a decades-long megadrought is putting its future in question. <br/><br/>With what some call America's 'lost national park' reemerging, an old debate is also resurfacing: should we restore a beloved canyon or refill a popular and critical reservoir? Environmental and American West correspondent Nathan Rott brings this story to guest host Dan Charles. Read Nate's full story and see pictures by photojournalist Claire Harbage of their recent trip to Lake Powell <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/07/1067716380/western-megadrought-climate-lake-powell-glen-canyon-reservoir">here</a>.  <br/><br/>This episode was produced by Berly McCoy, edited by Stephanie O'Neill and fact checked by Katherine Sypher.

      <title>The Debate About Pablo Escobar's Hippos</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Pablo Escobar had a private zoo at his estate in Colombia, with zebras, giraffes, flamingoes - and four hippopotamuses. After Escobar was killed in 1993, most of the animals were relocated except for the so-called "cocaine hippos." Authorities thought they would die but they did not and now, about a hundred roam near the estate. Conservationists are trying to control their population because they worry about the people and the environment. But some locals like the hippos and a few researchers say the animals should be left alone and are filling an ecological void. The controversy reflects growing debate in ecology about what an invasive species actually is.  <br/><br/><em>Contact Short Wave with your animal stories at shortwave@npr.org.</em>]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Pablo Escobar had a private zoo at his estate in Colombia, with zebras, giraffes, flamingoes - and four hippopotamuses. After Escobar was killed in 1993, most of the animals were relocated except for the so-called "cocaine hippos." Authorities thought they would die but they did not and now, about a hundred roam near the estate. Conservationists are trying to control their population because they worry about the people and the environment. But some locals like the hippos and a few researchers say the animals should be left alone and are filling an ecological void. The controversy reflects growing debate in ecology about what an invasive species actually is.  <br/><br/><em>Contact Short Wave with your animal stories at shortwave@npr.org.</em>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Our Favorite Things: Math And Community In The Classroom</title>
      <description><![CDATA[That's right — Day 2 of Short Wave's Favorite Episodes Week is pure math goodness! This encore episode, we revisit a conversation with mathematician Ranthony Edmonds. She reminds us that the idea of a lone genius scribbling away and solving complex equations is nothing more than a myth — one she actively tries to dispel in her classroom at The Ohio State University. Instead, Ranthony focuses on the community aspects of math: the support systems behind each mathematician and the benefits of a collaborative, inclusive environment for math innovation. <br/><br/>Think we should consider math more?

      <description><![CDATA[Gender is infused in many aspects of our world — but should that be the case?   <br/><br/>According to mathematician <a href="http://eugeniacheng.com/">Eugenia Cheng</a>, maybe not. In her new book, <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/eugenia-cheng/x-y/9781541646513/"><em>x+y</em></a>, she challenges readers to think beyond their ingrained conceptions of gender. Instead, she calls for a new dimension of thinking, characterizing behavior in a way completely removed from considerations of gender. <br/><br/>Cheng argues that at every level — from the interpersonal to the societal — we would benefit from focusing less on gender and more on equitable, inclusive interactions, regardless of a person's gender identity.   <br/><br/>You can reach the show by emailing <a href="mailto:shortwave@npr.org">shortwave@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Planning for a space mission to last more than 50 years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 1977, NASA sent out two Voyager probes to study Jupiter and Saturn. The spacecrafts were designed to last about five years, but they are still, to this day, collecting and sending back data from beyond the solar system.  But the Voyager mission is living on borrowed time. Today NPR science correspondent <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/4494969/nell-greenfieldboyce">Nell Greenfieldboyce</a> talks about a proposal for an intentionally long mission - what it would take for NASA to actually plan for an interstellar voyage that would pass research and responsibility down through generations.<br/><br/>What would you put on a spacecraft bound for the stars?

      <title>A new step toward ending 'the wrath of malaria'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Scientists have been trying to figure out how to eradicate malaria for decades. Globally, a child under the age of five dies from the disease every two minutes, and even for kids who do survive there can be long term complications. A big breakthrough finally came in October when the World Health Organization endorsed MoSQUIRIX, the first malaria vaccine. It has relatively low efficacy, just about 30%, but malaria researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/WinterOkoth">Winter Okoth</a> explains how the new vaccine could still make a big difference. ]]></description>

The remains are currently in the possession of the Smithsonian Institution, but for the past decade, the Seminole Tribe of Florida has been fighting to get some of them back to Florida to be buried.

      <title>An ode to the Pacific lamprey</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Pacific lamprey may have lived on Earth for about 450 million years. When humans came along, a deep relationship formed between Pacific lamprey and Native American tribes across the western United States. But in the last few decades, tribal elders noticed that pacific lamprey populations have plummeted, due in part to habitat loss and dams built along the Columbia River. So today, an introduction to Pacific lamprey: its unique biology, cultural legacy in the Pacific Northwest and the people who are fighting to save it. <br/><br/>To learn more about tribal-led efforts to restore the lamprey, read the <a href="https://www.critfc.org/fish-and-watersheds/columbia-river-fish-species/lamprey/lamprey-plan/">Tribal Pacific Lamprey Restoration Plan</a> and watch the documentary <a href="https://vimeo.com/116177956">The Lost Fish. </a>]]></description>

      <title>The Toll Of Burnout On Medical Workers — And Their Patients</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Burnout has long been a problem among health care workers. The pandemic has only made it worse. Some were hopeful COVID vaccines would provide some relief, but that hasn't been the case. Now, health care workers are leaving the industry — and they're taking their expertise with them. Plenty of surveys say that burnout hurts patient care.

      <title>SURPRISE! It's A...Babbling Baby Bat?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A paper <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/373/6557/923">published recently</a> in the journal <em>Science</em> finds similarities between the babbling of human infants and the babbling of the <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Saccopteryx_bilineata/">greater sac-winged bat </a>(<em>Saccopteryx bilineata</em>) — a small species of bat that lives in Central and South America.

      <title>Scientists Are Racing To Save Sequoias</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Based on early estimates, as many as 10,600 large sequoias were killed in last year's Castle Fire — up to 14% of the entire population. The world's largest trees are one of the most fire-adapted to wildfires on the planet. But climate change is making these fires more extreme than sequoias can handle. It's also worsening drought that is killing other conifer trees that then become a tinder box surrounding the sequoias, reports climate correspondent Lauren Sommer. Scientists warn that giant sequoias are running out of time and they're racing to save them. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/17/1037914390/giant-sequoia-national-park-wildfire-climate-change">Read more</a> of Lauren's reporting on sequoias: <a href="https://n.pr/39IX84M">https://n.pr/39IX84M</a><br/>]]></description>

The world's largest trees are one of the most fire-adapted to wildfires on the planet. But climate change is making these fires more extreme than sequoias can handle. It's also worsening drought that is killing other conifer trees that then become a tinder box surrounding the sequoias, reports climate correspondent Lauren Sommer. Scientists warn that giant sequoias are running out of time and they're racing to save them. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/17/1037914390/giant-sequoia-national-park-wildfire-climate-change">Read more</a> of Lauren's reporting on sequoias: <a href="https://n.pr/39IX84M">https://n.pr/39IX84M</a><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[California is in the middle of a terrible drought. The rivers are running low, and most of its farmers are getting very little water this year from the state's reservoirs and canals.

NPR climate reporter Rebecca Hersher explains. <br/><br/><em>Check out</em><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1004347023/why-fema-aid-is-unavailable-to-many-who-need-it-the-most"><em> Rebecca's full investigation here</em></a><em>. </em>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Lessons Learned From Hindered Contact Tracing Efforts In The U.S.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Early in the pandemic, contact tracing was viewed as one of the best options to quell the spread of coronavirus infections. The idea was to have public health workers track down people who tested positive, figure out whom they'd been in touch with and quickly get those people to quarantine. Places like Hong Kong and Singapore made headlines for their success stories. The U.S. aimed to replicate this, but came up short.

      <title>'Where We Come From': Emily Kwong's Story</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Nearly 1 billion people speak Mandarin Chinese. But Short Wave host Emily Kwong is not among them. As a third generation Chinese American, Emily's heritage language was lost through the years when her father, Christopher Kwong, stopped speaking the language at a young age in order to adjust to life in the U.S. Now, at age 30, Emily's trying to reclaim Chinese by attending virtual Mandarin classes for the first time. In conversation with her father, Emily explores how being 'Chinese enough' gets tied up in language fluency, and how language is a bridge that can be broken and rebuilt between generations — as an act of love and reclamation. <br/><br/>Check out more of the Where We Come From series <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/01/996412589/where-we-come-from">here</a>.]]></description>

It's one of the best-studied migrations and in recent years, ecologists like Sonia Altizer have been able to better answer how and why these intrepid butterflies make the journey. Short Wave brings this episode from the TED Radio Hour's episode with <a href="https://www.ecology.uga.edu/directory/sonia-altizer/">Sonia Altizer</a>,  with the University of Georgia.  ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Mud and dirt have often been treated as waste products from excavation or dredging sites. But these days, coastal communities need massive amounts of mud and dirt to protect their shorelines from rising seas. This is leading to a dirt shortage, where the demand for it is higher than supply.

      <title>Pediatricians Work To Persuade Parents And Teens To Get COVID-19 Vaccine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Some colleges and universities have announced that COVID vaccination will be mandatory (with some exemptions) and the FDA has authorized the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 12 to 15. While coronavirus infections are declining in the United States, vaccination rates also appear to be slowing down, so pediatricians and public health officials say they're trying to spread the word to overcome hesitancy, and get the vaccine out to people where they go to school and shop. Emily talks with NPR health correspondent Allison Aubrey about this and other topics in the pandemic news. <br/><br/>If you'd like to assistant on finding a vaccination site, you can dial 1-800-232-0233 or go to <a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/">vaccines.gov (English)</a> or <a href="https://www.vacunas.gov/">vacunas.gov (Spanish)</a> for more information.  <br/><br/>Have questions about the latest coronavirus headlines?

      <title>Smell Therapy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A curious symptom of COVID-19 that can stick with patients for a long time is loss of smell. Researchers don't know exactly how prevalent the loss of smell ism and while most people recover from it, some will not. This has given new life to a very specific treatment: smell training. Emily Kwong talks to the Atlantic's science reporter Sarah Zhang about how practicing how to smell might help those who've lost their sense of smell. <br/><br/>For more on smell training, read <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/covid-19-smell-recovery-its-own-strange-experience/618357/">Sarah's piece in The Atlantic</a>. <br/><br/>You can email Short Wave at <a href="mailto:shortwave@npr.org">ShortWave@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

According to <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons">The Marshall Project</a>, in the last year, over 380,000 prisoners tested positive for the coronavirus.

The close quarters make social distancing nearly impossible, leaving the incarcerated population vulnerable. <br/><br/>Josiah Bates, staff writer at TIME, reflects on how the pandemic has played out behind bars — in both jails and prisons.

      <title>How COVID-19 Affects The Brain</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Many patients who are hospitalized for COVID-19 continue to have symptoms of brain injury after they are discharged. For many, brain function improves as they recover, but some are likely to face long-term disability. As NPR science correspondent <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2100615/jon-hamilton">Jon Hamilton</a> explains, research into all the ways the coronavirus affects the brain is ongoing but research shows it can affect everything from loss of smell to memory problems.

      <title>Should Black People Get Race Adjustments In Kidney Medicine?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[As the U.S. continues to grapple with systemic racism, some in the medical community are questioning whether the diagnostic tools they use may be contributing to racial health disparities.<br/><br/>As <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/348777820/maria-godoy">NPR science correspondent Maria Godoy</a> reports, that debate is playing out prominently in the world of kidney medicine — specifically, in the use of estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR.

      <title>Chang'e-5: To The Moon And Back</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It's been more than 40 years since rocks from the moon have come back to Earth. But in late November, a Chinese craft landed on the moon's surface--it's the country's first mission designed to retrieve samples of the moon's surface. The mission is called Chang'e-5, in honor of the moon goddess. NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel tells us what the mission will tell us about the solar system, and how it foreshadows China's future ambitions on Earth and in space.   <br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:shortwave@npr.org">shortwave@npr.org</a>.  ]]></description>

      <title>The Long Legacy Of The Arecibo Telescope</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The National Science Foundation recently announced it plans to decommission the Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico.

      <title>Trump Administration Lifts Protections For Largest National Forest In US</title>

      <title>The CDC Doesn't Know Enough About Coronavirus In Tribal Nations</title>

      <title>Sepsis Is A Global Killer. Can Vitamin C Be The Cure?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Every day, approximately 30,000 people die globally of sepsis. The condition comes about when your immune system overreacts to an infection, leading potentially to organ failure and death. There is no cure. But then in 2017, a doctor proposed a novel treatment for sepsis, a mixture that included Vitamin C, arguing it saved the lives of most of his patients. NPR's Richard Harris has been reporting on this treatment and how it's divided scientists from around the world.

      <title>The Surprising Origin Of Some Timely Advice: Wash Your Hands</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Today we know that one of the easiest and most effective things you can do to protect yourself from the cold, flu, and other respiratory illnesses (including those like the novel coronavirus) is to wash your hands. But there was a time when that wasn't so obvious.

      <title>Can A Low-Carb Diet Prevent A Plague Of Locusts? </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Swarms of locusts can destroy crops and livelihoods. Right now, countries in East Africa are dealing with the threat.

The answer, NPR's Joe Palca tells us, might be looking at what locusts like, and don't like, to eat. Follow host Maddie Sofia on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/maddie_sofia">@maddie_sofia</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Swarms of locusts can destroy crops and livelihoods. Right now, countries in East Africa are dealing with the threat. At a lab in Tempe, Arizona, researchers are trying to figure out how to minimize the crop damage these voracious pests can cause. The answer, NPR's Joe Palca tells us, might be looking at what locusts like, and don't like, to eat. Follow host Maddie Sofia on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/maddie_sofia">@maddie_sofia</a>.

      <description><![CDATA[In 2015, Steffanie Strathdee's husband nearly died from a superbug, an antibiotic resistant bacteria he contracted in Egypt. Desperate to save him, she reached out to the scientific community for help. What she got back? A 100-year-old treatment that's considered experimental in the U.S. Strathdee, an infectious disease epidemiologist, tells us how it works, its limitations, and its potential role in our fight against superbugs.

      <title>The Evolution Of HIV Treatment</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A lot has changed since the first cases of AIDS were reported in 1981. Globally, AIDS-related deaths have dropped by more than 55% since 2004, the deadliest year on record. But, the road to effective treatment for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was long.

      <description><![CDATA[While doing field work in Central America in the 1990's, biologist Karen Lips noticed the frogs she was studying were disappearing. Scientists in other parts of the world had documented the same thing - frogs and amphibians dying at an alarming rate. For years no one knew what was killing the animals until, finally, a bit of good luck helped solve the mystery.

To get some insight into crows and perhaps set the record straight, we talked to Kaeli Swift.
