    <title>The Beautiful Liar</title>
    <link>https://qcodemedia.com</link>

    <copyright>QCODE Media, 2021</copyright>
    <description>An unlikely super-hero origin story, The Beautiful Liar, is an original scripted series imagined by the band the X Ambassadors. When a blind teenager named Clementine (Rory Anne Dahl) suddenly loses her father, her world is completely upended — powers she didn’t know she had start to manifest and take the form of her secret friend, Shadow (Emily Hampshire, Schitt’s Creek). Moving to a new school, she struggles to hide her abilities from her friends - and band mates - as they ﬁght to make the town a better place. Little does she know, her powers have triggered the attention of The Institute, a sinister organization who will stop at nothing to have her in their grasp.
~~
This heartwarming coming of age story is a companion narrative podcast to the X Ambassadors’ new album of the same name, The Beautiful Liar. Brothers and bandmates Sam and Casey Harris, grew up listening to audio dramas together since Casey has been blind since birth. Besides music, it was the only form of entertainment that the two could enjoy together. With a deeply personal motivation, Sam set out to create something in this inclusive and immersive medium.
~~
The Beautiful Liar premieres on 11/3 on Amazon Music ad-free with new episodes dropping every Wednesday. And, it will launch widely, wherever you get your podcasts, on 11/17.
~~
Produced by QCODE in association with Interscope Films. Created by Sam Nelson Harris and Minnie Schedeen. Starring Sam Nelson Harris and Emily Hampshire. Written by Cailin Lowry and Minnie Schedeen. Directed by Stefanie Able Horowitz. To learn more visit: qcodemedia.com</description>

      <title>Introducing: Bloodthirsty Hearts - A Supernatural Comedy Adventure Out Now!</title>
      <link>https://qcodemedia.com/bloodthirsty-hearts</link>
      <description>Friends growing apart happens, but creatures crashing a fantasy convention… not so much. 
Five high schoolers bonded over the Bloodthirsty Hearts novel series turned slightly-erotic movie franchise as kids, and now it’s what brings them back together for the first-ever fan convention. However, what starts as fun and games quickly turns into a fight-for-your-life event as creatures from the same universe invade. Will the childhood friends be able to work past their differences and survive the night? Perhaps their shared obsession will prove to be useful after all…
~~

      <title>Introducing: The Beautiful Liar</title>
      <link>https://qcodemedia.com/</link>
      <description>The Beautiful Liar premieres on 11/3 on Amazon Music ad-free with new episodes dropping every Wednesday. And, it will launch widely, wherever you listen your podcasts, on 11/17.
~~
An unlikely super-hero origin story, The Beautiful Liar, is an original scripted series imagined by the band the X Ambassadors. When a blind teenager named Clementine (Rory Anne Dahl) suddenly loses her father, her world is completely upended — powers she didn’t know she had start to manifest and take the form of her secret friend, Shadow (Emily Hampshire, Schitt’s Creek). Moving to a new school, she struggles to hide her abilities from her friends - and band mates - as they ﬁght to make the town a better place. Little does she know, her powers have triggered the attention of The Institute, a sinister organization who will stop at nothing to have her in their grasp.
~~
This heartwarming coming of age story is a companion narrative podcast to the X Ambassadors’ new album of the same name, The Beautiful Liar. Brothers and bandmates Sam and Casey Harris, grew up listening to audio dramas together since Casey has been blind since birth. Besides music, it was the only form of entertainment that the two could enjoy together. With a deeply personal motivation, Sam set out to create something in this inclusive and immersive medium.
~~
Produced by QCODE in association with Interscope Films. Created by Sam Nelson Harris and Minnie Schedeen. Starring Sam Nelson Harris and Emily Hampshire. Written by Cailin Lowry and Minnie Schedeen. Directed by Stefanie Able Horowitz.
