      <title>Daily Wire Backstage: Premiere of “What is a Woman?”</title>
      <description>Is having a penis all that it really takes to be a modern woman?

Are we ever going to be able to answer life’s most difficult question: What is a woman?

      <title>Daily Wire Backstage: The Mask Is Off</title>
      <description>Can Biden’s daily regimen of Gatorade, PB&amp;J’s, and Flintstone Vitamins really keep him in the tip top cognitive shape we’ve come to expect? Is there a certain number of rockets fired by Hamas at Israeli civilians that would convince the Left they’re on the “wrong side of history?” Because clearly, 3500 isn’t it. And when the UFOs playing peek-a-boo with our military do finally land, will John Cena apologize to our alien overlords for Hollywood’s shame that is The Last Jedi, Battlefield Earth, and Howard The Duck? Let’s hope he does the right thing. 
Join this roundtable discussion featuring Ben Shapiro, Andrew Klavan, Matt Walsh, Michael Knowles, and Daily Wire god-king Jeremy Boreing to find out!

      <title>Backstage Premiere: RUN HIDE FIGHT</title>
      <description>Join Ben Shapiro, Jeremy Boreing, and the rest of the Backstage crew and special guests as Daily Wire makes its entrance into entertainment content with its first feature film, RUN HIDE FIGHT.

Starring Isabel May, Thomas Jane, Radha Mitchell, RUN HIDE FIGHT follows a high school sieged by a quartet of school shooters. Zoe Hull (Isabel May) is a high school student coping with the recent loss of her mother. All she wants is to get through the last few weeks of her senior year and leave — off to college and a fresh start. Instead, her high school is attacked by four nihilistic, gun-toting students, who plan to make their siege the worst school shooting in history. Using her wits and survival skills, Zoe fights back to save herself and her fellow students. 

AUDIENCE WARNING: This video is rated TV-MA for violence, language, and nudity and is intended only for mature audiences.

RUN HIDE FIGHT will be available for streaming on Dailywire.com after our live stream premiere — exclusively for Daily Wire members.

Join this roundtable discussion featuring Ben Shapiro, Andrew Klavan, Michael Knowles, and Daily Wire god-king Jeremy Boreing, as they get to the bottom of these questions and more.

      <title>Daily Wire Backstage: Jeremy Said This Debate Wouldn’t Happen Edition</title>
      <description>Will this showdown be the cakewalk for Trump that many predict? Did Biden use the vast amount of time he’s spent avoiding the press to actually debate prep or was he just napping? Do Trump’s tax returns or Hunter Biden’s shady Russian dealings have any real effect on persuading voters? Is there any chance Joe will show up to all three debates?

Join this roundtable discussion featuring Ben Shapiro, Andrew Klavan, Michael Knowles, and Daily Wire god-king Jeremy Boreing, as they get to the bottom of these questions and more.

      <title>Ep. 554 - Race Riots Cure Coronavirus</title>
      <description>Race riots, looting, and arson overtook cities from coast to coast this weekend spreading misery and chaos in their wake. But on the bright side, since no one cares about social distancing anymore, the unrest seems to have cured coronavirus! Then, the mainstream media recast Black Lives Matter and Antifa anarchists as “white supremacists,” which put white liberals in a tough spot as they were all raising money to bail the alleged white supremacists out of jail.

      <title>Ep. 553 - Big Tech Goes Too Far</title>
      <description>President Trump promises to reign in the power of Big Tech after Twitter makes unprecedented moves to interfere in the presidential election. Then, speaking of power grabs, our de facto president Dr. Fauci seems to be appointing himself pope as well by telling churches to stop giving out Holy Communion. Jimmy Fallon apologizes for a joke he told 20 years ago, Planned Parenthood gets caught lying about their baby body part business under oath, and finally the Mailbag.

      <title>Ep. 552 - When Karen Met Karen</title>
      <description>Two weirdos had a viral meltdown in Central Park, and now one of their lives is ruined. Then, for the first time ever, Twitter “fact-checks” President Trump on voter fraud, and for the seven-zillionth time, what Trump said turns out to be true, and the “fact-check” turns out to be a lie. The mainstream media get caught in more coronavirus hypocrisy, and in Washington State gunshot victims get added to the COVID death toll.

      <title>Ep. 551 - Racists, Rapists, and Murderers</title>
      <description>Joe Biden informs 40 million black Americans that, if they support our President, they “ain’t black.” Is Joe Biden a racist? Is Joe Biden a rapist? Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar says she believes the woman accusing Biden of sexual assault. But she’s going to vote for Biden anyway. And President Trump accuses MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough of murdering a staffer. Some heavy stuff to start the week!

      <title>Ep. 550 - The Democrats’ Faucian Bargain</title>
      <description>The case for coronavirus hysteria collapses even further as the CDC changes its guidelines and admits that the virus does not spread easily if at all through contaminated surfaces. In other words, the masks and gloves are basically useless. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis takes a victory lap, the alarmist mayor of Atlanta makes excuses, and MSNBC’s Mika Scarborough has an on-air meltdown. Then, leaked audio surfaces of Joe Biden discussing with former Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko the decision to fire the prosecutor looking into Joe’s son in exchange for a billion dollar loan guarantee. And that’s just the beginning of Joe’s troubles. Finally the Mailbag.

Republican Governor Ron DeSantis takes a victory lap, the alarmist mayor of Atlanta makes excuses, and MSNBC’s Mika Scarborough has an on-air meltdown. Then, leaked audio surfaces of Joe Biden discussing with former Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko the decision to fire the prosecutor looking into Joe’s son in exchange for a billion dollar loan guarantee. And that’s just the beginning of Joe’s troubles.

      <title>Ep. 549 - Too Few Problems</title>
      <description>Hospitals are empty, homeless shelters are empty, coronavirus cases aren’t spiking. Great news, right? Not according to the mainstream news media, which is hard at work inventing fake problems to frighten us. Then, the high school science experiment that locked down the world, Joe Biden’s new nickname for President Trump—spoiler alert: it’s super lame—and an explosive new allegation that Norma McCorvey, the pro-abortion plaintiff in Roe vs. Wade, faked her pro-life Christian conversion.

      <title>Ep. 548 - Calling Their Bluff</title>
      <description>As pro-lockdown leftists get shriller in their calls to lock everyone at home, from coast to coast everyone from cops to judges to ordinary people are wising up to the simplest way to stop them: call their bluff. Just weeks after premising his own lockdown order on saving just one life, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is promising that lots of grannies are going to die. What a difference two months and lots of failed policies makes. And the gaslighting #MeToo movement is now pretending they never told us to believe all women. (Do they think we don’t have Google?)

      <title>Ep. 547 - Taking The Red Pill</title>
      <description>Furious at crazy left-wing covid policies, Elon Musk takes the so-called “red pill,” prompting right-wingers to claim the Tesla boss as a conservative and left-wingers to call him a Nazi. (They think everybody’s a Nazi.) Speaking of which, a left-wing Harvard professor praises Nazi education policy, the American Civil Liberties Union comes out swinging against civil liberties, and the mainstream media get caught with their masks down. Red pills for everybody.

      <title>Ep. 546 - The Mask Slips</title>
      <description>The unmasking of Mike Flynn in the last days of the Obama administration is the most egregious political scandal of our lifetimes, and we’ve just learned it goes all the way up to Joe Biden. Maybe even higher. Meanwhile, the new masking order in LA caps off the most arbitrary political power grab in our lifetimes. Luckily President Trump is starting to break with his expert doctor dictators. Then, another rough interview for Joe Biden, a big Republican win in California, and finally the Mailbag!

      <description>Science and Data are dead. And we have killed them. What was holiest and mightiest of all that secular modernity has yet owned have bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? The unelected fake doctor dictator who now apparently runs LA County has extended the lockdown order by three months, even as cases and deaths in southern California remain low, all in the name of “science and data.” Then, a drag queen raises six figures for abortionists on middle America’s favorite game show. Something has clearly gone wrong in the culture. And the woman campaigning for Vice President finally endorses the guy she’s asking to pick her.

      <title>Ep. 544 - The European Virus</title>
      <description>New York governor Andrew Cuomo is blaming Europe for the coronavirus even as evidence mounts that China knew about the virus, covered it up, destroyed the world economy, and killed lots of people. But American leftists keep defending the Chinese Communist Party because no less than their whole political program rides on it. Then, a New York Times writer wants you to pay her for raising her own children, a judge issues a major ruling on transgenderism before the case even begins, and Slate Magazine comes up with a new term for monogamy.

      <title>Ep. 543 - Don’t Let Them Distract You</title>
      <description>A killing in Georgia has Americans at each other’s throats on race, guns, and criminal justice. But while the Left gins up a fake race narrative and riles everyone up over a very sad local story, a major national political scandal implicating the highest levels of the Obama administration goes uncovered. How convenient. Then, CBS gets caught lying about coronavirus, NBC gets caught lying about Attorney General Barr, and a reopened Georgia disproves the COVID prophets of doom and gloom.

      <itunes:summary>A killing in Georgia has Americans at each other’s throats on race, guns, and criminal justice. But while the Left gins up a fake race narrative and riles everyone up over a very sad local story, a major national political scandal implicating the highest levels of the Obama administration goes uncovered. How convenient. Then, CBS gets caught lying about coronavirus, NBC gets caught lying about Attorney General Barr, and a reopened Georgia disproves the COVID prophets of doom and gloom.

      <title>Ep. 542 - Shell Game Shutdown</title>
      <description>While everyone is distracted with the latest drama about masks and meat shortages, lots of strange stuff is going on out of the political spotlight. From Obama era coverups to environmental overhauls, the shutdowns are starting to feel like a shell game. Then, the remaining half dozen #NeverTrumpers remind us why we got rid of them in the first place, and finally the Mailbag!

      <title>Ep. 541 - The Scientist Has No Clothes</title>
      <description>The scientist whose disproven doomsday model destroyed the global economy has resigned from his position after it came out that he broke his own lockdown order to sleep with his married mistress. Why should we be expected to listen to scientists when they don’t even listen to themselves? Chris Cuomo goes on an unhinged rant, a salon owner in Texas tells a power-hungry judge to pound sand, and President Trump vows revenge on China.

      <title>Ep. 540 - Court Jester Conservatism</title>
      <description>In an interview conducted in front of the Lincoln Memorial, President Trump claims he’s the most persecuted president in history, including Honest Abe. While everyone on the Left and Right mock the wild claim, few are picking up on the keen piece of political wisdom in Trump’s statement. Then, Michigan dictatrix Gretchen Whitmer calls her conservative constituents Nazis, the New York Times wins a Pulitzer for rewriting American history, and the federal government predicts more deaths from coronavirus.

      <description>As American Psycho Gavin Newsom locked down his political opponents’ beaches in one of the few conservative counties in California, your humble correspondent broke the law to lounge in the sun. The lockdown authoritarians don’t have any arguments anymore to defend their draconian policies, but that isn’t the point: the cruelty is the point. Then, Joe Biden blows it when addressing sexual assault allegations against him, but it won’t matter. Feminism dies with a tweet. And Hollywood tries to rewrite the history of the most important woman in the history of the conservative movement.

      <title>Ep. 538 - All News Is Fake</title>
      <description>The FBI destroyed former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s life for political purposes, according to new documents that have been released years after the fact. And for some reason, the mainstream media that colluded with the bureaucrats to trash the General don’t want to run the story. Yahoo News spreads lies straight to the President’s face, which is unwise when you’re dealing with Donald Trump, and even that story about the poor, confused lady who was convinced by Trump to feed her husband fish tank cleaner to stop the coronavirus turns out to be shady, all of which brings up an important political reality: all news is fake. Some of it’s true, but all of it’s fake. Then, power-mad politicians get crueler and crueler with no end in sight, and finally the Mailbag.

      <title>Ep. 536 - Lockdown vs. Liberty</title>
      <description>As more and more people around the country get arrested for leaving their homes, as we approach the 45th day since President Trump told us to hunker down for “15 days to slow the spread,” some people are beginning to wonder if these lockdowns are destroying our liberty. Unfortunately, our liberty problems run a lot deeper than being locked in your house for a few weeks, and both sides of the aisle are to blame. Then, more evidence emerges that Joe Biden got handsy with a staffer in the ‘90s as the mainstream media steadfastly and courageously refuse to ask him about it, the government confirms the existence of UFOs, and Nancy Pelosi wants to bribe you with your own money.

      <title>Ep. 535 - Sanitizing The Narrative</title>
      <description>President Trump appears to proclaim the virtues of shooting Lysol straight into your veins to stop coronavirus. But while the mainstream media criticize him for it, they do the best they can to sanitize their own narrative on everything from travel bans to workplace sexual assault. Then, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden compete to see which would-be world leader can seem the least lively, CNN humiliates itself, and crime spikes in locked-down New York.

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://bit.ly/2z2j1NB. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <title>Ep. 534 - Andrew Cuomo: Moral Idiot</title>
      <description>The UN is predicting 130 million people around the world might die, not because of coronavirus, but because of the economic shutdowns associated with coronavirus. Is it still all worth it to save just one life, Governor Cuomo? The new numbers expose a fundamental moral error on the Left that’s been around a lot longer than coronavirus. Then, failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams begins to openly campaign to be Joe Biden’s running mate, Alec Baldwin inadvertently reveals some spiritual truths about quarantine, and finally the Mailbag!

      <title>Ep. 533 - Lock Down The Border</title>
      <description>For over a month the Left has insisted we lock down our country. Towns, cities, even whole states have ordered citizens to stay locked in their homes. But now that President Trump is applying that logic to the national level by locking down our borders, the Left is up in arms. Foreign nationals can hop our fences and enter the country by the millions, but you can’t take a simple walk around the neighborhood. Doesn’t seem very fair. Then, CNN’s Chris Cuomo stages some Broadway caliber fake news before getting caught in the obvious lie, New York’s Mayor de Blasio calls for a ticker tape pandemic parade, and an Earth Day co-founder murders his girlfriend.

      <title>Ep. 532 - Experts Are Always Wrong</title>
      <description>Even left-wing mayors are beginning to admit the experts got it wrong. Way more people have the virus than they thought, way fewer people are dying from it, and the lockdowns likely aren’t doing very much to stop it. Then, the price of oil plummets to negative $40, cancel culture claims another scalp, and Kim Jong-Un might be braindead. All that and more: I’m MK, and this is the MK Show!

      <title>Ep. 531 - Liberate America</title>
      <description>Thousands take to the streets around the country to protest draconian lockdowns. The liberals and the squishes are furious, but President Trump is cheering them on. And believe it or not, the anti-lockdown protesters are getting some encouragement from one of the world’s leading public health experts. Then, Congressman Dan Crenshaw destroys Bill Maher’s anti-Trump talking points, Harvard tries to ban homeschooling, and Brian Stelter cries.

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://bit.ly/2z2j1NB. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <title>Ep. 530 - Money Printer Go Brrr</title>
      <description>The Trump bucks are here! Coronavirus stimulus checks hit people’s bank accounts yesterday, giving much-needed relief to millions of Americans, and the mainstream media are furious about it. But are left-wing journalists angry about the policy, or are they just upset that President Trump is getting all the credit? Then, liberal governors give us even more evidence that the coronavirus pandemic is politically a thing of the past, the government power grab leaves victims dead in its wake, and, speaking of criminals, a new report alleges that Jussie Smollett had sex with his attacker, which is particularly awkward since Jussie Smollett attacked himself. We’ll take a broad look at love in the time of self-isolation.

      <title>Ep. 529 - The Backlash Has Begun</title>
      <description>A new study shows Americans are worried. But they’re not worried primarily about the coronavirus. They’re worried about something that poses a far more imminent risk to their lives and livelihoods. As the backlash against our national lockdowns begins to brew, the response from mayors and governors separates the politician wheat from the politician chaff. Then, Joe Biden gets a major endorsement now that there’s no other choice. And the New York Times goes into full damage control mode to cover for grab-happy Joe Biden.

      <title>Ep. 528 - Flatten The Narrative</title>
      <description>Now that the United States has flattened the curve, President Trump is flattening the narrative at a White House briefing that not only brutalized the press but also prepared the way for a reopening. We will examine the grand strategy behind owning the libs. Then, a new study out of Israel suggests the global economic shutdown was completely pointless, Bernie Sanders endorses Joe Biden, and Joe’s lead in the polls evaporates.

      <description>As the coronavirus doomsday models fall apart, the alarmists who pushed them are doubling down of their draconian policies. We will examine the value of civil disobedience when power-hungry hypocrites get exposed and lash out. Then, the former Biden staffer accusing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee of sexual assault files a formal police complaint, and the mainstream media goes into full coverup mode to protect Joe. And finally, we take a look at the glaring logical fallacy at the heart of the Left’s favorite coronavirus narrative.

      <description>The Revolution comes to an end as Bernie Sanders drops out of the race. Or has he? We will examine the strange and unconvincing way Bernie suspended his presidential campaign and try to figure out whether or not there’s a future for the Sandernistas. Then, President Trump smacks down the World Health Organization and China—but I repeat myself—and finally the Mailbag!

      <title>Ep. 523 - Hindsight Is 2020</title>
      <description>Over the past few days, evidence is emerging that coronavirus models may have overestimated the pandemic. Even hard-hit areas like Italy and New York may be turning the corner earlier than projected. There is light at the end of the tunnel, and a whole lot of people will have a whole lot of explaining to do as to why we just destroyed the global economy. We will examine the value of hindsight and how shoulda-coulda-woulda will affect the 2020 election. Then, despite months of mainstream media insistence that the Wuhan virus has nothing to do with the shadowy Wuhan Institute of Virology, news reports suggest a link between the two. We will take a look at the latest and how a conspiratorial press has abused the term “conspiracy theory.”

      <description>Rents are due, but no one is working. And that’s just one of the practical challenges that comes with shutting down the global economy. Fortunately, socialist congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has the solution—if you can figure out what she’s saying. Then speaking of not speaking well, Joe Biden proposes postponing the Democratic National Convention despite widespread fears that time is not exactly on Joe’s side. We will examine what the move would mean for the Democratic Party.

      <title>Ep. 521 - The Criminal Injustice Of Coronavirus</title>
      <description>While police departments around the country are springing child rapists from the slammer, law enforcement is turning a decidedly less lenient eye on another group of miscreants: Christian pastors. We will examine why preachers are getting arrested while the criminals run free. Then, everyone from politicians to grocery store workers are jumping to take advantage of this pandemic. We’ll take a look at ethics in times of plague. Finally, Joe Biden—remember him?—launches a podcast, and much like the entire mainstream media, he refuses to mention the #MeToo allegation against him.

      <title>Ep. 520 - Stop The Spread (Of Fake News)</title>
      <description>The United States has slowed the spread of coronavirus, but there’s one scourge whose vitality is only increasing: fake news. We will examine the most egregious examples of how the left-wing media lies to add panic to the pandemic. Then, in an effort to combat Covid, a Democratic mayor politely asks criminals to chill, and a New York jail releases a bunch of child molesters. Meanwhile, prosperity preachers command the virus to go away, and President Trump rains fire and brimstone down on Jim Acosta during his latest ratings-busting press briefing.

In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <itunes:summary>The United States has slowed the spread of coronavirus, but there’s one scourge whose vitality is only increasing: fake news. We will examine the most egregious examples of how the left-wing media lies to add panic to the pandemic. Then, in an effort to combat Covid, a Democratic mayor politely asks criminals to chill, and a New York jail releases a bunch of child molesters. Meanwhile, prosperity preachers command the virus to go away, and President Trump rains fire and brimstone down on Jim Acosta during his latest ratings-busting press briefing.

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <title>Ep. 519 - The Catch-22 Of COVID-19</title>
      <description>Five days after President Trump said he hopes the country will reopen again by Easter, the President changed course and announced an extension of federal lockdown guidelines through the end of April. We will examine the Catch-22 of COVID-19. Then, the World Health Organization continues to bungle coronavirus but never fails to parrot China Communist Party propaganda. We will take a look at the WHO and why it needs to go. And finally, New York Mayor Bill De Blasio threatens to shut down churches and synagogues permanently if they have the audacity to hold services during the pandemic.

      <description>House and Senate Democrats torpedo a bipartisan coronavirus relief bill, raising an important question: if elected Democrats aren’t taking the pandemic seriously, why should we? We will examine the political shenanigans and the light at the end of the economic tunnel. Then, the mainstream media spread a story of a man dying from the drug touted by President Trump as a possible cure for coronavirus. The only problem with their story is it’s completely false.

      <title>Ep. 515 - The Dictatorship Of The Experts</title>
      <description>Nearly 700,000 people filed for unemployment last week—more unemployment claims than we saw at the peak of the 2009 recession. We will examine the promising signs for a cure to coronavirus and, perhaps more importantly, the promising signs that President Trump is ready to free us from the dictatorship of public health “experts.” Then, mainstream journalists humiliate themselves because today is a day ending in “y,” and the New York City government publishes a helpful guide on how to have sanitary group sodomy during the pandemic.

      <title>Ep. 514 - The Green Flu Deal</title>
      <description>The market continues to plummet as the Chinese coronavirus locks people idle in their homes for weeks at a time and the global economy grinds to a halt. We will compare the pandemic to the left-wing policy agenda and see if we can tell the difference. Then, a new study suggests the spread of the virus could have been reduced by as much as 95% if the Chinese government had acted to stop it rather than to cover it up. Of course, instead of reporting on that study, the U.S. mainstream media parrot’s the communist regime’s propaganda.

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <title>Ep. 513 - Never Let A Crisis Go To Waste</title>
      <description>As the U.S. death toll from the WuFlu hits 100, some experts are wondering whether grinding the global economy to a halt might have been something of an overreaction. We examine the scientific data and the philosophical reasons why the Left never lets a crisis go to waste. Then, President Trump officially secures the Republican nomination for president, and Joe Biden is set to sail to his own party’s nomination if he can only remember who and where he is.

      <title>Ep. 512 - Coronavirus vs. the Constitution</title>
      <description>Major U.S. cities shut down to stop the spread of the WuFlu. But as we rush to save our lives, is coronavirus killing our Constitution? We will examine the surprising civics lessons of this pandemic. Then, former future Democrat Governor of Florida and potential VP candidate Andrew Gillum is found vomiting in a hotel room with a naked male prostitute and a bunch of meth. We will analyze, as it were, how the press let him off the hook. Finally, DNC chairman Tom Perez illustrates the Left’s two contradictory takes on religion.

      <description>As neurotics on the Left and even on the Right suffer a nervous breakdown and hoard warehouses full of toilet paper, the Trump administration implements policies that will actually help stop the spread of the Wubonic plague. We will examine why hysterics don’t help during a pandemic. Then, Joe Biden confuses every major disease of the past decade while duking it out with Bernie Sanders, Ronald Reagan’s son proselytizes for atheism during the debate, and the Left takes advantage of the global panic.

      <title>Ep. 508 - Sick But Not Tired Of Winning</title>
      <description>Democrats in six states head to the primaries today, and polling shows Biden might blow Bernie out of the water within a matter of hours. We will examine the latest data on Joe’s chances in November. Then, pundits on all sides attack the President for his response to the Flu Manchu outbreak. But a very important group than the chattering class thinks President Trump is doing just fine.

We will examine the facts as well as other funny names for the public health crisis. Then, Kamala Harris endorses a man she considers a vile racist, Hillary Clinton refuses to endorse anybody, and MSNBC’s Brian Williams teams up with New York Times editorial board members Mara Gay to fail at basic arithmetic.

      <title>Ep. 503 - Who Bought Pete Buttigieg?</title>
      <description>After a weak showing in Nevada and a total flop in South Carolina, smarmy radical and alleged rat Pete Buttigieg is dropping out of the presidential race, vindicating President Trump’s prophesy that Alfred E. Neuman cannot be president of the United States. We will examine who bought off Mayor Pete. Then, Bloomberg finally makes it to a ballot as we look forward to Super Tuesday, a drag queen twerks for a toddler, and President Trump kills it at CPAC!

But the oppo file on the septuagenarian socialist is starting to leak, and a couple of Bernie’s erotic manifestos give us some insight on the Sanders campaign. We will examine the eternal connection between creepy sex and leftist politics. Then, CNN redefines newborn babies are “fetuses that are born,” and Bernie rebuffs the Obama era.

      <title>Ep. 499 - To Bern Or Not To Bern</title>
      <description>As Bernie Sanders racks up victories all around the country, conservatives struggle with whether to root for the radical socialist so Trump can sweep all 57 states plus Greenland in November or whether it would be better to root for one of the also-rans on the off-chance Bernie could somehow win in November. We will examine the conservative case for Bernie. Then, Pete Buttigieg has a prepubescent boy “come out” as homosexual onstage at a campaign rally, AOC likes luxury for herself but not for anyone else, and so much more!

      <title>Ep. 497 - The Bully Pulpit</title>
      <description>The Left has long blamed President Trump for just about every political problem under the sun. They’ve blamed him for the sun itself and how much it’s heating our planet. That’s par for the course. But Trump Derangement Syndrome has now progressed to so advanced a stage that the American Left is blaming President Trump for schoolyard bullying. We will examine who the real bullies are and how they get away with it. Then, Postmodern Pete Buttigieg declares that words have no meaning, everyone comes out as queer, and President Trump pardons a couple of jailbirds.

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <description>Barack Obama claims credit for President Trump’s booming economy, Bernie Sanders loses his mic to topless vegans at a campaign rally, and Mike Bloomberg intends to win the presidency by telling Americans how stupid they are. Then, a Democratic Alabama legislator introduces a bill that would require men to get vasectomies. We will examine why I’m skipping Birmingham on this semester’s campus speaking tour.

      <description>Bernie comes out on top, Biden and Warren collapse, and Bloomberg lurks in the shadows waiting to buy the nomination. But the biggest winner of all in the New Hampshire presidential primaries was Donald Trump. Don’t take my word for it. We look past the top line numbers to the hidden lessons of last night’s vote. Then, Jussie Smollett’s attacker is finally brought to justice, and an injustice is corrected in the sentencing of GOP operative Roger Stone for the unforgivable crime of working for Donald Trump.

      <title>Ep. 493 - How’d Our Elites Get So Dumb?</title>
      <description>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who studied economics in college and writes economic policy in Congress, can’t name the most prominent economist of the 20th century. MSNBC’s Katy Tur doesn’t know how senators get elected. And Joe Biden wants to ban guns that don’t exist. The problem isn’t that our alleged elites are ignorant; it’s that they know so much that isn’t so. We examine the root of their confusion. Then, Joe Biden collapses in the polls, Bloomberg surges, and Snoop Doggy Dogg gets the media to expose themselves.

      <title>Michael's Podcast Pick - The Cold War: What We Saw</title>
      <description>The Berlin Airlift. The Korean War. The Cuban Missile Crisis. The Space Race. Vietnam. Detente. Reagan. Solidarity. Gorbachev. The tales of these earth-shaking milestones have been always been told as a series of individual events, completely apart from each other. But they were not individual events; they were individual threads in the tapestry of the Apocalypse That Didn’t Happen. And because they were all part of the same ongoing story, they need to be treated that way. Check out the new 12-part podcast series, "The Cold War: What We Saw." Available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and anywhere you listen to podcasts!

      <title>Ep. 491 - Mitt Romney Has Always Been Awful</title>
      <description>President Trump has officially been acquitted in the Senate’s farce impeachment trial. But not before snake-in-the-grass Mitt Romney gets in one last snip before being relegated to ignominy and obscurity. We will compare sanctimonious backstabbers with serious and successful conservatives.
Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <title>Ep. 489 - Mayor Cheat Takes Iowa</title>
      <description>Chaos ensues in the Iowa caucuses as Democrats fails to tally up the votes. Mayor Cheat Buttigieg declares himself the winner even though no official votes have come in, and he’s not polling at the top in a single state. Actually, Bernie Sanders is polling at the top—not just in Iowa, but also in New Hampshire, and he’s running second in Nevada and South Carolina, where Joe Biden’s alleged “firewall” is collapsing. We will examine how an unaccomplished communist rose to the top, why party elites are trying to steal the nomination from him again, and how the Democratic Party fell apart.

Then, the peerless and pioneering Rush Limbaugh announces a diagnosis of advanced stage lung cancer. We will see what the reaction to his announcement means for Rush and his enemies. Finally, a lone Democrat turns against impeachment, and rich, liberal, white women pay bigots to call them racist over dinner.

      <title>Ep. 488 - The Comeback Kids</title>
      <description>The Kansas City Chiefs mount a four-quarter comeback to win the Super Bowl, NFL ratings are up, and Republican senators unexpectedly whip the votes to exonerate President Trump and end impeachment once and for all.

      <title> Ep. 487 - Why The Left Never Says Sorry</title>
      <description>CNN’s Don Lemon makes an awkward on-air apology for mocking half of his fellow countrymen as ignorant, illiterate rubes. The only problem with his apology is he never actually apologized. We will examine why being a leftist means never having to say you’re sorry. 

Then, the fate of impeachment comes down to a nail-biter on Friday. We will take a look at the stakes. The Iowa caucuses are just four days away, and finally the Mailbag!

      <itunes:summary>CNN’s Don Lemon makes an awkward on-air apology for mocking half of his fellow countrymen as ignorant, illiterate rubes. The only problem with his apology is he never actually apologized. We will examine why being a leftist means never having to say you’re sorry. 

Then, the fate of impeachment comes down to a nail-biter on Friday. We will take a look at the stakes. The Iowa caucuses are just four days away, and finally the Mailbag!

      <title>Ep. 486 - The Left Loves Humanity, Hates Humans</title>
      <description>CNN’s Don Lemon and two talking head sidekicks spend nearly a minute and a half of airtime laughing about how stupid they think half of Americans are. We examine why leftists love humanity but always seem to hate actual humans. Then, liberal Democrat Alan Dershowitz demolishes House Democrats’ impeachment case in a little under 3 minutes. Liz Warren throws a Hail Mary, Hillary threatens to run again, and Drag Queen Story Hour is coming to a public school near you.

      <title>Ep. 485 - Trump’s Team Goes For The Jugular</title>
      <description>On the first full day of President Trump’s impeachment defense, the Trump team flips the script on House Democrats and turns the trial of Donald Trump into a national broadcast of Democrat corruption. We will examine the strategy.

Then, the FBI is reportedly investigating Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar over claims that she once married her brother, which is definitely gross and possibly illegal. Then, Pete Buttigieg shows he’s not ready for primetime, and Hunter Biden somehow gets into even more trouble.

      <title>Ep. 484 - A Tale Of Two Marches</title>
      <description>Nearly 100,000 pro-lifers descend on Washington, D.C., for the 47th annual March For Life just one week after fewer than 10,000 shrieking, pink hat-clad leftists took to the nation’s capital for the fourth annual Women’s March. We will examine how the two back-to-back marches show us the stark difference between the modern Left and Right. Then, Bernie surges to the top of the polls just days before the Iowa caucuses. We will analyze how a decrepit communist became the future of the Democratic Party. Finally, in some sad news, basketball superstar Kobe Bryant and his young daughter die in a helicopter crash in California. We will try to make sense of the tragic news.

      <title>Ep. 483 - The Pro-Life President</title>
      <description>Yesterday, President Trump announced that he would become the first president in American history to attend and address the March For Life, which is taking place as we speak. We will examine how a man who once called himself “very pro-choice” became the most pro-life president in American history. Then, Democrat impeachment manager Adam Schiff accidentally explains why Democrats are so eager to oust Trump before November as the impeachment trial enters its agonizing second day. And Tulsi Gabbard sues Hillary Clinton for defamation because we’re living in the greatest timeline.

      <description>Yesterday marked the first full day of President Trump’s impeachment trial. The trial consisted of House impeachment managers talking. And talking. And talking, and talking, and talking. Twelve hours of talking. And I was up watching until the very last minute so you wouldn’t have to. That’s my service to the American public. We will examine the most important moments. Then, Hillary throws shade at Bernie, President Trump wrecks the weak elites at Davos, and we announce a fun new project…

      <title>Ep. 481 - Shooting Down The Narrative</title>
      <description>Yesterday, white supremacist Hitler-loving neo-Nazis wearing Make America Great Again hats and toting fully semi-automatic double-barreled AR-47 assault rifles descended on the Virginia statehouse to take over the government and establish a Prussian ethnostate in the fevered imagination of the mainstream media. In reality, law-abiding gun owners of all colors and backgrounds showed up on Lobby Day to defend their constitutionally protected civil rights, and there was no violence whatsoever, and they cleaned up after themselves when they left. We will examine how Virginia gun owners shot down the leftist narrative on our Second Amendment rights. Then, AOC has the dumbest conversation I’ve ever heard with leftist journalist Ta Nehisi Coates, Trump’s impeachment trial kicks off, and some great news for the pro-life cause ahead of the March for Life.

      <itunes:summary>Yesterday, white supremacist Hitler-loving neo-Nazis wearing Make America Great Again hats and toting fully semi-automatic double-barreled AR-47 assault rifles descended on the Virginia statehouse to take over the government and establish a Prussian ethnostate in the fevered imagination of the mainstream media. In reality, law-abiding gun owners of all colors and backgrounds showed up on Lobby Day to defend their constitutionally protected civil rights, and there was no violence whatsoever, and they cleaned up after themselves when they left. We will examine how Virginia gun owners shot down the leftist narrative on our Second Amendment rights. Then, AOC has the dumbest conversation I’ve ever heard with leftist journalist Ta Nehisi Coates, Trump’s impeachment trial kicks off, and some great news for the pro-life cause ahead of the March for Life.

      <title>Ep. 480 - The Artist Formerly Known As Prince Harry</title>
      <description>President Trump’s impeachment trial is about to begin! But the most important story of the day isn’t the Senate charade to acquit the President. Our political rot runs all the way back to the motherland, where Queen Elizabeth is about to de-royal Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. We will examine why with great power comes great responsibility. Then, the Women’s March flops, Elizabeth Warren continues her months’ long campaign collapse, CNN brings us the dumbest article on the Internet today.

      <title>Ep. 479 - When Democracy Fails</title>
      <description>A giddy Nancy Pelosi pretends to be somber while signing the official impeachment resolution against President Trump and simultaneously doling out souvenir pens to her jackal colleagues. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin moves to consolidate power in yet another blow to representative government in Russia. We will examine how and why democracy fails. Then, Trump wins big in the trade war with China, CNN releases the Warren-Bernie exchange, and finally the Mailbag.

      <title>Ep. 478 - Everyone Lost The Debate</title>
      <description>With just 20 days to go before the Iowa caucuses, the Democrats faced off last night in Des Moines, Iowa, and everybody lost. That’s right, nobody won. Not Biden, not Bernie, not Warren, not Pete. Not the voters. Not the viewers. Every candidate did terribly. We will examine why and how that train wreck happened, and what it means for 2020. Then, House Democrats refuse to condemn Iran for attacking us, Vince Vaughn gets cancelled for shaking hands with the President, and Mike Bloomberg goes full Boomer.

      <title>Ep. 477 - Libs So White</title>
      <description>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is under fire from the race-focused Left for once again snubbing performers of color in the Oscar nominations. But in the Academy’s defense, there will at least be more black candidates in the running at the Oscars than there will be at tonight’s all-white Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa. We will examine the incoherence and hypocrisy of racial identity politics. Then, Bernie Sanders says a woman can’t win in 2020, according to a new report from CNN and the Warren camp. We will revel in the circular firing squad.

      <title>Ep. 476 - Make Iran Great Again</title>
      <description>Iranians take to the streets to protest their dirtbag terrorist leaders, in exactly the way conservatives predicted they would, in direct opposition to two weeks of leftist howling. We will examine how Trump got it so right, and why reality contradicts the Left’s international worldview. Then, Bernie takes the lead in Iowa just 20 days before the caucuses! Democratic Party elites are furious, and I couldn’t be happier. Then, Brexit, Megxit, and the passing of the great conservative thinker of our age.

      <title>Ep. 475 - The Best War Ever</title>
      <description>The smoke has cleared, and both Iran and the United States have signaled plans to de-escalate tensions after we killed their top general and they lobbed some missiles into the dirt. We take a look at the key lessons from the best war ever. Then, Cardi B fears for her safety in Trump’s America, so she’s planning on moving to Nigeria. Joy Behar endorses white supremacist Richard Spencer on The View, and Prince Harry quits his family, proving once again that you should never marry a feminist.

      <title>Ep. 474 - Don’t You Know There’s A War On?</title>
      <description>Iran launches an attack on an US airbase in Iraq. The missiles flopped, and no Americans were killed, but the question remains: are we at war with Iran? We will examine what the strike means as well as the broader Trump doctrine. Then, Covington kid Nicholas Sandmann wins a big payout from CNN, as the fake news company settles a $250 million defamation lawsuit. Speaking of fake news, the media are spreading lots of it when it comes to the Australian wildfires, and finally the New York Times asks the right question and gives a dumb answer in the dumbest article on the Internet today.

      <title>Ep. 472 - Splattering Suleimani</title>
      <description>President Trump responded to Iranian attacks on U.S. servicemen and diplomats last Thursday by splattering Iran’s top military official all over the Baghdad airport. We will examine the brilliant geopolitical strategy behind the droning, and we will attempt to explain why the Left is so upset over the death of the world’s most notorious terrorist. Then, speaking of killing it, Ricky Gervais absolutely slays at the Golden Globes, a new poll shows Republicans’ dilemma looking ahead to 2024, and the movie 1917 highlights a major problem with our culture.

      <description>Iran-backed terrorists attacked the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on New Year’s Eve, but decisive leadership dispelled the violence.

      <title>Ep. 467 - AOC Proves Obama Wrong</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/michaelknowlesshow/ep467</link>
      <description>Barack Obama is convinced that women are better than men. At an event in Singapore, he declared that women are “indisputably” better than men and everything would be much better if women were in charge. Meanwhile, in Washington, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez complained that she couldn’t figure out how to enroll in any of the 66 taxpayer-subsidized health insurance plans she’s eligible for. We will examine how little Barack Obama understands. Can't get enough of The Michael Knowles Show?

      <title>Ep. 460 - Another One Bites The Dust</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/michaelknowlesshow/ep460</link>
      <description>Another 2020 Democrat drops out of the race, and that candidate’s failure says a lot about the Democrats’ present dilemma. We will examine the fall out as another one bites the dust. Speaking of which, an explosive new book sheds new light on who Jeffrey Epstein was, and how he died, and if he died. A transgender woman—that is, a man—demands a gynecologist inspect the genitals he doesn’t have. We analyze why it matters. And Hong Kong protesters find hope in Swole Trump.

      <title>Ep. 452 - Our Leaders Are Gasbags</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/michaelknowlesshow/ep452</link>
      <description>Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell broadcast hot air on MSNBC last night, but not so much as Democratic senator Chris Murphy or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We will examine shameless gasbaggery. Then, across the pond, the UK’s Prince Andrew sweats over questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, who didn’t kill himself, a New Zealand hunter gets death threats to killing her own food, and conservatives’ favorite chicken restaurant gives in to the leftist mob.

      <title>Ep. 449 - Our Civil War of Religion</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/michaelknowlesshow/ep449</link>
      <description>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the age of “Make America Great Again.” It was the age of “America was never really great.” It was the election season of hope. It was the election season of despair. The Atlantic Monthly, and many others, thinks America is headed for a civil war, and it dedicates its entire December issue to how it might be avoided. We will examine our biggest divide. Then, a Canadian broadcaster loses his job for calling on his countrymen to honor their veterans. Honoring veterans is now apparently racist. Democratic senator Mazie Hirono admits that global warming is a religion, and Americans warm up to the idea of men beating women—at sports. Date: 11-13-2019

      <description>Thirty years ago, the Berlin Wall fell, destroying Soviet Communism and vindicating the conservative Reagan Revolution. But that great victory for freedom created a big problem for the libertarians, traditionalists, and Religious Right who made up the post-war conservative movement: what unites us all now? We will examine the rubble of the Berlin Wall. Then, Elizabeth Warren picks up an endorsement from the backbone of our democracy, the good guys get a win in the War on Christmas, and leftists try to save a convicted murderer and rapist from execution.

      <title>Ep. 444 - Jeffrey Epstein Didn’t Kill Himself</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/michaelknowlesshow/ep444</link>
      <description>New polling from the NYT suggests that Democrats have been living in a progressive fantasy world if they believe that they’re likely to defeat President Trump in 2020, which makes sense if they believe other fantasies like the narrative that Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. We will examine how the Left can be so gullible when nobody believes the press. Then, an ex-Evangelical pastor who left his church, family, and faith is lecturing Evangelicals on how they’re ruining Christianity. Finally, the Mayor of Tent City Los Angeles claims, with a straight face, that LA is the model city for dealing with homelessness. Date: 11-05-2019

      <title>Ep. 443 - Liz Warren Thinks You’re An Idiot</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/michaelknowlesshow/ep443</link>
      <description>Big news in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, and I’m not talking about Beto O’Rourke’s dropping out because nobody ever actually cared about Beto O’Rourke except for the mainstream media, and they’re wrong about everything. No, I’m talking about actually consequential presidential campaign news: Elizabeth Warren has released the details of her healthcare plan, which costs roughly $50 bazillion dollars. We’ll get into the economics of it, and examine the broader strategy of the Warren campaign: she thinks you’re all a bunch of idiots. Then, a Democratic state rep says something horrifying about unborn babies, President Trump moves to Florida, and so much more. Date: 11-04-2019

      <description>President Trump tweets out a dog meme, and the mainstream media lose their collective minds. We will explain why fanatics never laugh, and how democracy dies in barkness. Then, RealClearInvestigations uncovers the possible identity of the impeachment whistleblower. We will examine who he is and why it matters. Finally, Facebook and Twitter take opposite approaches to political advertising in 2020, and the legacy media-dependent Left is furious. Date: 10-31-2019

      <title>Ep. 441 - Impeachment Gets Real</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/michaelknowlesshow/ep441</link>
      <description>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally agrees to hold a vote on the impeachment inquiry at the behest of—wait for it—Republicans. We examine Pelosi’s impeachment bind and the Democrats’ biggest mistake: they believe their own press releases. Then, a group of Indians attacks black girls in New Jersey because of white supremacy or something, according to the NYT in the Dumbest Article of the Internet Today. And finally, more bad news for Joe Biden as the nominally Catholic nominal Democratic presidential frontrunner is denied the Eucharist at a Catholic church in South Carolina because he supports killing babies.

We will examine what the photo means as most Americans ignore the strategic and symbolic significance of this very good boy. Then, Pete Buttigieg eats Kamala Harris’s lunch in the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, and it’s all Joe Biden’s fault. We’ll take a look at the latest polls.

      <title>Daily Wire Backstage: Summer Is Here But Harambe Is Not</title>
      <link>https://soundcloud.com/michaelknowlesshow/daily-wire-backstage-summer-is-here-but-harambe-is-not</link>
      <description>On this, the three-year anniversary of Harambe's tragic end, it's time to once again power through the grief, tighten our boot-straps, and ponder the ways in which we shall keep this republic steaming ahead. Is it possible to thwart the Left's mainstreaming of socialism? Will the Dems ever cease pushing the lies of collusion, obstruction, and cover-up? Will Trump be able to fix the crisis on the border? Can Biden pull off a 2020 win?

Join this roundtable discussion featuring Ben Shapiro, Andrew Klavan, Michael Knowles, Daily Wire god-king Jeremy Boreing, and special guest Texas senator Ted Cruz, as they get to the bottom of these questions and more.
