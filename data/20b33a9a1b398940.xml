***RECIPE, SERVES 4-6***

8 oz (223g) cascatelli or other large pasta shape
1 lemon
2 lb (908g) brussels sprouts
2 carrots
2 shallots
4 oz (113g) thick diced pancetta (or any fatty cured meat, or none at all)
8 oz (223g) mozarella
8 oz (223g) ricotta
1 red chili
2 garlic cloves
panko breadcrumbs
pecorino or parmesan cheese
fennel seeds
thyme (or other fresh herb)

Start by making the breadcrumb topping. Zest the lemon, grate up a little pile or pecorino or parmesan cheese, thin-slice the chili, pick some thyme leaves, peel the garlic, and chop all of these ingredients into each other until fine. Combine with an equal quantity of panko and set aside. Save the rest of the lemon for later.

Grate the mozzarella and set aside. Prep the brussels sprouts by trimming off the stem ends and any decaying outer leaves and then quarter them. Slice the carrots thinly. Peel and chop the shallots.

Get a pot of salted water coming to a boil for the pasta. Lay the pancetta out on a sheet pan in an even layer, put it in the oven and turn on the broiler/grill. Get the pasta boiling — you'll cook it until it's a couple minutes away from being done, then drain and reserve.

When the pancetta has leaked out a lot of fat and it's about as crispy as you want it, pull the pan out, toss in the sprouts, carrots, fennel seeds, and enough salt for all the veg. Spread into an even layer and return to the broiler until the veg looks almost cooked.

Take the pan back out, toss in the drained pasta and about a third of the mozzarella. Use a spoon to drop the ricotta onto the pan in dollops. Scatter the remaining mozzarella across the top, avoiding the ricotta dollops (you want to leave them exposed on top so they brown). Do the same with the breadcrumb topping.

Return the pan to the broiler and cooked until brown and crispy on top. Squeeze lemon juice over everything and eat.</media:description>

***RECIPE, MAKES SIX LARGE COOKIES***

113g (1 stick) butter
200g sugar (1 cup granulated or brown, but I prefer 1 2/3 cups powdered sugar)
5-10g (1-2 teaspoons) molasses (optional, replicates the taste of brown sugar)
1 egg
10g (1 teaspoon of Morton kosher) salt (use 2/3rds of that if your butter is salted)
4-8g (1-2 teaspoons) vanilla extract
3g (1/2 teaspoon) baking soda
230g (about 1.5 cups) bread flour (1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour is OK instead)
100g chocolate chips or other mix-ins

Get the oven heating to 375ºF/190ºC, convection if you have it.

Melt the butter. Mix in the sugar (and optional molasses) until smooth. Mix in the egg until very smooth. Mix in the salt (FYI, some people might not like their cookies as salty as I do), vanilla, baking soda, flour and chips. The dough should be a little sticky — you can chill it for a few minutes to make it easier to shape.

Divide the dough into six 115g portions and roll each into something like a golf ball. Space them evenly on a baking sheet — no parchment paper, no grease. Flatten each ball into something like a hockey puck and tidy up the circular shape.

Turn the oven off and turn the broiler/grill on maximum. Give it a minute or two to heat up, then put in the cookies near the top. Let the broiler brown the tops of the cookies until golden — this should only take a minute, so don't walk away or they'll burn. If you're doing multiple pans of cookies, brown them each one at a time.

Turn the broiler off and the oven back on to 375ºF/190ºC. Give the broiler a couple minutes to cool down, then return the cookies to the oven. Bake until they spread and look done to you — mine take about eight minutes as this stage, but they'll take longer if you don't have a convection fan. I like the texture when they look a hair underbaked.

Let the cookies cool and solidify before scraping them off the baking sheet.</media:description>

Seafoodwatch.org's guide for buying sustainable canned tuna: https://www.seafoodwatch.org/stories/tips-for-choosing-sustainable-canned-tuna

***RECIPE, SERVES 6-8***

1 12 oz (340g) bag dried egg noodles
4 5 oz (140g) cans of tuna
1 12 oz (340g) jar of marinated artichokes
1 lb (454g) fresh green beans
1 sweet red pepper
3-4 small hot peppers (or another sweet pepper)
2 bunches of green onions
1 qt (1 liter) milk (or non-dairy milk, or stock, or water)
1 750mL bottle of dry white wine (or less, or none)
1 stick (113g) butter (or 1/2 cup, 120mL olive oil)
1/2 gup (60g) all-purpose flour
grated parmesan or pecorino cheese (optional)
garlic powder
onion powder
dried thyme (or other dried herbs)
salt
pepper

Heat a large, stove-safe baking dish over medium. Melt in the butter then whisk in the flour until smooth. Keep whisking as the roux cooks for a minute or two until it's just starting to turn brown and it starts to smell a little nutty. Gradually whisk in the milk until smooth. Bring the sauce to a simmer until it thickens, then take the heat down to low, and remember to stir it occasionally while you do everything else, so the bottom doesn't burn.

Snip the stem ends off all the green beans and then just them into large chunks. Stir those into the sauce. Seed the peppers, cut into thin slices and stir into the sauce. Tear any decaying outer layers off the green onions, trim off the roots, thinly slice both the whites and greens and stir into the sauce. Stir in the artichokes and their marinade. Dump in the tuna, season heavily with garlic powder, onion powder, dry herbs, black pepper and a big pinch of salt. Stir, taking care to not break up the tuna too much (there's more stirring to come, so go easy on it).

Stir in the dry, uncooked egg noodles. Top off with enough wine (or water, or stock, etc) to just barely cover everything and stir. Taste the liquid and add more seasoning if needed — it should taste a little too salty on its own. Make sure all the noodles are pushed down just below the water line. Grate some cheese on top, if you want.

Cover the pan tightly with foil and bake at 400ºF/200ºC until the noodles are soft and most of the liquid is absorbed, 45-60 min. Uncover and bake until the top is nice and brown, another 20 min or so. Let rest to solidify before scooping. Leftovers reheat great.</media:description>

1 lb (454g) carrots
1.5 lb (680g) waxy potatoes
a few sticks of celery
one or two bunches of green onions
starch
powdered gelatin (very optional)
tomato paste
mustard (any kind that's tart)
honey or other sweetener
garlic powder
onion powder
dried mushroom powder (or a glug of soy sauce, any other source of umami)
dried herbs
salt
pepper
oil

Oil the roast and season it heavily with salt and pepper. Brown the outside over moderate heat, taking care to not to let anything burn. Finely chop the shallots, and when the meat is brown, throw them into the pan at let them brown for a few minutes. Stir in a squeeze of tomato paste and let it brown for a minute. Pour in the beef stock and deglaze the pan.

Season heavily with garlic powder, onion powder, dried mushroom powder, assorted dry herbs and pepper. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and let braise until you can feel the meat starting to soften, 2-3 hours.

Prep the vegetables by cutting them into really big pieces. For the green onions, I cut off the white parts and cook them whole — the greens I slice thin and use for garnish at the end. Don't start putting them in until the roast is getting soft and probably only needs another half hour or so. If you want to be able to slice the roast, take it out when it's just barely fork tender. If you want to tear it into chunks,  cook it as soft as you want.

When everything is cooked, remove all the solids with a slotted spoon and transfer to a heat-safe platter. Keep this in a warm oven until you're ready to eat.

To finish the gravy, consider blooming a couple packets of powdered gelatin in some cool water for a few minutes until gelled, then stir that into the gravy. This will enhance the texture, but it's not necessary.

Mix a couple spoonfuls of starch with just enough cool water to make a thin paste. Drizzle some of that slowly into the gravy while you stir aggressively, and bring the gravy to a boil. Keep stirring in slurry until the gravy is as thick as you want it. Stir in mustard, honey and additional seasoning to taste.

Slice the roast, cover everything with gravy and garnish with the sliced onion greens.</media:description>

This isn't really a recipe, but the basic technique I like is 4-to-1 liquid-to-pastina by weight, or 3-to-1 by volume, but volume measurements will depend on the specific shape of pastina you're using. Bring the liquid to a boil, stir in the pastina, cook until almost done, take it off the heat, season, melt in some butter and cheese, and when the bubbling has fully stopped, stir in an egg or egg yolk.</media:description>
