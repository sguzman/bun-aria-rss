<description><![CDATA[<p>Joining Laura today is Dominique Moceanu, the youngest Olympic gold medalist in US gymnastics history and youngest senior US national all-around champion in history. Dominique was a member of the first US women's gymnastics team to win Olympic gold in 1996, commonly referred to as the ‘Magnificent Seven’ by the media. A nine-time US national team member as well as back-to-back junior and senior all-around national champion, Dominique has been inducted into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame and the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame with her 1996 teammates. But, as life would have it, all that glitter isn’t gold. Even though Dominique made history as a young athlete and achieved astonishing results in her career, that success came with a heavy price. From a toxic sports environment to abusive coaching methods, there were a lot of things happening behind the scenes while Dominique and her teammates were winning medals and making gymnastics history. </p>
<p>In this episode of the Pursuit of Gold podcast, Dominique opens up about her emotional and challenging journey. First, she tells us about the impact of the abusive sports environment on young athletes and the toll that it takes on their mental health. Then, she walks us through all the events that were leading up to the Olympics, as well as the hardships she endured after the competition. When Dominique finally decided to speak up about her experiences, everything changed for her. She was abandoned by the community and had to find another way to make a living. Fast forward a few years, and she’s now a New York Times best-selling author and an advocate for athletes' rights and protection. Tune into this episode to hear all about her mission to make sports safer for future generations of athletes.</p>

<li>“You can't be in the right mindset to pull the best out of yourself when you're terrified.”</li>
<li>“I'm lucky that I made it as far as I did with that kind of intensity. Most teenagers would break. Most teenagers would not be able to handle it.”</li>

<li>“This is not who I am; it's what I do. And I love what I do, and I'm passionate about what I do. But you can't let it become who you are.”</li>
<li>“Can you live with yourself if you don't do the right thing?”</li>
<li>“That's what I kept saying to the women who came to me; it's wrong. You have to report it.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode, Laura’s talking about one of the things she gets asked about most frequently: visualization. Laura credits this technique as a big part of why she was able to make the Olympic team and win gold when no one else expected her to. Having seen other athletes succeed with this approach, she adopted it as a way to continue training after shattering her foot three months before the Olympic Trials, making an opportunity out of that forced sidelining. Visualization has remained part of Laura’s personal toolset, and she uses that experience in this episode to explain what the technique is and walk us through how to get started visualizing in a way that will actually make a difference.</p>
<p>Visualization is defined as purposely rehearsing a skill, routine, or performance in your mind to program your body physically for success. Practicing it consistently becomes a fortifying competition strategy, rewiring your brain to prepare it to deal with all the different factors that come into play while competing. Laura explains that there are a few different ways to visualize, including first and third-person versions, which contribute different effects and should be used in conjunction with each other. She also points out the importance of engaging all your senses while visualizing to better immerse your brain and make changes more easily. Laura then shares some how-to basics for those wishing to start visualizing, from giving yourself a set amount of time to practice, to making sure you have a quiet place to visualize in, and starting with the approach that comes most naturally to you. And finally, Laura finishes the episode with some tips and tricks for beginners, including practicing frequently and consistently, mixing things up every day, and using video study to enhance your visualization.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laura’s personal experience with visualization</li>
<li>What visualization is</li>
<li>Types and elements of visualization</li>
<li>How-to visualizing basics</li>
<li>Tips and tricks for getting started with visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“When I burst onto the scene winning an unexpected Olympic victory—well, unexpected to everyone else—the story that was being told was centered around me having shattered my foot before the Olympic trials and being unable to physically train. So I visualized, and that not only helped me make the Olympic team, but I consider it a big part of the reason that I was able to stand atop the podium and listen to my national anthem play.”</li>
<li>“The more senses that you engage, the more your mind starts to believe that you’re really doing the activity. You’re actively rewiring your brain on how to fire and react when you’re doing specific movements and techniques. So the more real it is to you, the more real it is to your brain, and the more effective changes you can actually make.”</li>
<li>“People say practice makes perfect, but really, practice makes permanent. So if you’re practicing or thinking about or visualizing the wrong actions, that’s what you are making into concrete in your brain. So you really want to make sure, as you’re visualizing, that you take the time to think about doing all the things, all the tiny, little details, correct because that’s what you are programming in your brain.”</li>
<li>“These visualizations of the competition scenarios, it just allows you to put yourself in so many different situations that maybe you don’t have the actual time to be going out and doing the thirty different competitions against the same people to see how you would stack up in different scenarios. But you can do that in your mind.”</li>
<li>“Make sure that you’re keeping this positive. This is not a place to beat yourself up or to get frustrated. This is a place to learn, to experiment, and to see yourself doing all these awesome and amazing things that you’ve dreamed of doing.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Not many things bond you like the trauma of learning the ten-meter platform together, and that’s exactly how Laura and this week’s guest, Gretchen Sheirr, became friends. A former US national finalist in diving, Gretchen is President of Business Operations for the Houston Rockets, making her the fourth woman to lead the business operations of an NBA team. Gretchen kicks off the episode with her journey from a childhood dream of being a gymnast at LSU before losing motivation, to joining the diving team (about a week before Laura!), and finally getting to LSU on a diving scholarship. She and Laura also discuss how their friendships helped drive them to do better and the intense pressure now being put on high school athletes. And Gretchen talks about how being an athlete teaches you lessons that set you up for life, including accountability, coping with change, and how to respond to feedback constructively.</p>
<p>Next, Gretchen discusses her decision to become a business major and how combining that with her passion for sports led her into the sports marketing industry and a job with the Rockets in the early 2000s. She talks about the changes the franchise was going through at that time and how that allowed her to make quick progress in her career while staying with the team. She also tackles what it takes to get into the sports industry and succeed, including a willingness to take risks, set goals, and make sacrifices. Laura then asks her to talk about what it feels like to be one of only a handful of women at the top of the NBA, and Gretchen admits there’s a lot of pressure but also opportunities to raise others up, such as her work with Women in Sport and Events (WISE). The discussion then pivots to how the NBA and the Rockets dealt with the impact of COVID and the loss of live events by creating the NBA Bubble, plus Gretchen shares what she and the team are doing now to bring people back in. And finally, Gretchen shares how she maintains her work/life balance by knowing her glass balls from her rubber ones and gives some advice to upcoming athletes not to worry too much about getting internships and focus on their full-time job of college and competing.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gretchen’s journey to competitive diving</li>
<li>What being an athlete teaches you</li>
<li>Succeeding in the sports industry</li>
<li>Being a woman at the top of the NBA</li>
<li>How the Rockets coped with COVID</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Some of our friends’ kids are older, and they’re really good athletes. And they’re talking about this stuff at an age that I hadn’t even started in the sport that I went to college on a scholarship for, that I was relatively decent at, at a time where parents these days are freaking out if their kids aren’t even getting recruited.”</li>
<li>“As an athlete, you hear that every single day, all day, every day, multiple times a day, that this wasn’t good enough, that was bad, or this was good. So you learn how to take a compliment and recognize what you’re doing well and make that even better. And you learn how to take negative feedback in a constructive way and correct yourself.”</li>
<li>“You need to be prepared to take risks and to move if growing your career is the most important thing. Which I’m not saying that it is—everybody needs to live their own life and create their own path and not necessarily follow other people. And they’re like, but you didn’t leave. And I was like, I know, but I went into it knowing that I would likely have to at some point, it just didn’t happen.”</li>
<li>“In order to go to the next step, you have to sort of master what you’re currently doing. And until you’ve mastered what you’re currently doing, or at least shown that you have the commitment to master what you’re currently doing, why would anyone want to talk to you about the next thing?”</li>
<li>“Monday is high school orientation, that me, as an idiot, thought was Monday night. And today, I found out that it is not Monday night, it is at 8:30 on Monday morning. And so I had to cancel two meetings, and I had to reschedule them because I’m going to high school orientation with my kids. Like, that’s a glass ball, not dropping it.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Joining Laura on today’s episode is professional high diver, CEO of the International High Diving Institute—America’s first high-diving facility, and founder of the Clean Cliffs project, Ellie Smart. Their conversation begins with Ellie’s journey from childhood dreams of diving at the Olympics to the tough realization that she wouldn’t reach that standard and her decision to retire from diving during college. She shares the challenges of walking away from the sport that defined her, finding her worth outside of diving, and finally discovering her purpose in cliff diving. Ellie then discusses how she made the move into professional high diving, started competing, and eventually made it onto the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series as a permanent diver.</p>
<p>Next, Ellie talks about her desire to keep challenging herself and working on new dives—including one partly inspired by Laura—so that she can continue unlocking her potential to the highest degree. She also speaks to how she and other cliff divers manage their fear, pointing out that fear can be a good thing physiologically, but only if we learn how to control it and use it in a healthy way. Ellie takes a moment to discuss the impact of social media and how she uses it as a tool while enforcing personal boundaries to ensure she avoids the urge to compare herself with others. Closing out the episode, Ellie reveals some of her pursuits when she’s not diving herself, including creating the High Diving Institute at the Utah Olympic Park and co-founding Clean Cliffs, a project with the mission to prevent plastic pollution in the world’s bodies of water.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking away from and coming back to diving</li>
<li>Learning to cliff dive and starting to compete</li>
<li>Unlocking potential and managing fear</li>
<li>Creating the International High Diving Institute</li>
<li>Giving back with Clean Cliffs</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I wanted to represent Team USA, I wanted to go to the Olympics, and I would practice my gold medals speech in the shower every single night as a kid and my autograph. In class, I used to get in trouble all the time for practicing my autograph.”</li>
<li>“The answer is always ‘no’ if you never ask, so I would rather ask and get the answer ‘no’ than not ask at all and maybe miss out on a really cool, incredible opportunity. So I definitely get embarrassed or shy or self-conscious sometimes when I have things that I really want to do, like, it’s definitely not just easy. But I know that the reward of asking and what could come of it is so much better than not asking.”</li>
<li>“It was also very humbling to realize that if I was going to keep diving, I needed to dive for me and not for the results or what it looked like from the outside to other people. Because there’s always going to be something bigger and better and different that you can do if you’re basing your life on decisions or opinions of other people.”</li>
<li>“I really think comparison is just the absolute worst thing that you can do. And so, I try to eliminate that as much as possible from my everyday life. So you know, if any of my friends are listening to this, I love you, but I’m not going to watch your Instagram stories. You can tell me all about it in person.”</li>
<li>“I think that that’s the most exciting thing about life is we don’t know, we get to figure it out as we go. And, you know, I used to have a different approach of, ‘I want to know the answer now. I want to know what I’m supposed to do.’ And now I have this whole new mindset of, ‘I’m so excited to see what I can do versus what I’m supposed to do.’”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Laura welcomes Rebecca Smith, the Founder and CEO of Complete Performance Coaching and PerformHappy, who has been helping high achievers thrive under pressure for more than 20 years. A former gymnast herself and a fellow recovering perfectionist, Rebecca understands very well the mental health challenges that professional athletes have to go through. Having struggled with mental blocks for years, she eventually quit her gymnastics career and decided to move on. Now, she’s committed to helping young athletes nurture their mental health while still winning competitions. Her unique evidence-based approach helps fearful young athletes discover the confidence to stand up for themselves when faced with the notorious toxic culture of youth sport.</p>
<p>On this episode of the Pursuit of Gold podcast, Laura and Rebecca discuss mental blocks and how to overcome them. Rebecca shares her own story dealing with perfectionism, how mental blocks destroyed her gymnastics career yet helped her to uncover effective tactics for getting over them. She explains the two main parts of overcoming a mental block: the physical side and the mental side. Once you overcome the physical part, you need to work on maintaining a healthy relationship with yourself, meaning build your self-awareness and inner confidence. These two are fundamental to your self-growth. Rebecca goes on to share a few more useful tactics for overcoming mental blocks, such as turning nervousness into excitement, practicing mindfulness, and front-loading confidence. Finally, Laura and Rebecca wrap up the episode by touching upon the importance of having a supportive coach, emphasizing the fact that a positive environment sets the tone for success.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebecca’s gymnastics background and moving past mental blocks</li>
<li>Winning the battle against perfectionism</li>
<li>The importance of praising effort versus talent</li>
<li>The incredible power of imagination and creativity for your competence</li>
<li>The two parts to overcoming a mental block</li>
<li>Increasing and front-loading confidence to avoid mental blocks</li>
<li>Turning nervousness into excitement</li>
<li>Practicing the mindful warmup and being present</li>
<li>Dealing with injuries as a professional athlete</li>
<li>Mental health and motivation during COVID</li>
<li>The importance of a supportive and positive environment for athletes</li>
<li>Supporting young athletes as a parent</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Their parents are like, ‘She’s the best tumbler anyone's ever seen, why can't she just go do it?’ And there's this because there's just such a combination of factors that lead to mental block. One of them is that it's the pressure of being amazing, being perfect.”</li>
<li>“Our brain only cares about keeping us safe. That's the only thing. It doesn't care about competitions. It doesn't care about scores, or metals or places, or deadlines, or any of that stuff It only cares about ‘keep the body alive.’”</li>
<li>“She was the kid who was a hard worker with heart. She was not the most talented kid on our team. But so, with that being said, if you want to move forward, you can't wait for your magic talent fairy to bless you with the ability to do your skill again, it just isn't going to work.”</li>
<li>“There is this huge kind of internal component that's all about connecting with your own joy and your own choice. Because if you don't, if you feel like you're doing it for anybody, but you, you're going to get burned out, it's just the way it goes.”</li>
<li>“Excitement and nerves are both high arousal, physical states. So, your heart's beating, you're a little more fidgety, you've got a little more energy, it is a lot easier to go from nervous to excited than it is to go from nervous to calm, especially when you only have moments before you compete.”</li>
<li>“Injuries, just like mental blocks, are part of the deal. For a lot of athletes, it's just a setback. And so, the worst thing you can do is compare yourself to where you should be or could be or where your friend is or where you would like to be because all that does is create self-pity.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Laura welcomes John Doolittle, a retired Navy SEAL Captain and currently a certified KAATSU Master Specialist who serves as the Chief Revenue Officer of KAATSU Global. Laura and John open the conversation by talking about John’s swimming background and introduction to the Air Force Academy. Supported by his trusted mentor Mike, John decided to join the BUD/S training and become a Navy SEAL. Although the training was one of the most challenging and hardest periods of his life, it served as a great introduction to Navy life.</p>
<p>From becoming a team player to developing mental toughness, John says this program taught him some of the most valuable lessons in life. He dives deep into the power of trust and how it can be applied in sports, too, not just in the military. He goes on to explain the importance of adopting the ‘never quit’ mindset, highlighting its very powerful and contagious nature. Laura and John also address mental health in sports and the military, pointing out the importance of having strong team support and adequate resources. Finally, John shares an inspiring story about his solo swim across the English Channel to raise money for the Navy SEAL Foundation. He offers an inspiring conclusion to this extraordinary episode by stressing that you can accomplish anything in life if you do it for a reason greater than yourself.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>John’s swimming background and introduction to the Air Force Academy</li>
<li>Going from the Air Force Academy to the Navy</li>
<li>The challenging journey of getting into the BUD/S class</li>
<li>The three phases of BUD/S training</li>
<li>Mental toughness vs. physical toughness</li>
<li>Learning to be a team player</li>
<li>Adopt a ‘never give up’ mentality</li>
<li>The importance of trust in teamwork and relationships</li>
<li>The power of little things</li>
<li>Protecting the homeland after 9/11</li>
<li>Pushing yourself without hitting the breaking point</li>
<li>John’s solo swim across the English Channel to raise money for the Navy SEAL Foundation</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“One of my biggest takeaways from my time in the teams was about relationships based on trust. And you know why - that starts with our parents, but it also starts with mentors.”</li>
<li>“Everyone fails physically pretty quick. That first night, you go to failure on just about everything you do. But the mental piece is so important. And you learn very quickly, that when you thought your body was done, you actually do have more to give.”</li>
<li>“You quickly learn at BUD/S training that if you're trying to do something as an individual, you will fail. There are very few things, even this swimming in BUD/S, you can't do it by yourself. Everybody has a swim buddy. And if the two of you fail, don't make the time, you both failed the swim.”</li>
<li>“Part of the goal with that type of training is to identify those that when they get really uncomfortable, when they get really tired, they end up making decisions that maybe are not the best. And whether or not somebody is going to quit, you want to identify that pretty early on.”</li>
<li>“'Never quit mindset' is very, very powerful and contagious to others on the team.”</li>
<li>“When you're doing something really hard in life, try and find a way to do it for something that's bigger than yourself, it's bigger than you, to do it for a reason greater than yourself and you can do damn near anything.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Laura’s guest on today’s episode is record-breaker, trailblazer, and history-maker Natalie Coughlin. Natalie has won twelve Olympic medals and twenty World Championship medals; she was the first US woman to win six medals at a single Olympic Games and the first woman to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals in the same event and consecutive Olympics. And as if that wasn’t enough, Natalie was also the first woman ever to swim the hundred-meter backstroke in less than a minute. Her achievements also include winning eleven out of a possible twelve individual NCAA titles, being NCAA Swimmer of the Year three years in a row, and winning a total of sixteen medals in major international competitions (twenty-five gold, twenty-two silver, and thirteen bronze) spanning the Olympics, the World Championships, the Pan-Pacific Championships, and the Pan-American Games. As impressive as her achievements are, Natalie’s also just a really cool, down-to-earth person who’s so much fun to talk to. During the episode, we jump into how her story began, her fierce competitiveness, and an injury that changed her whole perspective on swimming.</p>
<p>First up, Natalie shares how she got into swimming at a young age and how her natural competitiveness drove her to break onto the swimming scene at just thirteen. She then relates how she suffered a torn labrum in the run-up to qualifying for the 2000 Olympics team, the effect that had on her mindset and perspective, and her choice to avoid surgery and recover through physical rehab. Next, Natalie discusses how she chose which college to attend (eventually ending up at Cal, Berkeley) and the choices she made in her career post-injury, including ditching the two-hundred-meter backstroke and transitioning to sprint events. She talks about qualifying for the 2004 Olympics and the relief when she did, followed by the experience of winning her first gold medal and the positive impact that had on her confidence and ability to stay calm while competing. She also discusses how becoming a gold medalist led to more media attention and street recognition, how the Michael Phelps phenomenon helped shield her from the worst of that, and how she managed to achieve a happy medium of attention for her record-breaking success. Natalie then shares how it felt when other swimmers started nipping at her heels, firing up her competitiveness, and the mindset she gets into when preparing to compete. She then discusses how she prepared for the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, keeping her cool when the media were pushing retirement, and circling back to that early injury and how it helped her keep swimming in perspective. Laura then asks Natalie to share her most memorable and toughest moments in her career, including winning the hundred-back in Beijing and feeling isolated during the 2012 Games. And finally, Natalie shares what she’s been up to since retiring from competition, including writing her cookbook Cook to Thrive and starting the women-owned winery Gaderian Wines in Napa Valley.</p>

<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Like the Water Babies type thing, you know, that every parent really needs to do for the safety of their children. It’s very, very important, whether you want them to be a swimmer or not, you have to get your kids in the water early.”</li>
<li>“When we did soccer at school, like during PE or during recess and lunch, all the kids in my class, they were in soccer, and they were just, they were so much better than me. So I remember going home and practicing with a soccer ball against the wall in the backyard, just so I could get better. And no one was coaching me, I was doing this by myself.”</li>
<li>“I will never forget, like, walking out onto the pool deck in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and they’re like, ‘And in lane one, Natalie Coughlin. Thirteen-year-old Natalie Coughlin.’ And then I choked because it was the first time I was on, like, the major stage.”</li>
<li>“A doctor, you know, finally told me, ‘Hey, you tore your labrum.’ So I had to deal with that, you know, most of ’99 and the lead up until 2000. And so my training really suffered. Emotionally, I really suffered. It was a really, really tough thing. And so I got to the 2000 Olympic trials, and by that time, I was just a shell of like, what I was before.”</li>
<li>“Honestly, the 200 back is one of the most painful events. And by that stage in my career, I was transitioning much more into sprint. And so that was just kind of the proof that I needed of like, ‘Hey, see? I don’t need to do this dumb event.’”</li>
<li>“Olympic gold, kind of, you just enter this other stratosphere of athletics where you will forever be an Olympic gold medalist - no one could ever take that away.”</li>
<li>“Because I had the confidence to do so, I would go pretty easy that first hundred, I would build the fifth twenty-five, and then that last seventy-five meters, I would just hammer it home and just mow people down. It was so fun to swim that way.”</li>
<li>“I remember being in the middle of Manhattan and people stopping me on the streets and, like, being on a train in the middle of nowhere, and people stopping me and being recognized. And, you know, part of that was really cool. But also, you know, I turned twenty-two at that Olympic Games. So it was, it was a lot, you know, like, it was great, but it also was super-overwhelming at the same time.”</li>
<li>“I didn’t want all that pressure on me. It’s that catch-22. You know, if you want all that attention, you have to take all that pressure, and I felt like I had kind of the happy medium of it.”</li>
<li>“And then, all of a sudden, I started crying. And then I started crying because I was crying. I was just like this sobbing, like, snotty mess.”</li>
<li>“2012, I failed to make the Olympic team in the 100 back. And people were like, ‘Oh my God,’ you know, waiting for me to freak out or something. And like, 'It’s just swimming, guys. I already have two gold medals. Like it’s, I’m fine.'”</li>
<li>“One, it’s so misogynistic, and two, none of their business. Like, it is so inappropriate for people to tell women that they need to retire and have babies. Some women don’t want it. Some people have a hard time getting pregnant. There’s like, so many reasons to not.”</li>
<li>“What I’m most proud of is just, kind of, my consistency throughout the years. The ability to, you know, be in medal contention for twelve different events over three Olympic Games. Like that’s something that no one’s done. You know, even you know, Dara and Jenny. They didn’t do it in three Olympics. I’m really proud of that.”</li>
<li>“I knew definitively after the ’16 trials that I was done. Like, I love swimming, and I love training so much, but honestly, I don’t feel the need to compete ever again. Like, that was kind of my mentality. And so, you know, I ended on my own terms, and I was really, really happy about it.”</li>
<li>“I’ve always made sure when my teammates have had disappointing races or whatever, to not hide from them, and not hide from the conversation, just to be there for them. Like, it was a learning experience for me too.”</li>
<li>“I think it’s really telling of us as maybe a culture sometimes. Like, we expect people to have a hissy fit or just have this giant pity party.”</li>
<li>“I eat very healthy, but I don’t deprive myself. So like, I allow myself to have butter, and I eat chicken with the skin on it. And like, I believe in Whole Foods, and I believe in balance.”</li>
<li>“People really wanted to peg me into, like, just clean, just healthy. This, like, boring Spartan, like, oh, this is what athletes eat. And that’s not how I’ve ever eaten. And if I ate that way, I would go crazy. I need to have a glass of wine, I need to have my chocolate and butter and like all those things.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>We’re changing things up this week with a slightly different episode from usual, in which our host, Laura Wilkinson, answers some questions gathered from our Instagram followers. The questions cover topics including starting sports at an older age, dealing with injuries and mental blocks, epic advice that Laura’s received, being an underdog versus a favorite, and having purpose. Laura kicks things off with the story of finding her way into diving at the age of fifteen after quitting gymnastics and how that eventually led to the fulfillment of her Olympics dream.</p>
<p>And the final question rounding out the episode asks where Laura finds purpose after having achieved so much and what keeps her going every day. Her response is that she’s always been very goal-oriented and focused on pushing the envelope of what she is capable of, so she continues to find purpose and fulfillment in setting huge goals and being determined and consistent in pursuing them. But you might be surprised at what directly follows that answer.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Laura got into diving at an older age</li>
<li>Is it ever too late to start diving and compete?</li>
<li>The best advice Laura’s ever received</li>
<li>Being the underdog vs. the favorite</li>
<li>Moving forward from a loss</li>
<li>Laura’s favorite and least favorite dives</li>
<li>How Laura feels watching her kids play sports</li>
<li>Using injury time as an opportunity</li>
<li>Dealing with mental blocks</li>
<li>Setting goals and having purpose</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I wanted to continue learning and pushing boundaries and trying things, and I just kind of realized it was time to move on. But that dream of the Olympics was still in the back of my mind. I just recognized at that point I needed to find a new sport.”</li>
<li>“I’m not sure if it was ever that I recognized my own potential. I just wanted this thing so badly that I was going to pursue it. Whether it was switching sports or, you know, I was just going to pursue it no matter what. I was going to find a sport that I could go to the Olympics, and I was going to find a way to the Olympic Games.”</li>
<li>“If you are interested in diving and competing at any age, give it a whirl. I think, at the very least, you’re going to try something new, you’re going to learn something, and you’re gonna have a blast.”</li>
<li>“Soak it in. You’re at the Olympics, you’re in your dream, you’re getting to do all these things, just live it up. But when it’s your time to dive, when it’s your time to compete, that’s when you just let all that go. And at that point, you’re just at another diving meet against competitors you’ve competed against so many times, doing dives you’ve done a thousand times, you know exactly what you’re doing.”</li>
<li>“When I was kicked off my high school diving team for being a waste of space, yes, obviously, it still gets under my skin today, but I am so glad I was told that because it lit a fire. And sometimes, we need that kind of fire lit under us.”</li>
<li>“We want adversity, we want obstacles because that’s when we rise to the occasion. So I don’t think being labeled an underdog is a bad thing. I think fighting for something, it gives you that fuel—it’s just such a perfect description—that fuel to push forward and to overcome. Because you want this thing, and you’re fighting for it.”</li>
<li>“It’s okay to be sad, it’s okay to be angry, it’s okay to just lose it, and just kind of want to cry or vent or whatever, like, make sure you are allowing yourself to experience that emotion. If you are stuffing it in and trying to avoid the emotion of what happened, it will come out later in a much uglier way.”</li>
<li>“Don’t sit in the grief for, like, forever, you know, but give yourself a few days, a few weeks, whatever the timeline is, a little bit of time to process it. Then begin to create a new game plan and analyze and work on what happened and what is going to come next.”</li>
<li>“My other kids are still kind of figuring out what it is that they’re going to do. One has said she is not an athlete, she is an artist, and I respect that, although she will run sprints with me, and so that’s really cool, maybe one day she’ll go for track. But you know, I love, I love, absolutely love watching them find the thing that lights them up the way that I feel like diving lights me up.”</li>
<li>“Don’t be afraid to get more than one opinion on what your injury is. You know, one doctor doesn’t always have the answers or may not pick up everything, like, it’s okay to get two or three opinions on things to make sure you’re making the right choice.”</li>
<li>“When you have injuries, this is the number one thing I will tell people to do: take care of your injury and then train mentally. Everybody says sports is 90% mental, but no one trains that way. Not one. I can pretty much guarantee you that.”</li>
<li>“When you close your eyes as you start implementing all of your senses, you’re not just seeing it with your eyes, you can actually feel what you’re doing. You’re actually firing muscles, like, from the neurons in your brain, you’re starting to react with the right muscles that are going to be doing all of these skills. You’ll be blown away by what you can do if you do this consistently in that time.”</li>
<li>“A lot of times, the issue is not starting in the pool or in the gym. Sometimes, the issue is starting at home or in your personal life. We have this way of carrying stress and anxiety, and it begins to burden us so badly that it comes out in our sport, looking like mental blocks and things like that, or this ultimate fear that is overwhelming. And it’s actually not coming from your sport.”</li>
<li>“A lot of times, our sport, even if you’re a sprinter, the whole process is a marathon, not a sprint. So have that long-term vision and hang on to that.”</li>
<li>“I’m very, very goal-oriented. And so, even when I’ve done really awesome things, I’ve always wanted more. I’ve always strived for more, like, my whole goal wasn’t… I mean, I wanted to win the Olympics, but I also wanted to find out what I was capable of, how good can I be, how hard of dives can I do and do them really, really well, for like nines and tens.”</li>
<li>“I love training as much as I love competing. Competing is exciting and it’s fun. But the hunt to get there is almost better. Like sometimes, when you get to the meet, you’re like, man, I kind of wish it wasn’t here because I love that process. And that hunt. And that work. There’s just something so fulfilling about that to me.”</li>
<li>“My purpose doesn’t just lie in having goals. And it’s not just in what I’m doing. I know that I have worth and value because God created me, and he told me that. And, you know, for me, diving has always been a beautiful way to feel really connected with God. Because that is a gift I know he gave me, and when I do it with everything that I am, it feels like worship. And it feels beautiful and completely fulfilling to me.”</li>
<li>“I’m still learning how to not just juggle all these things, but how to, you know, shift my priorities to where diving isn’t my number one priority, my family is, and then diving will come after that. And learning that I don’t have to be so intense all the time, but I can actually just fully embrace it and enjoy every step of the way.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Laura is joined by Michael Hixon, an American diver and two-time Olympic medalist.  The pair open up the episode to talk about Hixon’s abnormally young introduction to sports.  Growing up with two parents that were collegiate coaches, he was practically raised on the basketball court and in the pool, but it wasn’t until his eighth grade year that he decided to pursue diving full time.  It would soon be a career full of seemingly unachievable goals, Olympic success, and unusual circumstances.  Michael, however, remains humble and expresses his gratitude for his parents, especially his mother, in that they never pressured him to play the sport for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>He raves about the importance of purpose based performance, and how his parents taught him that true success is hardly ever achieved when you compete for the wrong reasons. These lessons helped guide him on his Olympic journey and during his initial introduction to synchro, which, afterall, was fairly different compared to his experience previously competing alone. It was during this time period that Michael feels he honed his skills the most, perhaps due to the help of his coaches, his teammate, Andrew, or the ‘Pray for Rain’ speech from a former Olympian.  Laura and Mike draw this episode to a close as they talk about embracing hiccups and mishaps - if you welcome adversity into your life, you transform your mindset.  </p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hixon’s young introduction to sports</li>
<li>Growing up with parents who coach for a living</li>
<li>Feeling behind during his junior career</li>
<li>Why unrealistic goal setting is a strong suit for Hixon</li>
<li>The importance of having someone believe in you</li>
<li>Proving others wrong</li>
<li>Purpose based performance</li>
<li>Grounds for transferring universities</li>
<li>The redshirt process going into the Olympics</li>
<li>Hixon’s experience with synchro</li>
<li>Olympics in Rio</li>
<li>Praying for Rain</li>
<li>The Olympics during Covid</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes: </p>
<ul>
<li>“I grew up in a gym and a pool. I actually refused to go to kindergarten my first year, because I was having so much fun, and there was no way that anyone was going to ever get me to sit in a classroom when, prior to that, all I had done was play all day.”</li>
<li>“Eighth grade was when I wanted to quit playing basketball. I wanted to go fully into diving, but when you stopped growing at five foot eight, your decision’s kind of made for you.”</li>
<li>“I was diving alone in a pool with my mom and that was very isolated, absolutely. Then the other side of that is I got to go play basketball with my friends, and that was a social outlet as well - it was a ton of fun to be a part of a team.”</li>
<li>“I thought you know, ‘If I'm going to chase this guy and have the success that he's had, and get onto that international level the way he has at a young age, I've got a lot of work to do.’ To be honest, chasing him was one of the easiest ways to get better. When you have a really high standard and you hold yourself to that, that's going to push you forward quickly.”</li>
<li>“There is a difference between fear based performance and purpose based performance, and you are talking about a purpose. You had meaning to this, not pressure, not expectation.  You had a purpose doing it for somebody else– something bigger than yourself.”</li>
<li>“I think maybe the wrong reason to transfer is maybe if you think everything's supposed to be just 100% perfect, and exactly what you envision. It's just not, and understanding that going into that is important.”</li>
<li>“Whether it was this crazy wind that's blowing over, you know, the backdrop at Rio, the green pool, the food, or all these crazy little wrenches thrown into what would have been a perfect plan, we were excited for that. We weren't just okay with it. We were like, ‘This is great’.”</li>
<li>“I got off the airplane from Rio…I was listening to pump up music on the flight back. I was just so excited for what was next, and I ended up really burning myself out that next year a little bit for that reason; not taking time to maybe allow that whole situation to sink in and give respect to what had happened.”</li>
<li>“I might wake up tomorrow, and I'm going to find out at the same time as everybody else. I'm going to wake up tomorrow, and the Olympics are going to be canceled, you know. All this work, what was it for?”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Drug scandals are unfortunately notorious in sports, as the Beijing Winter Olympics so recently illustrated with its flashbacks to the vast Russian doping scandal of the 2014 Sochi Games. These doping issues have cheated many clean athletes out of their rightful medals and can take several Olympic cycles to sort out, leaving the true champions in the shadow of the doper and their scandal. Today’s guest, Allison Wagner, has very personal experience with this issue and is now in a place to start making effective changes in sport for athletes. Allison is an Olympic silver medalist, a three-time World silver medalist, a thirteen-time national champion, and even held a world record in swimming for over fourteen years. On several occasions, Allison was beaten in major championships by swimmers who are highly suspected or have proven to be users of banned performance-enhancing substances. She now works for the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) as their first Director of Athlete and International Relations. On today’s podcast, Allison shares her story and gives us a basic understanding of how the drug testing process works and our rights as athletes. We also dig into the Russian doping scandal that started way back in 2014 and what we can do as athletes and coaches to affect change.</p>
<p>Allison begins the episode with a rundown of her history as an athlete and her personal experience competing against dopers. She shares the frustration of not being protected by those in positions of power and influence and how that led to her current position working for USADA, where she’s committed to driving changes in the global anti-doping system. Allison then gives some advice for current athletes on what to do if they find themselves up against dopers and an overview of how doping controls function, including the requirements enforced by the Whereabouts System. She also explains what rights athletes have to appeal in the event they miss a test or receive a positive result. The conversation then switches gears to discuss the Russian doping scandal at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, the failure to effectively punish those involved, and the negative impact that has had on trust in governing bodies in sport. Alison points out that there are still major issues regarding trust and transparency in sports governance, as highlighted recently with the Kamila Valieva scandal at the 2022 Beijing Games, and calls out the lack of concern and acknowledgment for the harm done to the clean athletes competing against Valieva. She calls for those in positions of power to speak up and take action and suggests ways that athletes can push for change by speaking to their sponsors and representatives, emphasizing that communication is key to making those in power take notice and change their priorities.</p>

</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Over the years, these doping issues have become front and center in the news to the detriment of the clean athletes. Sometimes, several Olympic cycles will pass before athletes are even found to have cheated, and the clean athletes are finally awarded their rightful medals and place on the podium. But that’s long after the world has forgotten about the event and moved on, leaving the true champions forever in the shadows of the doper and their scandal.”</li>
<li>“That experience, for me, was gradually and more increasingly frustrating and defeating. You know, realizing that my devotion to respecting the rules and a fair playing field and respecting my competitors, you know, that devotion wasn’t being protected by those people in positions of power and influence.”</li>
<li>“This is how things change, if people get engaged and involved. While there’s a lot of room for improvement in terms of how athletes have or don’t have power, decision-making power in sport-governance structures, I think it only helps if athletes can engage.”</li>
<li>“I had a DCO once accompany me to a theater show. I had just emptied my bladder, and I had tickets to this show. And so, they just came with me. So I could, like, provide a sample again.”</li>
<li>“I think that it’s pretty unfair as an athlete to have to compete against a system that wasn’t effectively sanctioned. And what we see now is that I don’t think anybody’s really confident that they’ve not been coordinating doping amongst their athletes. And that any punishment, or the lack of punishment basically, has led us to where we are today.”</li>
<li>“It’s unfair to everybody. It’s unfair to the Olympic Games and the Olympic system overall. You know, people lost confidence in the Olympic Games being clean, they lost confidence that there would be bold action taken in response to the state-sponsored doping that was proved.”</li>
<li>“What was concerning to me as well was that there was no acknowledgment for the irreparable harm to the clean athletes in competition, as well. So it was all focused on the harm to Kamila, but what about the harm to the clean athletes and also the sport and the Olympic Games?”</li>
<li>“The Olympics in LA in 2028 are going to be a great opportunity for the US to assert concerns and create a new stage for the Olympics that is more dedicated to protecting athletes—clean athletes and athletes in general—from injustices.”</li>
<li>“The Olympic spirit, as we know, and the Olympic values are a cherished part of the Olympic movement, I think by everybody, but they’re not being sufficiently protected. And the Olympic Games are not being, and the Paralympic Games are not being sufficiently protected.”</li>
<li>“Speaking truth is something that takes, you know, courage and boldness, and it’s to be respected and supported. And I think we need more people doing that.”</li>
<li>“I’m just trying to find a way to change this, you know, I don’t want to just leave it the way it is. I love sports, and I want it to be this awesome thing for my kids coming up, for the next generations coming up. I want it to be this beautiful thing that made us fight for things and want to be these amazing people, you know, in this pure, beautiful way.”</li>
<li>“What I’m hearing is the moral of the story is we just can’t stop pushing. I guess we just need to be this consistent drumbeat where we just don’t let it go.”</li>
<li>“I’ve experienced the downsides of sports. And I am happy to keep any concerns confidential. And there will be no selling out on my behalf. Because I just, you know, I paid too high of a cost personally, for what I experienced in sport, to take anything lightly. Most especially confidence.”</li>
<li>“We need to start speaking up. We are courageous athletes, we need to be courageous people as well, you know, outside of our arena, outside of the sport, when it has to do with these things like our sport that we love.”</li>
<li>“The conversations I have with people from the IOC, WADA, and other sport-governance people is that they just have no idea. You know, they’re living in this bubble of unicorns and rainbows, and that is not in touch with the reality of how athletes fight their way through their careers oftentimes. And athletes need more support in lots of ways, and they need more advocates.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>You may know today’s guest Cecile Landi as Simone Biles’ coach or for coaching multiple gymnasts to Olympic medals, World Championship titles, and numerous full-ride scholarships to D1 schools. What you might not know is that Cecile was an Olympian herself; she claims to have been a late-bloomer, but once she made the French Senior National Gymnastics team at fifteen, there was no stopping her. Cecile competed at three European Championships, three World Championships, and the 1996 Olympic Games. She’s always up for a challenge and constantly wants to be pushed to the next level in everything she does, yet manages to maintain her calm throughout it all. Today, she walks us through her journey from gymnast to coach and how she and her husband Laurent make an unstoppable coaching duo. She also discusses the difficult time during the Tokyo Olympics last summer and the beautiful silver lining that came from it.</p>
<p>Cecile starts the episode with her story of growing up in gymnastics, telling her parents at age seven that she wanted to be an Olympian, and getting invited to the National Team Training Center at age nine. She discusses her transition from not being the hardest worker to deciding she wanted to be pushed to be better and how that let her break through to the Senior National Gymnastics Team. Cecile then gives an insight into her competitive experience, describing her favorite memories of going to her first World Championships and to the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, before moving on to describe how she decided to continue with gymnastics at the club level following her Olympics experience. She follows that up with the story of how she got into coaching and moved to the US, how she and Laurent balance their professional partnership and their marriage, and their journey to coaching at the elite level, a journey that brought them an amazing opportunity. Cecile and Laurent were on a break from coaching and in the process of buying their own gym when they got a remarkable offer—to coach record-breaking gymnast Simone Biles at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Cecile discusses how the couple couldn’t turn down the opportunity, how she coped with the pressure of training a superstar, and the impact of the pandemic on their preparations. She also goes into detail about what happened when Simone began experiencing the twisties, including how they dealt with the fallout and put together a beam routine that would win Simone and Team USA a bronze medal. And finally, Cecile discusses her latest success, winning level ten in Texas, and gives her trademark advice to other coaches—be there for your athletes and remember that it’s only gymnastics and the sun will rise tomorrow.</p>

<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I started when I was five. And it was just one club in my city of 40,000 people. And I just started because my sister started. She’s three years older than me. And by the age of nine, doing some little competition, I ended up being invited to the national team training center.”</li>
<li>“I didn’t feel pushed. And I wanted to feel it. So we had a couple of Chinese coaches that were there. And they had the best kids. And I wanted my chance to be there. And most of the people there were like, 'I don’t think you’re going to survive. I don’t think you’re strong enough to do it.' And actually, it helps me. When someone tells me I can’t do it, I’m going to prove to you that I can.”</li>
<li>“When I was younger, I wanted to be a nurse like my mom. And then she told me really early on, 'Don’t do it, it’s too hard, you don’t make money, you work too much.' And I look at her now and say, 'Look what I do. I work way too much. I don’t make a lot of money. And I’m not a nurse.'”</li>
<li>“I have a lot more respect for my coaches and anyone who coaches because it does not get any easier as the years go on. It’s just, it’s a hard job. It’s a hard job. Sometimes, a lot of people think it’s a hobby. It’s more than that. It has to be more than that.”</li>
<li>“Year by year, we just kept working. Kept working with the girls, and they were just learning so fast. And they followed our leads and the process and trusted that we had the best interest for them. And it just worked out.”</li>
<li>“We went back to Dallas, and we looked at each other, we’re like, man, we can’t pass this opportunity. We can always open a gym later. But working with the most talented athlete I’ve ever seen in my life, it’s not going to happen again.”</li>
<li>“The pressure for us was toward her, we didn’t want to disappoint her. We wanted to make sure she got the chance that she deserved. And other than that, I didn’t really care what anyone else was saying. You’re not in my shoes, and I do know that I’m doing the best that I can to help her. And as long as she knows that, then the rest doesn’t matter.”</li>
<li>“The pandemic had been such a mental struggle for everybody, but nobody wanted to talk about it. And I think she was the one who said, ‘Hey, I’m not okay. And it’s okay to not be okay. And I’m struggling.’”</li>
<li>“We started training, and something was said by our national team staff that she took wrong. And her demeanor changed. And I saw that pressure on her shoulders even showing up more, and she was not practicing as well. And that’s when she started having her first case of the twisties on the floor.”</li>
<li>“She looked at me, she looked really good. I was pretty confident that, you know, she was okay. But she said as soon as she stepped into the arena and the lights, something just clicked, and she just lost her confidence in everything, and she started panicking, but didn’t want to say anything, so went for the vault.”</li>
<li>“She said, ‘Those girls, they need a medal, they deserve a medal, and they will get a medal without me. If I compete, we’re done.’”</li>
<li>“In a sport like gymnastics where, like you said, you’re landing on a hard surface, and if you don’t know right side up from upside down, and you land on your head, you break your neck, like this could be it, you know, like, like life-altering, ending.”</li>
<li>“Understanding what she couldn’t do in that moment, to say she couldn’t compete, I feel like was a very impressive thing to do. I’m actually really, really impressed by that choice that she made. I think that was really smart. But it had to be excruciatingly hard.”</li>
<li>“When she hit that dismount, that was just, the relief, like, she did it, she’s safe, she competed the way she wanted to compete. She proved to herself that she could do it, and it’s going to help her on the healing process. For me, that was what was important. It was, I know if she can do this, it’s going to help her.”</li>
<li>“Time will tell what she decides to do. We told her, if you come back again, it has to be for you. Can’t be for us, can’t be for anyone else but yourself. And we’ll be here if you want us to be.”</li>
<li>“Even if it’s an individual sport, they’ve noticed that they only get better if the team is better. And so that’s why, really, we want them to understand, the stronger your team is, the stronger you’re going to be.”</li>
<li>“At the end of the day, you are here for the athletes. They’re not here for you. You’re here for them. It’s your job to figure out how you can help them become their best. And the sun will rise tomorrow. It’s only gymnastics. It’s going to be okay if today is not perfect.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Laura catches up with her dear friend, fellow competitive platform diver, and bridesmaid in her wedding, Cristi Christensen. Originally an elite-level gymnast, Cristi went on to train with the US Olympic diving team as a young adult. After an injury cut her Olympic dreams short, Cristi shifted her focus to helping others improve their level of fitness through personal training, Pilates, Core Fusion, and yoga. In addition to a degree in Kinesiology, Cristi has studied extensively for over 10 years with world-renowned teachers including Saul David Raye, Shiva Rea, Seane Corn, Elisabeth Halfpapp, and Fred DeVito.</p>

Cristi also details her experience as a global traveling yoga teacher, how the pandemic caused her to pivot yet again, and the outcome of her most recent pivot. The episode draws to a close with an overview of Cristi's work to expand the definition of wellness and well-being, and how her style of yoga brings her back to how she grew up. Cristi’s story of responding to injuries with her determination to bounce back, keep learning and moving forward will captivate and inspire all who listen into this fascinating conversation today.</p>

</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“My mom was like ‘No more. No more. I know it’s your dream but we’re not risking you being paralyzed.’ And there was no pushing… that was the end of my gymnastics career.”</li>
<li>“That’s just so quick though, too. I mean, you go for a summer, doing a sport you’ve never done, and you just decide to move for your last two years of high school. Like, that’s pretty intense. But it sounds like that’s kind of the way you roll.”</li>
<li>“I did shatter my left hand into a million pieces. Basically, I had three metal plates and 22 screws to put it back together.”</li>
<li>“And that’s where joy, like a joy of movement, started coming back. My body was healing, I was connecting to my breath.”</li>
<li>“But now I had a new lens on it, because the practice I was doing was healing me and I wanted to be able to share that with others… I taught tons of different fitness classes and was still doing yoga as my personal practice… yoga really opened me up in a way that I didn’t even know I was closed.”</li>
<li>“Every time you show up and do it, those voices will get smaller.”</li>
<li>“I had some really bizarre instances that just made it so, so clear that the way I was living and the way I was working were no longer in alignment.”</li>
<li>“I got to a point where the fear of if I failed was much smaller than the fear of actually staying and staying small and staying trapped in something.”</li>
<li>“Over the years it evolved… how could something that was so right, now be something that’s actually a detriment to the evolution of my career or the evolution of where in my soul I believe I wanted to go?”</li>
<li>“I just thought I was going to be hanging out in LA for six months, like figuring it out… but as the opportunities came, I was like, ‘Well, I just have to say yes’.”</li>
<li>“I didn’t realize I had all my eggs in one basket; I thought I was diversified.”</li>
<li>“Everything I teach is based off of ‘how can we use this as a map for our own empowerment, our own awakening, so that we can live a life that is full of color and rich in love and passion and freedom, but really be grounded in this very human experience and be able to deal with everything that life brings?’”</li>
<li>“The whole idea was to share women’s stories… I want more women’s voices to be heard. I want more kids growing up to have more access to role models from different backgrounds.”</li>
<li>“I’m not teaching a routine. It’s not like ‘5, 6, 7, 8’. It’s actually getting you to a place that you feel free enough to express and to move and to breathe, and just enjoy the aliveness and the power pulsing through your body - letting it move, letting the emotions move, letting everything just flow.

<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode, Laura’s guest is her dear friend and forever teammate, Hank Richardson. Hank earned a full scholarship for diving to the University of Florida, where he went on to become a ten-time All-American, a US national champion, and a national team member for USA diving. Hank retired from diving when he graduated from college, but some of his old injuries continued to plague him long after he left the pool, the pain becoming so severe that it started to impact his ability to enjoy work. At the urging of a friend, Hank tried a Pilates/yoga/ballet hybrid class and found himself at the beginning of something special: not only did he start managing his pain and experiencing relief, but it led to him teaching classes, opening new studios, and going back to school to get a Master’s in business. His senior project in his MBA program became the foundation on which his health and well-being studio, DEFINE, was created. DEFINE has now expanded throughout Houston, the US, and across the globe, but pain management and physical fitness are only part of Hank’s passion. He is also a well-being and positive psychology expert, and today, he and Laura discuss positive ways to reframe your thinking and how positive psychology can help and impact athletes on their journey to greatness.</p>
<p>First, Hank gives us the lowdown on his remarkable journey, from learning to dive at Camp Longhorn to becoming a champion diver, and giving up diving because of a back injury, before sharing how he transitioned from teaching to fitness instruction to business school. Then he tells the story of surviving month-to-month when launching DEFINE and how he expanded the business into a global franchise, including how he survived COVID by pivoting into online services. Next, Hank talks about his decision to go back to school to get his Master’s degree in applied positive psychology and how it has influenced his worldview and business, with DEFINE shifting into a well-being hub with a mission to enrich its members’ lives. He also has some advice on how to incorporate positive psychology into your everyday life and how it can help athletes develop resiliency and focus on strengths rather than weaknesses, as well as how meditation and mindfulness can work in partnership to improve self-awareness and enable positivity. Laura then asks Hank about his partnership with Education Based Housing, a nonprofit working with cost-burdened households to provide access to quality housing, and Hank discusses his passion for creating circles of well-being within communities and how DEFINE will offer well-being services through this partnership. And finally, Hank offers his thoughts on what has made DEFINE so successful, pointing to its mission to offer a service that truly helps its communities, and gives some advice to current athletes and coaches, emphasizing the importance of focusing on personal strengths and creatively applying them in challenging situations.</p>
<p>Hank’s story of determination, resiliency, and willingness to keep learning and developing will captivate and inspire athletes and non-athletes alike to focus on their strengths, keep a positive outlook, and never give up on their dreams.</p>

</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Diving, it truly was a way of utilizing movement as a self-expression. And you know, the many lessons that all of us learned in diving, the overcoming fears, the setting goals and accomplishing them, the concept of resiliency, even during injuries, etc. It’s such a powerful, powerful sport.”</li>
<li>“Being a student athlete, you are literally performing a job in some ways. You are studying for school, you’re going to school, you’re training first thing in the morning, you’re training in the evening, you’re eating, I mean, it’s very regimented. Right. And I know for a fact, it made me a much stronger, better person. But I remember that first year being like, oh my gosh, I don’t know if I can continue doing this.”</li>
<li>“The good thing about the mindset that, really, work being physically hard created is that when we got to the end of the year, I actually really knew I deserved it. I was like, I’ve worked so hard, I deserve to do well at this NCAA championship. And so that worked, but at the same time, by the end of the year, I was a little burnt out physically, mentally, emotionally.”</li>
<li>“It’s called spondylolisthesis. And you know, it’s manageable. A lot of people have to have fusions done. But that’s really how I started getting into the next phase of my life, which was really getting into yoga and Pilates to help to prevent to have to have the fusion.”</li>
<li>“When I started thinking about the classes and the things that I really, really loved, it was centered around psychology, it was centered around education, it was around mindset. And so I applied for this program called Teach for America. And they placed me to teach sixth-graders in the South Bronx, and it was truly a life-transforming experience.”</li>
<li>“I give all the respect in the world to schoolteachers. Any school has its challenges, any grade level has its challenges. And so working with the various teachers that were in our public school setting just gave me the most utmost respect for what school teachers do on a daily basis.”</li>
<li>“I never really thought of myself as being, like, a fitness instructor as my goal in all of this, but I loved working with clients, I loved working with people. And that has been kind of the consistent theme for me throughout. And when you believe in a product or a service so much because of its own transformative benefits that you’ve received, it’s impossible to not want to share that, truly.”</li>
<li>“My professor, within that same timeframe, said something that changed my life. He said, ‘You know what? Don’t take a job just because it’s available.’ He said, ‘Do something that will define your role in this world.’ And I, literally, the light bulb went off, the chills in my body. And I’ll be honest, because it’s a process of overcoming fear in many ways, just like diving, that I was like, I don’t know if I’m going to open up a studio, but if I do, I know I’m going to name it ‘Define.’”</li>
<li>“There are also a lot of negatives, challenges, that can also happen because of the franchise model. And a lot of it is because the mindset of a franchisee is that they own a business, whereas really, they’re just licensing the name and the services of the business.”</li>
<li>“Once COVID hit, it was a survival mindset and a little bit of a free-for-all. And truly, people felt like they had to do whatever they needed to do to make sure that they survived, and we really responded quickly by pivoting. Within just a few days, our entire business shifted online, we started Zoom classes, we had an on-demand platform.”</li>
<li>“The concept is that if we’re just focusing on our weaknesses, well, that’s how we’re going to feel when we’re living our lives. Versus if we can put our energy and focus on our strengths, then it’s going to have that ability for us to find more of a state of flow, more of a state of ease and also be able to be more proficient.”</li>
<li>“It’s not simply about just being focused on the good, right? It’s also coming up with a plan for when things don’t go the way you expected, how to kind of overcome that.”</li>
<li>“What I ultimately realized is that what meditation is doing is it’s training us simply to become more aware. More aware of our internal dialogue, more aware of the stories we tell about other people or ourselves, more aware of truly how we feel being around certain people, or how we feel about, you know, certain activities that we do.”</li>
<li>“I love the analogy for meditation where it’s like, you know, you can go a couple of days without showering and not a lot of people notice, but after a while, you know, people are gonna notice, right? And I feel the same way about my meditation. Like, I can go a couple days, and it’s not a big deal. But if I go for more than three, four, or five days, my attitude’s a little stinky.”</li>
<li>“One of my huge passions is about supporting and providing and helping to create circles of, you know, well-being if you will, and support. I feel like the studio business, it caters to a very specific demographic, and that demographic is people who can afford to come and take those types of services. And there’s so much that could be done and said in our world that could help various people.”</li>
<li>“Walking into the store of DEFINE, it needs to be an experience, and that experience should be, you know, welcoming, it should be truly nurturing in many ways, but at the same time pushing you and challenging you enough to get something out of it. So I think people come to us for that reason.”</li>
<li>“It’s important that we focus on strengths. And as a mentor or as an athlete, it’s important for us to help discover that strength, whether it’s a parent role, or a mentor role, or a coaching role, helping to really look at the strength of the individual.”</li>
<li>“Instead of using some of their weaknesses, which is very common in a challenging situation, we can now train ourselves to look at our strengths and use creative ways of applying that to our lives.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s guest is Tamyra Mensah-Stock, an American freestyle wrestler who won Olympic gold for the USA, becoming the first African-American and second American female athlete to win a gold in 68 kgs freestyle wrestling in the Olympics. In her journey to this remarkable level of success, Tamyra has also encountered and persevered through a number of difficulties and today she shares her inspiring story with us all.</p>
<p>She opens up the episode by describing her transition from life as a sprinter into that of a wrestler.  While Tamyra didn’t love the sport at first, it became a big part of her life that stayed with her through bouts of loss and depression.  She goes on to talk about meeting her husband and their decision to move to Colorado to train for the Olympics.  Some rough patches followed her through 2016, but she notes that these tough times really taught her the importance of faith and compartmentalization. Tamyra also notes that COVID gave her a much needed breather that allowed her to prepare for the Olympics. She was incredibly successful in the 2021 Olympic Games, and in the wake of vaccine mandates, she’s become a key supporter for Athletes for Medical Freedom. She makes it clear that she isn’t anti vaccine, she’s anti mandate, and, to close out this week’s episode, she expresses gratitude for Athletes for Medical Freedom, because it taught her how to use her voice.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transitioning from sprinting to wrestling</li>
<li>Tamyra’s experience confronting the death of family and friends</li>
<li>How she met her husband</li>
<li>Making the decision to move to Colorado Springs for Olympic training</li>
<li>Learning to compartmentalize and trust in her faith</li>
<li>Why COVID was a breath of fresh air</li>
<li>Tamyra in the 2020 Olympic Games</li>
<li>Athletes for Medical Freedom</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<p>“For some reason, back in the day, I was an early riser, and I loved going to school when it was dark and there was nobody around. There was just some kind of freedom about that.”</p>
<p>“I don't blame wrestling now because it has given me the platform to identify with people who have dealt with the struggle.”</p>
<p>“You cannot succeed without a little loss.”</p>
<p>“Some people in college had asked me why am I dating a white man. And I went, ‘You never asked me out. You never showed me any consideration that you wanted to date me. Jacob took the initiative.’”</p>
<p>“When you are wrestling for one of the biggest tournaments ever, stay in the moment and leave the mat with no regrets.”</p>
<p>“COVID was a blessing. I just had time to breathe. I came up with a great win. And I could just relax and it was awesome. And once the Olympics came around, I came to destroy.”</p>
<p>“When you go to the Olympics, you're going to represent whatever country you are representing, and I'm proud to be an American. And I got up on that stage, I represented America, and I was extremely happy. I've been doing this since 2008 - wanting to go on that stage - nobody was gonna take that away from me.”</p>
<p>“They're just trying to mandate the vaccine. And I'm fine with vaccinations. But when you force people to do things, that's where the line gets really skewed.”</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>When he was just nineteen, Ryan Campbell flew 24,000 nautical miles on thirty-five stops in fifteen countries in just seventy days and was recognized as the first teenager in history to fly around the world solo by the Guinness Book of World Records. His critically-acclaimed book Born to Fly, which detailed this amazing journey, was nationally celebrated, and Ryan was on top of the world… until tragedy struck. At twenty-one, Ryan barely survived a devastating, life-changing plane crash, suffering broken bones from head to toe that left him in hospital for five months, followed by eighteen months of rehabilitation. Yet, refusing to accept his doctors’ diagnosis of paraplegia, Ryan fought back, using his desire to fly again as fuel for his painful yet triumphant recovery. In this episode, Ryan shares his journey from record-setting victory to backbreaking defeat and how he developed the mindset and toolbox necessary to ride out life’s toughest bumps.</p>
<p>Ryan starts the conversation by sharing how he fell in love with flying and set about making it his career before hitting upon the idea to break a world record. He lets us in on the process of fundraising a quarter of a million dollars at just nineteen while gaining flight experience and gives us insight into the remarkable, record-breaking flight itself, including the incredible sights and how he and his crew kept their heads under pressure. Ryan then provides an emotional account of the plane crash that nearly killed him and left him diagnosed as paraplegic, stuck in hospital with a long journey of recovery in front of him. He tells us how he drew inspiration and learned perspective from a fellow patient and developed the mindset toolbox, the idea that we all have a mental toolbox we can fill with tools to help us navigate change, challenge, crisis, and adversity. He also explains how his own toolbox helped him not only become tough and lean into his recovery but also to accept and adjust to long-term disability without letting it hold him back. In fact, he was even able to get back in the cockpit and fly again, keeping that intrinsic part of himself that he almost lost. Finally, Ryan tells us about his plans to get married, his move into motivational speaking, and why a pink Cadillac has become an important symbol for his attitude toward life.</p>
<p>Ryan’s resilience, determination, and fighting spirit are sure to inspire as he shares his emotional and uplifting journey from glory to tragedy and back to happiness.</p>

<ul>
<li>How Ryan fell in love with flying and set about becoming a pilot at fourteen</li>

<li>The Pink Cadillac</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<p>“So we’re actually invited to go up and visit a cockpit as three young boys, and I tell you what, that’s pretty incredible. Eyes wide, amazed at the buttons and switches, super-stoked to meet the pilots, I thought they were the coolest people that ever walked the Earth. And that was it, that was the day that six-year-old Ryan discovered his passion, and that would be all things aviation.”</p>
<p>“Fifteen years old, this kid’s flying an airplane on his own, and I was jealous. Like, I was envious, I couldn’t believe this was legal. It just blew my mind.”</p>
<p>“The day that I turned fifteen, I went to the airport, I practiced some takeoffs and landings with my flying instructor. And then he told me to take him back to the hangar, not to shut the airplane down. He got out of that airplane, did up his seatbelts, he took his headset. He said, ‘Don’t forget to lock the door, go and have fun.’”</p>
<p>“I saw something I wanted, I started to kind of research how to do it, I put a plan in place, I worked really, really hard, I gave up on a bunch of stuff to be able to make it happen and ultimately found success in that. And that was a pretty powerful lesson to have when you’re fifteen.”</p>
<p>“I went to Google, and I googled ‘how to fly solo around the world,’ right? Legitimate Google search.”</p>
<p>“At that point, it wasn’t about precision. It was just about progress, doing something.”</p>
<p>“I often tell people, I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to rent a car at an airport under the age of twenty-five, it’s very, very hard. Under the age of twenty-one, it’s borderline impossible, right? But trying to rent a million-dollar, single-engine airplane at seventeen, eighteen, nineteen to fly it around the world was an incredibly tough sell.”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, we had to take 24,000 miles and split it up into not just legs but little tasks. So this wasn’t a 24,000-mile flight around the world. This was thirty-five A-to-B flights that happened to connect the dots around the globe, but then every single flight was broken down into jobs.”</p>
<p>“What really mattered was the impact we had on some many different people.”</p>
<p>“The reality was that my entire life had changed. The very thing that had given me my identity and made me who I was, at that point in time, was now the very thing that had taken it all away.”</p>
<p>“I’d been to the top. And even though I couldn’t see it then, I look at this as my biggest gift: I had now been to the bottom. And the opportunity to compare those two, to ask ourselves a couple of really important questions, where do we truly learn what makes us the very best version of ourselves? They are the powerful questions that I had now the real-life experiences to pull apart and find myself.”</p>
<p>“Adversity is a byproduct of breathing, and turbulence is a part of life. And it comes down, at the end of the day, to how tough and resilient you are and how willing you are to tackle the mountain that’s ahead and get up every single time you’re knocked down. And it comes back to understanding that resilience is a learned and refined skill.”</p>
<p>“Every day in hospital, I could go to the gym, and I could move a muscle, and I could build strength, and I could see progress. That progress is what gave purpose to the pain. Right? That’s what made me get up the next day, get back in the wheelchair, go back to that rehabilitation gym.”</p>
<p>“Every single one of us is born with a toolbox. It’s really big, it has drawers and wheels, we take it with us wherever we go in life. Now, the aim of the game is to fill that toolbox with tools, tools that we can use to navigate change, challenge, crisis, and adversity, right? To make us turbulence tough.”</p>
<p>“I’m now walking independently and shuffling around, kind of, you know, getting where I want on my own two feet. The way that we arrived at that point was by kind of making a pact and understanding that no one was going to give me, you know, a great outcome. I had to work for it.”</p>
<p>“You have to kind of come to terms with aviation from a different set of eyes. That it is safe. It is incredible. It is part of who I am. And you know, to be back up there is what ultimately was the end goal, and we made it happen.”</p>
<p>“We like to say go and do something that, you know, may not be logical, you know, may not be financially sensible, but it makes you smile like a kid. Once you do that, you start to show up better in all areas of your life.”</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode, Jane Figueiredo joins Laura Wilkinson to discuss her long standing career as a one-time Olympian and diving coach for the British and Russian Olympic teams and the University of Houston. Among her many accomplishments, Jane was named the NCAA Diving Coach of the Year four times and has coached a number of international divers, including multiple divers, including Tom Daley, to Olympic medals.</p>
<p>She opens the episode by recounting how she made the leap from her home in South Africa and Zimbabwe to Houston, as well as her experience of becoming a diving Olympian for team Portugal before becoming a coach.  Jane goes on to discuss her coaching career, attributing much of her success in this field to being in the right place at the right time. She also highlights what she learned by working with the Russian Olympic Diving Team, and also by working with Tom Daley. Taking a note from Laura’s book, Jane notes that she has started valuing the importance of mental preparedness more, and encouraging her athletes to focus less on medals, and more on striving to be the best they can. This fascinating interview draws to close with Jane sharing her plans for the future. </p>
<p>Episode Highlights: </p>
<ul>
<li>Growing up in Zimbabwe</li>
<li>Coaching at University of Houston </li>
<li>Olympian for one year on Portugal’s team</li>
<li>International presence</li>
<li>The importance of being in the right place at the right time</li>
<li>Figueiredo’s time working as a coach for the Russian team</li>
<li>Lessons learned from team Russia </li>
<li>Presently coaching British team</li>
<li>Tom Daley and his strong work ethic and need for planning</li>
<li>How Tom made her a better listener</li>
<li>Tom’s lack of success in Rio</li>
<li>Confidence going into Tokyo</li>
<li>The importance of mental preparedness </li>
<li>Focus on being the best you can be; not gold medals  </li>
<li>Jane plans to return to London to prepare for Paris Olympics</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes: </p>
<p>“Obviously, I was born and raised in Southern Africa. And we had, believe it or not, a deep history of diving. Most of the divers that ever came out of Zimbabwe, all dove in the States on scholarship.”</p>
<p>“There is certainly an extra drive, because you’ve got to understand, a lot of them… they live with their parents for many years into their adult life. So they don't have the same opportunities that American kids have. So yes, the drive is certainly there to try to better themselves in a different way.”</p>
<p>“My technical knowledge exploded because once I started coaching Vera Ilyina I understood they coached me on twisting technique. Because I would ask a lot of questions.”</p>
<p>“In the US, we never had trials, and nobody used dry land, whereas in the Russian system, it was 80% dry land. And that's where they develop their divers, in dry land. And then the other 20% was, ‘Okay, let's have a look in the pool.’”</p>
<p>“Tom called me and said, ‘Hey Jane, I want to come over and chat with you. Can I come train with you?’ I said, “Sure, you can come.” And– I thought he was coming in two weeks. He said, ‘I'll be there tomorrow morning.’”</p>
<p>“I'm pretty satisfied with my career and the college thing had gone really, really well, and I was okay. I was happy with myself, and then he came along, and I was just like, ‘Oh, my God, this is just, Oh, my God, he's got me.’”</p>
<p>“I'm happy to admit that as an elite coach, we become quite controlling, because we want to try to control all of it. Sure. We want to try to control the mindset, the physicality, the emotion, the private, because all of it contributes to whether you're successful or not. And then I had to really just let some of it go.”</p>
<p>“We talked too much about winning the gold medal, and I think that puts so much pressure and expectation on you. And that when you don't deliver, it's like you go below the surface. It's like the iceberg below the water. And so we decided, I don't want to hear a word about it.  Don't let me hear you, in any interview, talk about a gold medal. I don't want to hear about it. Do not say a single word.”</p>
<p>“Life does not go exactly to schedule. So you know, maybe the event gets postponed, maybe you're up there getting ready to do front, four and a half. And they blow the whistle just as you're running because something's fallen in the pool. I said, ‘Tom, I'm going to schedule this out. But the only thing that I want you to always remember is that things can change.’”</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>With the Winter Olympic Games upon us, it's perfectly fitting to bring Lauren Gibbs back on the show. If you haven't already heard Lauren's incredible journey from the corporate world to the Olympic podium in just three years while in her 30s, all you need to do is go back to Episode 6 - 'You're Never Too Old To Dream Big with Olympic Medalist' - and listen to her hilarious and wild journey into the world of bobsled. Throughout her career, she has made eight national teams, competed in 44 World Cups, and has won 17 World Cup medals, two World Championship medals, one of which was gold in 2020, and an Olympic medal in 2018. Today, Lauren provides an update on her incredible story.</p>
<p>She picks up the story at the point where the pandemic began to derail training and sponsorships, and goes on to describe the mindset shift she went through and the value of always being ready to pivot. As always, Lauren is open, candid, and vulnerable, as she discusses not being chosen for the Olympic team a second time, the struggle of keeping a certain weight to compete, and how she became friends with her competitors. She also offers some great advice about learning how to tell your story to attract sponsors and supporters, and about different apps to help athletes on various stages of their journey. Lauren finishes up by giving us a rundown of athletes to keep an eye out for at the Winter Games, and an update on what she is up to these days, especially her work with Heroic. A remarkable woman with an equally remarkable story to share, Lauren Gibbs demonstrates once again here today that she is a talented, resilient, and inspiring individual from whom we can all learn so very much about both sport and life in general.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lauren Gibb's astonishing career from age 30</li>
<li>How she was affected by the pandemic</li>
<li>Lauren's work with Kara Winger on Parity</li>
<li>How she pivoted and supported herself with COVID and the Tokyo games being postponed</li>
<li>Lauren's physical, emotional, and mental state</li>
<li>Her advice and insight for aspiring athletes</li>
<li>The value of sharing your story in your athletic career</li>
<li>Her transformation from high school and college to now</li>
<li>The difference between quitting and knowing when it's time to move on</li>
<li>The uniqueness of bobsled and how Lauren navigated its complexity</li>
<li>The adrenaline letdown after success</li>
<li>Lauren's friendship and connection with Kaillee Humphries and Elana Meyers Taylor</li>
<li>The competitive dynamics among women in the same team in sports</li>
<li>The challenges women face in sports, particularly Olympics</li>
<li>Insights on the upcoming Winter Sports and exciting newcomers</li>
<li>Update on what Lauren is currently doing</li>
<li>Details about Heroic and her work there</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>"It's been tough to see people struggle. I've been very fortunate, but I enjoy life with other people. And so, to see people around you and people you don't know struggling is always hard. My heart goes out to anybody that's been adversely affected by the pandemic. That's a lot of people."</li>
<li>"Then, when the pandemic hit, everything went away. And it was a quick lesson to me on how quickly life can change and how you have to prepare for a pivot. So you always have to be ready for a pivot."</li>
<li>"Olympics was never my end goal when I started bobsled, which I think sounds probably crazy to most people."</li>
<li>"You have to figure out what your story is because everybody has a story that people can learn and grow from."</li>
<li>"People just want to know about real people. They want to know about your struggles, successes, and the weird things you do in your sport that people would never think of. So share as much as yourself as feels comfortable, but also remember, once you share it, you can't take it back. So really show up as yourself."</li>
<li>"Don't try and be this person you think everybody wants to see or hear from because no matter who you are, there's enough people in this world that your story will click with - the people that it needs to click with."</li>
<li>"As someone who's on the other side, I can't wait to help athletes that need help in their journey because people help me. So I think just realize that more people out there want to help you than you think. So you’ve got to share your story and figure out what you're all about."</li>
<li>"I was one of those people who were fairly good at a lot of things. And so, when things got difficult, I would just quit. And I've realized that quitting feels worse than failing. And I was always more afraid of failure than I was excited for success, that I would quit before I got there. I've learned that that's more dissatisfying because you don't really learn anything from just quitting."</li>
<li>"That conversation with my dad was such a gift. He wasn't telling me that the Olympics weren't worth my time or worthless. Basically, he was telling me that the Olympics don't define Lauren Gibbs. And it can be so easy for an athlete to feel defined by their successes or losses in a sport. That's unhealthy. That's not good. You should do it because you love it. "</li>
<li>"You are not your sport; your sport is something that you do."</li>
<li>"If you're depending on this result to change how you feel about life or yourself, whether you get the result or not, it's not going to do it."</li>
<li>"That's how you become a leader at anything. You have a goal in mind, and you work towards that daily. It really focuses on the small wins and the daily activity and then having this great support system."</li>

</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“At the age of five, when I was young, I really really had this lifelong dream of being an Olympian one day.”</li>
<li>“You're always having to use your visual awareness to spot where you are. And make changes based on where you are. So I learned that through trampoline, and that actually really progressed well into my diving career.”</li>
<li>“I've had two big struggles in learning how to make a proper entry. And also learning how to get the rhythm and the timing with the springboard, because also trampoline is very quick - quick twitch muscle work.”</li>
<li>“I competed platform in the 2016 Olympic Trials because we weren't quite there yet with springboard. And my coach had always said, Give it time. Because springboard diving...you need time to develop the skill of it.”</li>
<li>“I came into the team mid-semester, so in January. And I had to learn all my springboard dives for 1-meter/3-meter before Conference in February.”</li>
<li>“I think the biggest thing was just trusting my coach [Jianli You], because I knew that she has the knowledge and the skill to teach me, whatever it is. I'm learning and I have the talent to try it. And it only takes me trying it to learn something new.”</li>
<li>“That was the trip that made me stronger as a diver and as a person.”</li>
<li>“I really gained a whole other level of respect for my coach at that time, because I really saw how respected she is amongst all the Chinese coaches and athletes.”</li>
<li>“For me, it really made me appreciate my sport and my country and our freedom to choose to be able to do sports.”</li>
<li>“I think that was the biggest takeaway for me from the trials is just feeling like I fit in. But I know that there's still more in me and I still need to learn more in order to get to that point.”</li>
<li>“We really did take a step back from platform at that time. Then springboard started to pick up, and I was competing in it at all the Nationals and getting better and better.”</li>
<li>“The springboard is very similar to trampoline, and I can do a lot of the same skills that I would typically do on a trampoline as well.”</li>
<li>“I was coaching our club team. And that's really the majority of where I got money in order to survive and make a living. And so I was starting to see things from a coaching perspective, which actually helped me as an athlete as well.”</li>
<li>“That's been a big learning lesson as I transition from a college athlete to now a professional athlete, is just to really pay attention to everything that surrounds me as an athlete, and what's going to help me achieve my dream.”</li>
<li>“My first ever international competition was the World Championships in 2017.”</li>
<li>“Coming back from that competition, I really had done a lot of processing and journaling, writing things down of what went wrong. What I learned was my mentality going into this event - I really learned that I had put a lot of pressure on myself. And nobody else did that. I was the one that did it to myself.”</li>
<li>“I really needed to learn from that. And not necessarily get dragged down by the failure of it. But stepping into, kind of, that failure and learning from it, and then growing from it, and taking the next step into the next chapter, and facing what happened… These competitions were actually the ones that I've learned and grown the most from.”</li>
<li>“I think my mentality through all my injuries really helped me through the pandemic, because it was really, Be stronger than you were before the injury. And coming into the pandemic, I could see it two different ways - I could see it as a disappointment and as a setback. Or I could see it as an opportunity and an area to grow, and another year of training, which is really beneficial for me because I’m still a new diver.”</li>
<li>“I really chose to look at it that way and took that mentality from the injury standpoint and said, Hey, I'm going to be stronger than I was before the pandemic.”</li>
<li>“For me, it's a performance. I love getting out there and just showing off what I love to do.”</li>
<li>“That was just a beautiful, beautiful moment for me to receive [my Olympic ring] from you. And you're telling the story - I'm still getting chills because it's special for me.”</li>
<li>“For me, what keeps me grounded is reading the Bible and getting my time with God.”</li>
<li>“At that point, [Coach Jianli You] knew that I had medaled. And so I gave her this big hug. And she just held me tight. And she just said, We did it. We did it. And so that's just - that was a beautiful moment.”</li>
<li>“I don't think this is my peak performance as a diver... I know that there's so much more that I still have left in me.”</li>

<li>“That's, like, the joy when I think about playing football - how it made people feel.”</li>
<li>“The power of just having one person believe in you like that one coach when everybody else is saying ‘No’, it makes a huge difference.”</li>
<li>“It was really hard to mess up in Denver, they just had it down. That's probably one of the most professional teams I've ever played for, and it showed by us winning and everybody loved each other, and everybody helped each other. It was amazing.”</li>
<li>“We're all going to go through stuff, and it's how you handle it that's going to grow you as a person and your character and who you are the rest of your life beyond your sport, too.”</li>
<li>“Fear is feeling excited and ready.”</li>
<li>“Now today, what I do is I'm thankful for everything that happens.”</li>
<li>“Hard work, dedication, drive, and just willing to do what you have to do and just not ever giving up on your goal.”</li>
<li>“I hope everybody else that I'm playing with feels like they're the best because that's the type of players I want to play with.”</li>
<li>“You tell me I can't do it, I'm going to find a way to prove you wrong.”</li>
<li>“You made this choice to enjoy it and to have fun and playing the game the whole time.”</li>
<li>“The reason I'm playing is for family.”</li>
<li>“I learned discipline, hard work, to be honest, from my mom.”</li>
<li>“It turned out to be the best thing that happened to me because I think if I wouldn't have gotten hurt early on, I don't think my body would have held up as long as it did.”</li>
<li>“They always kept me grounded and humble, like, you know, and I kept that with me my whole football career.”</li>
<li>“I wanted to get 10 years and I felt like if I got 10 years and that's like my goal, that's like my gold medal.”</li>
<li>“I love your mental mindset. I love your passion, your gratitude, you're always so thankful for every opportunity, good and bad. I love that you showed us your purpose that's beyond yourself, your unwavering belief in your dreams.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Joining Laura on the podcast this week are Dr. Chad Carlson and Dr. Brian Bolt, two guys from rival schools who came together with a common purpose: to think deeply about sport and faith. They both grew up as competitive athletes and are now coaches and sports scholars, Brian as the Dean of Education at Calvin University, and Chad as a Professor and Director of General Education at Hope College. They have also teamed up to create the ‘Sport. Faith. Life.’ podcast which they describe as ‘a conversation that meets at the intersection of sport and faith’. After hosting the 2nd Global Congress on Sport and Christianity at Calvin University in October 2019, our two guests made a commitment to continue to explore the athletic world through the lens of Christianity, and that is precisely what they do hear today.</p>
<p>In today’s episode, Chad and Brian discuss the connection between sports and faith., concepts like forgiveness, and how sports can become a part of one’s identity. Together, they also delve into viewing sports as a form of play, how not everybody is drawn to the idea of competition, and how sports must be enjoyed at the moment. They conclude by exploring athletes’ mental health and the sense of loss they feel after certain events such as the Olympics, and by discussing how to view sports as a separate space from other things in life. Filled with ideas regarding how to lead with grace, call for truth, and be a light on a very diverse team, today’s conversation is enlightening, informative, and, above all, one you do not want to miss.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competition in sports: the good side and the bad side</li>
<li>Comparisons that people make while playing sports</li>
<li>Sports and their impact on one’s identity</li>
<li>How human beings are meant to be playful</li>
<li>Forgiveness and the concept of a community</li>
<li>Selfishness in sports and attributions people make for their successes or failures</li>
<li>Mental health and sports</li>
<li>Redemption in sports</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘‘And we see this, especially those who are in Olympic sports, where, you know, it’s not like you play Major League Baseball, where if you don’t do well, one day, you get a chance to the next day, right?”</li>
<li>“And what’s so interesting about athletes or successful people in some ways is that they attribute failure to things outside themselves.’’</li>
<li>“And so, from a faith perspective, I think it’s a reminder to us that when we watch our heroes, we’re watching real people with skin and flesh and people who are dealing with real everyday issues. That’s important for us to remember in the midst of our heroism - the way in which we worship athletes at times, for sure.’’</li>
<li>“And then we also need to take a step back with someone we trust - a coach, a teammate, somebody - and logically look at what happened without the emotion and learn from it instead of just blaming all the time. Because I’ve had teammates who blame judges, who blame this, that, and the other all the time.’’</li>
<li>“If you use your energy to fix what you're doing wrong, instead of blaming other people, you might actually be a better athlete.”</li>
<li>“There are experiences that we have on Earth, that may be glimpses of Heaven, and when we're at play, we're doing something because the joy of it is in the doing. We're experiencing that Kingdom at hand.”</li>
<li>“I have parents that ask me all the time, like, ‘How can I make my kid more passionate?’ and, like, you’ve just got to let them fail. Like, if he fails and he wants to keep going, like, he’ll find the passion.’’</li>

<li>“And then, every once in a while, like, as humans, we’re just not reliable, we’re not reliable to our own commitments.”</li>
<li>“But regardless of who’s there watching, you know…you’ve accomplished something that you set out to do so many years earlier, and it’s an incredible feeling.’’</li>

<li>“And when I woke up from this coma, a few days later, I still have this respirator down my throat. And so, I couldn’t talk. But I wrote out on a piece of paper that I was given a choice and I chose to stay.’’</li>
<li>“I was just hanging on, and also incredibly grateful, like to have the opportunity to hang on and fight. And so, gratitude became a big part of not just a practice, but to be honest, like a very natural organic thing for me, because every day I woke up and I was alive, I was grateful whether I’d lost my legs or not.’’</li>
<li>“And I remember at one point saying, ‘I don’t know if I can do this, but if anybody can, it’s going to be me.’ ‘’</li>
<li>“I needed a community of people who are like me, and it didn’t really exist and needed something to pull it together.’’</li>

<ul>
<li>“Faith and determination separate the good from the great.”</li>
<li>“Just because somebody tells you you can't, doesn't mean it's true.”</li>
<li>“Failure is part of success. And the concrete actions that you take from the moment you accept that you failed are what defines you as a leader and as an elite performer.”</li>

<li>“The task ahead of you is never greater than the power behind you.”</li>
<li>“I absolutely loved it, because it wasn't about me in that moment...it was about something so much bigger.”</li>
<li>“So it's about the pursuit, it's about the hunt. It's about who you become. And I think that's what I really mean by Dream Chaser.”</li>
<li>“You have to have this done just to be a mom because if you trip down the stairs, if you have a small car accident, like, that could lead to a quadriplegic.”</li>

<li>“To wholly stay in the moment is really the biggest key…and you have to practice that in practice.”</li>

<li>“Adversity makes you stronger.”</li>
<li>“The challenge in front of you sometimes becomes the blessing that you needed.”</li>
<li>“I have learned this last year is that I can just tear my plans up, throw them out the window, because I’ve got to roll with it. And I'm not good at that.”</li>
<li>“I think one of the best things COVID taught me was that I need to have my kids be part of what I'm doing.”</li>
<li>“They saw the sweat, they saw the tears, they saw the frustration, they saw how many times a day I was having to do this stuff and how hard I was working, all just hoping to get back in the pool. So it provided a lot of really good conversations for us.”</li>
<li>“The best people you see doing this are beginners at some point, like, you have to start somewhere.”</li>
<li>“I've had a lot of times where I'm like, you know, God, I'd be okay, if He closed the door, and we're done with this. But He's made it very clear, this is where I need to be, and He's made a way, and then that fire is back, and that fuel is back.”</li>
<li>“I've learned not to be scared of my emotions. I've learned how to use them and how to direct them.”</li>
<li>“And it's not about the pressure, or the expectations, or all these other things, just let that go. And it's just about me enjoying the moment.”</li>
<li>“This is actually my way of finding the resources and giving them to other athletes.”</li>
<li>“Learning those lessons from people and taking that with me, I think makes me not just stronger mentally, but emotionally and spiritually.”</li>
<li>“There's this need for achievement and growth mindset - be better today than you were yesterday, continuous self improvement - that you display that has set you apart from all of your competition.”</li>
<li>“For all the people who maybe think they're too old to do something they love to do, don't let society or culture decide that for you. If you love something, do it.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Joining Laura on the podcast today is Olympic Taekwondo athlete, Victoria Stambaugh. The daughter of a professional boxer, Victoria took to Taekwondo at an early age, made the US National Team in her teens, eventually joined the Puerto Rico National Team, and has since qualified to compete for Puerto Rico at the upcoming Tokyo Games. Having suffered a number of injuries and resulting surgeries over her career, Victoria has demonstrated remarkable resilience, and, through her faith in Christ, has persevered to achieve her dream of becoming an Olympian. In today’s conversation, she not only shares her inspirational story, but also turns the tables to pick Laura’s brain for some of her sage advice as well.

She also delves deeply into the role that her faith has played in her life and career, the impact of handing control over to God, her 17 scars and what they mean to her, and her work with Master Bang in preparing for Tokyo. Victoria concludes the episode by questioning Laura on her Olympic experiences and advice, and the role that her faith has played in her life and career. As you will hear, Victoria and Laura are very much kindred spirits whose personal, professional, and spiritual lives resonate considerably with each other, and also offer valuable lessons for all listeners here today.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s episode is a little different in that Laura is actually a guest on another podcast, and is interviewed by veteran broadcaster, Bill Houston and former LPGA Pro, Tracy Hanson, from the Power Up Sports Ministry, an outreach of Our Daily Bread Ministries. Listeners may remember Tracy as a guest on Episode 20 of Pursuit of Gold where she very vulnerably opened up about recognizing and overcoming abuse. As you will hear, this week’s episode is an extra special one for Laura as she shares so much that is close to her heart, but that she doesn’t always get a chance to discuss in other arenas.
 
She begins by briefly reviewing her personal and professional lives, and then delves deeply into her spiritual journey, including a moving account of the moment her life changed and she started fully trusting God with it. She also describes how she brings her faith into her competitions, the impact that the Tokyo Games postponement has had upon her and her training, her experience of returning to diving after neck surgery, and how she approaches sharing her faith with others. Laura concludes by offering her perspective on ministering to other athletes, as well as details regarding her wonderful family, and what she has learned about herself in her quest to return to the Olympics. Laura truly loves ‘just being able to be open and honest about Jesus and sports’, and that is precisely what she does today in this enlightening and thoroughly inspiring interview.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>A brief history of Laura’s personal and professional lives</li>
<li>Laura’s spiritual journey and the moment her life began to change</li>
<li>Trusting God with her life</li>
<li>Taking her faith into her competitions</li>
<li>The impact of the Olympic postponement on Laura</li>
<li>Returning to diving after her neck surgery</li>
<li>Sharing her faith with others</li>
<li>Her perspective on ministering to other athletes</li>
<li>Laura’s family</li>
<li>What Laura has learned about herself</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes: 
 </p>
<ul>
<li>“I was told I was a waste of space… fortunately for me, it lit a fire.”</li>
<li>“I had reached out and I kind of realized that I had taken the reins of my life and I'd made a mess of things, but I was reaching back out for God.”</li>
<li>“I just remember thinking that God was saying, “Look, when you trust Me with your life, I have plans for you. I have a purpose for you.”</li>
<li>“You are probably impacting people's lives all over the place and you don't always see the fruit of that. But you've got to know when you're trusting God and you're doing what He's asking you to do, like, waves will be made, seeds will be planted, you know, and the harvest will come.”</li>
<li>“I was much better at staying in the moment because of Him, because I was focused on Him.”</li>
<li>“God always gives you these challenges that you're like, ‘No, I don't want to go through this’, but he uses those to equip us in ways that we can't even fathom to help us for something bigger that’s coming ahead.”</li>
<li>“You have to be able to meet people where they are and talk to them where they're at.”</li>
<li>“I think for athletes just constantly, constantly reminding them that, like, you are not the sum total of your score or your place at the end of the competition. Like, you are far more valuable than that. And if you get injured and you can't go on tomorrow, you still have value and purpose and you were created for that purpose.”</li>
<li>“I've gotten really good at juggling, and I have an amazing husband who is very supportive. Without him, I mean, honestly, none of this would have happened.”</li>
<li>“The older I get, the more I realize I don't know.”</li>
<li>“Having kids, they kind of make you really not eat your words, but live up to your words.”</li>
<li>“I think athletes and sports ministry leaders alike can learn from what you're putting out there with the guests that you're having.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The inspiration for today’s episode can be found in a team meeting that Laura’s coaches called recently. The meeting was all about goals, and included an exercise where each member shared their own goals with the others. Even with her years of experience, Laura still found this a little uncomfortable and even a bit intimidating, but also incredibly powerful and beneficial for herself and her teammates, and definitely important enough to share with listeners today.
 
She starts this solo episode by highlighting the need to set big goals, and the value of writing down and sharing them. She recounts the role that healthy competitiveness plays in making teammates better, emphasizes the importance of being specific about goals, creating a plan involving both short and long term goals, and explaining the difference between goals and expectations. She finishes up by looking at the importance of having and knowing your ‘why’ and by reviewing today’s main takeaways for listeners. Blessed with wisdom gained through experience and reflection, Laura expands upon a key coaching strategy for elite athletes and eloquently translates it for athletes and non-athletes alike in this relatively brief but hugely impactful episode.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Setting a goal out of your reach</li>
<li>Writing down and sharing your goals</li>
<li>Employing healthy competitiveness to get better</li>
<li>Being specific with goals and creating a plan to get there</li>
<li>Setting short and long term goals</li>
<li>The difference between goals and expectations</li>
<li>Avoiding the ‘expectation trap’</li>
<li>The importance of your ‘why’</li>
<li>Takeaways from today</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes: 
 </p>
<ul>
<li>“If you’re setting a goal that you know you can already achieve, it’s not a goal.”</li>
<li>“If you share it with someone, you are 77% more likely to accomplish it.”</li>
<li>“It’s now real because somebody else knows about it, and they can hold you accountable in a number of different ways.”</li>
<li>“The better your teammate’s getting, that’s just going to push you to get better.”</li>
<li>“It’s important to recognize that expectations tend to have very emotional roots and responses.”</li>
<li>“At some point you’re not going to be able to keep up with that growing expectation because it’s not a tangible result.”</li>
<li>“When you have purpose, you can become capable of so much more than you ever thought possible.”</li>
<li>“You’ve got to start acting like you are the person who is going to achieve that goal.”</li>
<li>“I grew as a person. I grew as an athlete.”</li>
<li>“You are capable of doing great things.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Professional cyclist, Brad White, joins Laura on the podcast this week. While working as a teacher, Brad discovered professional cycling somewhat later than most, but enjoyed great success in a very short amount of time. Eventually leaving teaching behind, he went on to compete internationally full time, and, upon retirement from the sport, has found a way to continue to make his passion his livelihood. Filled with wisdom and experience both within the sport and beyond, Brad has much to share with listeners today.
 
He starts off by recounting his rather unique beginnings in his sport, his transition to becoming a professional rider, and the type of cycling in which he competed. Brad goes on to share details regarding the team aspect of the sport, his preparation for races, the importance of patience in sports, and some of his most memorable moments. His training focus, special awards, definition of success, and transition out of professional cycling are also explored. Brad finishes up with a description of the work he does these days which keeps him connected to the world of cycling. As Laura notes, Brad’s wisdom and experience is ‘hard earned’, and today he demonstrates once again that so much of what is learned through sport is remarkably valuable in so many aspects of life in general.</p>

<li>“It's really important that you know your role, you can execute your job, but also that you show up ready.”</li>
<li>“The preparation for each course is going to be different, but kind of the same, and then you're just going to react differently.”</li>
<li>“The overall time is what matters to some riders, but then, to other riders, winning a stage is a big deal.”</li>
<li>“If I need to suffer this that little bit longer, you know, they may give up.”</li>
<li>“I think one of the biggest motivators for me was just not wanting to let down my team, my fans.”</li>
<li>“Patience is a huge part of, I think, all sports.”</li>
<li>“We were just riding so well together all the time, having fun on and off the bike.”</li>
<li>“I think there's definitely something about, even with a training plan, listening to your body and being able to react to what your body is dealing with, and get the most out of your training.”</li>
<li>“Kind of racing stupid made me stronger, made me a little smarter later, but it also got my name out there a little bit.”</li>
<li>“Being able to achieve what you set out to achieve that day is a success.”</li>
<li>“I think the biggest thing for people transitioning out of sports is you don’t need to find the thing right away.”</li>
<li>“The bike has done so much for me within my career but also, you know, mentally, physically, spiritually, it's connected me with people…and it's amazing what I've seen it do for people.”</li>
<li>“With COVID, bikes have been a big hit.”</li>
<li>“The programs we have are to give back to our community and to create experiences for people to use the products that we’re selling them.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<hr>
<p>This week, Laura welcomes Olympic hurdler, Sarah Wells, to the podcast. Once an athlete who was cut from every high school team she tried out for, Sarah discovered track and field and went on to become an Olympic semi-finalist and Pan Am Games silver medallist in the 400m hurdles, building a reputation for overcoming challenges and achieving the ‘impossible’ along the way.  She is also the Founder of the Believe Initiative, where she now uses her story to help youth understand the importance of being resilient and the power of believing in themselves, and to help corporations build more resilient teams.
 
Sarah begins by recounting how she got her unique start in sports, the support networks which have sustained her throughout, her rapid development in the hurdles, and both working and learning through her injuries. She also shares her discovery of ‘her word’, her Olympics Trials and Games experience, managing her stress fractures, and preparing to qualify for Rio 2016. Sarah concludes the conversation by discussing her Believe Initiative, how to get involved in it, her retirement from sports, and her perspective and guide to redefining success. A gifted speaker with a truly inspiring story, Sarah Wells has learned so much from her journey which is so very pertinent to life both within and beyond the sporting arena, and she shares it all here today.

<li>“You go from zero to competing internationally in, like, eight months.”</li>
<li>“When someone else says it, you know, you're instantly a bit more likely to believe it.”</li>
<li>“I would almost, like, live and die by how my leg felt that morning.”</li>
<li>“I just would get so mentally defeated and, like, halfway through an interval I would just start walking.”</li>
<li>“In the most important races in my life, when the gun goes off, I hear nothing. I just lock into completing what I need to do.”</li>

<li>“I miss qualifying by half a second.”</li>
<li>“Clearly you don't build self-belief through achievements, you build it through action.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>One topic that Laura has been receiving a lot of messages about lately is that of dealing with injuries. There seems to be some worry, frustration, and uncertainty expressed by more and more athletes when it comes to feeling productive while they’re sidelined for weeks, months, and even longer during their recovery. Definitely no stranger to the world of injuries, Laura draws upon her own experiences, and those of previous podcast guests, to address all of these concerns and share some valuable advice.
 
Laura begins by recounting some of the injuries she has sustained during her career and how she and her coach responded to them. Throughout these stories, she highlights the importance of being ‘all in’ on your recovery plan, learning from these injuries and carrying those lessons forward, the power of mind, mindset, and perspective, as well as working through the many resulting emotions. Laura also reviews the stories of some past guests of the podcast whose journeys through injury and illness are both inspiring and enlightening, and she concludes the episode with her advice on ways to deal with injuries, how to use the time while on the sidelines, and just how critical it is to really take the time to assess your injury and recovery before choosing wisely on how to move forward. As you will hear, today’s topic is one with which Laura is greatly familiar, and the knowledge and wisdom she shares here is drawn not only from her own experience but from others in the world of high level sports. This is, truly, an important listen for all athletes, and really, for anyone who may suffer perceived setbacks in achieving their goals in life.</p>

<li>“It all truly comes down to how you chose to look at it…choose wisely, friends.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>South African Olympic runner, Dom Scott, joins Laura today for a truly inspiring conversation about persevering and making tough decisions to make your dreams a reality. Born in Cape Town, Dom’s journey to the Olympics meant moving away from her family at a young age to access the training and opportunities offered elsewhere, which resulted in multiple NCAA titles, 12 All-American honors, and, of course, her appearance at the Rio Olympics. Today, Dom takes some time out from her training for the Tokyo Olympics to share her story and the lessons it has to offer.
 
She begins by sharing some details of growing up in Cape Town, her start in sports, particularly running, and the difficult decision to leave home to attend a high school with a track team. Dom also discusses the road that took her to the University of Arkansas, her career there, her year of fairy tale moments, and her Rio experience. She concludes by delving into the lessons she has learned throughout her career, how COVID has affected her and her training, what keeps her going through the hard times, and the Dom Squad. The overriding themes of following your dream and cherishing support from family, friends, and faith run through Dom’s journey, and
offer inspiration for us all in how we can approach our own lives.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Dom’s upbringing in Cape Town and her start in running</li>

</ul>
<p>Quotes:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>“I grew up playing every sport.”</li>
<li>“I guess as a dreamer and the determined person that I am, as a 12 year old, that just seemed like something that was worth fighting for and worth making hard decisions for.”</li>
<li>“Selflessly…she told me to go and to follow my dreams, follow my heart, and if she hadn’t done that, I think I probably would have pulled the plug on the whole thing.”</li>
<li>“College, you’ve got to remember, everyone is away from home.”</li>
<li>“Very quickly, I started changing the way I was talking…and looking back at it, I’m so sad that I did that.”</li>

<li>“Your 10 points just secured the win for the Lady Razorbacks.”</li>
<li>“That sermon gave me so much peace.”</li>
<li>“You earned your spot on that start line.”</li>
<li>“I had taken the necessary steps to make my dream a reality.”</li>
<li>“At the time, I was embarrassed to say I’d come 21st,which is ridiculous!”</li>
<li>“It’s not about the place, it’s about how you feel about what you did.”</li>
<li>“Being an Olympian and having competed in the Olympics is not something that made me a better person, or, like, changed my life significantly either…it wasn’t something I wanted to be branded as.”</li>
<li>“If you are searching for your identity in anything other than Christ…it’s never going to fulfill you, it’s never going to satisfy you, and you’re always going to be left wanting more.”</li>
<li>“I am…more than Dom Scott, the athlete.”</li>
<li>“I really feel like surrounding myself with people that love me and support me – that’s what helps me through those really horrible days.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Laura has been looking forward to today’s interview for a while, and the reason will become very clear, very quickly. On May 6, 2017, Robert Paylor was playing for the number one college rugby team in the country as they competed in the National Championship, a dream come true for any young athlete. Mere moments into that game, Robert broke his neck and was subsequently told that he would never walk or move his hands again. His life was changed forever in that instant, but if you think that’s where Robert’s story ends, you couldn’t be more wrong. That fateful day not only impacted his physical life, but his mindset, his faith, and his outlook on life, and he shares the whole story with us all today.
 
He begins by describing how he got involved in rugby in the first place, his experience at Cal, and then he shares, in chilling detail, the events of that day in May, 2017, as well as the immediate and long-term decisions and treatments involved in his rehabilitation, which continues to this very day. Along the way he touches upon the need for mental toughness, working through the daily grind toward his vision, the role that neuroplasticity plays in his rehabilitation, and the power of forgiveness. Throughout his story are woven Robert’s feelings of gratitude, the incredible support from family, friends, doctors, teammates, and coaches, and, especially, his discovery of the greatest purpose and commitment of his life. What happened to Robert truly changed his life on so many levels, and by listening in to his heartfelt and moving conversation with Laura today you’ll find out why he wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>World Champion runner, Chanelle Price, joins Laura today to share her remarkable story and the lessons she has learned through it all. A supremely talented elite athlete, Chanelle’s many achievements include competing at the 2007 USA Outdoor Championships at the age of 16, running the second fastest 800m of all time by a high school female which qualified her for the Olympic Trials when she was 17, and becoming the 2014 World IAAF Indoor Champion – the first American woman to ever win 800m gold at an indoor or outdoor world championship. Along with these great successes, Chanelle has experienced some devastating low points in her career, and she courageously discusses them all here today.
 
She begins by sharing how she came to find her way into track, her early successes, her struggles with insecurity, and the dark days of her time at college. Chanelle then provides a highly personal account of the factors that led her to contemplate suicide, and how beginning her journey with Christianity pulled her through that tragic time. She also discusses the many challenges she still had to face throughout this journey, the difference between her Olympic Trials experiences, and training for Tokyo during COVID. She draws the conversation to a close by highlighting the importance of maintaining a healthy relationship with sport, surrounding yourself with the right supportive people, her current definition of success, and the crucial role her ‘why’ plays in keeping her motivated and moving forward. Chanelle holds nothing back as she recounts the shining mountain peaks and dark, dark valleys she has encountered in her fascinating journey, and how these have helped her to become the woman she is today - an individual overflowing with faith, strength, character, and commitment, who undoubtedly ‘brings a smile to God’s face’.</p>

<li>“I’m not thinking about anything else besides using my gift, and for me that’s when things seem to fall into place.”</li>

<li>“This is what you do. It’s not who you are.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Due to the winter storm that hit Texas recently, and the ensuing power outage, Laura has had to postpone some of the fantastic interviews she had lined up for the podcast. However, today’s episode proves equally fascinating as she delves into something which we all experience, and about which she is asked all the time: fear. While no one is immune from it, there are ways to manage it rather than let it spiral out of control, and today, Laura breaks it all down for you.
 
She begins by defining what fear actually is, how healthy fear works and can help, the relationship between fear and control, and the only way to overcome fear. She also discusses the need to change the way we talk and think about fear through refocusing and reframing, the gift of gaining courage through fear and commitment, and then finishes with an offer to participate in her ‘Free 5 Day Fear Challenge’. This is a topic with which Laura possesses a vast amount of experience, and her insights and advice here today, once again, go far beyond the world of sports and into each of our daily lives, making this yet another ‘must listen’ episode of ‘The Pursuit of Gold’.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Defining what fear actually is</li>
<li>Healthy fear</li>
<li>Fear and control</li>
<li>Overcoming fear</li>
<li>Changing the way we talk and think about fear</li>
<li>Refocusing and reframing</li>
<li>Gaining courage</li>
<li>Commitment</li>
<li>Laura’s Free 5 Day Fear Challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>“Fear is huge in my sport…I am no stranger to fear.”</li>
<li>“Fear basically boils down to a strong feeling.”</li>
<li>“A healthy fear should not be absolutely paralyzing.”</li>
<li>“However big your fears are, you are not powerless against these fears.”</li>
<li>“Fear has no actual control over you, it’s only making you feel a certain way.”</li>
<li>“When we ignore our fears, they don’t get smaller, they begin to grow.”</li>
<li>“When we’re trying to push our fears away, we’re actively interacting with them.”</li>
<li>“The only way to overcome fear is to face it.”</li>
<li>“We have to begin trusting ourselves and our knowledge and what we know will help us.”</li>
<li>“You cannot have courage or be brave unless you are first afraid.”</li>
<li>“The most important ingredient to becoming courageous is commitment.”</li>
<li>“It’s normal to freeze up and get scared just before a big, important moment. That just let’s you know how important it is to you.”</li>
<li>“You can’t dip your toe in from the 10m to see if the water feels nice.”</li>
<li>“The thing on the other side of fear is more important to me than the fear itself.”</li>

Laura sugarcoats nothing in today’s episode, demonstrating that life is filled with difficult patches to navigate, that it is up to us to decide who we want to be as we face these difficulties, and also passionately reinforcing the fact that we do, indeed, have the potential to not only get through all this but to thrive in the process.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Today you will be treated to an ‘extreme’ episode as World Champion High Diver, Gary Hunt, joins Laura for an absolutely fascinating conversation. A legend in the high diving world, Gary is actually a 2-time World Champion and an 8-time winner of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series. Before he took on the daredevil world of high diving, Gary competed in 10-meter platform diving, and, in fact, took home a Bronze in the 10-meter Synchro at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. If you have ever wondered what it takes to have the courage and skill to dive off of cliffs and castles, and even out of helicopters, and still continue to set even loftier goals for yourself, you’ve come to the right place.
 
In this conversation, Gary tells his story all the way from first getting into diving all the way to what he is doing now and what his lofty and inspiring new goal is. In the process, he shares his favorite places to dive, his craziest and most memorable dives, the dangers he and his colleagues face, and the mental preparation that allows him to do what he does so well so consistently. Finding coaching in a relatively new sport, maintaining focus, his exciting new goal, and the impact that COVID has had upon him, his sport and his training are all discussed as well. Gary’s calm, thoughtful and humble nature shines through in this episode as he shares his vast amount of experience and insight into a sport which would seem unthinkably perilous to so many of us. Combine all of these qualities with his penchant for setting new goals and pursuing passion projects, and you will undoubtedly agree with Laura’s assessment of Gary Hunt as truly ‘an inspiration’, certainly one well worth listening to here today.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:
 
·   How Gary found his way to diving
·   Transitioning from platform to high diving
·   His favorite places to dive
·   Gary’s craziest high diving story
·   The potential dangers in high diving
·   The process involved in introducing a new dive

<li>“I’ve had a really rough year this year.”</li>
<li>“All in all, I think it might have worked out okay for me. Hopefully, next year’s going to be way better.”</li>
<li>“We can’t change the cards we’re dealt, and so we just have to make the best of what we have…those who are able to cope with the changes and stay on track and stay motivated are the ones that are going to find the most success next summer.”</li>
<li>“Although these few months have been hard, I don’t think it counts me out. If anything, it lights more of a fire under me to prove that I can overcome this and everything else thrown my way to be the athlete and the competitor that I want to be.”</li>
<li>“Impossible is a dare.”</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Laura is very excited to welcome two-time Olympic swimmer, Cammile Adams, to the podcast today. Originally from Houston, Cammile started swimming at four years old, and went on to specialize in the 200m butterfly, eventually becoming a two-time NCAA Champion and seven-time NCAA All-American. She also competed for Team USA at the World Championships, earning a silver medal in 2015, and also represented her country at the London and Rio Olympics. Having retired from competitive swimming after Rio, Cammile currently runs a number of SafeSplash Swim Schools in and around Houston.
 
In this episode, Cammile describes her swimming career starting with her twin sister and her father at an early age, through her college, professional and Olympic experiences, and finishing with her dream job running her swim schools. Along the way she shares the influence her coaches and mentors have had upon her, her unique fly stroke, one of the darkest moments in her life, and the importance of building a ‘tribe’, of having wise counsel around, and of balancing life within and outside of the pool. She concludes the conversation with her valuable advice for young athletes, borne out of her vast amount of experience and earned wisdom. Fully evident throughout today’s episode is the idea that sports can teach a person so much about themselves and help them grow the skills necessary for life in general.

<description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Benjamin Houltberg, VP of Research and Practice at Search Institute, is Laura’s very special guest on today’s episode. Ben is a developmental scientist, and an experienced licensed marriage and family therapist, as well as a former elite athlete. He is widely published in topics such as the socialization of adolescent emotion regulation, promoting resilience through adversity, character, and identity development in sports. As you will discover, he is also well versed in the practice of Mindfulness, and he is here to share his vast amount of experience, knowledge, and advice with you today.</p>
<p>Ben begins by sharing his journey from his first interest in sports and his running career, through to his current position, and then offers a thorough analysis of both performance based and purpose based identity, as well as the continuum between them. From this analysis, he expands upon performing out of fear and coping with it, mental health, his perspective on overcoming the challenges that this past year has provided, and the importance of gratitude and positive emotions. While examining the foundation for dealing with adversity, Ben explains the concept of Mindfulness, and actually leads Laura and our listeners through an exercise. He finishes the conversation discussing virtue development and high performance and sharing his advice for young athletes. Ben’s overriding belief that we are all of value, not because of our performance, but because of who we are, is evident throughout this inspiring episode.

<p><strong>Quotes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“My same exhilaration for sports began to transfer over to my desire to want to understand how the mind works and how relationships work.”</li>
<li>“In the process of trying to study this, I experienced my own kind of healing in some of the wounds that I experienced as an athlete.”</li>
<li>“When results start to get wrapped up as the main definer of your self-worth, then it has devastating consequences.”</li>
<li>“I really firmly believe that there’s a lot of athletes who ‘choke’ or ‘bonk’, or whatever you want to call it, that really comes from an overstimulated sympathetic nervous system.”</li>
<li>“Often, our body responds even before we are able to process it cognitively.”</li>
<li>“Our external lives and relationships and stressors all can have positive or negative consequences physiologically on us.”</li>
<li>“We deal with stress and pain better when we have a purpose that’s bigger than ourselves.”</li>
<li>“These athletes that have this more purpose based identity, they achieve at really high levels as well, but they don’t have the consequences of high levels of depression or anxiety or shame.”</li>
<li>“Throughout history and throughout research, we just do better when we’re connected to others and we have this connection to some type of transcendent purpose.”</li>
<li>“What do I value? What is most important to me?”</li>
<li>“Relationships are so powerful for our emotional health.”</li>
<li>“How can I serve the people around me right now?”</li>
<li>“The foundation of the self becomes really important…the mindset skills are also really important.”</li>
<li>“Invest in your relationships – in healthy ones.”</li>
<li>“Being mindful in your day-to-day is really just…a non-judgmental awareness of being in the present moment.”</li>
<li>“For me, breath also represents a connection to God or even for some people to everybody around them, the source of life.”</li>
<li>“You are valued. You are loved. You are known. You are free. And your worth does not depend on your performance. And you have something to offer this world that nobody else can take away…there’s a purpose in what you can contribute to those around you.”</li>
<li>“When we do have that solid foundation, we are able to also give our best, and I think that’s where virtue development and high performance come together.”</li>

<p>“Team USA and USA Swimming do a great job of, you know, helping you, make you feel secure.”</p>
<p>“I felt like my job there was to go to swim as fast as I could on the relay for Team USA and then try to just soak up all the knowledge and experience, and just watch people go through what they need to go through to be successful.”</p>
<p>“We are going to do whatever we can to give you something to be successful.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to be Captain to be enforcer of rules or punishments.”</p>

<p>“It takes a long time at the beginning of the season to sort of groove those neuropatterns out, but once you’re clicking…you just kind of do it.”</p>
<p>“I think every athlete that gets up to a certain level has these sorts of stories where they just totally sucked, and no matter what their resume is, that story is still there.”</p>
<p>“You really have to know yourself.”</p>
<p>“You, as the patient, still have to make actual decisions.”</p>
<p>“The diagnosis itself will definitely change your outlook, especially, I think for an athlete who is all about that delayed gratification, that payoff at the end of the season.”</p>
<p>“I still look forward to going to practice even to this day.”</p>
<p>“It certainly shaped my own paradigm moving forward…I almost got so much just ripped away.”</p>
<p>“My wife was a saint through it.”</p>
<p>“Something feels off…like, my left foot doesn’t sweat – it’s like the weirdest thing ever.”</p>
<p>“Your body has this incredible way of finding a way to compensate and, you know, figure out a way to still move through the water.”</p>
<p>“I’m just getting a little bit better each and every week.”</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Joining Laura on the podcast this week is elite Olympic weightlifter, Kristi Brewer.
K Mighty, as she is known, didn’t even start weightlifting until her mid-30’s, and in her relatively short career so far, she has earned the title of Master World Champion and Master Worlds Best Lifter, and in the process broken 12 world records. She competes for the USA on a national and international platform, and is the oldest national ranked weightlifter on the senior circuit. Kristi is also a CPA, a mom to two wonderful girls, and, not surprisingly, a scheduling genius, all of which you will learn more about here today.
 
In this episode, Kristi shares the story of her rather non-traditional journey to weightlifting through her steady progress in the sport to the current day, and her plans for the future. Along the way, she touches upon her training history, being a ‘remote athlete’, her competitions and the pressure associated with them, the insignificance of ‘weight on the scale’ in the bigger picture, and the impact her training has upon her daughters. She also offers a glimpse of her stellar organizational and scheduling abilities, what it’s like to compete for Team USA, and how we can help cheer her on. Unmistakable throughout is Kristi’s love of the sport and what it has done for her, her pride in being an example for others especially her children, and, above all, the fact that her story clearly demonstrates that ‘life is not over when we become a mom or when we hit a certain age’. Truly, new beginnings are possible at any point in our lives, so listen in today and be inspired by the mighty Kristi Brewer.

Quotes:
 
“I didn’t find weightlifting actually until my second child when I was 35.”
 
“I love the intensity of it, and also the monotonousness of the training.”
 
“Weightlifting also just fit my personality as well as my body type.”
 
“I didn’t have time to be good at both, and I didn’t want to just be mediocre, I wanted to be really good at one, and so…it morphed into weightlifting.”
 
“I was so terrified of being a remote athlete.”
 
“I do train alone in my garage, and I’ve been doing that for 4 of the 5 years that I’ve been an athlete.”
 
“Ultimately, I had to trust myself that I could make these lifts without someone there telling me what to do and when to do it.”
 
“You don’t actually know what you don’t know until you just do it.”
 
“I love that women are, like, breaking all kinds of barriers…showing the world that, like, just because you’re in your 30’s or your 40’s doesn’t mean life is over. You can start something new then, and be awesome at it.”
 
“Through the variety of my different competitions and experiences, the ones…that I’ve done the best at are the ones that I went in with to have fun.”
 
“The biggest pressures are definitely self-inflicted.”
 
“Most people aren’t as concerned with us as we are, but that’s something really easy to say but hard to, like, take to heart.”
 
“Just because it hasn’t been done doesn’t mean that I can’t do it.”
 
“I hate BMI.”
 
“Weightlifting has been this huge, huge, huge mind shift of just how powerful a woman’s body can be and how awesome muscle is.”
 
“If I don’t stick to the plan, I won’t compete.”
 
“I love being that living example…we can relate on a totally different level.”
 
“I am way more for experiences over money.”
 
“Every day is blocked out into work, training, family, and then basically just fitting that all in.”
 
“Our days are pretty structured, but that structure creates freedom.”
 
“We do believe that I did get COVID.”
 
“Tokyo 2021 is out – that’s not something that I’m qualified for.”
 
“I am a firm believer that you need to make time for yourself.”
 
“Every time I see your stuff I just smile and I’m encouraged.”

<description><![CDATA[<p>This week’s episode is a little different, because today is Laura’s birthday! And to celebrate, she has a very special guest who will be asking the questions – her oldest daughter, Arella. Many of the questions that Arella will be asking Laura have been submitted by listeners, and she has also added a few of her own. Towards the end of the podcast, Laura turns the tables and asks Arella a couple questions as well. You will quickly discover that Arella is an excellent interviewer who might just be ready to host her own podcast someday, and you’ll also learn a lot more about Laura, her sport, her faith, her physical and mental training, and, of course, her Olympic experiences. Today’s episode is an excellent opportunity to learn so much about the life of an Olympian and her family, and if there is more you would like to know, be sure to send in your questions to Laura and they might just be answered on a future episode!</p>

“Your ultimate goals don’t need to change…what changes is your path to get there.”
 
“Research what other athletes in your sport are doing out there right now, like, stalk Instagram or Facebook or YouTube.”
 
“Obviously, the biggest part of being able to share your faith is starting relationships with people. That has to come first.”
 
“That’s really when you get a chance to show people what your faith is, what it means to you, and begin to have those discussions if they’re open to that.”
 
“’I’m going to free fall out into nothing. I’m going to leave this world for a while’, and to me, that just encapsulates what it feels like when I’m diving 10 meter, and I’m just in my happy place, and I’m in my zone, and it kind of feels like a place of worship for me because I’m using the gifts that God has given me.”
 
“Episode 11 with Kaillee Humphries, she talks about mental and verbal abuse…from one of her coaches…and also in Episode 20, with Tracy Hanson, there was kind of a very long term abuse going on there.”
 
“It’s kind of like a small car accident every time.”
 
“Sometimes it’s not your body that’s wearing out, it’s your mind…if that’s the case, go play.”
 
“If you’re not failing, you’re not going to succeed.”
 
“It’s to keep the chlorine from absorbing into their hair.”
 
“Mostly, ‘Flips’ was my home gym.”
 
“The Bible has just been, kind of, my firm foundation since I gave my life to Christ.”
 
“If you’re ever going through a really hard time, Psalms is a wonderful place to go.”
 
“It really broke a barrier for me to all of a sudden, I could do anything.”
 
“I tried a bunch of sports until I finally found diving.”
 
“My biggest challenge is really getting my body back to the point where I can get my entries clean again.”
“I didn’t give up just because I had a bad dive…I came back and I won the competition.”
 
“In 2000, it was in Sydney, Australia. In 2004, it was in Athens, Greece. And in 2008, it was in Beijing, China.”
 
“The back 3½ somersault pike just felt really, really, really hard.”
 
“Sometimes, the simple ones are the hardest.”
 
“My easiest dive is probably just, like, jumping in the water…a pencil dive.”
 
“My first sport was gymnastics.”
 
“I did soccer and now I’m a Ninja Warrior…I did diving…before soccer.”
 
“The trapeze bar is probably my favorite.”
 
“I keep trying over and over again until I finish the route.”
 
“I want to be…the first woman to be a Navy SEAL.”
 
“I like hard and challenging things.”
 
“I started working out while I was doing my Math.”

<description><![CDATA[<p>Laura’s guests on the podcast today are Olympic runner, Abbey Cooper, and her sport psychologist husband, Jacob. Abbey’s impressive college career includes being seven-time national champion, 16-time Ivy League champion and 12-time All-American. In 2012, she became the first Dartmouth woman to win a national title, and in 2013 she became the first Ivy League student-athlete to win the cross-country title. Currently running for New Balance and pursuing the Tokyo Olympics, Abbey is perhaps best known for her inspiring performance at the 2016 Rio Olympics, which she describes in full here today. Highly talented in his own right, Jacob was a scholarship athlete and four-year starter on the football team at Taylor University. This experience led to his interest in the field of sport psychology, and currently, he is the Director of Sport Psychology Services at Appalachian State University and a member of the Mental Health Registry of the USOPC.</p>
<p>Their conversation with Laura today explores not only their story in sport and in their personal relationship, but also of their unwavering faith, and the role that God plays in their lives. Along the way, they touch on Abbey’s experience at Dartmouth and the beginning of her faith journey, God’s grace in her life, His transformation of Jacob’s heart, and how He has taught them lessons about hardship, suffering, and what really matters through His ministry to them. Of course, Abbey’s historic and inspiring performance at the 2016 Olympics is recounted from both of their perspectives, and they also share details of their unique dynamic, what the past four years have been like, what they’ve been working on during the pandemic, and the dream that they have for helping other athletes. Having been through so much, and having faced it all together, supported by the power of their faith, Abbey and Jacob have many lessons to teach about making meaning out of experiences, and they do precisely that here today with extraordinary grace, humility, and sincerity.</p>

<p>Quotes:</p>
<p>“God had other plans.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t go back and change it, because it really brought me to the end of myself, and introduced me to this need for the Lord in my life.”</p>
<p>“It was the peace He gave you inside.”</p>
<p>“It was definitely a pretty humbling and arduous path from there that God really used to kind of transform my life.”</p>
<p>“It was this gift to glorify Him.”</p>
<p>“Luckily, God surrounded me with great friends, coaching, and mentors that helped me make meaning of my experience.”</p>
<p>“It was the fastest mile of my life, and probably the slowest of Abbey’s.”</p>
<p>“It was like God’s hand was over the whole thing.”</p>
<p>“I know that I’m here for a reason, but none of this makes sense.”</p>
<p>“That is so unnatural to me to respond in a way that isn’t selfish that I am so sure that it was just the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p>“Abbey tried to get up like two or three times and run, and just kind of collapsed.”</p>
<p>“It was one of the most memorable and uplifting stories of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.”</p>
<p>“Now to him who is able.”</p>
<p>“When I crossed the finish line, I was already so amazed by what God had done.”</p>
<p>“Lord, bless me with wisdom, bless me with humility, and bless me with a godly wife someday…He gave me all three combined into one.”</p>
<p>“God’s given me a lot of hardship to walk through, and so I’ve picked up a few things along the way about what’s helped me.”</p>
<p>“I hope and pray athletes will feel less alone in their struggles.”</p>

<p>“It’s really important to me that I’m around and I’m available and, kind of, flexible to be a dad, all day, 24/7, and not out of commission too much.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to put it all out there. There’s worse things in the world but non more difficult to deal with than living with regret.”</p>

Within a year of her retirement, she embarked on a new journey, which included unpacking the truth about the harm and abuse she experienced as a child. Today, she joins Laura to courageously share her story and offer sage advice for all listeners.</p>
<p>In this conversation, Tracy relates her history in sports, particularly in golf, and offers details regarding her role now as a counselor. She also shares the story of her abuse from its start of being ‘groomed’ to finally recognizing it as abuse, and its immense impact upon her life. Along the way she recounts her struggle of wrestling with her identity, the prominent role that her faith has played throughout her life, and how she has become a counselor for others who may be going through what she experienced. She and Laura discuss some organizations that offer help to athletes, including Tracy’s own non-profit, and Tracy offers valuable advice for athletes, parents, coaches, and anyone with similar experiences. So much of today’s episode is centered around a difficult but enormously important topic offering an equally important message delivered by a woman gifted not only with athletic prowess, but with unrivalled strength, perseverance, faith, and courage. This is an episode that needs to be heard by everyone.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The one and only Apolo Ohno is Laura’s very special guest on the podcast today.
After claiming his first major speed skating title at the US Championships at the age of 14, Apolo went from kid prodigy to the most decorated US Winter Olympian in history—a title he still holds—earning eight Olympic medals in short-track speed skating across the 2002, 2006, and 2010 Winter Games. Many of you will remember that he was also involved in one of the craziest short track speed skating races in history where, after colliding with 3 other racers and hitting the wall, he managed to skate over the line and win a silver medal. He shares that story and much more in the episode today.</p>
<p>Apolo begins the conversation by reflecting upon his first broadcasting experience, the effects of the Olympic postponement on athletes, and the first sports in which he participated as a child. He then compares and contrasts short track and long track speed skating, and relates his storied career in speed skating, including the game changing life lesson his father taught him, the importance and power of his shift in mindset, and especially the tremendous impact that sports psychology has had upon his performance. Apolo goes into great detail about the ‘assertive intentionality’ which revolutionized his training, and he provides all the details behind his infamous silver medal at the 2002 Olympics and his transformation as he reinvented himself for the 2010 Olympics. This fascinating conversation concludes with Apolo offering his sage advice for athletes. As an athlete who has experienced so very much throughout his remarkable career, Apolo Ohno possesses a unique perspective on setting goals and accessing each and every ‘reservoir of potential’ during their pursuit. Today you have a front row seat to hear him share his extensive knowledge, insight, and wisdom with Laura in this very special episode.</p>

<p>“I don’t like racing against the clock – that seems very boring to me – I liked racing against other athletes and testing my might against them.”</p>
<p>“I was racing against men who were 30, 35 years old, who had been skating and training longer than I had been alive on this planet, and I was beating them with ease which was very, very weird.”</p>
<p>“At a flip of a switch, I was now being talked about as being a statistic, as being a kid who had it all but threw it away, who didn’t know what hard work and discipline was. And that was painful.”</p>
<p>“Whatever it is, I want to see real dedication and commitment from you.”</p>
<p>“It’s only a true failure if you stay down.”</p>
<p>“I have a mindset…that you are not willing to go to. I will go to the places in my mind that you are afraid to go through.”</p>
<p>“I have something upstairs and in my heart that other people around me do not have.”</p>
<p>“I had this untapped reservoir of potential, and that was my mind.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got to take pleasure in those small wins.”</p>
<p>“I was able to make such assertive intentionality around each training, pre-, during, and post-, that the quality of my training went so high.”</p>
<p>“Everything scarred me in some degree, and…it wasn’t healthy back then, but when it comes down to sheer performance, I think there was no one that was more driven.”</p>
<p>“We, as a country, needed to see some athlete like that, to get knocked down when he was supposed to win, and to not complain about it, and to not gripe about it, but to say...‘Life happens’…it was a blessing.”</p>
<p>“I’m so grateful that I didn’t win that race…anything else would have been different.”</p>
<p>“It was really about me exhausting any and all of the options, leaving no stones unturned in that preparation.”</p>
<p>“Every up, every down, every mediocre performance is an incredible learning experience and opportunity to light that fire within.”</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Laura is so honored to welcome Amy Dixon, a visually impaired professional triathlete and member of the USA Paratriathlon National Team, to the podcast today. Amy lost 98% of her vision to a rare autoimmune disease and now serves as a patient advocate and President of the Glaucoma Eyes international non-profit. She is also the reigning Aquathlon World Champion, US National Champion triathlete, USA Paracycling Time Trial National Champion, and is ranked 6th in the world in the Paralympic International Rankings. She recently moved to San Diego to focus her training for her road to the Tokyo 2021 Paralympic Games, and she talks about her preparation for these Games and so much more with Laura here today.</p>
<p>She begins their conversation by sharing her experience and advice as a sommelier with Laura before moving onto how the pandemic has affected her and her training, including how her autoimmune disease has prepared her for the current health protocols. Amy then offers a vivid description of exactly what her sight is like these days, her bad luck at World Championships, the story of her vision loss and how she dealt with the news, and the therapy she found in working with horses again. She also discusses the story of her competitive triathlon career, how she missed going to the 2016 Paralympics, what keeps her going for the 2021 Games, and the surgeries and treatments she continues to undergo and the complications they create for training. Amy closes out the conversation by explaining how she maintains her mantra given her many challenges and offers details about the ‘No Sight No Limits’ camp she started. Today’s episode is a truly moving and inspiring story of one woman’s courage, strength, perseverance, and determination, which holds lessons for everyone, especially those in pursuit of gold.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Laura is very excited to welcome four-time Israeli National Champion in skeleton, AJ Edelman, to the podcast today. AJ is an American-Israeli who, by competing for Israel at the 2018 Winter Olympics, became the first Orthodox Jew to compete in the Winter Olympics, and the first Orthodox Jewish male to compete in either Olympic iteration. He has since retired from skeleton, intends to compete in the coming seasons and qualify Israel for the 2022 Olympics in 4-man bobsled, and is currently head of development and programming for the Israel Bobsled and Skeleton team. As impressive as these accomplishments are, they constitute just one part of his truly inspirational story, as you will hear today.</p>
<p>AJ begins the conversation by relating his experiences with, and advice regarding, both bullying and mental health. He then goes on to describe the remarkable impact that fellow athlete Steve Holcomb had upon him, the ‘I’ll show you’ attitude which propels his performance, the steps he took to improve his skill in skeleton so quickly, and, above all, the importance of having a goal greater than yourself. AJ’s faith, his duty to represent his community, the special tradition which he started, and his experience of training in Jamaica are all discussed as well. The conversation draws to a close with their exploration of being the best version of yourself, AJ’s Olympic experience in 2018, and what he is up to these days. Intelligent, articulate, passionate, and committed are just a few of the words which come to mind as you listen to AJ speak about all he has been through and accomplished to this point in his life. He is a visionary who puts his heart and soul into each and every goal he sets, and you will undoubtedly be equal parts amazed, impressed, and inspired as you listen to him here today.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>AJ’s experiences with, and advice regarding, bullying and mental health</li>
<li>His journey from playing hockey at MIT to becoming a skeleton athlete</li>
<li>The impact that Steve Holcomb had on AJ</li>
<li>AJ and Laura’s shared ‘I’ll show you’ attitude</li>
<li>How he improved at the skeleton so quickly</li>
<li>The importance of having a goal greater than yourself</li>
<li>AJ’s faith and representing his community</li>
<li>His special tradition</li>
<li>AJ’s experience training in Jamaica</li>
<li>Being the best version of yourself</li>
<li>His 2018 Olympic experience</li>
<li>What AJ is up to these days</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<p>“The only reason why I try to do any of the things that I try to do is borne out of using those experiences, in particular the negative feelings that sometimes come about from depression, as fuel.”</p>
<p>“It’s always been about rise above and be the best that you can be, but initially motivated by some very negative experiences.”</p>
<p>“Even though people hurt you, oftentimes, they themselves are hurting, but that’s also not an excuse to take it.”</p>
<p>“Realize that you are on a higher plane than your bully.”</p>
<p>“We have to fight bullying by addressing the root causes.”</p>
<p>“Mental health is very similar to most other health issues, in that it presents differently for people, but we have to acknowledge that it not only exists, and that it exists within ourselves, but that there are many methods that we can take to treat it, but we have to treat it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that decisions are ever wrong if they’re made with the right intent.”</p>
<p>“The plan was to find a sport in which I could actually become truly excellent and elite, to show that Jews can become elite in a sport, even later on in life.”</p>
<p>“People may not register on your scale, but you can impart an enormous amount of influence and help on other people’s lives.”</p>
<p>“I was fighting in my mind for the future of my program.”</p>
<p>“I will not be part of the end product, but I will be, I can be, a significant stepping-stone to creating something really good.”</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>This week marks one year out from the 2021 Paralympic Games in Tokyo, and Laura is deeply honored to welcome Gold Medal Paralympian, Brad Snyder, to the podcast today. A highly experienced competitive swimmer, Brad graduated from the US Naval Academy and was deployed to Iraq and later to Afghanistan as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Officer. After six months in Afghanistan, Brad sustained complete vision loss as a result of the explosion of an improvised explosive device (IED).  What’s incredible about Brad is not what happened to him that fateful day, but as you will hear, how he responded to it.</p>
<p>Brad begins by detailing his start in swimming, the impact that becoming the swim team captain in college had upon him, and how he found himself in the role of an EOD Officer. 
Brad then recounts the stories of his deployments, including the day of his injury, the effects of losing his sight, and his eventual return to swimming and rebuilding his identity. He and Laura discuss the power of celebrating the process as well as the outcomes in athletics, and Brad shares his Paralympic experiences, the reasons for writing his memoir, what he is up to these days, and just how the pandemic shutdown has affected him and his training. Brad concludes by recommending Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle is the Way, a book for which he has the greatest respect. As Laura notes, Paralympians ‘have a unique strength of character that combines mental toughness, physical ability, and outstanding agility’ whose performances ‘often redefine the boundaries of possibility’. Brad Snyder embodies all of these qualities and more, as you will find out in this inspired and inspiring episode today.</p>

<p>“My bailiwick is leadership.”</p>
<p>“In the modern era, what we do predominantly is the mitigation of explosive hazards in support of military operations worldwide.”</p>
<p>“They were able to save my face, but they weren’t able to save my eyes, unfortunately…the good news is I walked away with my life.”</p>
<p>“I’m never going to be who I was, and that shouldn’t prevent me from being who I am.”</p>

<p>“I felt like I belonged…I felt fulfilled.”</p>
<p>“You have to be vulnerable. You have to learn how to make a mistake, but then vow not to do it again, and to learn something from it.”</p>

<p>“We’re on the road to Tokyo full force.”</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s episode is the second part of Laura’s interview with Kaillie Humphries, two-time Olympic Women’s Bobsled Champion, first female bobsledder to defend her Olympic title, and the most successful Canadian bobsledder in history. In part one, Kaillie shared the exciting story of her epic gold medal win on her home soil, and this week the conversation picks up right at that historic point in her life.</p>
<p>Kaillie shares the stress, pressure, and expectations on her following her gold medal win and the preparation for her next Olympics. She talks about becoming a leader, her 2014 Olympic performance, what kept her wanting to continue to compete afterward, and her efforts to ensure equality and equity in her sport. Kaillie also goes into great detail about the verbal and mental abuse she suffered at the hands of the Canadian coaching staff and Federation in the lead up to her 2018 Olympics, the steps she took to address it, and  precisely why athletes are so hesitant to speak up about such abuses. The conversation draws to a close with her story of joining the USA Team, the grace and humility that both she and the team demonstrated during this transition, and her plans for the future. Kaillie’s story is one which ranges from the sheer joy of victory to the pain and personal agony of being bullied and excluded by those who should have been supporting and protecting her. There is so very much for everyone to learn from the perseverance, consistency, and courage she has shown throughout her life – listen in to today’s episode (and part one if you missed it) to be inspired by all that she has to share.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Joining Laura today on a very special episode is the man, the myth, the legend, Greg Louganis, currently the Sports Director for the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series. As you probably already know, Greg is a 4 time Olympian, and the only man to ever win consecutive double gold medals in diving at the Olympics. He is also, of course, the man who came back to win Olympic gold in dramatic fashion after hitting his head during a dive, and we do discuss that as well as many other topics during the show.</p>
<p>In our discussion, Greg shares how elite athletes, including himself, handle cancelled or boycotted competitions, deal with distractions, and maintain motivation while processing criticism. We also explore the importance of the trust between a coach and athlete, dealing with feelings of failure, and the incredible story of Greg’s 1988 Olympics experience. We finish up by looking at his perception of challenges actually being opportunities, and I ask him how he would like to be remembered. Throughout this fascinating conversation we discover Greg’s lifelong focus upon learning to perform to the best of his ability rather than competing for awards – a valuable attitude for us all to emulate in both sports and life in general.</p>
<p>Episode Highlights:</p>
<p>How athletes are handling the cancellation of the Red Bull Cliff Diving Season
How Greg dealt with the boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games
Managing distractions while competing, maintaining motivation and processing criticism
Building coach-athlete trust
Dealing with feelings of failure
The story of the 1988 Olympics
Seeing challenges as opportunities
Performing instead of competing
How Greg would like to be remembered</p>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<p>“If you think of an elite athlete in many sports, it’s like a carton of milk…it has an expiration date.”</p>
<p>“I always wanted my performance to speak for itself…I was out there to prove something.”</p>
<p>“It’s human nature to root for the underdog, and for many, many years, I was not the underdog.”</p>
<p>“I think the most important thing is to observe and listen.”</p>
<p>“It was never my goal to win gold…my goal was to have the best performance that I could on that given time, and just be the absolute best that I could be…the results will take care of themselves.”</p>
<p>“This pandemic is proof – we have such little control, ultimately.”</p>
<p>“As long as I was in the pool in training, HIV didn’t exist, nor did my relationship…that was my safe space, my sanctuary.”</p>
<p>“I always thought…a bad takeoff was a great opportunity.”</p>
<p>“Emulate what you admire, but be your own person.”
