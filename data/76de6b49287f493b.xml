      <![CDATA[<p><em>My Mother Made Me</em> is a series from <em>Radiotopia Presents</em>, where writer Jason Reynolds and his mother, Isabell, explore their shared history, how she raised him, and what they’re teaching each other. It’s a love letter to their connection, an homage to parent-child friendship, and a testament to how growth can be perpetual, despite age or circumstance. Across four episodes, Jason and Isabell go deep – into birth, death and spirituality… but they also keep it light: pushing a cart through Costco, birthday lunches, and hitting the casino together. That’s just how they do.</p>

<p><em>My Mother Made Me</em> is a production of PRX’s Radiotopia and part of <em>Radiotopia Presents</em>, a podcast feed that debuts limited-run, artist-owned series from new and original voices. It is written and narrated by Jason Reynolds with his mother, Isabell Reynolds. The series is produced by Mark Pagán and edited by Julie Shapiro, with production support from Yooree Losordo.

Every time.

<p><em>My Mother Made Me</em> is a series from <em>Radiotopia Presents</em>, where writer Jason Reynolds and his mother, Isabell, explore their shared history, how she raised him, and what they’re teaching each other. It’s a love letter to their connection, an homage to parent-child friendship, and a testament to how growth can be perpetual, despite age or circumstance. Across four episodes, Jason and Isabell go deep – into birth, death and spirituality… but they also keep it light: pushing a cart through Costco, birthday lunches, and hitting the casino together. That’s just how they do.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Today, we’re sharing the first episode of a new series from Futuro Media and PRX. <em>We Imagine…Us</em> is a powerfully crafted dual set of podcasts designed to inspire and elevate innovative ideas and solutions for some of the most pressing problems facing our communities as they confront decades of racial inequality.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, Futuro Media is producing an original fiction podcast along with PRX, “We Imagine…Us: <em>The Long Way Around</em>,” starring Emmy-winner Karrueche Tran in her debut podcast performance. The compelling and audio-rich series takes us on a journey filled with twists and turns through the center of the country and explores themes of racial injustice, family and community healing and solidarity while telling the story of a father and daughter’s journey to build a new life for themselves.</p>

<p>This compelling audio drama holds up a mirror to the challenges of our contemporary world and was inspired by recent events and interviews with members of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation’s Solidarity Council on Racial Equity (SCoRE) including John Legend, Ava DuVernay, Michelle Alexander, Heather McGhee and others. </p>

<p>A companion factual podcast series, <em>Re-Imagination Nation with Maria Hinojosa,</em> features interviews with these thought-leaders about where we are and about how we can work together to create a more just and equitable world.</p>

<p>In episode one of <em>We Imagine…Us,</em> after serving three years for a white-collar crime, Albert "Bumpy" Watkins is released into a post-Covid America, where he has to navigate his new status as a formerly incarcerated person  and his new role as a single parent to teenager Mercy Watkins. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>Behind the Series</em> is a short-run series about the shows previously featured on this very podcast: <em>Radiotopia Presents</em>. This week, we’re talking with the creative team behind our latest series, <em>a hit dog will holler</em>. Today's episode is full of spoilers  — so if you haven't heard the series yet, we suggest finishing all the episodes before listening to this conversation. </p>

<p><em>a hit dog will holler</em> tells the story of two Black women activists who find their lives connected in surprising ways. Today, we sit down with three of the leading members of the team, writer Inda Craig-Galván, producer Gisele Regatão, and sound designer Sandra Lopez-Monsalve to reflect on the show’s highlights and creative challenges; from adapting a play into a podcast, creating a major character out of abstract sound elements, and the decisions that go into telling fictional stories about the real world.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>Behind the Series</em> is a short-run series about the shows previously featured on this very podcast: <em>Radiotopia Presents</em>. This week, we’re talking with the creative team behind our latest series, <em>a hit dog will holler</em>. Today's episode is full of spoilers  — so if you haven't heard the series yet, we suggest finishing all the episodes before listening to this conversation. </p>

<p><em>a hit dog will holler</em> tells the story of two Black women activists who find their lives connected in surprising ways. Today, we sit down with three of the leading members of the team, writer Inda Craig-Galván, producer Gisele Regatão, and sound designer Sandra Lopez-Monsalve to reflect on the show’s highlights and creative challenges; from adapting a play into a podcast, creating a major character out of abstract sound elements, and the decisions that go into telling fictional stories about the real world.</p>

      <title>S***hole Country BONUS: AfroQueer's Ghana 21</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Radiotopia Presents and S***hole Country is proud to present a bonus episode from AfroQueer. 2021 has been a really rough year for Ghana’s LGBTQI people. Police raided and shut down a queer community center in Accra; 21 people attending a paralegal workshop in the city of Ho were arrested and locked up for 21 days before the case was dropped; and eight MPs have come up with draft legislation that, if adopted, makes it a crime just to be queer or a queer ally. But the LGBT community are fighting back - with a #KilltheBill campaign. Ghanaian filmmaker, Edem Robby, reports on what’s been happening and why - and, in a rare interview, she sits down with some of the so-called Ho 21 to hear the horrifying story of their arrests.</p>

<p>This episode from AfroQueer was reported by Edem Robby. Produced and written by Penny Dale. Story Editor is Kerry Donahue. AfroQueer is executive Produced by Selly Thiam. Rachel Wamoto is the social media manager, Tevin Sudi, and Mercy Barno are the audio editors. Listen to Human Being (Just like you) by Wanlov The Kubolor that was featured in this episode.

<p>A warm, funny, and intimate podcast that tells stories about the black diaspora, <em>The Stoop</em> has had an interesting run with Radiotopia. After landing as a top ten finalist in Radiotopia’s 2016 <em>Podquest</em> search, <em>The Stoop</em> launched a year later as an independent podcast, released a four-episode run on <em>Showcase</em> in 2018, and returned three years later as the newest network show to join Radiotopia. As <em>The Stoop</em> moves into this next stage with the network, producers Hana Baba and Leila Day reflect on what they’ve learned and what they’re still discovering: from producing stories that balance journalism ethos and the personal to what they hope they’re answering for their intended audience.</p>

Initially released in 2018, this five-part series tells the story of brain scientist Alice Flaherty’s journey to understand the madness that consumed her brain and body for a time—a journey which eventually led to acclaimed author and “great god of depression” William Styron. Three years later, producers Karen Brown and Pagan Kennedy reflect on the show’s creative challenges; from making a podcast for the first time to telling a serialized story that isn’t about a crime.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Occasionally between <em>Showcase</em> series, we’ll bring you surprise bonus episodes, like the one you’re about to hear. It’s a recording of a live conversation inspired by <em>Ways of Hearing</em>, the very first series we ever featured here on <em>Showcase</em>. <br>
<br>
Since the series aired, writer, host, co-producer (and excellent musician) Damon Krukowski has taken the podcast to the page, with <em>Ways of Hearing</em> the book, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/ways-hearing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">published by MIT Press</a> in May 2019. <br>
<br>
The conversation was recorded live before a studio audience on April 9 at the PRX Podcast Garage in Allston, Massachusetts and was mixed by Ian Coss. It was led by Damon, with Radiotopia Executive Producer Julie Shapiro, Ian Coss, who co-produced and sound designed the podcast, Matt Browne, who edited the book, and James Goggin, who designed the book.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In the final episode of <em>Spacebridge</em>, big TV-satellite “spacebridges” become popular in the USSR, but remain a logistical nightmare—and for American producers, especially—a labor of love that few can afford. Meanwhile, a new breed of citizen diplomat enters the scene, determined to do an end-run around the USSR’s ancient telephone system. They find ways to connect people via a new-fangled contraption, the modem. The consequences of those connections linger today.</p>

Battling language and technological barriers, Soviet and American musicians, computing pioneers, scientists, and even kids find a way to stage a series of exchanges across the skies — at first awkward, but growing more meaningful as Cold War paranoia ratchets ever higher.<br>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>Spacebridge</em> tells a largely-forgotten saga of the late Cold War, when despair about the prospects of a nuclear conflict gripped the world. Both Soviets and Americans grasped at emerging communication technology via satellite and early Internet “spacebridges” that brought together citizen diplomats ranging from New Agers to tech-enthusiasts to astronauts. The urge to “just connect” helped tilt the world from top-down broadcasting to the more horizontal, Internet-levelled society where we all now live…for better and/or for worse.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>The Stoop</em> talks to interracial couples having difficult conversations around race, love and identity at a time when racial tensions are high. And when there’s kids in the mix, these conversations can be even harder. We also hear from Professor Shantel Buggs—author of the study “Dating in the Time of #BlackLivesMatter”—who shares her findings from talking with with dozens of women about whether awareness of racial issues mattered when they were choosing a partner. <br>
<br>
This mini-series of <em>The Stoop</em> is produced especially for <em>Showcase</em> from PRX’s Radiotopia. It’s hosted and produced by Leila Day and Hana Baba, edited by Julie Caine and Casey Miner, engineered by Seth Samuel and Chris Hoff, and associate produced by Jessica Jupiter. Music by Daoud Anthony and artwork by Neema Iyer. Special thanks to KALW, the NPR Story Lab, and California Humanities.<br>

With him are other Magical Negroes: Mother Abigail, Bagger Vance, and God (with a Little g). When John learns the nature of his power, he doesn’t want to be magical anymore and refuses to go. But everyone has to play their part, or the universe might fall apart. John Coffey and the rest of the Magical Negroes wrestle with question; are we all destined to play the roles we are cast?</p>

Mohamed’s father died of brain cancer in 1998, carrying all of these secrets with him into the grave. 

Also in episode five: We meet Swedish comedian Tobias Ström, whose long-distance girlfriend told him she was dying of cancer. But the details didn’t quite add up.

Secrets is produced and hosted by Mohamed El Abed and Martin Johnson, with additional reporting by Åsa Secher, from the Swedish production company, Soundtelling. Executive producer is Julie Shapiro. Artwork is by Sepidar Hosseini, and music is by Min stora sorg.

<p>When Mohamed’s mom was left alone with her six children, she worked herself to death and eventually collapsed at home with a heart attack. Mohamed was 12 years old. Now, 25 years later, there is no one to answer the questions he would like to ask: How much did she know about Maria, the secret sister? How much did his father lie to her?</p>

<p>Also in episode four: Andrea Hunter and her boyfriend had two children together. Turns out he was also living a completely separate life in London – a life that she knew nothing about.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In <em>The Polybius Conspiracy</em>, producers Jon Frechette and Todd Luoto investigate the decades-old urban legend of Polybius, a mysterious arcade game from the '80s whose alleged existence in the Pacific Northwest is fueled by myth and an obsessive online fan base, and which may have factored in the abduction of two teenage boys. Told as a hybrid documentary/fictional story, the series is an artful meditation on how urban legends take hold and spread, and an exploration into how we consume and perpetuate information in the internet age.</p>

<p>In Episode Seven: The Final Level, fact, fabrication, history and hoax converge as the search for Marc comes full circle.</p>

<p><em>The Polybius Conspiracy</em> is written and produced by Jon Frechette and Todd Luoto, and hosted, sound designed and mixed by Jon Frechette. Field producer is Dylan Reiff. Executive producer is Julie Shapiro.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In <em>The Polybius Conspiracy</em>, producers Jon Frechette and Todd Luoto investigate the decades-old urban legend of Polybius, a mysterious arcade game from the '80s whose alleged existence in the Pacific Northwest is fueled by myth and an obsessive online fan base, and which may have factored in the abduction of two teenage boys. Told as a hybrid documentary/fictional story, the series is an artful meditation on how urban legends take hold and spread, and an exploration into how we consume and perpetuate information in the internet age.</p>

<p>In Episode Four: The Rewind, sometimes journalists pursue a mystery; other times, it pursues them. An unexpected phone call from Naomi Halbrook leads to more revelations, while a competing documentary project about Polybius leads to conflict.</p>

        <![CDATA[In The Polybius Conspiracy, producers Jon Frechette and Todd Luoto investigate the decades-old urban legend of Polybius, a mysterious arcade game from the '80s whose alleged existence in the Pacific Northwest is fueled by myth and an obsessive online fan base, and which may have factored in the abduction of two teenage boys. Told as a hybrid documentary/fictional story, the series is an artful meditation on how urban legends take hold and spread, and an exploration into how we consume and perpetuate information in the internet age.

In Episode Four: The Rewind, sometimes journalists pursue a mystery; other times, it pursues them. An unexpected phone call from Naomi Halbrook leads to more revelations, while a competing documentary project about Polybius leads to conflict.

The Polybius Conspiracy is written and produced by Jon Frechette and Todd Luoto, and hosted, sound designed and mixed by Jon Frechette. Field producer is Dylan Reiff. Executive producer is Julie Shapiro.

In <em>The Polybius Conspiracy</em>, producers Jon Frechette and Todd Luoto investigate the decades-old urban legend of Polybius, a mysterious arcade game from the '80s whose alleged existence in the Pacific Northwest is fueled by myth and an obsessive online fan base, and which may have factored in the abduction of two teenage boys.

<p>In Episode One: The Player, an investigation into the origins of the Polybius legend leads to Bobby, who claims the game was responsible for his abduction as a teenager. In the 35 years since, Bobby has remained steadfast with his story, going so far as to organize a for-profit walking tour while obsessively searching for the one person he believes could corroborate his allegations. Local players from the Portland arcade scene cast doubt on Bobby’s story, as do journalists who refute the game as ever having existed.</p>

        <![CDATA[Introducing our new Showcase series! In The Polybius Conspiracy, producers Jon Frechette and Todd Luoto investigate the decades-old urban legend of Polybius, a mysterious arcade game from the '80s whose alleged existence in the Pacific Northwest is fueled by myth and an obsessive online fan base, and which may have factored in the abduction of two teenage boys. Told as a hybrid documentary/fictional story, the series is an artful meditation on how urban legends take hold and spread, and an exploration into how we consume and perpetuate information in the internet age.

Stay tuned for the first episode, “The Player,” coming up October 6th.]]>

        <![CDATA[In Tokyo, people on crowded trains pretend they’re asleep, to avoid eye contact. But in modern-day New York – richer, neater, just as noisy – count the headphones: it’s like we’re avoiding ear contact. In this episode, Damon examines how digital technology is privatizing public space. Guests include writer/activist Jeremiah Moss and historian Emily Thompson.

This is the second episode of Ways of Hearing, a six-part podcast hosted by musician Damon Krukowski (Galaxie 500, Damon &amp; Naomi), exploring the nature of listening in our digital world.

Credits: Produced by Damon Krukowski, Max Larkin and Ian Coss. Written and hosted by Damon Krukowski. Sound design by Ian Coss. Executive Producer is Julie Shapiro. Showcase is a production of Radiotopia from PRX.]]>
