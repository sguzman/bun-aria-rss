      <title>Introducing: That Moment When</title>
      <description>Introducing That Moment When: Stories of specific and honest relational touchpoints that changed a person’s life. 
All Christians have a story about how they came to know God. But those stories aren’t always simple. They can be complicated, counterintuitive, even painful. 
In this podcast, we’ll hear from Lecrae, Barnabas Piper, Christina Im, Portia Collins, Trevin Wax, and others about that one moment in their lives when everything changed. But more importantly, how every little moment in our lives matters.
