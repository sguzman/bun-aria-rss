      <title>Republicans Gain Momentum as November Nears</title>
      <description>Three weeks from the midterm elections, the GOP's prospects for taking the House and Senate seem to be rising. President Biden pledges that his first bill in 2023 will be to protect abortion access, but the issues that are top of mind for voters include inflation and crime. One example is the race for Governor in New York, where Lee Zeldin is closing fast on incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul.

      <title>Is the U.S. Ready for a Cold War With China?</title>
      <description>With Xi Jinping poised this week to win another term as China's leader, the country's course seems set for confrontational nationalism, and perhaps an attempt to take Taiwan by force. But the U.S. seems woefully unprepared for a new Cold War, as the Pentagon misses recruitment targets and Congress focuses on social spending instead of buying ships and airplanes.
