   <media:description>Hi guys! Thank you for supporting our channel and our series Childhood sweethearts! As you all know, we have had to censor a lot of our content to comply with Youtube's policies. This means that many of the super romantic parts of Childhood Sweethearts have been edited out to make it family-friendly.

 However! We are so excited to announce that soon we will be moving our content to REBL, which is a new animation platform where we won‚Äôt have to censor our content like Childhood Sweethearts anymore!

REBL as the name implies will be different because there will be full content freedom, no ads, no clickbait, instead you will follow human curators to discover series you‚Äôll love. 

REBL is about to launch in the coming week, meaning you'll be able to watch and create uncensored content on a new creative platform. Make sure to check out our REBL Kickstarter page and to reserve one of the limited packages before it's too late!

   <media:description>I was born on November 27, 1940, in San Francisco's Chinatown during the hour and year of the dragon. My mother was of Eurasian ancestry making her a halfie and my father was an opera star who toured the US where, from a young age, I was exposed to the world of entertainment and when I was 1 year old, appeared in films alongside my father. In many ways, the camera became my first love but that was cut short when my family decided to move back to Hong Kong.

My name is Lee Xiao Long, or Bruce Lee and I broke racial barriers by becoming the first ever Hollywood martial artist in film.

   <media:description>'I was diagnosed with Anorexia and couldn't believe it. I knew my condition was serious when I could no longer feed myself as I had to be fed through tubes. I was in the hospital for weeks. There was no other option than to drop out of school and my mom even had to quit her job to take care of me.

I learned how little value other peoples opinions have. The most important things are the love you have from friends and family but even more important than that is the love you should have for yourself. I am me. I am beautiful in my own way and I don't feel the need to have to follow society and trends about being skinny. Why do I need people who only love me for how I look? It's been a long journey getting here, I really hope that my story can help to warn people that are about to fall into the same trap.'

We chose this story because we want to encourage people to speak up if something similar has happened to them and to seek help if they're still in such a situation. We hope this video will encourage people to feel empathy and compassion for those who have gone through such experiences. And we hope that it will encourage us all to do what we can to prevent these things from happening. Even if it does happen we want to encourage people to speak up for their own safety

   <media:description>Being a young child I knew for sure; you belong to me and I will always belong to you. Why did my parents not feel the same way? Why were they always fighting? Was it my fault? Was I not good enough? You know, after all that happened, I had no other option than to make a drastic decision; &quot;I never want to see my parents ever again.&quot;

We chose this story because we want to encourage people to speak up if something similar has happened to them and to seek help if they're still in such a situation. We hope this video will encourage people to feel empathy and compassion for those who have gone through such experiences. And we hope that it will encourage us all to do what we can to prevent these things from happening. Even if it does happen we want to encourage people to speak up for their own safety

   <media:description>In 2019, five Indian seafarers were #kidnapped in the Gulf of Guinea by Nigerian #pirates and held #hostage for more than two months. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è  

It all happened so fast. The moment I realized that all I was wearing was my underwear that I had gone to sleep in, was the same moment one of the pirates fired at the floor and a bullet fragment struck me in my left shin, lodging itself just an inch from the bone.

Pirate: &quot;GET UP NOW!!&quot; üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

They marched us outside and onto the deck and then into a speedboat that was waiting for us next to the ship. We were now their hostages - 5 Indian Sailors and 1 Nigerian Captain - and they were taking us deep into the forest to await our fate. They tied us together on a platform the size of a car that was floating on a mangrove swamp and left us there as they celebrated their capture by firing shots in the air for nearly half an hour.

   <media:description>What would you do if your crush who broke your heart, walked back into your life a year later? What if you were stuck together for 2 weeks with no choice but to be around each other every day... Would you forgive him for what he did and go back to how it used to be? Or would you ignore him and move on?

&quot;I hated the fact that I was always the one who had to apologise to Lacey.  Lacey is a good person and can be a great friend, but we would be so much closer if Aiden hadn't come between us. And because of this, I know there would always be tension between us. I loved him. In the back of my mind, I've always wanted to get back at her. Hurt her the way she hurt me. I was about to knock on Carter's door, when it opened and I came face-to-chest with Carter chest.


Carter: &quot;Take a picture. It will last longer.&quot; 
Mercedes: &quot;Um, r-right. Is Lacey home?&quot; 
Carter: &quot;Nope. Her pet came and picked her up about ten minutes ago. Just missed them.&quot; 
My lips spread in a thin line at his word choice. Describing Aiden as a 'pet' was not cool. Not when he was so, so much more than that.  &quot;But, you're welcome to come in if you'd like.&quot; His eyes swept over me not-so-subtly and I felt my heart rate quicken. 
Every girl wanted Carter Williams to notice her. I felt like I was beginning my five seconds of fame.  
Mercedes: &quot;You're asking me to come in?&quot; 
Carter: &quot;Well, that's what it looks like. Unless you have something better to do, of course.&quot;
