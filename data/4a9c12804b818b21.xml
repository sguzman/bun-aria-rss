This video is a different rendition of my normal challenge videos, where there are THREE hunters trying to stop me from beating Minecraft.

We're so close to 30 million subscribers! Make sure to subscribe :) also congrats to Mr Beast on 100 million!!!

In this challenge, the pot starts at 1 million dollars and it goes down $69 every 1 second. When I beat the game, the money that's left is given away to a RANDOM SUBSCRIBER! So make sure to subscribe! There's a catch though. If I don't beat the game quick enough, the money goes into the negatives, and that's how much I have to pay my 3 friends that are hunting me down!

It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,000,000 likes, I might try and convince someone else to do it! 

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.18 challenge that we have decided to try. We try and survive 100 floors on a Minecraft death elevator. We challenged a developer to code 100 floors that increase in difficulty, with one goal, kill us! If they kill us before we beat the 100th floor, they win. If we survive 100 floors, we win. 100 floors may feel like 100 days of hardcore in this challenge :)

If this video gets 2,000,000 likes we'll do it again :)

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.17 challenge that we have decided to try. We try and find ways to die random deaths that are selected after each round. We have five minutes to find out how to die the way that was chosen before we lose. Me and my friend George both get different random deaths, and whoever loses first loses the game.

This is a little different than my normal content. Rather than being about combat or about trapping, this is about racing and about general Minecraft skills. This was super fun, challenging, and pretty funny overall.

This video, my friends can one shot me in Minecraft. If they hit me at all, I die, and I lose. If I look at them, they are frozen with lazer beams on them. They can't move or hit me at all. They have to sneak up on me.

We haven't decided on a name for this, but if this video gets 2 million likes we will consider doing a rematch! This video is a different rendition of our normal challenges, where there are two hunters trying to kill me while we have random items.

We can break blocks, but they don't drop items. There is a 1000x1000 border. Every two minutes we each get a completely random item. We can't pick up each others items.

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to survive, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a battle, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

Sapnap: @Sapnap 
Antfrost: @Antfrost 
Awesamdude: @awesamdude 

We decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there are not FOUR hunters but FIVE instead of just one.

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo AND my friend Antfrost AND my friend awesamdude tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll do a rematch!

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin

BadBoyHalo:  @BadBoyHalo 
George:  @GeorgeNotFound 
Sapnap:  @Sapnap 

We decided to call this series Minecraft Hitmen. This video there are THREE hunters/hitmen instead of just one.

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to survive for 100 minutes, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo tries to prevent me from surviving. Every 10 minutes there is a 10 minute period of invincibility. They can see me through walls, and the world is small. It's a chase, a race, and it's super intense. A lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,500,000 likes we'll do it again!

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed runner / survivalist in Minecraft against a killer / assassin / hitmen
