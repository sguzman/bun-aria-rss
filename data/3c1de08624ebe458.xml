      <title>Introducing: Mother Country Radicals</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Zayd Dohrn was born - underground - his parents were radicals and counter-culture outlaws, on the run from the FBI. Now, Zayd takes us back to the 1970s, when his parents and their young friends in the Weather Underground Organization declared war on the United States government. They brawled with riot cops on the streets of Chicago, bombed the Pentagon and the U.S Capitol, broke comrades out of prison, and teamed up with Black militant groups to rob banks, fight racism - and help build a revolution.

      <itunes:subtitle>Hey! Whether you&apos;ve been listening from the jump, or just discovered us because of an algorithm controlled by a billionaire sociopath, welcome! This is Pod Save America, a no-bullshit conversation about politics hosted by former Obama aides Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer and Tommy Vietor. We&apos;re here to break down the biggest stories, scandals, and political fights - and talk about what each of us can do about it. We publish new episodes twice a week, and starting on October 26, 2021, we’ll be shifting our schedule in this feed to Tuesdays and Thursdays.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In episode four of this five-part series on the Iowa caucuses, we take you behind the scenes as the campaigns prepare for one of the biggest nights of the primary season, the Liberty and Justice Dinner. Obama’s speech at the event back in 2007 gave his candidacy an enormous boost, but we’ll explain why the evening is as much about what you say as how well you’ve organized. Then we’ll consider proposals to change the primary process that would reduce Iowa’s influence as we continue to wrestle with the question: is this really the best way to pick a president? This series is hosted by Tommy Vietor and produced by Pineapple Street Studios.</p><p> </p><p></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In episode three of this five-part miniseries on the Iowa caucuses, we dive into the all-important race to lock down the state’s key endorsements. These campaign surrogates, always critical, loom particularly large for the five US Senators running who may have to spend the bulk of January in impeachment hearings. We’ll also dig into all the criticisms of the Iowa caucuses, from the demographics of the state to the charge that the caucuses themselves are undemocratic. Plus: a ukulele. The series is hosted by Tommy Vietor and produced by Pineapple Street Studios.</p><p> </p><p></p>
