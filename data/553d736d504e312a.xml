The lifestyle he’s created means its hard to tell if he’s working or playing since it’s all intertwined in a beautiful manner. From real estate development to investment fund management to custom gun grips, it’s all in a fun day’s work. With 5 companies that have done over 7 figures, Charles is staring at the 9 figure mark as his next goal.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everybody can display strength in stressful times unlike a few, whom you call a ‘real hero’. Katrina has proved herself to be one during the pandemic. She has been a true frontline warrior with her great contribution to the well-being of mankind in those uncertain times. Every day she was combating death, trying to save the lives of people, but never chose to step down.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katrina Schabacker is Steve’s wife. She is a healthcare professional. Starting as a</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNA</span></em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">, she has come a long way in her career.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How you grow up and what environment you’re exposed to during your formative years can play a significant role in – ‘who you become’. Christian had a run of good luck with an upbringing in an entrepreneurial family. Seeing his Dad chasing his dreams and progressing always motivated him “to keep trying as you never know where it's going to lead you in the end.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Schabacker is Steve’s son and currently a full-time police officer that he always wanted to be. Growing up with an entrepreneurial Dad, Christian learned to be relentless as he says to his father: “See, you succeed makes me want to succeed even more.” At only 22 years old, he has come a long way, but that’s not an end to the path of his dreams. Eventually, he wants to start his own company or some side hustle to be “his own Boss”, and build a financially better future for himself and his family.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this very special episode of</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Tactical Entrepreneur</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcast, the father-son duo engage in a fascinating conversation by having a few laughs and some serious stuff that genuinely touches you with their authentic revelations. Christian lets out what life skills he developed, having been raised in an entrepreneurial family, how he feels about achieving his long-desired goal, what his future dreams are, and so much more. The father and the son made it all happen in their lives, believing “ anything’s possible” if only you are willing, and they are all set to instill the same in you.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How Steve has been a constant motivation for Christian in his growing years.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What traits do you find in common between working as an entrepreneur and as a cop that Cristian always feels inspired about.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What sets Cristian apart from guys of his age.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why Christian stresses prioritizing family time.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">And many more interesting facts!</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><strong>“The biggest piece of wisdom I can think of is, trusting your gut.

Growing up with an entrepreneurial Dad, Christian learned to be relentless as he says to his father: “See, you succeed makes me want to succeed even more.” At only 22 years old, he has come a long way, but that’s not an end to the path of his dreams. Eventually, he wants to start his own company or some side hustle to be “his own Boss”, and build a financially better future for himself and his family.</p> <p>In this very special episode of <em>the Tactical Entrepreneur</em> Podcast, the father-son duo engage in a fascinating conversation by having a few laughs and some serious stuff that genuinely touches you with their authentic revelations. Christian lets out what life skills he developed, having been raised in an entrepreneurial family, how he feels about achieving his long-desired goal, what his future dreams are, and so much more. The father and the son made it all happen in their lives, believing “ anything’s possible” if only you are willing, and they are all set to instill the same in you.</p> <p> </p> <p>What you will learn:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How Steve has been a constant motivation for Christian in his growing years.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What traits do you find in common between working as an entrepreneur and as a cop that Cristian always feels inspired about.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What sets Cristian apart from guys of his age.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Why Christian stresses prioritizing family time.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">And many more interesting facts!</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Favorite Quote:</p> <p>“The biggest piece of wisdom I can think of is, trusting your gut. That’s what is going to steer you in the right direction. Even if it steers you in the wrong direction, what I've realized is you will learn more than you ever could.”</p> <p>-          <em>Christian Schabacker</em></p> <p> </p> <p>Connect with Christian:</p> <p>Find Christian on Facebook <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/christian.schabacker.5">here</a></p> <p> </p> <p>How to Get Involved:</p> <p>Steve Schabacker is the co-founder of Sheepdog Firearms and an entrepreneur, bestselling author, and marketer.

From his holistic and bottom-up approach to health and wellness to his belief that a client/trainer relationship should last a lifetime, Marc’s lessons are not limited to working out; instead, they demonstrate that success in all walks of life only occurs with consistent, deliberate, repeatable, and intentional action.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this episode of the Tactical Training Podcast, Steve Schabaker and fitness guest Marc Zalmanoff discuss how putting yourself in uncomfortable situations can help your business, the importance of establishing boundaries and limits in your day-to-day life, and how to make sustainable, consistent, and beneficial decisions amidst the hectic nature of the outside world. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How Marc has used challenging, intense, and uncomfortable workouts to help him gain perspective and be a better entrepreneur</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why calendars and scheduling your day in minute detail is so vital to daily success</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What long term, holistic fitness, and health looks like</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why living your best professional and personal life is simply about the "next choice"</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">And much more!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><strong>“I think that's one of the biggest things that people miss in the fitness journey is… that it doesn't end.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a firefighter and hero is no easy feat. After 15 years of service as a first responder, Gary Roberts has had several sleepless nights, dealt with excruciating pain from arthritis, and witnessed the unimaginable. PTSD is common for most first responders to experience, but it’s rare for them to be able to really get the help they truly need.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Gary Roberts not only sells his own high-quality CBD but has made it his mission to be a passionate advocate on his podcast:</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Good Dudes Grow.</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">He understands the importance of a product to be what it says it is, and in his case, one without THC.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this episode of “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tactical Entrepreneur</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, Steve and Gary talk about the current opioid crisis in the world, and how CBD has changed not only their personal lives but the lives and families of many.

Through everything, Sammie maintains a love of the outdoors and unstoppable energy.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this episode of The Tactical Entrepreneur Podcast, Steve and Sammie dig into the parallels between hunting and business strategy, the need for extreme perseverance in entrepreneurship, developing a mindset that plans with the end result in mind, and how to set boundaries (or cut ties entirely) with unhealthy people for your own health and the health of your business.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you best protect the people around you? You teach them to defend themselves. As the world goes through massive changes, more and more people seek out the knowledge they need to stay safe. And if you’re the right person to teach them, you have a golden opportunity.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Scully is a Marine Veteran, former police chief, and partner at Sheepdog Firearms. His decades of experience in the military and law enforcement make him an ideal teacher, mentor, and guide to anyone hoping to dive deeper into self-defense and the world of firearms. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this episode of The Tactical Entrepreneur Podcast, Steve and Tom dig into the vital importance of taking personal responsibility for your safety and the safety of others, why you have to recognize your tribe and treat them like family if you want your business to thrive, and the trajectory of Tom’s path from Marine to firearms instructor and master storyteller. Listen in for some valuable insight on keeping customers coming through the door, no matter what’s going on in the world.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why Steve and Tom have seen a significant upswing in the number of people who want to take self-defense classes, and why so many people choose Sheepdog for their training</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How Sheepdog maintained a steady customer base, even during COVID, by pricing differently than their competition</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What Tom does daily to stay on top of his priorities and keep focused on the crucial stuff</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">And much more!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><strong>“At the end of the day, any business has to have customers to survive.
