<p><em>Psychedelics</em>. Just mentioning the word triggers a wealth of opinions, stigmas, misconceptions, and judgments that are often based on loosely founded assumptions, Hollywood depictions, or stories of good or bad “trips” that linger in our social consciousness and mythology. Putting preconceptions aside, it’s fair to say we are entering what many are calling a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-science-of-the-psychedelic-renaissance">psychedelic renaissance</a> — a new science-driven wave of thinking about psychedelics’ use for psychiatry, mental health, and well-being. </p>
<p>So, what is this reemergence about? </p>
<h3>The Psychedelic (Re)Emergence in Science and Business</h3>
<p>First, a primer. Psychedelics have been used by <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.729425/full">ancient societies</a> across the globe for thousands of years, though rigorous scientific research didn’t begin in this field until the 19th and 20th centuries. They are psychoactive substances that affect several cognitive processes in the brain, leading to altered states of consciousness and influencing perceptions, thoughts, and emotions. </p>
<p></p>
<p>By the 1950s and 1960s, there was an explosion of research into the use of psychedelics in mental health and illness. However, the counterculture movement, spikes in recreational use (and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390818300753">misuse</a>), and political unrest led to such drugs’ stigmatization, which ultimately resulted in psychedelics being classified as Schedule 1 controlled substances in 1970. This made it nearly impossible to continue conducting clinical research.  </p>
<p>The wider grouping of classic psychedelics includes various classes and varieties, including LSD (“acid”), psilocybin (“magic mushrooms”), DMT (most associated with plants such as ayahuasca), and other psychedelics such as mescaline (found in cacti such as peyote and San Pedro), ketamine, and MDMA (a component in what is known as ecstasy). </p>
<p>Each can have different mechanisms of effect within the brain, affecting the mind, perception, and behavior. The effects of psychedelics also very much vary by dose: At high doses, they can induce intense emotional experiences and even hallucinations — which can last for hours. At very low doses (referred to as <em>microdoses</em>), individuals self-administer amounts that do not impact their regular functioning.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the past decade, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35022823/">clinical interest in the field of psychedelics</a> has been reignited, and global research institutes are normalizing the conversation and engaging in multidisciplinary studies, with promising results. (This includes research centers at the University of Zurich, Imperial College, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, Johns Hopkins University, and Stanford, among several others.) While in some countries, such as Switzerland, psychedelics have been selectively approved — in a highly controlled manner — for psychiatric care and research for decades, there is now more movement in the U.S. to support the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of certain psychedelic substances as medications. </p>
<p>When it comes to the business world, the global <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/04/2307610/28124/en/The-Psychedelic-Drugs-Market-Global-Industry-Analysis-2018-2020-Growth-Trends-and-Market-Forecast-2021-2026.html">market for (legal) psychedelic</a> drugs is expected to grow at a 14.5% compound annual growth rate, reaching $6.3 billion by 2026. This is increasingly drawing the attention of business leaders and the investment industry. For example, the 2022 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, hosted a Medical Psychedelics House, with the goal of bringing together a wealth of scholars and leaders to discuss the future of psychedelics for their potential to revolutionize the field of mental health. Trade associations are popping up around the globe supporting the drugs’ legal research and use, and alongside many smaller ventures, large, publicly traded companies such as Atai Life Sciences and Compass Pathways have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/psychedelics-industry-growth-pitch-deck-ipo-ceo-interviews?r=US&IR=T">raised hundreds of millions of dollars in funding</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Science Shows About the Effects of Psychedelics</h3>
<p>What are some of the reasons for this explosion of research and investment in psychedelics? Scientific research has uncovered myriad potential applications that could change people’s lives for the better.  </p>
<p><strong>Mental health and well-being.</strong> First and foremost, in medically controlled studies, psychedelics have been clinically and empirically explored to treat a wealth of diagnosed disorders, such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036616300657">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4086777/">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.735523/full">anorexia</a>, <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2021/repeated-ketamine-infusions-reduce-symptom-severity-in-individuals-with-chronic-post-traumatic-stress-disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, various addictions, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33184743/">migraines</a>. In recent trials by Compass Pathways, a single dose of psilocybin, administered in conjunction with psychological support, led to significant improvements in patients with treatment-resistant depression. In healthy individuals, psychedelics have been shown to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35438609/">enhance mindfulness</a> and increase feelings of connection, compassion, empathy, and general and spiritual well-being — what <a href="https://michaelpollan.com/books/how-to-change-your-mind/">author Michael Pollan</a> has referred to as “the betterment of well people.” </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Self-awareness and relationships.</strong> Psychedelics have been shown to be potent modulators of social cognition and behavior. As such, they can influence the information we perceive, process, and act upon in relation to other people. Reported benefits include increased <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5581487/">emotional empathy</a>, better-quality communication, and strengthened relationships. Research shows that psychedelics can offer crucial insights and awareness regarding one’s behavior toward others, increase feelings of connectedness both internally (to one’s emotions) and externally (to others and the world at large), expand one’s access to previously hidden emotions, and lead to the development of a more positive relationship with oneself (through building competency in areas such as self-awareness, self-compassion, and self-worth).  </p>
<p><strong>Sustained change through neuroplasticity.</strong> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32194129/">Research reviews</a> highlight that psychedelic substances can support the rewiring of the brain and thus influence enduring change to psychological functioning and behavior. Some of the most commonly studied long-term changes relate to personality, in particular, heightened openness to experience, increased extraversion, and decreased neuroticism. Studies have also examined psychedelics’ effects on attitude, including mood improvement, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050654/">well-being and life satisfaction</a>, and a more enduring positive attitude toward oneself, others, and nature. Increased optimism and mindfulness are seen as key to driving some of these positive and more enduring psychological changes. </p>
<p><strong>Innovation and creativity.</strong> When it comes to creativity, psychedelics may help people exercise cognitive flexibility by activating or deactivating important brain networks that normally tend to work in opposition. In one study, microdosing LSD was found to support the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811211069113">generation of creative ideas</a> by increasing the novelty, originality, and surprising nature of participants’ responses to problems compared with those of people who received a placebo. Volunteers attending ayahuasca retreats in the Netherlands developed a significantly higher <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.721537/full">capacity to decenter themselves</a> (that is, see the world from other people’s perspectives), which is known to stimulate original thinking.  </p>
<p>Creativity is a particularly challenging concept to measure, especially in a lab setting. But at a minimum, the accumulated body of knowledge attests that psychedelics help users boost their capacity for creativity and pursue unusual, less obvious lines of thought. </p>
<p>Overall, research indicates that most psychedelics are considered <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)61462-6/fulltext">physiologically safe</a>, with low levels of toxicity and fewer <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02698811211069100">adverse effects</a> than other substances, including alcohol. In controlled research studies conducted during the past 30 years, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8905125/">no lasting psychiatric consequences</a> attributable to psychedelics were reported among participants, and no significant physiological harm or hospitalizations have occurred during more than 2,000 controlled dosing sessions.  </p>
<p>That said, psychedelics are powerful and potent drugs that should not be abused or exploited. Especially in larger doses, they must be handled ethically and under the care of experienced professionals. It must also be noted that people with personal or family histories of schizophrenia are advised not to take certain psychedelics, such as DMT, because they can trigger psychotic episodes. Intentionally considering both psychological and physical safety (through what is commonly referred to as <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/7854_2021_298"><em>set</em> and <em>setting</em></a>) and working with experienced professionals are paramount. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So, what does all of this mean for the business world?</p>
<p>The intent of this article is not to recommend the use of psychedelics in the workplace but to provide insight into a growing but still controversial and stigmatized industry. The psychedelic renaissance is generating momentum and opportunity and sparking new conversations that bridge the worlds of nature, medicine, and management. </p>
<p>According to a quotation often attributed to Albert Einstein, “You can’t solve a problem with the same level of consciousness that created it.” Thus, at a time when <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide">global mental health is in decline</a>, there’s a need for new and innovative solutions to increasingly complex systemic problems, and organizations are calling for leaders with more connectedness, self-awareness, compassion and empathy, psychedelics may indeed have an increasing role to play.  </p>

<p>Driven by customers, activist investors, governments, and their own values, companies are increasingly looking to make a more positive impact on the environment by adopting a sustainability focus. An important arena for those activities is the emerging bioeconomy, which focuses on using biological (nonfossil) resources, waste streams, and manufacturing byproducts, often combined with a circular, whole-life-cycle product perspective.</p>
<p>This movement is enabled by new materials technologies and processes that replace fossil-based ingredients with bio-based alternatives from the agriculture, forestry, and marine industries. Circularity comes in with strategies aimed at extending the useful life of products for as long as possible and then reusing their materials and components in some way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Multiple materials and technologies can replace fossil-based ingredients and components, such as packaging made from bamboo and mushrooms, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals made from seaweed and algae, and plastics made from microbes and dandelions. The global demand for plastic alone is 300 million tons per year, a figure projected to quadruple by 2050. Bioplastics made from plant-based feedstocks are a way to make a dent in the fossil-based standards.</p>
<h3>A Decade-Plus of Experimentation</h3>
<p>Products and processes in the bioeconomy cover wide ground. Think using bacteria to extend the shelf life of dairy products, consuming gut-health foods that reduce our reliance on antibiotics for animals and humans, and generating energy from sewage sludge — and then using the waste from <em>that</em> process to make agricultural fertilizer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are more than a decade into experimentation. Coca-Cola, for instance, introduced the first iteration of its PlantBottle in 2009, positioning the 30% bio-based plastic as a more sustainable alternative to traditional plastic. These bottles were not compostable, though, and accusations of “biowashing” followed. In response, the company has stepped up its research into 100% bio-based plastic, sourced from sugarcane and the residues of sugarcane processing, with prototypes introduced in October 2021. Coca-Cola shared its technology, first with noncompetitive brands such as Heinz ketchup and Ford Fusion hybrid cars (for the fabric interior), and then, in 2018, with competitors, to <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/faqs/what-is-plantbottle-packaging">scale up demand and drive down pricing</a>.</p>
<p>Other projects are yielding a variety of market-ready products, with varying degrees of market adoption. One of the biggest circular bioeconomy success stories comes from Sardinia, Italy, where biotechnology company Novamont and chemical company Eni have transformed a former petrochemical plant into a large-scale high-tech biorefinery. The joint venture, called Matrica, processes locally grown <a href="https://www.bbi.europa.eu/bbi-ju-first2run-project-bioeconomies-aim-become-beating-heart-local-communities-both-rural-and">thistle weeds into vegetable oils and then bioplastics</a> and biocide preservatives, which can be used in laundry dishwashing products. Thousands of locals who lost jobs when the petrochemical plant closed now work in the biorefinery. The thistles can be grown on poor-quality land nearby, where wheat is no longer profitable for local farmers.</p>
<p>Many of these projects extend across borders. Swiss chemical company Clariant, a fossil-based business, began pivoting in 2009 to bio-based products generated from waste. The company developed a process it calls “sunliquid” <a href="https://www.clariant.com/en/Corporate/Blog/2018-Blog-Posts/03/Fueling-our-cars-with-straw">to convert waste straw</a> from cereal production into biofuels. Clariant upskilled its workforce to make this change and completed the construction of its first commercial sunliquid cellulosic ethanol plant in October 2021, in Podari, Romania. It has licensed the technology to two projects in China as well as projects in Slovakia, Poland, and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Other projects are localized to take advantage of region-specific wastes and resources. In Lake Victoria, Kenya, Alisam Products uses up to 70% of the waste generated from local fish processing to make leather from fish skin and shoelaces from fish intestines, and exports its products globally. The company helps solve the problem of how to handle some of the <a href="https://allafrica.com/stories/202110060071.html">150,000 metric tons of fish waste</a> generated annually in the city of Kisumu — waste that was polluting the area and causing the growth of lake weeds, which in turn were affecting water transportation and fishing.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Ireland, Biorefinery Glas converts freshly harvested grass into feed supplements and fertilizers. Historically, grass has been the main feedstock for animal agriculture in Ireland, relying on expensive grassland management and driving down farm revenues. Using biotechnology innovations, the supplements provide higher nutritional value and increase grass’s economic value. Biorefinery Glas is a cross-sector project involving agricultural cooperatives, farmers, and research institutions.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Fueling the Bioeconomy: Ways to Move Forward</h3>
<p>Companies have an opportunity today to become providers or consumers of bio-derived products, while other stakeholders, including governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), can provide the economic incentives and structural frameworks that will allow the bioeconomy to further flourish. Process regeneration technologies can have high conversion costs. Thus, financial support, particularly from governments, is imperative.</p>
<p>Over 60 countries have begun developing coordinated bioeconomy strategies, including China, Canada, and South Africa.<a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> That includes providing financing: In the European Union, for example, the public-private partnership Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking has invested over 3.7 billion euros ($3.7 billion) in bio-based projects.<a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> South Africa’s OneBio fund, a public-private partnership, will provide 83.5 million rands ($4.8 million) to biotech startups.</p>
<p>Manufacturing-led partnerships also need to be further nurtured. Clothing manufacturer and retailer Patagonia is known for its innovative approach to sustainability, and it’s no surprise that it has embraced the sustainable bio-circular economy, with a focus not just on sourcing but on final end state. Through its Worn Wear program, customers can get Patagonia items repaired (or learn how to repair them themselves) or receive store credit for trading in used Patagonia products that are cleaned and then resold. Patagonia was central in the establishment of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-patagonia-sustainable-apparel-coalition-higg-index-2019-4">Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC)</a> following an unexpected collaboration with Walmart in 2009. The SAC has since brought together over 250 diverse stakeholders, including brands, retailers, manufacturers, NGOs, and governments, to work to transform the apparel, footwear, and textile industries.</p>
<p>Businesses can also take advantage of current public-private partnership opportunities, even when regulations fall behind innovation. For example, aquaculture waste — fish sludge — can be used to make a valuable bio-based fertilizer, but it currently cannot be used in the EU due to safety and hygiene restrictions. In Spain, the BETA Technology Center is working with the EU to address this gap; BETA has <a href="https://www.uvic.cat/en/news/the-eus-fishing-industry-produces-25-million-tonnes-of-waste-per-year-that-could-be-converted">obtained funding</a> from the European Commission to develop a system to obtain fertilizers from fish sludge that is both safe and technically feasible.</p>
<h3>Develop a Business Strategy for the Bioeconomy</h3>
<p>Managers looking for business opportunities in the bioeconomy will need to monitor new materials and bio-based products coming to market, consider new sources of supply, and seek — or create — new markets for new materials or more sustainable products. They also will be required to add capabilities in terms of both skills and technologies. For most businesses, this is an evolutionary process consisting of the following four stages:</p>
<p><strong>1. Materials innovation.</strong> A logical starting point is to explore the potential for substituting nonrenewable materials with biological analogs. Companies that see potential for themselves as producers of new bio-based materials will need employees with skills in biotechnology and chemical engineering.</p>
<p><strong>2. Process rethinking.</strong> In this second stage, organizations consider production processes that maximize the use of raw and residual materials. An example is introducing enzymes that strengthen fibers into textile production so that fabrics last longer while also reducing the need for water and energy in the production process.</p>
<p><strong>3. Product reinvention.</strong> Here, organizations consider production outputs that can be used for new purposes. For example, whey from cheese production has been a significant environmental pollutant when disposed of as wastewater but could instead be used to create bioplastics.</p>
<p><strong>4. Business redesign.</strong> A fully circular, bio-based business model requires rethinking the structure and operations of the organization and its entire value chain. This involves developing relationships and building networks with new partners in other industries.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Recognize Potential for Unintended Consequences</h3>
<p>There are fundamental risks to focusing on new uses for natural products, and they need to be approached with clear eyes. Early bio-based innovations, such as using biomass for energy and fuel, led to large-scale sustainability problems, including land degradation and biodiversity loss. For example, using food staples like maize and sugarcane as feedstock for biofuel and biomass led to the ongoing “food for fuel” debate. </p>
<p>In the United States, the shift to maize for biofuel was said to have increased its price by 70% in the 2000s.<a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> It also caused problems for Indigenous populations who lost land rights, and it led to terrible working conditions for those in the biofuel industry.<a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p>
<p>Biomass companies face criticism from NGOs such as Biofuelwatch for using first-generation wood from hardwood forests. In response, U.S. company Enviva has developed the Track & Trace Wood Supply Map, which allows the public to identify each forest used by Enviva, along with a host of other details. While Enviva still sources a significant percentage of hardwood forest, the map enables NGOs and communities to hold the company to account for its sourcing practices.</p>
<p>Products that start with good intentions can have tricky outcomes down the line. Some bioplastics, such as compostable straws, have been criticized for being difficult to compost, contributing to the plastic waste problem and encouraging single usage by consumers. These challenges have the potential, though, to lead to next-generation improvements. Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China, for instance, has developed a bio-based straw that decomposes completely in a week when exposed to sunlight and oxygen.</p>
<p>Another risk of entering the bioeconomy market is that assumptions underlying a business model can change. Amyris, a North American synthetic biology company, is an example of how this can play out: The company invested heavily in biofuels in the early 2000s to take advantage of rising oil prices. However, as oil prices dropped and biofuels became less competitive, the company was forced to rapidly update its business model. Amyris acted quickly, leveraging its technological knowledge to begin manufacturing bio-based chemical alternatives, and now has pivoted to personal care, with multiple bio-based skin care, makeup, and hair care brands.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our hope is that as organizations and, indeed, the entire bio-circular economy evolves, we will see entire industries rethink their inputs, processes, and outputs within the wider context of social and ecological sustainability. Here, we are hopeful and excited to see the emergence of new and redefined industries and, in some cases, different industry sectors coming together for the first time.</p>
<p>A truly sustainable bio-circular economy will significantly alter company decision-making, production, consumption, and how we evaluate success. Sustainable bio-circular thinking can guide us to design products and packaging made from waste, seaweed, or plants that degrade in weeks or months rather than thousands of years. And, crucially, sustainable bio-circular thinking will lead to decision-making that considers material, product, and process innovations holistically to ensure that their net impacts are positive for business, society, and the environment. </p>

<p>Imagine you’re the manager of a diverse team. One day, you are troubled to hear that several Black employees feel unwelcome in the workplace. They report that two White employees were joking with other colleagues about a photo of themselves posted to social media showing them wearing racially insensitive costumes to a party. You want to be an inclusive and responsive leader, so you call the two offending employees into your office individually to address the report.</p>
<p>The first employee — we’ll call him Michael — goes on the defensive, complaining that this is a classic case of “reverse racism” and that he is being unfairly targeted by the Black employees because he’s White. </p>
<p>The second employee, John, also tries to portray himself as the victim, but in a different way. He argues that his free speech is being imperiled. He says that efforts to control what he can and cannot say in the workplace threaten his fundamental rights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What do you make of these arguments? Would you be inclined to believe both of them, or one employee more than the other? How would you address the situation with your team?</p>
<p>When members of groups with more power and resources — what social scientists call dominant groups — are accused of discrimination against those with less power and fewer resources (nondominant groups), they will sometimes seek to deflect criticism by portraying themselves as the victims of discrimination. This is known as <em>competitive victimhood</em>. Some go a step further and invoke victimhood on a new dimension of harm, changing the topic to freedom of speech, for instance, or religious liberty. We refer to this as <em>digressive victimhood</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In recent research spanning three studies of 3,081 people, we explored how people respond to claims like the ones in the scenario above. We found that people consistently respond more favorably to digressive victimhood claims (like John’s) than competitive ones. Because digressive victimhood claims complicate conversations around bias, their effectiveness means that managers may end up neglecting to address the original instances of bias they are meant to respond to. By raising awareness of this psychological phenomenon, this article aims to help managers avoid getting derailed or distracted by digressive victimhood claims, allowing them to uphold their responsibility to address discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Claiming Victimhood in Response to Accusations of Bias</h3>
<p>Members of nondominant groups who experience discrimination can highlight the discrimination they face by reporting biased behavior to supervisors or, when that fails to get results, going outside to the media or the courts. This can be seen in rising cases of <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leading-in-an-age-of-employee-activism/">employee activism</a>, such as the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/18/tesla-california-racial-harassment-discrimination-lawsuit">discrimination lawsuits against Tesla</a> by employees of color. Managers faced with reports of discrimination must explore their merits without getting distracted by the counterclaims of those accused.</p>
<p>In the opening example above, the first employee, Michael, tried to avoid facing consequences for his behavior by alleging reverse racism, deflecting blame from himself onto the Black employees who accused him of discrimination. This type of counterclaim was the basis of a lawsuit against Google in 2018 filed by James Damore, an engineer and ex-employee, who claimed that the company’s efforts to address sexism and racism in the tech industry were actually discriminatory against White and Asian men. Such competitive victimhood claims aim to make the dominant group seem virtuous and stop the criticism levied against them.</p>
<p>In contrast, the second employee, John, exhibited digressive victimhood when he said the accusation of racism levied against him threatened his freedom of speech. Digressive victimhood is also at work when individuals or businesses invoke religious liberty to deflect claims of homophobia. For example, when accused of bias for refusing to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple, the defendant in the <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission</em> case, heard by the Supreme Court in 2018, argued that his religious liberty was on the line. Like competitive victimhood claims, digressive victimhood claims aim to absolve the dominant group and deflect criticism, but they also complicate the discussion. By drawing in new topics of debate, especially big ideas around universal rights, these claims can obscure nondominant groups’ efforts to address discrimination.</p>
<h3>The Power of Digressive Victimhood</h3>
<p>A manager could easily be distracted by John’s digressive victimhood argument, thinking there was a more complicated debate to be had. This muddying of the waters might make managers hesitate to hold employees accused of causing a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-every-leader-needs-to-worry-about-toxic-culture">hostile climate</a> accountable. When that happens, managers neglect their responsibility to ensure that employees from nondominant groups are protected from discrimination at work.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103121001360">our research</a>, we asked people to read and react to victimhood claims like the ones from the opening example. Across our studies, members of dominant groups endorsed the digressive victimhood claim more strongly than the competitive victimhood claim. For example, in one study, on a scale where 1 represented “strongly disagree” and 7 “strongly agree,” digressive claims averaged a rating of 4.0, compared with 3.4 for the competitive claim. Members of nondominant groups also preferred digressive victimhood claims to competitive victimhood claims, but this preference was smaller, and both claims were endorsed less (averaging 3.5 and 3.1, respectively).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those who endorsed the digressive victimhood claim were also more likely to agree that the claim would be difficult for those originally making accusations of bias to rebut. When trying to understand why members of dominant groups show a clear preference for digressive victimhood claims, we ran statistical analyses that indicated that this preference is rooted in a belief that digressive victimhood claims are more effective at preventing further criticism. This relationship did not emerge among participants from nondominant groups.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that members of dominant groups may support digressive victimhood claims strategically. Indeed, we observed that there was a positive correlation between how biased (such as racist) people were and how strongly they endorsed a digressive victimhood argument. We even observed evidence of people acting in bad faith and supporting digressive victimhood claims when they didn’t even particularly support the abstract value undergirding the claim (such as free speech).</p>
<h3>Where to Go From Here</h3>
<p>Think back to the example of our two employees accused of racism. If you found the claim based on the threat to John’s freedom of speech more compelling, you’re not alone. The problem is that you could easily get derailed into a debate about free speech and forget about the original issue at hand — the discrimination faced by your Black employees. </p>
<p>Here are three steps managers can take to avoid getting distracted by digressive victimhood claims.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t lose focus.</strong> Competitive and digressive victimhood claims emerge when members of dominant groups are confronted with evidence of their bias. It can be easy for managers to get distracted by these counterclaims. After all, the belief that such claims are effective in silencing further criticism is one of the reasons they may be deployed. Managers should separate such counterclaims from the original grievance they are responding to and take care to weigh the sincerity and importance of each. Without this awareness, even well-intentioned managers may find themselves neglecting to address the discrimination often faced by nondominant group members in the workplace.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Consider potential motivations.</strong> It’s hard to know what people actually believe, and we’re often inclined to take the arguments people make at face value. However, our research shows that people making digressive victimhood claims may be acting in bad faith. While leaders should listen carefully to all employees, they should also be aware that some may be trying to distract their attention away from the suffering of others. Leaders might investigate counterclaimants’ commitment to the principles they are marshaling to defend themselves. Do they defend the free speech of people whose views do not align with their perspectives? How does the employee think about the consequences of exercising their speech? Do they consider that Black employees in the workplace feel insulted and harmed?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Reward accountability.</strong> Our research focused on what happens when those who engage in biased behavior try to dodge accountability and portray themselves as the victims. However, we shouldn’t expect this to happen every time an employee is called out for their biased behavior. Hopefully, some will recognize what they did was wrong, own it, apologize, and change. This kind of behavior should be rewarded and held up as an example to other employees. Knowing how to recognize when employees are claiming competitive or digressive victimhood and being able to discourage it, while also rewarding employees who take accountability, is a key part of effectively <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/apl-apl0000482.pdf">leading diverse teams</a>.</p>
<p>We hope that with a better understanding of digressive victimhood, managers will feel better equipped to respond to tricky situations and ensure that underrepresented employees can work in a bias-free climate.</p>

<p>The defining characteristic of shareholder capitalism is that one type of stakeholder — investors — is elevated above all others. But when financial performance and total shareholder returns are used as the ultimate measure of performance, it is inevitable that many companies will skimp on their other responsibilities as employers, innovators, partners, taxpayers, and local citizens.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/did-jack-welch-blow-up-the-business-world/">book by David Gelles</a>, <cite>The Man Who Broke Capitalism</cite> (Simon & Schuster, 2022), narrates how General Electric CEO Jack Welch myopically pursued <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/strategy-forum/has-strategic-management-overlooked-the-role-of-purpose-what-experts-say/">Milton Friedman’s doctrine</a> that the sole duty of business is to increase its profits. In the process, Welch systematically underinvested in people, innovation, brands, and environmental stewardship. In doing so, he created the conditions for decline at GE and, via his direct proteges and acolytes (such as the founders of 3G Capital), similar declines at companies such as Boeing and Kraft Heinz. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The shift away from a sole focus on financial returns to multistakeholder capitalism has involved a welcome rediscovery of the idea that businesses are social entities that are embedded in a network of economic relationships — a concept that was popularized in the 1990s by management thinkers such as Arie de Geus and Charles Handy. Recent business reporting has focused on the increased attention being given to stakeholders other than investors and customers. The Great Resignation and <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/five-ways-managers-can-help-prevent-quiet-quitting/">quiet quitting</a> are both manifestations of the importance of employees and the long-term consequences of treating them indifferently, while ESG (environmental, social, and governance) efforts involves giving a voice to those stakeholders (such as future generations and communities) whose interests were often overlooked under shareholder capitalism.</p>
<p>However, there is a fundamental point about multistakeholder capitalism that has not yet been fully appreciated: It involves a different kind of math because it views business as a dynamic system rather than just a mechanism for allocating capital to its most productive use. </p>
<p>The math of shareholder capitalism is <em>compensatory</em>: A deficiency in one aspect of the business, such as a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-fix-a-toxic-culture/">toxic culture</a> or poor environmental performance, is outweighed by stellar near-term financial performance. The math of multistakeholder capitalism, on the other hand, is <em>combinatorial</em>, taking into account the health of each type of stakeholder, since all are regarded as essential to the economic and social sustainability of the system. This is not easy to achieve, even for companies that claim to care about moving in this direction, and it requires informed and sustained commitment to implement. It goes beyond the risk mitigation stance that ESG initiatives promote, where the objective is to identify the vulnerabilities of a company’s existing business model, and instead strategically reevaluates the business model itself. </p>
<h3>The Rise of the Combinatorial System</h3>
<p>As we noted in our earlier article “<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/great-strategy-considers-more-than-customers-and-investors/">Great Strategy Considers More Than Customers and Investors</a>,” multistakeholder capitalism replaces a linear, mechanical concept of business with a dynamic, biological one. The managerial implications of this shift have not yet been fully appreciated.</p>
<p>In a compensatory system, the best strategy is to “back your winners” — you should funnel your resources into the aspects of the business where you are strong. Outperformance in these areas more than compensates for underperformance in others.</p>
<p>In a combinatorial system, the wisest strategy is to “raise the tide for all boats” — to focus on how to increase value across all aspects of the business. In a combinatorial system, your total performance is constrained by your weakest performance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because the math of systems is different from that of linear functions, multistakeholder strategy is not simply about adding a few new factors (such as employees and communities) into an existing <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/a-refresher-on-regression-analysis">regression equation of business</a>. Stakeholders are not independent variables but rather interdependent members of a complex ecosystem whose health is more than just the sum of the parts. In a linear regression, a zero on any factor means that the factor does not contribute to the outcome. In a system, a zero implies the loss of integrity of the system.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just as consumers assess the integrity of a brand across multiple touch points (their experience in researching, testing, purchasing, and using the brand), the requirement for coherence and integrity extends across the entirety of a company’s operations. In a combinatorial system, companies are no longer assessed solely on the desirability of their products, but also on their performance as employers, partners, taxpayers, and environmental stewards. Calculating how a company is doing across its stakeholder landscape — and tracking and sharing the results in a transparent way — is challenging, and most companies are in the early stages of this process.</p>
<p>A necessary starting point for organizations is to identify aspects of the business that are damaging to its corporate reputation, even if they are not yet a source of lost sales.  </p>
<p>Some examples: Amazon is in the process of revisiting its commitment to “customer centricity” as its sole obsession, having realized that its customers are troubled by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/24/technology/amazon-employee-leave-errors.html">reports of poor working conditions</a> in Amazon fulfillment centers. In July 2021, the company announced the addition of <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/two-new-leadership-principles">two new leadership principles</a> for the organization — one focused on employees and the other on its social responsibility.</p>
<p>British multinational grocer Tesco, which was publicly derided in 2015 for its treatment of suppliers, has in recent years been lauded for its <a href="https://www.cips.org/supply-management/news/2020/april/tesco-completely-reset-relationships-with-suppliers/">collaboration with value chain partners</a>. This is evidenced by the company’s supplier satisfaction scores, which reached all-time highs just five years later, even as the COVID-19 pandemic stressed the strongest of supply chain relationships globally. </p>
<p>Or consider how Siemens, the world’s largest industrial manufacturer and historically a major carbon emitter, has aggressively <a href="https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/environmental-society-governance/environmental-action.html">reduced its carbon footprint</a> by using distributed energy systems at its production facilities, deploying low-emission and e-mobility vehicles globally, and significantly increasing its use of renewable natural gas and wind power energy. Other global giants, including Walmart, Cargill, BMW, John Deere, and Samsung, have also invested heavily to improve their environmental performance and community responsiveness. </p>
<h3>And Yet: The ‘Say Versus Do’ Disconnect</h3>
<p>There is further work to be done. In the research we have conducted with over 300 companies across five continents, <a href="https://www.research.net/r/qqmad">we’ve asked</a> whether their approach to strategy development explicitly considers the needs of five types of stakeholders: employees, customers, investors, partners, and communities. Our research highlights that few companies overlook investors and customers in their strategies, but just 1 in 6 companies actively considers all five major stakeholder groups. (See “The ‘Say Versus Do’ Gap in Multistakeholder Strategy.”) </p>

<h4>The ‘Say Versus Do’ Gap in Multistakeholder Strategy</h4>
<p class="caption">While a majority of companies now claim to embrace multistakeholder capitalism, research shows that only a minority actually considers more than investors and customers when developing strategy, and a smaller minority considers all five types of stakeholders.</p>

</div>
<p>This is a relic of shareholder capitalism that prioritized customers and investors while overlooking the role that employees, partners, and communities play in an organization’s success. While many companies are no doubt sincere in their desire to support all stakeholders, this disconnect suggests that business leaders still maintain a mechanistic construct of business whereby anyone not giving money to the organization, either as an investor or as a paying customer, is regarded solely as a cost. This leaves companies vulnerable to misdiagnosing their next best moves. </p>
<p>The first step for leaders who truly want to break out of the say/do disconnect is to invest in understanding not just the individual interests of their stakeholders but also the ways in which these interests can be integrated. This is the foundation for creating novel strategies that increase a company’s <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-essence-of-strategy-is-now-how-to-change/">fit to purpose</a> (relevance to stakeholders) and deepen its relative advantage (distinctiveness from alternatives).</p>
<p>Companies whose leaders foster mutual interest and respect across stakeholder relationships tend to perform better. A three-decade analysis published in 2012 by London Business School finance professor Alex Edmans found that businesses ranked among the best to work for had <a href="http://faculty.london.edu/aedmans/RoweAMP.pdf">stocks that outperformed their peers’</a> by an average of 3% annually — nearly 150% cumulatively — even after controlling for industry category and other factors. More recently, New York University’s Center for Sustainable Business performed a meta-analysis of 1,000 research papers and found a <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/assets/documents/NYU-RAM_ESG-Paper_2021%20Rev_0.pdf">positive correlation</a> between stakeholder performance beyond customers and investors on the one hand, and key financial performance and stock returns on the other, in the majority of the studies.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In multistakeholder capitalism, you are only as strong as your weakest behavior. From a strictly mechanical perspective, there may be no operational connection between your treatment of each type of stakeholder, but there is a human systems linkage that infers how a company’s willingness to exploit or ignore one constituency might translate into poor behavior with another. A 24-hour news cycle, hyperprolific and accessible data, and ubiquitous social media reinforce the risk of reputational contagion caused by poor behavior on any aspect of the business. </p>
<p>The new multistakeholder approach to strategy involves thinking of business as a biological system — one in which the success of the whole requires the health of each of the parts. This way, strategy is viewed in a broader context and focuses on creating a set of reinforcing actions across multiple stakeholders as the basis for value creation. </p>

<p>Racism, misogyny, classism, xenophobia — when these chronic problems afflict organizations, they stem from a constellation of forces, not a single attitude, act, or outdated norm. As a result of that complexity, solutions can be elusive, and we often see intransigence even in places explicitly committed to change.</p>
<p>Take, for example, our home institution of Columbia University, which invested more than $200 million over two decades to enhance diversity and inclusion among its faculty. Given that level of commitment and the school’s progressive values, the administration was quite stunned when a self-study revealed a stubbornly slow pace of change and an environment where “women and minority professors … navigate numerous inequities … in a workplace that isn’t conducive to their success.”<a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Persistent grievances included harassment of women faculty members, fear of retaliation for reporting incidents of harassment and discrimination, cronyism, and a cryptic and biased tenure and promotion system. In addition, women and members of underrepresented groups said that they were tasked with an unfair share of committee work and other “invisible labor” and that their contributions were undervalued. Though well intended, the school’s efforts clearly hadn’t addressed the root issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This problem certainly isn’t unique to academic settings. Organizations large and small with mostly homogenous leadership teams, across sectors and industries, struggle to make headway with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Research shows that dozens of factors interact to create change-resistant institutional cultures, which further complicate matters.<a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> At the individual level, for instance, factors such as implicit biases, stereotyping, ethnocentrism, and homophily (our attraction to people who are similar to us) can work together to shape our perceptions and behaviors. Between groups, selective perception of bias-confirming information about outgroups can elicit hostile responses (from both “us” and “them”), resulting in self-fulfilling prophecies.<a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> And those experiences, in turn, can lead to more competitive and destructive intergroup interactions — one of the many vicious cycles at play.</p>
<p>Within organizations where leadership is essentially monocultural, conflicts over individual and group differences are often suppressed, and leaders may be blind to the dominant power structures and stereotyping that exacerbate those differences.<a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> Even so, whenever people must compete for scarce resources and rewards (attention from senior leaders, project support, plum assignments, promotions, office space, and so on), the conflicts persist, bubbling under the surface if unacknowledged — and Columbia was certainly not immune to this.<a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> Of course, many marginalized groups have experienced long periods of institutionalized discrimination and injustice at the hands of dominant groups, fueling distrust and anger. Those in power, meanwhile, insulated by their privilege, might fail to recognize and respond to those concerns and feelings.<a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p>
<p>That’s just a sampling of destructive relational dynamics in workplaces. And studies suggest that they have staying power: When the various individual, intergroup, and organizational factors fuel and reinforce one another, the cultural patterns that result are robust, particularly resistant to change, and largely unresponsive to the typical interventions.<a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p>
<p>Indeed, research shows that workshops, training, and other one-and-done events fail to go deep enough to address the attitudes, incentives, and norms that perpetuate these systemic patterns.<a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> Sometimes they even make problems worse, escalating tensions by increasing awareness of injustice without offering a path toward resolution, or simply raising defenses and rallying resistance to change. But many organizations don’t know what the alternative to training is, so they keep at it, spinning their wheels, knowing they have to do something.</p>
<p>There is a better way.</p>
<h3>A Blended Approach</h3>
<p>In our research and work with organizations, we study the complex dynamics that make conflicts flare and persist, and we identify paths to positive change. We spent much of the past decade exploring how to create better conditions for sustained DEI reform — and how to dismantle systemic bias — by leveraging and managing the inherent conflicts more effectively. We’ve found that conflict resolution, which typically attempts to reduce tension over differences (and is the approach favored in organizations with homogenous leadership teams), is at times insufficient, because it applies a superficial bandage to deep wounds that need to be reckoned with more thoroughly. While advocacy for social justice goes deeper in seeking to increase awareness of wrongs against members of marginalized groups within organizations, it can also create problems: Tensions can escalate with no relief, and activists can lose sight of the shared goals and concerns of all involved. An approach that blends conflict-resolution tactics with a social justice mindset — one that optimally manages tensions between groups — is needed to support constructive, genuine change.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Organizations can choose from menus of tactics for tapping and reducing conflict. For instance, acts of civil disobedience (such as the walkouts at Netflix over content that employees viewed as transphobic) can facilitate conversations about difficult topics like microaggressions and systemic bias, or analyses of counterproductive power dynamics can be used to underscore tension and highlight the need for reform. Mediation, information sharing, collaborative task force work, or discussions about shared experiences or values can be used to tamp down tension, making it easier to establish common goals and embrace change. Choosing tactics effectively often involves weighing contextual factors — for instance, what are the main sources of conflict, and how responsive has leadership been in addressing voiced concerns? — to decide what the situation calls for. Different tactics can be employed by different actors in an organization; for example, ombudsmen, HR leaders, managers, employees, and union organizers may play separate roles. Or the same actors can apply various tactics.</p>
<p>For those reasons, managing conflict in pursuit of organizational change is an art. But there’s also some science to it. By applying theoretical models that cast organizations as complex, dynamic systems to better comprehend culturally institutionalized forms of discrimination, we’ve come to understand this: While it may be possible for DEI policies or programs alone to affect the current state of intergroup relations, lasting change requires altering the underlying enduring patterns, known as attractors in systems thinking.<a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> Like strong habits, routines, and cultural norms, these attractors emerge from complex combinations of factors, repeatedly draw us in, and resist change. They are the social-psychological ruts we get trapped in.<a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a></p>
<p>We’ve developed a framework for breaking out of these traps. It utilizes tension, conflict resolution, and bottom-up activism to break through cultural inertia and facilitate constructive and sustained forms of organizational DEI.<a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> We’ve applied it over the past few years at the Earth Institute, a 900-person multidisciplinary research and education center at Columbia promoting global sustainability, to help reform the culture.</p>
<p>We think our experience there could serve as a blueprint for other organizations interested in becoming more inclusive, equitable employers. Here, we explain what steps they can take, describe how and why we took them in our work with the institute, and share some of the changes we saw as a result.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Capitalize on shocks to the system.</strong> Breaking ingrained cultural patterns — such as the dominance of White males among Earth Institute leaders and faculty members despite attempts to recruit a more diverse workforce — often requires leveraging conflict, tension, crises, and pressure for effect.<a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> Sometimes dramatic events like scandals, walkouts, lawsuits, or mergers send difficult but useful destabilizing shocks through an organization, and leaders can take advantage of moments like these to drive organizational change.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the institute, a combination of events created such an opportunity. First was the arrival of what Connie Gersick, a visiting management scholar at Yale University, calls a newcomer; such leaders are “more than three times more likely to initiate frame-breaking change than existing executive teams.”<a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> Alex Halliday came on as director of the Earth Institute in 2018, after a stint as dean of science and engineering at Oxford University, where he had worked resolutely on increasing gender diversity in the geosciences. Upon his arrival, he immediately began speaking out about the need to diversify the institute’s leadership.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, when racist emails were received by students at one of the institute’s 19 units, Halliday prioritized that push for DEI and asked us to assist. He ordered a systematic review of the demographics on hiring and promotion at the Earth Institute for the previous decade and began working with our team to develop a comprehensive strategy for reform.</p>
<p>In addition to the internal destabilizing events — the new leader, the racist emails — societal forces also played an important role. Protests over the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police ignited across the country in 2020, which further increased the sense of urgency of this work and deepened conversations about race. Halliday explicitly encouraged and participated in those conversations, and he became evermore committed to correcting the gender and racial deficits he saw as pervasive. His ethos and energy reverberated throughout the organization.</p>
<p>The message here is to look for opportunities for change during times of crisis or instability in the organization or in the world. For instance, rather than avoiding discussion of injustices that grab the headlines and resorting to business as usual after such acts are reported in the news, leaders can use them as cues to start new conversations and mobilize meaningful reform within their own institutions. Of course, such leaders must be willing and able to work with deep sources of tension. Addressing long legacies of discrimination is always emotionally messy, politically fraught, and likely to trigger backlash from members of the dominant group. The remaining steps in our framework can help leaders navigate and manage these reactions effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Map the DEI landscape.</strong> Once leaders have seized on an opening for change, it is critical to survey the status of intergroup relations in the organization. That involves gathering information on the experiences of members of different groups — their highs and lows, opportunities and grievances, successes and setbacks. In all of the workplaces we’ve studied, such data collection (through conversations, surveys, and archival research) has shed light on the specific elements driving both constructive and destructive patterns in distinct pockets of the organization. The Earth Institute was no different.</p>
<p>To gain a comprehensive view, organizations must learn about what is going well <em>and</em> what isn’t. Research has shown that the drivers of positive versus negative intergroup relations are often not mirror opposites of one another but, rather, qualitatively different factors.<a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a> For example, one study showed that positive attitudes about Black people led to positive acts more often than a lack of negative attitudes did. And negative attitudes led to negative acts more often than a lack of positive attitudes did. So it’s important to measure a full range of attitudes and experiences to understand and predict behaviors toward historically marginalized and underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>At the Earth Institute, we cocreated an assessment with the DEI steering committee and used it to survey faculty, staff members, and students. We measured for empirically derived indicators of healthy work climates (such as psychological safety and respect) and dysfunctional environments (including lack of fairness or accountability) and gathered information about how members of different demographic groups experienced the organization. For instance, we asked how safe they felt being themselves and whether promotions seemed within reach. We also dug deeply into hiring practices and approaches used to resolve internal conflicts among management and the staff.</p>
<p>The result was a nuanced account of each unit within the institute. As expected, we saw troubling patterns in some places, like a sense of isolation among employees who identify as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, or people of color) in certain units, disengagement of some senior White males from DEI activities, resentment at being asked to participate, and widespread frustration with leaders’ lack of urgency to remedy long-standing structural inequities. But we also identified efforts that were making a positive difference, such as the affinity groups that had been convened in one unit, and a more comprehensive approach to reform taken at another. Institute leaders and members are generally very responsive to data, so sharing our findings helped further open people’s minds to change.</p>
<p>We compiled the results into one high-level report and several unit-level reports that were fed back to each unit, shining a light on the intergroup tensions. The unit directors then recruited small, diverse teams of DEI champions (including White and BIPOC employees, men and women, and senior and junior folks) to review the findings and begin planning how to tackle challenges and bolster initiatives that were already proving useful.<a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a> The chosen champions had strong levels of support and influence within the organization, since they would be tasked with recruiting coworkers to participate in these efforts. In selecting champions and deciding whom else to include in these groups, it was critical to remember that DEI adds extra work that can be emotionally taxing, and this work is often put on the plates of those who belong to underrepresented groups. Such work must be valued, recognized, and compensated as in-role labor, and other responsibilities must be balanced accordingly — a recommendation that was emphasized in the reports.</p>
<p>After sharing the findings, we offered coaching and workshops when requested to address tensions head-on. (This type of support works best when it’s not prescribed or imposed.<a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a>) For example, we conducted a workshop on how to lead difficult conversations about race at work, and we provided coaching sessions for managers on how to address deep-seated misogynist and White supremacist attitudes held by a few of their senior employees. Such training sessions can have a powerful impact when they are offered in response to the immediate needs and concerns of managers and employees.</p>
<p><strong>Deconstruct destructive dynamics.</strong> Sustained institutional reform requires shutting down problematic psychological and behavioral patterns (those attractors, or ruts, we mentioned earlier) and bolstering positive deviance (those programs and policies already working).<a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17</a> Because bad experiences tend to have a stronger impact than good ones, we took every indication of problems seriously — like reports of bias and ethnocentrism, intergroup competition, and exclusionary practices within the units — and delved into those areas before examining positive dynamics.<a id="reflink18" class="reflink" href="#ref18">18</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, more than half of the BIPOC members of the community reported feeling isolated and stressed and said that key people at the institute often didn’t turn up for diversity events like bias training and town hall meetings. Those same respondents said that the onus of promoting DEI had mostly fallen on members of underrepresented groups, and such efforts lacked coordination. “There were not really any frameworks or any structures for DEI on a large scale. There were a lot of one-off events, but not a lot of continuous traction,” said Kailani Acosta, a Ph.D. student. Acosta had organized opportunities for dialogue to uplift diverse voices at the Earth Institute and had helped create a seminar on race, climate change, and environmental justice before our work began.</p>
<p>After digesting the feedback from surveys, the champion groups got to work in their respective units. This allowed individuals like Acosta, who had struggled to generate interest in the programs she’d organized, to channel their energies toward achieving unit-relevant goals and measurable outcomes. Rather than applying a top-down, one-size-fits-all approach to reform, each unit took charge of creating and implementing its own agenda, with support from the top. This helped get people on board. Some of the dozens of activities deployed to mitigate exclusionary dynamics included integrating DEI criteria (like providing BIPOC employees with equitable opportunities for development) into managers’ performance appraisals, establishing a bridge program to mentor and support members of historically underrepresented groups, and rethinking the methods of some major research projects to reduce their unintended negative consequences on the communities under study.</p>
<p>These change efforts were not always met with complete enthusiasm, of course. Some busy scientists saw them as distractions from their primary work. Their resistance sparked difficult conversations that needed facilitation, both during staff meetings and in mediated one-on-one discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Bolster constructive DEI efforts.</strong> Our analysis also identified strengths to build on in each unit. We learned, for example, that the staff members of most units (other than leadership) were perceived to be very diverse and that people generally felt respected by their supervisors. They mostly felt psychologically safe to interact with candor, saw equal opportunities for promotion and advancement for most positions, liked their colleagues personally, and reported a high level of job satisfaction. These were areas that <em>didn’t</em> require conflict resolution — positive dynamics that could be channeled to further the organization’s DEI work. Given the Earth Institute’s standing as a model in the sustainability field, respondents also saw the organization as uniquely positioned to take on student pipeline issues that have historically prevented hiring from underrepresented groups, particularly in climate science roles.</p>
<p>As DEI conversations across the institute continued, we supplied the champion teams with a template and other tools to help them develop their action plans.<a id="reflink19" class="reflink" href="#ref19">19</a> We encouraged them to begin with what was already advancing DEI in their units. These teams eventually came together across the institute — at a meeting we facilitated — to present their draft plans and receive feedback from one another and senior leadership. (This can happen only in an environment where it’s safe to speak truth to power.) The Earth Institute also asked its DEI steering committee to draft an overarching action plan that would stitch those smaller plans together. </p>
<p>With our help, committee members identified actions to bolster positive efforts across the organization and then followed through. For instance, they clarified processes for navigating the existing (albeit complicated) systems for raising and addressing grievances, joining search committees, and calling for town hall gatherings.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Persist and adapt.</strong> Ultimately, the idea was to create staying power through accountability. The DEI steering committee reported to Halliday, the institute’s director, and that direct line was a pivotal component of effective change.<a id="reflink20" class="reflink" href="#ref20">20</a> The overarching plan consisted of 24 proposed actions nested under six priorities: establishing responsibility for DEI throughout the organization, linking funding to DEI commitments, prioritizing DEI in hiring and promotion, enhancing DEI programming, integrating DEI into all aspects of research, and providing mentoring and networking opportunities to BIPOC employees to mitigate social isolation. Each of the units’ own plans were similarly structured: They briefly spelled out who was responsible for achieving each goal, when it would happen, and how. Actions included establishing a DEI office and director to oversee, support, and organize continuing efforts; convening a faculty-student committee to work in partnership with that office; and, critically, tracking progress on the newly established DEI goals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout the process, we continued to facilitate communication within the teams and units and, in some cases, brokered some of the more difficult conversations over race and gender that flared up. That was important, because well-laid plans can fall apart if tensions are simply buried or escalated (hence the blending of conflict-resolution tactics and a social justice mindset in our framework). Unit and institute leaders had to learn to maintain a climate of cooperation, candor, inclusivity, and justice. Some were understandably concerned about their skills in shepherding the necessary conversations. And in a hierarchical organization like Columbia, poor communication can heighten anxiety for those who aren’t in a position of power; it can make people feel threatened or invisible. We offered workshops on difficult conversations so that leaders would have a safe space to share questions, replay scenarios, and build skills.</p>
<p>But diversity and inclusion efforts are never “accomplished.” Without continuous attention (and tension) and adaptation, there’s a high risk of reverting to old patterns and undoing progress. Therefore, monitoring and providing feedback on the effects of the action plans will be an essential part of the new director of DEI’s work. That is why the Earth Institute explicitly agreed to keep sharing the findings from its ongoing data collection in a timely and transparent manner: Making the inevitable setbacks and lags in implementation apparent will serve as an ongoing source of accountability and pressure for reform.</p>
<p>Lasting change also depends on distributing responsibility between those working in the trenches — who have a nuanced understanding of the pain, problems, and more promising remedies — and those with the organizational power to fund and execute programs. That shared stewardship amounts to shared power. It gives everyone a voice and a stake in sustained systemic change.</p>

<p>Anytime the economy hits a downturn, it’s a familiar story: Companies cut expenses through layoffs, and top executives get bonuses for keeping stock prices up. Today, this arguably hurts employees more than it used to. Even before the pandemic, 17% of adults <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-dealing-with-unexpected-expenses.htm">could not pay their bills</a>, and 24% skipped medical care because they didn’t have the money. And given the bruising, consistent rise in income inequality, the average employee <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/30/stubborn-inflation-forces-more-americans-to-live-paycheck-to-paycheck-.html">lives paycheck to paycheck</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 2021 the average <a href="https://aflcio.org/paywatch">ratio of CEO pay to worker pay</a> among S&P 500 companies was 324-to-1, and during the pandemic, 20 CEOs furloughed workers while maintaining a CEO-to-worker pay ratio <a href="https://aflcio.org/press/releases/sp-500-ceos-received-average-148-million-total-compensation-2019">greater than 1,000-to-1</a>. Their collective total compensation could have covered the wages of over 30,000 of their employees. Yet this has become standard practice: CEOs have used the actions of fellow executives as cover to pay themselves obscene amounts, reduce employee benefits, and send jobs offshore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nonetheless, some companies are already trying to do better by their workers. Early in the pandemic, from March to May 2020, 259 U.S. companies <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-s-p-500-buyback-suspensions-dropped-to-zero-in-june?context=article-related">suspended share buyback programs</a>. Costco raised its minimum wage from $15 to $16 an hour and further <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/27/business/costco-minimum-wage/index.html">upped it to $17 in 2021</a>. Target, CVS Health, Walgreens, and others also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/companies-paying-15-an-hour/">increased minimum wages</a>. Yet more tools are needed to guide and motivate the vast majority of CEOs to decisively protect employees during future crises. </p>
<p>The existing incentive structure for executives rewards them when things go right without motivating them to minimize the chance that things will go wrong. A new federal <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/08/2022-18771/pay-versus-performance">pay-versus-performance rule</a> that went into effect Oct. 11 begins to address this by mandating that companies provide details on executive renumeration and financial performance from the past five years. Companies also have to disclose the performance measures that are linked to leaders’ compensation. Yet the new rule does not tie executive pay to employee wages in downturns. </p>
<h3>Rethinking Executive Incentives With Parity Pills</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/09/parity-pills-ceos-pay-cuts-layoffs-coronavirus-recession.html"><em>parity pill</em></a> — a term of my own — is a clause in a company’s governing documents that would automatically redistribute executives’ pay in the event of a business downturn, to avert layoffs or augment the salaries of the lowest-paid workers. Parity pills would allow CEOs to keep the spoils they are accustomed to in good times but ensure that they share gains during bad times, too. </p>
<p>Changing their incentive structures to incorporate parity pills is a single step that companies could take to operate more ethically in the long run. Of necessity, doing so would also save companies from the throes of short-term thinking and emergency decision-making, which may propel larger long-term profits. Parity pills could more virtuously align the interests of workers and leaders in a way that strengthens the company while it makes good on its commitment to stakeholder capitalism. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Parity pills were inspired by poison pills, which aim to shield businesses from other corporations’ CEOs by blocking takeovers, whereas parity pills would protect workers from their own bosses. Similar to the proposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/opinion/dont-tax-the-rich-tax-inequality-itself.html">Brandeis tax</a>, which would increase the highest marginal income tax bracket if income inequality exceeded a certain level nationally, parity pills aim to reduce inequality at a time of crisis. They would do so by creating a set of sticks when executives’ actions create financial pain for the company to parallel executives’ existing carrots of stock options and bonuses. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Putting Parity Pills Into Practice</h3>
<p>Parity pills are a mechanism designed to be triggered by a set of conditions — external shocks like pandemics and recessions, or internal factors like revenue declines or pay inequality exceeding a predetermined amount. Each company must customize its own triggering conditions and the details of its parity plan. The board or CEO could determine how many executives (or board members, if paid) would be asked to sacrifice compensation and by how much. Alternatively, leadership could set a minimum floor for redistribution, allowing executives the choice to forgo even more if they wish. </p>
<p>When such a pill was triggered, workers would benefit; parity pills could prevent layoffs and the elimination of employee benefits, such as matching retirement contributions. Parity pill proceeds could be used to strengthen <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/05/employee-hardship-funds-help-companies-help-their-people">employee hardship funds</a>. Most ambitiously, parity pills could be the mirror image of executive bonuses in good times; that is, the lowest-paid workers could see their salaries increase when times get tough. </p>
<p>For parity pills to effectively lower total executive compensation, they must be tailored to each company’s particular compensation structure. Most importantly, companies should consider the ways in which executives are likely to benefit during a downturn. </p>
<p>A small minority of executives took a pay cut during the pandemic; for those who have, the reduction has overwhelmingly been <em>only</em> to their base salary — which amounts to a minor sacrifice. (For example, two-thirds of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/business/economy/ceo-pay-pandemic-layoffs.html">CEOs who took a pay cut</a> in 2020 had their overall pay lowered by 10% or less compared with their 2019 total compensation.) A small group of companies has instead deferred a portion of executive compensation or <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/08/21/the-pandemic-and-executive-pay/">paid executive salaries</a> in restricted stock units — options that could result in sizable future payouts.  </p>
<p>To be clear, many executives’ annual bonuses would disappear in a downturn if a parity pill were in place, though parity pills could still apply to their base pay, reduce future payouts, or even require them to return past compensation. Plus, many CEOs still receive their cash bonuses and stock options during recessions. </p>
<p>Parity pills should explicitly forbid bonus payouts in the case of company bankruptcy, especially when employee pensions are at risk. From March to October 2020, at least 18 major companies distributed executive bonuses that totaled more than $135 million <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/10/26/chapter-11-bankruptcy-executive-bonuses/?arc404=true">before entering bankruptcy</a> with a collective $79 billion in debt. The traditional argument for such payouts is to retain skilled leadership during bankruptcy proceedings, but these bonuses often go to the executives who sank the ship. Beyond the inequity of rewarding executive failure while simultaneously cutting the benefits and jobs of employees, there is the question of why a board would entrust executives to get out of their own mess. Implementing a parity pill would still leave open the possibility of appropriately compensating new leadership brought in to successfully steer the company out of bankruptcy. </p>
<h3>Unexpected Benefits of Parity Pills</h3>
<p>While the advantages to workers are clear, why would CEOs, board members, and shareholders — who would be the ones to design and implement these clauses — choose to do so? Because, perhaps counterintuitively, it’s in their self-interest. </p>
<p><strong>Clear costs for risky decisions.</strong> Parity pills incentivize leaders to prevent foreseeable crises. By redistributing executive compensation to workers, parity pills impose a price on risky activity in which executives benefit if the plans succeed but workers pay if they fail. The known risk of income loss can drive executives to focus on long-term value over short-term profit. </p>
<p>Such an equitable financial policy can also improve recruitment of future executives that are more likely to prioritize the long-term vision of the organization and not be driven by short-term, personal gains. This is because <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1059601120905728">dark triad executives</a> — whose narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism can harm organizations — would likely be turned off from ever seeking employment at companies with parity pills in place. </p>
<p><strong>Reputational advantages.</strong> Implementing and publicizing a company's positive social policies can drive the loyalty of socially conscious consumers. For example, Unilever’s “<a href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/unilever-says-brands-purpose-growing-twice-speed-others-portfolio/1345772?src_site=marketingmagazine">sustainable living brands</a>,” such as Dove and Ben & Jerry’s, are growing at twice the pace as its other brands. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Parity pills and labor-friendly policies can also improve employee morale and sense of equity, further enhancing the company’s ability to attract candidates. Employee satisfaction leads to <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/02/27/the-best-companies-to-work-for-are-beating-the-market/">stronger financial performance</a>, as the example of Patagonia shows. The company boasts a 4% turnover rate, due in part to worker-friendly benefits like onsite child care and perks that align with its emphasis on sustainability. Patagonia has even offered to <a href="https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/how-can-patagonia-have-only-4-percent-worker-turnover-hint-they-pay-activist-employees-bail.html">pay workers’ legal fees</a> if they’re arrested for peaceful environmental protest. </p>
<p>To be clear, this competitive advantage based on reputation can increase company financial returns and executive compensation tied to such performance criteria. Similarly, CEOs who voluntarily implemented a parity pill could benefit from a reputational boost, whether or not the pill ever impacted them personally. </p>
<p>Parity pills offer board members a tangible response to the <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/01/24/shareholder-activism-in-2020-new-risks-and-opportunities-for-boards/">social justice issues</a> that are high on many shareholders’ agendas. This could also benefit them financially. During crises, companies with <a href="https://www.issuelab.org/resources/22448/22448.pdf">strong corporate responsibility reputations</a> do not see meaningful share price declines, while those with poor reputations for corporate responsibility were found to decline by 2.4% to 3%, an average $378 million market capitalization loss per company. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, CEOs and boards uninterested in parity pills could see them thrust upon them by shareholder resolutions, given the fact that asset managers and pension trustees make decisions for millions of investors. This has become increasingly relevant; for example, as <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/04/23/the-push-for-shareholder-democracy-should-be-accelerated"><cite>The Economist</cite> reported</a>, BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard “together own over a fifth of the average company in the S&P 500, but wield even greater clout, because only 30% of retail investors bother to vote their shares.”</p>
<p>Finally, parity pills would aid activists and unions because they provide a mechanism to retain their members’ jobs during downturns. Parity pills are a practical, clear demand of leadership that does not already have such pills in place. </p>
<p>CEOs no longer have the excuse that their obligations to shareholders require them to implement fiscal austerity in downturns, at a time when their lofty compensation is increasingly being called into question. Parity pills are a concrete tool that could enable companies to privately spread the pain of future crises while increasing the financial or reputational interests of all those involved. </p>

<p>Khatereh (KK) Khodavirdi is focused on using AI to create better customer experiences — a process she compares to creating an “AI Legoland,” in which various technology components fit together to build cohesive solutions for PayPal’s customers. This is an approach she is applying in her role as senior director of data science in the online payment systems company’s consumer products division, where she oversees data science teams for PayPal, its peer-to-peer payment app Venmo, and e-commerce coupon-finder Honey.</p>
<p>On this episode of the <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> podcast, KK joins Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh to describe how PayPal’s various consumer products work together to help users have a seamless experience across its products. She also talks about AI’s role in further personalizing the customer experience across the company’s brand portfolio, data governance challenges following corporate acquisitions, and her approach to creating effective teams.</p>

<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What do Lego have to do with how PayPal thinks about AI? Find out on today’s episode. </p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> I’m Khatereh Khodavirdi from PayPal, and you’re listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite>. </p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Welcome to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite>, a podcast on artificial intelligence in business. Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I’m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I’m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite>.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I’m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG, and I colead BCG’s AI practice in North America. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI for six years, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Today, Shervin and I are talking with Khatereh Khodavirdi. She’s the senior director of data science at PayPal. Khatereh, thanks for joining us. Welcome. </p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> Thanks for having me. Great to be here. </p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You build and oversee giant data science teams for the many different entities within PayPal. A lot of people know PayPal, but probably some people don’t realize the extent of all the PayPal activities, so maybe let’s start there. Tell us a bit about what PayPal does and what all these different subentities do as well. How are they connected?</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> Yes. Obviously, a majority of the people know PayPal through PayPal Checkout, which is a core product that we have, and the company started from that product. But we have a wealth of different products, especially on the consumer and merchant side. We have whole suites of products to provide people the capability on the merchant side to run their business, from invoicing [to] having the offline capability for financial services and then the online transactions, and on the consumer side, starting from peer-to-peer payment to financial services to different types of credit and “buy now, pay later” capability, and savings accounts. I can go on and on, but on the consumer side, we have a wealth of different products. </p>
<p>Over time, we also acquired many other companies to help us accelerate and also be incremental in terms of the value chain that we are creating for the consumer and merchant, such as on the consumer side, a couple of years ago, we acquired a company — its name is Honey — which actually helps you to find the best deal on the internet when you’re shopping online. </p>
<p>I started at PayPal on the consumer side, so I was helping the small-business group, helping accelerate and solve the problems for our customers through data and data science capability. And then, over time, I supported all the merchant side of our equation — all the enterprise merchants, channel partners, our relationship with Shopify, WooCommerce, Magenta — programmatically bringing a merchant for us.</p>
<p>And then, a couple of months ago, I actually switched completely to the consumer side of the house. So I’m new on the consumer side but super excited, because you can leverage a lot of AI and data science capability to solve a lot of interesting problems in this domain.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That’s great. So obviously, PayPal is a big, multifaceted company with different business and subdivisions, and you talked about those. But since you’re in the consumer group, let’s talk about that. Share with us a bit how AI’s being used in the consumer business to drive the themes you want with your consumers and what use cases is AI being used for.</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> We can actually bring all the different accounts together, so we have a point of view around the user interactions with us. For example, if Shervin has a relationship to Honey with us, but at the same time, he’s using peer-to-peer or the Checkout product or our credit capability, how can we make sure that we can actually look at Shervin’s relationship with PayPal through one lens?</p>
<p>So that is, I would say, one of the fundamental problems we are trying to solve as a company. But the piece I’m personally super excited about is around the fact of understanding the customer journey with us and how we can leverage personalization and AI to actually solve customer use cases — that “What are the jobs they are coming to PayPal to get done?” and “How can we show them the personalized and relevant messages to help them?”</p>
<p>So think about it: Internally, we always said, “Hey, there are a bunch of happy paths with PayPal, and there are a bunch of sad paths with PayPal. How can we migrate people from one happy path to a happier path with us, and how can we avoid the sad path with the customer?” And I truly believe that this is basically an AI capability that we need to develop for customers. If you build that, it will unlock a humongous amount of value for our consumers and for us as a company.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Let’s talk about some of those paths. You said, “What kind of jobs are people trying to get done?” so let’s talk about that. Tell us how personalization could be helpful there.</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> Think about it this way: Imagine Shervin is one of the people that is actually using PayPal Checkout to shop through different merchants throughout the internet as well. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, once we acquired Honey, we also had a whole wealth of the coupons that are [available] out there, and over time, if you get a better sense around what type of categories or what type of merchant Shervin is interested in, we can actually show Shervin the right deals at the right time. </p>
<p>For example, it’s back-to-school time, and we know that historically, at this time, you shop in this type of category. Currently, you know, Target or Walmart or some of the top merchants for back to school are running these deals, and then we remind you and show you relevant and personalized deals to actually drive activity with us.</p>
<p>Or you might use Venmo on a weekly or biweekly basis to send somebody who cleans your house some money. We can remind you that, “Hey, Shervin, it looks like you’re doing this,” and through just one-click touch, you go and do that. So basically, we become part of Shervin’s life and understand what type of activity Shervin is trying to do and make it much easier for him.</p>
<p>The other part of it that we are all super excited about is tracking. When you shop online to a different retailer, one part of it is, you want to track that order and see where your order is and when you are getting it. We also want to make it much easier — you can actually get the notification and see where your order is, and you can look at your whole commerce activity and financial activity in one place.</p>
<p>I would say for me, also, the other part is that, yes, I’m in a data function and we build models, and I look at the outcome of our model, but also the more important part for me is — I always call it … qualitative and quantitative. … I would say, “Hey, I want a sample of some of the customers in this group. I want to understand their journey, the activity they had with us,” or, you know, actually attend the user research studies that we are doing with customers, so firsthand, I actually hear the challenges and the problems we are trying to solve.</p>
<p>Because for me, the most important part is that I just cannot go and in isolation build the model and solve all the problems. It’s really doing the qualitative and quantitative aspects and learning from each other and improving it over time.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That’s very helpful. I have to imagine that being more of a tech company than, let’s say, a financial services company, that some of these challenges are actually a lot easier for you to deal with than it would be, let’s say, for a gigantic global bank that’s trying to personalize across products and business lines and all that. Share with us some of the challenges. What’s difficult about what you need to do?</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> I think one of the biggest challenges we have is that some of the other companies that we acquired over time, each of them is using different data stacks, so basically migrating all of them to one data lake and having one kind of technology to use across the board and being able to [build] that common data layer platform … end to end, and understanding all the touch points and all the data points we have with the customer. So having that common data technology platform is one of the common challenges we have internally. </p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That’s huge, I think, for everybody. I remember my first experience with this. Back in my past life, I used to work at the United Nations, and I was working with databases, and I looked down and we had just literally dozens of databases we were supporting, and I asked, “Well, which is the standard?” And they said, “Well, this is the standard.” And, I said, “Well, what are all the rest of them?” “Well, those were the standards <em>then</em>.” </p>
<p>And so you’re in that same situation when you’re acquiring companies, where you’re pulling together … lots of technology stacks [but] you don’t want to just kind of rip them out and start over. How do you manage that process? How do you get those in a cohesive data science process?</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> Yeah, so, I would say, Sam, you brought a very good question as well — that it’s not only the technology problem aspect of it. I call it the data governance aspect of it as well: … what the definitions are, and how different people define and look at different things differently, and how you can define that common language across the board internally within the company as well. </p>
<p>So that is why we are trying internally to develop the best practices that every new company that we have … here are the steps, one to end, that we are going through to incorporate them as part of the rest of the data assets we have for the company. But you can imagine it’s not an easy exercise. It’s a humongous task.</p>
<p>But that data governance aspect of is it also very important, because when you are bringing different components together, you need to take a step back and look at the definition from a different lens as well and see if those definitions still are relevant in the new construct or not.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Let’s talk about teams a little bit. You’re talking about a series of challenges with personalization, with other use cases, and then the capabilities that are required to get that done, from data coming together and identity resolution and many, many other things. Tell us about the team. Clearly, they have to have very strong technical capabilities, but what else do they need to have to work in that kind of an environment?</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> I would say this area is one of the areas that is so multidisciplinary, and you can imagine the different types of problems you want to solve need different types of skill sets and these types of talent.</p>
<p>So I always said that in data science, AI, or the overall data field, one of the things that is really important is diversity of talent. And by diversity of talent, I don’t only mean diversity of gender or background, which is very important, but diversity of thought leadership, diversity of problem-solving, diversity of technical skill set, because at the different stages of the problem, basically, you need to practice a different type of muscle in order to get the desired outcome.</p>
<p>So, for example, one of the areas that I really feel [is] underappreciated in the data world is business acumen — people who can actually tackle the problem through a very structured framework and be able to synthesize the recommendation and the “so what” to the business. </p>
<p>Because the worst thing that can happen is that you look at your data team and you feel like they are building a bunch of black boxes for the rest of the organization, and you’re not investing in the last mile — that people are actually translating the “what” and the “why” and the “so what” to the business group, to the product group, and to the rest of the organization. So you would not get the adoption that you are hoping from the capabilities that you are building. </p>
<p>So the way I’m looking at it is that we are actually also building a product organization that supports the personalization and AI, because like any other product development cycle, you basically have a product strategy behind this — that we are not practically building the AI model to solve specific use cases. We actually take a step back, understanding our consumer personas — what are the jobs they are coming to us to get done? — and build a product road map and product vision around this and tackle this problem in a cross-functional fashion instead of just internally within the data group.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Is it harder to get that last mile with AI-type projects? Is that something the people have a harder time understanding? Is it something that is harder for people to relate to? </p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> It might be a little bit harder because of just the scale of the problems that you are trying to solve here, because people cannot relate to it when you’re talking about millions of customers. So for me, it’s how I can actually break down the problem and solve smaller use cases through AI to create that adoption and championship in the organization [so] that it will help me to solve the biggest problem. It’s a humongous task, because I’m not only talking about the product touch points that we have. I’m talking about <em>every</em> touch point that the customers have with us, either through customer service, through risk — through all the different functions within the company.</p>
<p>Rallying all of those cross-functional functions around solving this problem would be much harder, versus my approach, which is that I will first start with solving it within the product organization, understanding all the touch points with all the products, understanding how we can understand the product task, and personalizing that component. And then you can add an additional layer — like bring the risk component — with each of the product components, then you add the customer service.</p>
<p>I would think about it as more of a Legoland — that at the end of the day, we will have an AI Legoland for PayPal. But right now, the way I am attacking to solve this problem is to build each of the individual Lego pieces with the hope that I can orchestrate and build a Legoland and it won’t become a bunch of separate Lego that are not orchestrated to solve the common equation. </p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I love the Lego analogy, because my kids are totally into Lego and we have probably like 900,000 different pieces of Lego going on at any given time. And if you just look at it in isolation, you think, “OK, this is all we’re doing.” But, of course, you’ve got to start there, and then the pieces come together.</p>
<p>So then my question to you is, as with Lego, when I see my 12-year-old or 8-year-old building stuff, and I’m looking at it in isolation, I might not have a full sense of the vision [of what] the whole thing is going to be. </p>
<p>So, I might say, “Oh, this is nothing,” or “What are you building? It’s like a small piece. Didn’t you do something like this before?” And then they bring out the box with, like, 8,000 pieces that’s going to look like this. And then, I go, “Uh-huh.” How are you doing the big “uh-huh” here at PayPal so people don’t lose sight of the big vision and don’t get myopic about the little things that it takes to get there?</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> You can imagine there is no shortage of individual use cases — that there are many individual AI, or whatever you name it, capabilities within the organization. But when you take a step back, you do not have that guiding principle to see how they can help you to actually build that Legoland.</p>
<p>And actually I want to tackle this problem in a reverse order; first, I want to take a step back and say, “Hey, what will the blue sky look like in terms of the AI capability and personalization for us?” So building that product strategy and vision around it, and then trying to solve it backward, and then breaking it down into smaller pieces of the component Lego and being very prescriptive around what are the key problems each of these Lego will try to solve, and why we are building each piece of the Legoland — what will be the “so what” to the organization.</p>
<p>Then you can actually build something … because if you show that whole vision to everybody, it might be a little bit too much for some of the people to absorb it, so it might really slow down your progress in the organization. [In comparison,] when you show the bigger vision, you have something to rally the whole organization around. But at the same time, you can break it down into more tangible components so you can start making progress while you’re actually keeping that energy and enthusiasm around the organization to the north star that you have.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> The breaking down actually is quite critical. To build on the Lego analogy, usually you get these 5,000, 6,000 pieces of Lego, and they come in like 20, 50, 30 boxes or little bags, and so you first do this, and then you do that, but then you have the whole thing.</p>
<p>Well, I got one two days ago that had 3,000 pieces in 20 different bags, but all the bags are unlabeled, so you don’t know what goes with what. And so then, what we have is, like, 3,000 pieces, and we’re trying to build a piece, and the analogy I’m trying to draw here is, as you’re building these little capabilities that then come together and get stitched together to support your bigger vision, how do you make sure that these pieces are actually connecting rather than the organization is looking to find what piece goes where, or how does this connect, or do I have eight of these instead of five of those?</p>
<p>How do you avoid that? And that’s, by the way, something that goes on in a lot of other organizations, where there are silos of folks building things, and they don’t all come together. How do you approach that?</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> You brought up a very good question that, Shervin, basically, hey, I cannot go to run a step from that vision and product strategy for the AI and personalization to be a tactical component of the puzzle that you have. But once you build that mental model around the common themes of the problem you are trying to solve, then I would say the other reality also is that I cannot solve all these problems by myself, [nor can a handful] of people solve these problems in the organization. You need to create that culture, and you need to rally your organization around this.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That makes sense, because I like the Lego analogy, but the world isn’t as simple as Lego. You don’t have that perfectly labeled bag that you know will fit together in the end. You’ve got to bring those people along to pull that in.</p>
<p>One of the things that we did early in the pandemic was sort our giant things of Lego and, when you have those Lego that are not in the little bags, it’s practically impossible to find the right piece to pull it back together. Shervin, it reminds me of when we were talking to <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/lplAIPMe">Arti Zeighami at H&M</a>, and he was talking about working with individual pieces … </p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> On the wheel, right? </p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> His analogy there was tightening each lug nut a little bit as you go around, and there’s some logic here, too, that what’s different, too, about Lego is that you could solve one bag and move to the next bag, but in reality, you’ve got a lot of people working on lots of different bags who are moving at different paces. </p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> No, totally, Sam, and I would say that is why it is very important that, in my view, in order to make progress on such a complex topic, it’s kind of a top-down and bottom-up approach, and you just need to have that check-in on a regular basis. … The top down, I would call it your blue-sky strategy around where you want to be with AI strategy, and the bottom up is just mainly like the tactical differences of the Lego that somehow exist in the organization, or there are different components that different teams are building, and how you can actually bring the two components together.</p>
<p>And you’re absolutely right that the speed of the development and making progress for some parts is more difficult than the others as well. So you also coordinate the different components together, so at the same time, you are making progress, you can rally the organization around that, but also be realistic that some other parts are more complex and it will take more time.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And the one thing that I think companies have that Lego pieces don’t is they still have P&Ls and targets and numbers. And so I think that’s probably why it’s such a nuanced approach, as you were saying, KK, that it’s like you’ve got to figure out where the most practical path is for your organization, given all the players and all the stakeholders and all the pieces, and maybe for Arti, it was a bit “one lug nut at a time” to get the whole thing going, and maybe here it is like, “No, we’ve got to get personalization perfect before we move on to risk or pricing.” And I think that’s the nuances of different organizations a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> Yeah, and I would say, Shervin, you brought up a really good point as well, that at the end of the day, all the organizations are very value-focused, both for the customers and also for the company … and the shareholder as well. </p>
<p>And for me, one of the biggest risks that people can do is just looking at the output and the outcome of the P&L, [whereas] for such big projects like this, like personalization, the reality is, it will definitely take some time for you to actually get the true benefit of this from the output standpoint of your P&L. But what are the leading indicators and the KPIs you can have to actually keep the team and the organization accountable, to make progress so you make sure that you are moving in the right direction, while it will take you more time to see the whole benefit as an output in your P&L?</p>
<p>Because the reality is that the worst thing that can happen is that all of us know that this is absolutely the right thing to do for the company, but because you wouldn’t … there is no magic, there is all this good work consistently over a long period of time. There is no magic that [lets] you see the output overnight, so how can you keep the team accountable, the working team, to make progress, but to the leading indicator that you know that eventually it will get you to the outcome that you are looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> For sure, right? As you’re saying, the worst possible thing would be to set a big outcome goal for the vision, but for the wrong time.</p>
<p>KK, this has been quite insightful. I think, Sam, we should move to the rapid-fire question segment. So this is a segment we do, KK, where we ask you a bunch of questions in rapid-fire style, and please tell us what comes to your mind first.</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> Sounds good. </p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What has been your proudest AI moment? </p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> My proudest AI moment goes back to grad school, when I was at Carnegie Mellon, before this field was this much in demand, and as part of my graduate research studies, I was building capabilities and platforms for energy management — smart energy management for residential buildings. That was the most proud AI moment of my life.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Cool. What’s your favorite activity that involves no technology?</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> Playing tennis, because it really helps me to focus on the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What was the first career you wanted? What’d you want to be when you grew up?</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> Probably, for my first career I wanted to become a professor or a pilot. I don’t exactly remember which one came first, because in our family, education is a big piece, and my mom actually had an educational career, but probably either a professor or a pilot.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What worries you about AI?</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> I would say there have been a lot of conversations about responsible AI and bias, and I chatted about this earlier — that it’s qualitative and quantitative as well. I think it would be a huge mistake to assume that AI can solve basically all the problems without having the right checks and balances in place. </p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What is your greatest wish for AI in the future?</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> I would say there are a lot of challenges that the humanities are facing, from climate change or a bunch of other stuff, so I really hope that more and more people actually play a role in using AI to solve those problems. A lot of my colleagues actually started investing more of their time and energy, and I really hope that eventually in my career, I also can play a role as well.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Great. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So, KK, I think that, obviously, the Lego analogy is going to be interesting for people, but I also like what you were saying about things like governance that, I think, are fundamentally important for this, and the idea that you would come on and mention some of that importance of things like governance getting you to that scale that you need — I think that’s something that maybe is more widespread or universal. Thanks for taking the time to talk with us today. We really appreciate it. Thanks for joining us.</p>
<p><strong>Khatereh Khodavirdi:</strong> Thank you guys so much for having me. </p>

<p>The business world is increasingly and genuinely inspired by the idea of building more sustainable businesses. Organizations are motivated by pressure from their employees, their customers, their investors, other stakeholders, and their own values — as well as growing clarity about the opportunities (and requirements) of the big economic and tech transitions already underway (like, say, decarbonizing the whole world). </p>
<p>The true leaders are looking beyond the reactive exercise of checking off the boxes of an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiative and looking to build something better — a business that thrives by serving the world. These businesses will have a net positive impact on the planet and its people by, among other things, taking responsibility for their full impacts, intended or not; serving all stakeholders, <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-reconcile-your-shareholders-with-other-stakeholders/">not just shareholders</a>; helping to solve society’s biggest challenges; and enabling the shift to a thriving, regenerative economy. Yet often these same leaders miss something critical to building a better, more positive business: the question of what they stand for and act on when they step into the public sphere. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Most companies rely on a dated model of engagement on policy with governments and civil society, compartmentalizing their political influence activities into an organizational silo, just as they used to do with their supply chains. (By “political influence,” we mean actions intended to influence the electoral, governing, or civic affairs processes of a nation, state, or municipality, directly or via third parties, including political spending, lobbying and advocacy, employee communication, and external communication and other influence on civic discourse.) Their trade associations — and often their own government relations departments — default to fighting all regulations, including those that would realign private interests with the public good. </p>
<p>That can put them on the wrong side of policy changes needed to bring about the more sustainable world they often have <em>publicly</em> committed to building. This inconsistency leaves them in the crosshairs of many stakeholders and vulnerable to attack, either for failure to back up their social and environmental commitments with political action or, at the other end of the spectrum, for daring to make those societal commitments at all. Companies are managing conflicting views about <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leadership-in-an-era-of-context-collapse/">when and how they should use their voices</a> and their political influence. </p>
<p>A recent example is BP’s roller-coaster ride of engagement on climate policy in the state of Washington. A couple of years ago, the company spent nearly $13 million to defeat a state ballot measure to impose a carbon price. It’s easy to interpret the action as prioritizing BP’s narrow, short-term interests. But more recently, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/new-bp-ad-campaign-calls-on-washington-legislature-to-put-a-price-on-carbon-pollution-from-fossil-fuels/">BP supported a Washington state bill</a> that would place an overall cap on state carbon emissions. We can debate the merits of a cap or a tax, but at least BP supported new rules of the game to align market incentives with the broader public good of doing something about climate change, thus better aligning the company with its own sustainability commitments that aim to help the world get to net zero.</p>
<p>Acting with responsibility in engaging on policy can require courage if it goes against industry dogma or if it wades into important social issues, where companies face the rising threat of political retaliation. The experience of Disney in its efforts in Florida to support LGBTQ employees and customers — and the subsequent <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/florida-legislature-votes-to-strip-disney-of-special-tax-status-in-a-win-for-governor-ron-desantis/">attacks from Florida’s governor</a> — offers a cautionary tale of the challenges of doing the right thing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In today’s contentious political environment, any company’s political spending can put it in tough spots, where its values or stated priorities (and <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leading-in-an-age-of-employee-activism/">what its vocal employees may want</a>) are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-election-company-campaign-finance-climate-change/">at odds with the people it has donated to</a>. In the aggregate, these spending practices can also contribute to a political environment in which government retaliation against critics — a hallmark of authoritarianism — becomes routine. This is precisely why executives must recognize what is at stake and weigh their responsibilities thoughtfully.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Navigating to a New Normal of Political Engagement</h3>
<p>Understandably, corporate leaders worry about political gridlock and whether their countries will align on the stable policy and regulatory frameworks they need in order to thrive and follow through on their sustainability commitments. But it’s disingenuous for companies to pretend they are passive observers of regulations, laws, or the political climate. Many have purposely contributed to the gridlock they bemoan, through conflicting messages, donations, and third-party affiliations. Political spending helps companies elect leaders who represent their interests and gain access when they need it. Social media, advertising, philanthropy, and public relations can shape civic discourse and cultural beliefs, influencing voting and behavior. And with direct lobbying, companies are not just playing by the rules of the game, they are <em>shaping</em> those rules and how they are enforced.</p>
<p>Clearly, companies need broad principles and guidelines to navigate these tricky political waters and exercise more consistency and responsibility in their influence. At a minimum, organizations should recognize the need for more principled, proactive, and integrated governance and frameworks to guide their decisions about when and how to engage in political affairs. Much of this discussion falls into the seemingly least sexy part of ESG — the governance component, which can shape how well a company manages the rest. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Most of the limited attention to corporate political action thus far has been about <em>transparency</em>. In the U.S., the vast majority of citizens (including most executives and investors) support political spending disclosure, and two-thirds of the S&P 500 voluntarily <a href="https://www.politicalaccountability.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-CPA-Zicklin-Index.pdf">disclose their election-related spending</a>. More recently, we have seen a gradual expansion of attention from transparency to <em>accountability</em>. Employees, investors, customers, and third-party watchdogs now regularly scrutinize whether a company’s political influences align with its stated commitments to purpose, values, sustainability, stakeholders, and business goals. </p>
<p>Companies that strive for accountability are struggling with increasingly complex trade-offs as they confront the realities of the current U.S. political system and the <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/01/corporate-political-spending-is-bad-business">hypocrisy traps</a> it creates. They wonder, “How do I align our spending with our company values? Which values do I prioritize? How do I promote policies to enable our net zero commitments while navigating the risk of lawmakers damaging our businesses with the stroke of a pen?”</p>
<p>Happily, recognizing these challenges begins to suggest a way out. Companies need to take a broader view of their interests and shift from constantly chasing individual issues to focusing on the health of the larger systems on which business and humanity depend. This still means reacting to and addressing crises as they occur, but also taking a proactive stance and helping to strengthen the foundational systems that generate civic trust, social cohesion, and broad-based prosperity. It also means addressing the breakdowns that are generating <em>dis</em>trust. As we have engaged with decision makers on these challenges over the past year, we have found more and more leaders who are convinced of the need go beyond transparency and accountability to explore <em>corporate political responsibility</em>, or CPR. This is an idea developed by Tom and expanded by Elizabeth in her work at the University of Michigan Corporate Political Responsibility Taskforce. </p>
<h3>Working Toward Corporate Political Responsibility</h3>
<p>CPR is a broader take on old-school corporate social responsibility, or CSR. CPR focuses on how business influences four key systems: the rules of the game (markets, laws, and regulations), civic institutions and representation (for instance, protecting democracy), civil society and public discourse, and natural systems and societal shared resources. (See “Putting Corporate Political Responsibility Into Action.”) These four systems can help leaders think about their impacts and how they can defend and build capacity in these critical societal foundations.</p>

<p>We believe that by committing to CPR and focusing on these four levels, companies can improve their own <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-research-can-mislead-marketers-on-brand-activism/">brand reputations</a>, make sustainable and net positive strategies achievable and more profitable, and have solid ground to stand on, with support from a range of stakeholders in the face of political blowback. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As a start, company leaders can engage with peers and internal and external stakeholders to consider their responsibilities at each level, exploring the CPR reflection questions included in the table here or their own inquiries. Based on these reflections, companies can prioritize actions that focus on a kind of Hippocratic oath of CPR — at the very least, to do no harm. Such a procedure also helps ensure that companies respect civil society and self-government, by prompting leaders to identify a legitimate basis for any political engagement.</p>
<p>Beyond the benefits for companies that adopt CPR on their own, the full benefits of this approach will come from helping to establish or reinforce CPR as the norm. A more systems-oriented approach is what one of us (Andrew, along with his coauthor of the book <cite>Net Positive</cite>, Paul Polman) calls <em>net positive advocacy</em>. This entails a more systemic view of the policies and investments society needs to solve large, shared challenges. It means approaching government not as an adversary or a stakeholder to be contained and minimized but as a true partner because companies cannot be net positive businesses (or most effectively embrace CPR) solely on their own. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If a broad cross-section of businesses adopts a set of principles for CPR, and if they are widely accepted as meaningful and legitimate, this could represent a tipping point that would lead companies out of today’s morass. Companies can mobilize partnerships within their supply chains or industry to adopt new principles for CPR. Doing so can offer the hope of a new and level playing field — one where businesses have credibly sworn off using political contributions and backdoor lobbying to gain a narrow advantage at the expense of larger public well-being (and thus their <em>own</em> thriving over time). </p>
<p>Critics and watchdogs can recognize companies advancing CPR in good faith, and investors can call on companies to use their political influence constructively to enable broad, long-term goals. Cross-sector partners can support and challenge lawmakers to abide by similar practices, approaching them jointly for rules that make sense and holding the line on fundamental support for representative democracy. In such a world, business leaders will be seen as partners in good faith, building a world that works for everyone. </p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>For all of the attention that leader character gets when we witness its negative extremes — such as when an authoritarian CEO presides over a corrupt or an abusive culture — most organizations give surprisingly little thought to what is actually one of the most significant available levers to effect positive organizational development.</p>
<p>Organizations that fail to hire for and develop positive character among its leaders are missing an opportunity. In fact, one study found that organizations with leaders of high character — those whose employees rated them highly on integrity, responsibility, forgiveness, and compassion — had nearly five times the return on assets of those with low character.<a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p>
<p>Why is this aspect of leadership and organizational culture so overlooked? Over more than a decade of investigating leader character in organizations, we’ve found that leaders largely underestimate and misunderstand the concept of character. They marginalize it as just being about ethics rather than recognizing it as the foundation of all judgment and decision-making. They generally assess their own character as “good enough.” They believe it is a fixed trait rather than a quality that can be developed, and so they don’t see how individual strength of character can be embedded and scaled in their own organizations and cultures. Simply put, they don’t see that competence and character go hand in hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our research into leader character began as an investigation into the failures of leadership associated with the 2008 global economic crisis.<a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> We conducted focus groups with over 300 business leaders in Canada, the U.S., England, and Hong Kong. The groups reached consensus that the character of leaders contributed substantially to creating the crisis. Unfortunately, there was no consensus about how to define character, and there was extensive debate about whether it could even be developed. We set out to address the underlying science of leader character: what it is (and is not), why it matters, how it can be developed, and how it is manifested in people’s actions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we unpack what character is and how it operates, the critical underpinning is its impact on judgment and the choices we make minute by minute, day in and day out — what we call the micro-moments between stimulus and response. It is this character-based judgment that supports superior performance, and its lack explains both misconduct and poor decision-making. In numerous high-profile cases — whether the global financial crisis, the Volkswagen emissions scandal, or the Boeing 737 Max tragedies — technical competence was largely evident, but character was not. Essentially, the slippery slope of compromised judgment and decision-making can be identified in the seeds of compromised character.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while strength of character certainly supports ethical decision-making, its reach is much broader; as noted above, too many leaders equate it simply with being “good,” which is much too narrow. It is also a powerful influence on individual well-being and sustained excellence, and so it matters at all levels of the organization, not just in leadership.<a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> To illustrate, consider the perspective of Ron Francis, general manager of professional hockey team the Seattle Kraken. At the 2022 NHL combine, where teams have an opportunity to interview prospective draft picks, one athlete asked him what the team looks for in a player. His immediate response? Character. Competence is table stakes, but what sets players, teams, and organizations apart is the character that enables them to bring their best every day, even in challenging situations. Will the exhausted player maintain the drive needed to win the one-on-one puck battle? Will a player withstand an opponent trying to pull them off their game? And will a team persevere through a difficult stretch of losses? None of these choices are about competence or skill but about character, and they make the difference between winning and losing. At the highest level, character is the competitive edge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this article, we will provide a deeper understanding of character and its applications, beginning with an overview of our research-based Leader Character Framework, and we will offer guidance for how business leaders can begin to apply considerations of character to build stronger organizations.</p>
<h3>Understanding Leader Character</h3>
<p>Whereas the rigorous application of leader character in organizations is new, the science of character is not. More than two millennia ago, Aristotle declared character to be a virtuous set of habits. Even earlier than that, around 500 B.C., Confucius had introduced ideas about justice, humanity, and wisdom. More recently, psychologists Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman used a rigorous scientific approach to identify a universal set of virtues that contribute to well-being and human flourishing.<a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> Porting this depth of research on character and well-being into leadership in organizations involved mapping the scholarly research on character with its practical application in organizations.</p>
<p>To forge a bridge between the research underpinnings associated with character and the application of character in leadership practice, we used an engaged scholarship approach with over 2,000 executives that involved focus groups and quantitative analysis. This ultimately led to a definition of <em>leader character</em> based on 10 separate dimensions that interact with an 11th, central quality of judgment. (See “Leader Character Framework.”)</p>

</aside>
</div>
<p>Each dimension in this framework is a potential virtue. Consistent with Aristotle’s thinking, though, virtues become vices in either deficiency or excess. For example, leaders with too little courage are timid; those who take courage to an extreme become reckless. Every character behavior can operate as a vice in deficiency or excess.

</div>
<p>People often have difficulty understanding how vices as well as virtues can spring from character dimensions. However, when we ask people to describe a leader who has a lot of integrity, accountability, and drive (behaviors that are often reinforced, endorsed, and rewarded in organizations) and low humility, humanity, and temperance (behaviors that are typically unsupported), the responses are consistent. Rather than describing a leader who is authentic, candid, transparent, principled, and consistent (observable behaviors associated with integrity in its virtuous state), the leader is described as being uncompromising, belligerent, indiscriminate, dogmatic, and rigid (the vice state of integrity).</p>
<p>The problem has been that we treat those vice behaviors as expressions of personal style rather than connecting them to the poor decision-making and negative outcomes that often result. It’s important to understand that such a person isn’t just “rough around the edges” but that the very behaviors the organization has endorsed and rewarded have overweighted some dimensions of character and underweighted others, leading to dysfunctional decision-making and culture, and poor results.</p>
<p>But excess is not simply about having too much of a single dimension. The dimensions of character need to be considered in relationship with each other. Excess, then, is having too much of one dimension relative to other dimensions that you have too little of when they all need to be in balance. Courage needs to be balanced (constrained) by temperance to avoid tipping into recklessness. At the same time, courage needs to be fortified (supported) by justice and accountability to avoid slipping back to deficiency. An appropriately courageous leader supported by a strong sense of justice and accountability but constrained appropriately by temperance and humanity is not afraid to speak up and take action, even in a challenging situation. This isn’t about “dialing back” courage, justice, or accountability so much as it is about making sure temperance and humanity are sufficiently strong to balance them and achieve the best outcomes. This leader will also tend to speak and act in a measured manner that avoids further inflaming difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>Contrary to other areas of leadership development, which prescribe focusing on strengths and allowing others to complement weaknesses, character development work looks at potential strengths that are likely operating as a vice, and it seeks to restore them to their virtuous state by strengthening weak areas. (See “Developing Leader Character.”)</p>

<h4>Developing Leader Character</h4>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, individuals are not born with character, nor is it set in stone at an early age.<a id="reflinki" class="reflink" href="#refi">i</a> Because the 62 elements associated with the 11 dimensions of character are virtuous habits that can be developed, the basic truth is that character can be strengthened, but it can also atrophy without conscious attention to its development. We are always becoming something while we are busy doing what we do; we can become more courageous or less courageous, or possess more humility or less. To this point, many studies have shown that as leaders rise in the organization, they may develop hubris (a lack of humility).</p>
<p>The development of individual character occurs through five phases. (See “The Five Phases of Leader Character Development.”) Most organizations doing leader character work couple the understanding of what character is and why it matters with an introduction to the development of character. The Leader Character Insight Assessment offered through Sigma Assessment Systems provides an opportunity for the self- or 360-degree assessment of character and a set of resources on which to start the character development journey.<a id="reflinkii" class="reflink" href="#refii">ii</a></p>

<h4>The Five Phases of Leader Character Development</h4>
<p><strong>1. Discover.</strong> Even a brief session providing individuals with an overview of leader character can help them to discover latent character strengths upon reflection. For example, one executive in a session we led told us that he subsequently realized that his drive had atrophied over time, and he committed to strengthening it. Such realizations shift the learner into the next phase.</p>
<p><strong>2. Activate.</strong> Character can be activated through reminding, priming, and reinforcement. There are many ways to do this: For some, it might be setting a reminder alarm, or using that first cup of coffee or tea in the morning to trigger the intention to be mindful of a certain character dimension. Music can be particularly effective; research has revealed that, through tempo, rhythm, and memory, music can activate all 11 dimensions of character.<a id="reflinkiii" class="reflink" href="#refiii">iii</a> For example, people intuitively understand that music can activate drive when they work out. Music is prevalent in our lives and a freely available resource. In fact, we have created a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/search/The%20Virtuosity%20soundtrack">Spotify playlist</a> for all 11 dimensions. (Search for “the Virtuosity soundtrack” on Spotify).</p>
<div class="callout-toggle">
<p><strong>3. Strengthen.</strong> This is where character development becomes much more challenging for both individuals and organizations, because it requires daily investment. Our research has drawn on the science of exercise and habit development to anticipate what it takes to develop character. We have developed the Character Behavior Intentionality index, which measures the intention to develop a character-related behavior.<a id="reflinkiv" class="reflink" href="#refiv">iv</a> The scores are derived from an assessment of attitude, peer influence, cultural influence, lifestyle, and ability. Note that even if individuals have a strong attitude to develop a character behavior, it can be negated by an organization where that behavior is discouraged by peers or cultural norms. The Virtuosity learning app provides a customized program for the learner to strengthen character and work through the next two phases of development as well.</p>
<p><strong>4. Connect.</strong> This phase reinforces the interconnected nature of character and how some dimensions and behaviors can be overweighted and others underweighted. People often see the benefits of courage and integrity (and rarely see the vices) but fail to understand the strength in humility (including vulnerability) that allows someone to be authentic and candid, revealing integrity. Lack of candor is often tied to an unwillingness to show vulnerability; people fear speaking up and being judged.</p>
<p><strong>5. Sustain.</strong> The real test of character is whether it holds up under stress and in different contexts. For example, having strength in vulnerability to support humility means that when you need to be vulnerable, you can lean into that discomfort or fear. Sustaining character means that you can call on any dimension of character when you need it, not that you are exercising it all the time. Character is always evolving, for better or worse, whether personally or professionally. For example, time pressure tends to stress-test temperance, which has emerged as the weakest dimension of character for most executives. With greater insight and clarity about the leader you are becoming, you can make choices that help strengthen rather than erode character.

<p></p>
<p>We have validated our framework by working alongside — and also surveying — thousands of leaders worldwide across sectors and in industries such as international banking, government, law enforcement, military and border protection services, and professional sports. In addition to providing evidence of how character dimensions can be problematic in both excess and deficiency, this work has confirmed that character is a habit of being that is objectively observable. This indicates that it can be objectively assessed and developed like other human behaviors.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Aristotle said, one becomes virtuous only by acting virtuously. Our decisions and actions, especially in difficult or crucial moments, manifest character. How we habitually make decisions — what we think about in crucial moments, what considerations we reference — determine our actions and whether they exhibit character. The decisions and actions to which we are inclined then form patterns and build capabilities, which influence future actions and decisions. And just as physical exercise builds muscle strength, an individual’s intelligent and disciplined practice develops character strength.</p>
<p>Our research reveals that simply educating people by unpacking what character is and how it operates can often provide immediate course correction to individuals and organizations, and create the opportunity to activate dimensions of character that have been latent or underdeveloped.</p>
<p>While individuals must act on these insights themselves, leaders are responsible for bringing an organizationwide approach to elevating character and integrating it with competence. That includes taking a hard look at an organization’s cultural norms that might encourage some character dimensions at the expense of others. Philip Zimbardo, the psychologist known for the famous Stanford prison experiment, has suggested that sometimes problematic behaviors are not the result of “a few bad apples” but, rather, good apples having been placed into bad barrels. In the case of character, because it has been misunderstood and neglected, the organizational barrels have consistently overweighted some dimensions of character and underweighted others and have failed to strategically embed leader character alongside competence in organization practices.</p>
<h3>Making Leader Character a Strategic Asset</h3>
<p>When individuals increase their understanding of leader character and take ownership of elevating their character in addition to their professional competence, organizational excellence and well-being will result. But positive effects are limited when organizations don’t apply character insights to policies and practices while continuing to hire, reward, and promote individuals who have weak or imbalanced characters. And because people can’t “unsee” leader character once they’ve learned how it is expressed, it’s only a matter of time before the good apples choose to leave the bad barrels.</p>
<p>For many companies, work on leader character might begin with the goal of fostering a healthier organizational culture. The table “How Character Manifests in Culture” lists examples of typical behaviors when leader character is present — or absent — in an organization. Every organization we have worked with aspires to the behaviors in the If Present column because they are clearly linked to strategic advantages, but these same organizations have many of the behaviors in the If Absent column. They have struggled to make changes, largely because there is too much lip service paid to areas such as values, which are often aspirational statements about some dimensions of character.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the value of integrity, which is common to most organizations. Valuing integrity without understanding what it is, how to develop it, and how it is nested within the other dimensions of character is like telling someone to run a marathon without having trained for it. There is also the serious danger that in spite of best intentions, cultures built on a strictly values-based foundation simply elevate dimensions such as integrity or drive into a state of vice or dysfunction. A key point is that we do not advocate that organizations reconsider values or even competencies but rather that they elevate leader character alongside competence so that aspirational values are realized in the way they were imagined.</p>
<p>When working with organizations, we ask leaders to assess where they position their areas of the organization along the continuum, from present to absent, for each of the dimensions in the table. Then we ask them to imagine whether they would reassess where their organization is positioned along the various dimensions if they personally had strength of character across all dimensions. It’s a sobering moment when they realize that the culture of the organization is a reflection of their character.</p>
<p>While culture might be a good starting point for many, our experience is that it doesn’t matter where you begin when applying leader character in the organization. It often starts with someone who is a champion in a particular area. For example, Sonia Côté, chief HR officer and acting assistant commissioner of the Human Resources Branch at the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), was asked, “How do we know we are hiring the right people?” In response, Côté led the introduction of character-based assessments and interviews to complement the CRA’s competence-based approach to identifying internal candidates for leadership positions. The hiring process transformed radically.<a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> The objective, according to Côté, is to “assess who these people are as leaders … to look for their sense of purpose, to get to truly know them and assess the quality of their judgment.”</p>
<p>The character initiative at CRA has evolved to engage the entire organization and led to the creation of a 20-person leader character team, headed by Steve Virgin, a former Canadian Forces submarine captain. At first, Virgin recalled, people were skeptical. Soon, though, interviewers were calling the approach powerful and meaningful. Even more impressive was the impact of post-interview debriefs. Candidates were encouraged to seek feedback, and those who did were provided commentary about their interview. Many candidates said that the character-based feedback was the most meaningful they had ever received. Interview board members, including those at the most senior levels, indicated that it was the first time they had really gotten to know the candidate as a leader and as an individual. And, importantly, character-based interviews have changed hiring decisions. Because the interview board gets a truer, deeper understanding of who the candidate is as a person, they are more willing to select less traditional candidates, creating a more diverse workforce. All of these positive changes arose from Côté and her team making the initial, personal commitment to champion leader character.</p>
<p>One of the significant benefits of the strategic approach to leader character is that it provides an accessible common language that weaves together the many different strategic agendas of the organization, whether it be risk management or diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). For example, <a href="https://www.questionofcharacter.com/essays/characters-essential-role-in-addressing-conduct-in-financial-institutions">misconduct and risk management are heavily affected by character-based judgment</a>. And when judgment is strengthened by elevating dimensions such as humility, humanity, collaboration, accountability, courage, and justice, meeting strategic goals to advance DEI becomes easier.</p>
<h3>Taking Action on Character</h3>
<p>The most immediate and practical approach for organizations that seek to tap the power of leader character is to simply start the conversation. A leadership team from TD Bank Group recently referred to our book, <cite>Developing Leadership Character</cite>, to launch a set of workshops for their colleagues on each of the dimensions of character.<a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> We learned about this opportunity when a TD  executive reached out to learn more about temperance. </p>
<p>Educational events with the goal of understanding leader character are both scalable and high impact. They can range from intimate senior leadership workshops to webinars with thousands of people on the call, and they provide an immediate grasp of how leader character can be applied both personally and professionally. In our own workshops, we deepen understanding using video clips such as the movie <cite>Invictus</cite>, which features the real-life story of Nelson Mandela’s transformation of South Africa. We’re often struck by how easily people can identify all the character behaviors after viewing a video clip of Mandela’s first day on the job. They observe that it is not one behavior at a time but often several working simultaneously, in much the same way you might observe the muscles of the body working together when you see someone in motion. These insights are important, because we distinguish what we call <em>elegant manipulation</em> — someone with weak or imbalanced character who pretends to exercise humility and humanity, for example — from the person with strength of character whose actions reveal that strength. And there is another profound moment when people realize that the essence of their leadership potential arises from their strength of character rather than some style that seems inauthentic to them.</p>
<p>After a workshop with the senior executives of the capital markets group in a bank, one executive asked where he could find a leader character coach for his son, to which we replied, “That would be you.” It is not an insignificant point that many people see the application of character in both their personal lives and professional lives. In fact, given an understanding of what character is and how it develops, there is as much potential for development outside of the workplace as there is within it.<a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>As discussed above, though, these initial investments will have the most significant payback when leadership elevates character alongside competence as a strategic asset. The best outcomes result from inserting character into HR practices and leveraging it in strategic and cultural transformation and key initiatives, including risk management and DEI.</p>
<p>Although there is a sweeping strategic agenda for leader character work, there are practical points of application. First, start with yourself. Consider whether what could be potential virtues are operating like vices, and where you need to strengthen dimensions of character. Consider who you are becoming while you are busy doing — how is character showing up for you, and how is it affecting others? One executive we know sets his watch to remind himself several times a day to check on how he is activating his character to influence his judgment and the judgment of those with whom he is interacting. A gut-check on character has pivoted many conversations that are going sideways when individuals ask themselves, “What dimension of character do I need to activate in this moment?”</p>

<p>Second, you can start to embed leader character in your practices from wherever you sit. You might be a senior leader with a smorgasbord of strategic priorities, or someone like Côté, who has a particular area of responsibility. Because the thread of leader character weaves through and connects all facets of the organization, you can make the changes that trigger a ripple effect throughout.</p>
<p>Finally, our aim has been to enable the strategic shift in elevating character alongside competence with a far-ranging set of tools, from articles and podcasts to assessment instruments and learning apps. It’s a big idea and profound shift, but there are very practical tools and approaches to help implement it. We contend that the times we live in make elevating character alongside competence not only a strategic imperative but also a social responsibility.</p>

<h6>David Gelles (Simon & Schuster, 2022)</h6>
<p><img class="book-cover" src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Man-Who-Broke-Capitalism-Cover.jpg" alt="The Man Who Broke Capitalism: How Jack Welch Gutted the Heartland and Crushed the Soul of Corporate America — and How to Undo His Legacy"></p>
<p>“The history of the world is but the biography of great men,” wrote 19th-century Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle. With <cite>The Man Who Broke Capitalism</cite>, <cite>New York Times</cite> business reporter David Gelles attempts to resuscitate the hoary “great man” theory of leadership in a backhanded sort of way. He calls out the late Jack Welch, the General Electric CEO whom <cite>Fortune</cite> magazine anointed “manager of the century” in 1999, as the evil mastermind behind the litany of economic woes rooted in shareholder capitalism gone wild, but he pays scant attention to their root causes.</p>
<p>When Welch took up the reins at GE in 1981, it was not a prosperous time in America’s economic history. The post-World War II boom was on its last legs: America’s industrial giants were sinking under their own weight, and foreign companies, especially those from Japan and Germany, were making inroads the size of superhighways into the U.S. consumer market. GE, then one of the nation’s leading companies, was languishing in the slow growth environment too.</p>
<p>If you were in business in the 1980s and ’90s, Gelles’s recounting of Welch’s tenure at GE will be a familiar story. “Neutron Jack” cut head count and instituted an annual employee ranking scheme that required that employees in the lowest decile be fired. The company’s business units had to be No. 1 or 2 in their market or they were jettisoned. Meanwhile, Welch chased new growth opportunities in financial services and media — soon, GE Capital alone accounted for more than half of the company’s profits.  </p>
<p>The results? “During [Welch’s] tenure, GE posted annualized share price growth of about 21% a year, far outpacing the S&P 500 even during a historic bull market,” writes Gelles. “When Welch took over, GE was worth $14 billion. Two decades later, the company was worth $600 billion — the most valuable company in the world.”</p>
<p>This extraordinary run made Jack Welch a legend in his own time. Gelles reports that 8,000 or so articles about Welch appeared annually during his final years at GE — “most all of them fawning in tone.” Major companies across the country vied to hire his proteges as their CEOs. (Some of these companies profited, but many did not.) Meanwhile, GE made Welch one of the world’s richest people: “In 2000, his last full year on the job, Welch’s compensation package was worth $122.5 million,” relates Gelles. “A career of stock-based compensation had paid off. In the end, Welch possessed a staggering 21 million shares in GE, which, at their peak, were worth roughly $1 billion.”       </p>
<p>The difference in Gelles’s telling of Welch’s story is its almost exclusive focus on the negative externalities. He argues that Jack Welch’s approach to corporate management relied on the “dark arts” of downsizing, dealmaking, and financialization — the last of which nearly sank the company when the crisis in subprime lending crashed the global economy a decade after Welch retired. Gelles labels this trio of tactics “Welchism” and throughout the book blames Welch for popularizing it and propagating its costs on the American worker and economy.</p>
<p>These costs are well known and undeniable. In 2009, Welch himself denounced shareholder capitalism as “the dumbest idea in the world” — to which Gelles responds, “Coming from Welch, the assertion was laughable.”           </p>
<p>But is Jack Welch the bogeyman who single-handedly gutted American manufacturing and innovation and turned the American dream of millions of workers and middle managers into a waking nightmare of stagnant wages and meager retirements? Hardly. Welch carried water for economists such as Milton Friedman, politicians like Ronald Reagan, and the people who supported them — that is, powerful and wealthy investors who cared about nothing except rising returns. There were structural forces in play, too: the growing economic might of Japan, Germany, and then China; free trade and deregulation; the decline of unions and the rise of global labor arbitrage; and an overly permissive government. Welch is not responsible for the societal zeitgeist portrayed in movies like Oliver Stone’s <em>Wall Street</em>. He rode a wave, and perhaps he helped increase its amplitude, but he didn’t create or control it. No one person could, no matter how great.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>During a recent interview with Roger Martin, the former dean of the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, who is quoted several times in Gelles’s book, I asked for his assessment of Welch. Martin knew him from Welch’s visits to the Rotman School and had taught at GE University by invitation of the CEO. “I find it hard to see him as a Machiavellian genius,” said Martin. “He was an unsophisticated connoisseur of the idea of shareholder value maximization who was able to somewhat blindly and without reflection implement it in a powerful company.”</p>
<p>While <cite>The Man Who Broke Capitalism</cite> serves as a welcome antidote to the shelf full of hagiographic books about Welch, including his memoir and management manuals, it also is a tiresome polemic and a misreading of modern business history and the shareholder-obsessed culture of management that emerged in the 1980s and ’90s. Worse, in seeking to transform Jack Welch into the straw dog for a couple of generations’ worth of greed, selfishness, and shortsightedness, Gelles ignores the broader structural and societal pressures that resulted in the creation of an economic system that has proved to be inequitable and unsustainable.  </p>

<p>In a tight labor market, companies are in trouble when career growth opportunities within the organization are misaligned with the needs of employees.</p>
<p>According to Pew Center Research data, more than 60% of U.S. employees who quit their jobs in the past year cited a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/09/majority-of-workers-who-quit-a-job-in-2021-cite-low-pay-no-opportunities-for-advancement-feeling-disrespected">lack of career advancement opportunities</a> as a leading reason for leaving, and a recent study by researchers at the MIT Sloan School of Management, New York University’s Stern School of Business, and Revelio Labs found that <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/toxic-culture-is-driving-the-great-resignation">lateral career opportunities</a> are more than twice as important as compensation in predicting employee retention. Additionally, lateral moves and promotions allow employees to experience professional growth and develop new skills. Yet our research finds that only 10% of job opportunities today are filled with internal lateral hires.</p>
<p>While often overlooked as a lever for talent, offering employees lateral moves can be an untapped gold mine for companies. By adopting leading practices for internal mobility, companies can better deploy existing worker capacity and benefit from more successful hires who hit the ground running in new roles with greater institutional knowledge, higher levels of engagement and retention, and even improved gender equity. At the same time, employees benefit from meaningful skill and career development opportunities that better align with their goals, making this a win-win for employers and employees alike.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In our research, we have identified companies that are leading the way as <em>talent mobility outperformers</em>. These organizations have higher internal lateral mobility rates and higher employee satisfaction. In this article, we explore four practical insights based on best practices of outperformers, offering ways for companies that are currently underutilizing internal talent to learn from those at the leading edge of this trend.</p>
<h3>What Talent Mobility Outperformers Do Differently</h3>
<p>We identified internal and external hires at the 750 largest U.S. public and private companies by analyzing the employment histories described in their professional online resumes (See “Identifying Internal Lateral Mobility Outperformers”).  We define an internal lateral career move as a new position of an employee within the same company, where the occupation changes but the level of seniority remains the same. We found that the median lateral mobility rate for large U.S. companies is 8%, and only about a quarter of companies in the data set boasted rates above 15%.</p>

<h4>Identifying Internal Lateral Mobility Outperformers</h4>
<p class="caption">This chart uses data from 2021 to show the relationship between the lateral mobility rate and employee satisfaction ratings from more than 400 large U.S. public and private companies. Those in the top right quadrant fall into the outperformer category, scoring higher on both internal mobility rate and employee satisfaction.</p>

<p class="attribution">
</article>
</aside>
</div>
<p>We also found that certain industries, growth stages, and occupations (including business process specialists, brand managers, and strategists) are more conducive than others for employees to make lateral moves. Perhaps more surprising is the fact that these variables explain only about a quarter of the variation in companies’ internal lateral mobility rates. Other factors, such as company talent practices, play a more significant role. </p>
<p>In the following section, we look at four talent practices that are setting talent mobility outperformers apart.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Put More Power in the Hands of Employees</h4>
<p>Talent hoarding is one of the greatest barriers to talent mobility. Only 20% of employees feel supported by teams to make an <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/what-stops-employees-from-applying-for-internal-roles">internal move</a>. And many employees — especially women — leave companies without even exploring internal options. Talent mobility outperformers overcome this tension in part by giving employees the ability to browse and apply for opportunities directly on <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/create-a-crisis-growth-plan-start-with-opportunity-marketplaces/">talent marketplaces</a> without first notifying their line managers. </p>
<p>While conversations with managers are often encouraged, most don’t require approval from line managers for job changes or project opportunities. Asaf Jackoby, vice president of global HR at Amdocs, explains that resistance to change can come at a cost for the organization. “While it’s only human nature to want to hang on to your talent,” says Jackoby, “managers simply don’t have the opportunity to limit mobility for their teams.” </p>
<p>For companies like Amdocs and HSBC, the shift from <em>organization-led</em> mobility, where managers must initiate and approve mobility opportunities, to <em>employee-led</em> mobility is intentional, designed to give employees more agency while reducing the friction associated with finding opportunities internally. </p>
<p>Of course, designing mobility processes to empower employees is only part of the equation. Change management is still critical. No matter how well companies design their internal talent systems, a layer of skeptical managers telling their teams that staying put is the surest path to advancement is sure to slow adoption. At Mastercard, chief talent and organizational effectiveness officer Lucrecia Borgonovo emphasizes the importance of showing leaders the benefits of tapping into talent in other parts of the organization. Amdocs monitors mobility metrics at all levels of the organization, reviewing which businesses are talent exporters and which are talent importers on a monthly basis, helping to surface insights for leaders and hold them accountable for internal mobility goals. </p>
<h4>Expand the Mobility Option Menu </h4>
<p>While historically many internal mobility programs have focused on permanent job transfers, a growing number of companies are embracing more varied models for lateral mobility — especially through project or internal gig work, in which employees contribute to a project while remaining in their jobs. In fact, most companies that are outperforming in terms of internal lateral mobility based on job changes are also implementing some form of project matching.</p>
<p>Fidelity International has launched a pilot career vitality program focused on growing internal talent. Internal project work and job-shadowing opportunities that offer a promising path to permanent internal transfers are at the core of the program. “We recently had an employee who undertook job shadowing and project work in our asset management team,” Fidelity International’s global head of talent, Carmel Mitchell, explained. “When that team had a job opening, this individual applied and transferred into the department. They would have never applied had they not gained experience through project participation.”</p>
<p>At Seagate Technology, an employee from marketing helped the talent acquisition team with a project so successfully that they then transferred into a full-time employer branding role. And an engineer who took part in a six-month innovation project became an innovation lead in addition to their day-to-day responsibilities.</p>
<p>Projects offer employees the opportunity to explore a passion and develop new skills while unlocking additional worker capacity and innovation for their employers. “It’s easy for people to think that internal mobility is all about moving from one role to another,” says Hamish Nisbet, global head of resourcing for HSBC. “But if you think about it from a future-of-work lens, internal mobility might also be about stretching into other areas while remaining in your job role or unit.” </p>
<h4>Take Advantage of Recent Innovation </h4>
<p>Third-party solutions that help companies tap into internal talent have blossomed in recent years. In 2021 alone, $12 billion was invested in the <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/billion-dollar-opportunity-in-hr-technology">HR technology</a> space. Where companies used to create their own custom technologies for internal mobility, platform developers like Gloat, Fuel50, and Eightfold AI now offer internal talent marketplaces powered by artificial intelligence. Human capital management providers like Workday have introduced talent marketplaces of their own.</p>
<p>Third-party offerings can accelerate a company’s internal mobility journey and create a virtuous cycle of adoption and learning (from data collected through the marketplaces) while avoiding common traps that come with developing and maintaining custom internal platforms (such as maintaining a growing list of APIs). Most outperformers use third-party solutions for their talent marketplaces, and many of those that have built their own are exploring options to partner. </p>
<p>These partnerships also reflect a philosophy of looking outward to fuel internal talent innovation. Unilever’s vice president of global learning and future of work, Paddy Hull, reflects that companies at the leading edge look at “the trends and beyond the walls of their own organizations.” Unilever is a prime example. In 2018, Unilever went on a digital safari to visit future of work startups in five cities around the world. It was then that they met Gloat, with whom they would partner to launch Unilever’s Flex experiences program, which uses AI to help employees match with open career opportunities.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Integrate Mobility With Other Talent Practices</h4>
<p>In order to build a successful talent program around internal mobility, leaders need to think about bringing these practices into day-to-day routines — such as onboarding, learning and development planning, and performance management. A focused approach to talent mobility can also help companies to integrate talent processes that have historically been disconnected.</p>
<p>Take the example of Comcast, which reimagined quarterly reviews, rebranding them as quarterly connections to allow for conversations about next steps and potential job changes in addition to in-role performance. At Unilever, purpose workshops where employees can develop future-fit skill plans create opportunities for talent mobility to support employees’ development goals. And S&P Global has a dedicated internal career development coaching team that provides confidential support to employees at all levels of the organization as they navigate their career paths.</p>
<p>Companies are also tightening the links between talent mobility and talent development. Seagate Technology, which requires that jobs be posted internally before being posted externally, has set an 80% skills match threshold for job transfers. The company started an upskilling program to help employees bridge the gap from 80% to 100% and ensure that employees are successful as they transition to new roles. Using data from the talent marketplace allows Seagate to identify skills gaps in the organization and tailor learning and development programs to help close them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tapping internal talent in the workforce is a meaningful opportunity for companies facing growing skills gaps, hiring pressures, and retention risks — especially in an economic downturn. As more organizations follow the lead of outperformers to invest in internal lateral mobility, companies that overlook this strategy risk becoming less competitive for talent in a market in which career opportunity matters more than ever. </p>

<p>The past few years have been tough and chaotic for many working people. Assumptions, habits, and ways of working have changed, and as we look forward, many of us realize that building personal resilience will be key. </p>
<p>One of the crucial elements of personal resilience is friendship. It helps if we have a trusted confidant at our organization — someone who makes us feel worthwhile and whom we can celebrate and commiserate with. </p>
<p>Friendships at work matter. When so many hours are spent working, having someone who understands our situation — the players involved, the office dynamics, and the general organizational culture — can help buffer routine stress. When we share our experiences, it often reminds us that others have gone through similar ones. </p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://news.gallup.com/topic/element-10-best-friend.aspx">Gallup research</a> found that agreement with the statement “I have a best friend at work” is a strong predictor of whether you are likely to stay in your job. Gallup also found a concrete link between having a best friend at work and the amount of effort a worker expends on their job. For example, “Women who strongly agree they have a best friend at work are more than twice as likely to be engaged (63%) compared with those who say otherwise (29%),” according to <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236213/why-need-best-friends-work.aspx">Gallup’s 2018 research</a>.</p>
<p>Yet friendships at work is a complex topic, as I discovered when I recently spoke on a <em>Financial Times</em> podcast and wrote an <em>FT</em> article about the joys of friendship at work. Many people responded to each, and I discovered that while some felt positive about their experiences, many were more wary. Typical comments included “People are friends with you at work only because they want something from you,” “It’s hard to be a good friend with someone who is more/less senior,” and “I cannot trust people at work.”</p>
<p>These are all legitimate concerns that really go to the heart of friendship and work. And they illustrate why friendship among work colleagues has never been more fragile. During the pandemic, 59% of people in hybrid work environments and 56% who were entirely remote reported that they had fewer work friendships, according to the Microsoft 2022 Work Trend Index. Even before work was uprooted by COVID-19, 76% of executives said they had difficulty making connections with their work teammates, and 58% described their social relationships at work as “superficial,” according to research by Constance N. Hadley and Mark Mortensen, who reported their findings in <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite>’s “<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/are-your-team-members-lonely/">Are Your Team Members Lonely?</a>” Young people are feeling the sting especially acutely: Forty percent of those ages 16 to 24 surveyed by the BBC in 2018 reported feeling lonely “often or very often.”</p>
<p>So here is the paradox: People often feel isolated, both in general and at work — what Hadley and Mortensen termed “alone together” in the organization. Yet they are wary of making the workplace relationships that could reduce their loneliness. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ways to Build Workplace Friendship</h3>
<p>To understand this paradox more deeply, I turned to my friend Robert Waldinger, who is the current director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development. This <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/">long-term research project</a> by Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital has been tracking groups of people over their lifetimes. The studies show conclusively that people with close long-term friends are more resilient and happier than those who lack such friendships. </p>
<p>But what of friendships at work? In Robert’s view, it is important that we acknowledge the potential for complexity in work-based friendships. Take, for example, a close friendship between two people who started out as peers, but one is now more senior — perhaps even the boss. These friends are now managing dual roles — as a friend and a boss, and as a friend and a subordinate. These power differentials are real, and they do create complications. And while all relationships are to some extent transactional (think about the relationship between romantic partners), working relationships are more delineated: “You are my boss; you pay me.” </p>
<p>Yet Robert and I agree that there are ways of coming to terms with these complexities — and we offer two strategies: </p>
<p><strong>Test for trustworthiness.</strong> Relationships bridge from transactions into friendships through the steady accumulation of personal affection and trust. Our friendships are based on intimacy, and you become friends with people because both of you reveal your innermost thoughts and memories. Yet to reveal oneself (particularly to someone at work) is potentially dangerous — could they use this information against you or tell others? So perhaps even more so than in relationships outside of work, establishing whether a potential new friend is trustworthy is crucial. You have to decide, “Can I have confidence in this person?” </p>
<p>Knowing whether trust is possible is a process that begins by first being careful and paying close attention to the other person. How do they behave when they don’t believe they are being observed, such as in their treatment of subordinates? How do they talk about others? Do they show what Robert calls <em>sympathetic joy</em>, or are they envious and calculating? How do they deal with confidential information? Are they telling you secrets they are not supposed to tell? Do they overshare? Remember: You don’t have to be friends with everyone, and each relationship has to be considered on its own merits. No situation is identical to another.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Start with mutual sharing.</strong> Friendship builds as you begin to take the risk of leaning on each other. If it keeps feeling right, then it’s possible to take more risks. When it does not feel right, then it moves back to a more detached, businesslike relationship. Friendship develops over time based on incremental actions that are frequent and informal. Saying “hi” through an open door and chatting in the kitchen area gradually shifts into sharing interests and volunteering information. Especially for people who are working partially at home, in-office interactions during those infrequent times together has been shown to <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-loneliness-of-the-hybrid-worker/">reduce feelings of aloneness</a> and improve job satisfaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Friendships build from reciprocal effort; they involve telling your friend something and listening to them share their thoughts. By asking, “How is your mother doing?” or offering information like, “I am worried — I think my daughter is depressed,” you are acknowledging the other person and both your and their unique situations. In the workplace, asking about what the other person is experiencing and engaging with them about their stories and opinions is showing what Robert calls <em>radical curiosity</em>: “Hearing an accurate understanding of your own experience coming from another person, articulated in their words, can be thrilling.” I really feel this for myself. I have a close friend at work and share with her my innermost worries, successes, and frustrations. My life feels chaotic at times, but our friendship has been a steady and nurturing force. Sharing strengthens a sense of belonging. </p>
<p>The alternative of not sharing and not establishing friendships is that so much of the “real” parts of our lives have to be separated from the “work” parts. I believe that friendship at work is a risk worth taking. Many of us spend eight hours a day working, and if we compartmentalize and silo, we have no one to talk to about what we are struggling with or celebrating. That is the foundation of loneliness — which has tremendous costs and negative consequences. </p>
<p>So let’s embrace complexity rather than shutting it down. It’s sad if we cannot have friends at work because we believe the risks are too high. Let’s not overestimate the mess of trying to build friendships at work and underestimate the benefits of having a close friend at work. </p>

</figure>
<p>Mentoring programs are a popular and important tool to support employees in developing skills and advancing at work. At their best, they provide a way for senior managers to nurture promising employees, sometimes by advocating for them at key moments, and other times by helping them navigate the challenges of their roles.</p>
<p>But mentoring can also miss the mark. Senior managers can end up perpetuating noninclusive and harmful norms of an “ideal worker” instead of empowering their mentees to challenge the status quo.</p>
<p>In our research about mentoring relationships, we seldom see mentors use their roles to engage in identity work that celebrates the unique characteristics of their mentees. Instead, mentors often advise mentees on how to “fit in” and assimilate to toxic behaviors and gendered cultures at organizations. Mentoring becomes another tool of oppression rather than one of enlightenment and inclusion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s an example: Latika was a mentee paired with Agnes in the formal mentoring program of their financial services organization. Agnes had risen up the ranks through hard work and had a reputation as a tough but fair leader. In their first meetings, Agnes emphasized the sacrifices she had made. “You cannot be halfway in,” she said. “If they want you to close business deals over late-night meetings, you do that. If getting things done means skipping lunch, you do that. You have to show that your work is the most important thing in your life.” Agnes told Latika that as a woman, she would have to do even more than a man to prove herself.</p>
<p>While Latika appreciated Agnes’s directness, she was disappointed. She wondered whether it is truly impossible for someone as accomplished as Agnes to challenge the culture of overwork and discrimination. She wondered what following in Agnes’s footsteps would mean for her health, well-being, and work-life balance. She wondered whether that is all that mentors do — help people like her adjust to making trade-offs.</p>
<p>That disappointment is not unjustified. Ambitious young people, especially women and people of color, are looking for role models who are pioneers not just in achieving personal success but in changing unhealthy and inequitable cultures for the better. They’re looking for ways to succeed without molding themselves to fit the definition of so-called ideal workers and without the requirement to limit their identity expression. In the case of Latika, she wondered why Agnes wasn’t questioning the unreasonable expectations of the organization instead of following them to prove her worth. Maybe she needed to do that when she was at a junior level in her career, but she had become a reputed leader. Why was she still playing by their rules?</p>
<p>Our research suggests that mentoring can be a missed opportunity if mentors like Agnes view these relationships merely as ways to socialize mentees into inequitable structures and cultures. If Agnes is not reflective of her opportunity to call into question some of the poisonous expectations of her organization, she becomes complicit in perpetuating practices that reinforce power inequities between women — especially women of color — and their White, male counterparts. Instead, if mentors like Agnes could partner with mentees like Latika to collectively reflect on how following expectations blindly might yield short-term gains in terms of a promotion but hamper long-term outcomes such as well-being and equity, then mentoring relationships could become vehicles of change.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Tips for Mentors to Challenge the ‘Ideal Worker’ Status Quo</h3>
<p>Creating a mutually trusting partnership — one of respect and of valuing both vulnerability and strengths — depends on the extent to which mentors are willing to see the mentoring relationship as a space for identity work and not just skill development.</p>
<p>We recently published a study that describes how the two of us, as immigrant academic mothers, experienced <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13505076211062900">our co-mentoring relationship</a> as a healing space during the pandemic. Drawing insights from that work and our <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrdq.21386">research on mutual mentoring partnerships</a>, we offer some concrete tips on how mentors (formal and informal) can help mentees thrive. This sometimes means helping mentees avoid the scrutiny that minorities and women experience in their day-to-day work lives based on stereotypes, negative attributions, and perceived lack of competence — scrutiny that shapes their image as those who are less-than-ideal workers.</p>
<p><strong>Redefine the yardstick of success.</strong> Mentors need to consider the ideal worker image their organization promotes implicitly and explicitly. Is it healthy, or is it detrimental to their mentees’ well-being? Mentors have a critical opportunity to redefine the often-gendered rhetoric of success that rewards ideal working at the cost of well-being. They can broaden the definition of success to include notions of compassion, vulnerability, and care. Our recent studies confirm earlier work that shows that such care and trust are invaluable for fostering a high-quality mentoring relationship that can challenge the status quo in organizations.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Practice mutuality.</strong> Leaders need to recognize that mentoring relationships, especially ones in which their mentee does not share similar personal, social, or organizational identities, are inherently hierarchical. These relational dynamics can inhibit mentees from bringing their authentic selves to the relationship. “Practicing mutuality” can mean having mentors challenge themselves to learn from their mentees, or it can mean discussing how the power imbalance in the relationship might be affecting the mentoring. Mentoring offers mentors a rare opportunity to learn different perspectives. Opting to be mentored by a more junior-level employee in a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352058876_Engagement_inclusion_knowledge_sharing_and_talent_development_is_reverse_mentoring_a_panacea_to_all_Findings_from_literature_review">reverse-mentoring relationship</a> can prepare them for mutuality in mentoring as well.</p>
<p><strong>Engage in identity work.</strong> We recommend that mentors reflect critically on how their multiple identities position them to interact with mentees. “Identity work” means understanding that your experiences are a function of how your identities interact with systems and that your experiences may not match the lived reality of your mentees, especially if they have marginalized identities. For instance, research indicates that mentoring can offer a relational space for the identity work needed for <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15344843211040732?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.112">developing diverse leaders</a> and thus <a href="https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/publications/meaning-in-mentoring-more-than-meets-the-eyei">goes beyond mere skill development</a> to enabling growth in both the mentor’s and mentee’s identities.</p>
<p><strong>Offer allyship.</strong> While giving tips on how to develop certain skills and attitudes is important, it may not be sufficient for having an impact on a mentee’s career. If an organization’s systems and practices are biased against those from marginalized backgrounds, asking mentees to develop certain skills or mold themselves to fit the organization’s way of doing things is harmful. Instead, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1052562917710687?journalCode=jmed">mentors have a powerful opportunity</a> to challenge themselves to leverage their positions of power and privilege to advocate for mentees with marginalized identities.</p>
<p><strong>Encourage mentees to be self-authoring.</strong> Mentors should want mentees to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1059601119838689">respect them, not mimic them</a>. Mentors should make clear at the onset of the relationship that they want their mentees to grow in ways that <em>go beyond</em> what the mentor has been able to effect or achieve. Mentees need to be encouraged to nurture the capacity to generate their own standards and values (that is, self-author their lives and careers) without pressure to conform to any ideal worker prototype. While mentors should share their experiences and the steps they took in different situations, they also should encourage mentees to bring their own uniqueness and problem-solving to the table.</p>
<h3>Tips for Mentees to Resist Mentors’ Modeling of ‘Ideal Worker’ Norms</h3>
<p>We also have developed tips on how mentees can prioritize their health and well-being over untenable expectations potentially modeled by their mentors — without derailing their career trajectories.</p>
<p><strong>Practice critical reflection.</strong> Mentees often worship their mentors’ experience and expertise, but mentors are human and can be questioned. High-quality relationships need a strong foundation of trust, but that can’t be built if a mentee doesn’t feel free to question their mentor’s advice and engage in a conversation about why that advice may not apply to their lived reality. Mentees should not be afraid to speak up. And critical reflection is a learning opportunity for both mentees and mentors: In our recent article about co-mentoring each other during the pandemic, we note the importance of having each other to challenge our assumptions about working and mothering.</p>
<p><strong>Reflect on the mentoring schema.</strong> Everyone has a mental script on what mentoring is and what each role involves. But that script might need to be broadened if each side is to better the other. For example, if the mentee’s schema primarily guides them to defer to the mentor without questioning their advice, there’s a missed opening to cocreate knowledge. Having an awareness of mentoring schema can enable mentees to expand their ideas of the responsibilities of mentor/mentee roles to <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Exploring-the-lived-experiences-of-mutuality-in-the-Ghosh-Hutchins/2ca2ab195c2ed799694a6d7a148e9a797f875855">accommodate mutual learning</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Bring your whole self to the mentoring relationship.</strong> Mentees should feel free to acknowledge without inhibition who they are at the intersections of their different identities. The editing of identities can be especially harmful to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/15344843211040732">mentees from marginalized backgrounds</a>. Mentees who find themselves limiting their self-expression and truncating their identities to fit someone else’s expectations should seek mentoring elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Discuss the costs and benefits of challenging the status quo.</strong> While we have mentioned the importance of challenging the status quo several times, it is, of course, wise to be careful about the implications of such challenges. This is an especially good topic to explore with a mentor. A mentor might be able to help figure out low-risk situations where the mentee can begin to let go of the organization’s mantle of ideal working. Small experiments can limit the risks of such actions. In our recent co-mentoring study, we discussed the ways in which challenging the status quo of ideal working might be risky for us as women leaders of color in academia and identified situations where we could take such risks.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Compare and contrast the advice of multiple mentors.</strong> Mentees can certainly be proactive in designing a network of mentors instead of restricting themselves to one. With multiple mentors, ambitious workers are able to compare and mix advice to find a best path forward. Recent research has underscored the <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/making-the-most-of-conflicting-advice-from-mentors/">value of divergent advice</a> from multiple mentors as a catalyst for growth. If one mentor gives advice that is not aligned with a mentee’s values and interests, that mentee has other advisers to turn to.</p>
<p>It is time to look beyond the traditional benefits that mentoring can offer in regard to skill and attitude development. Mentoring has the potential to be a tool for change where both mentors and mentees can practice critical reflection — together — to promote equity and well-being. Being mindful of the tips we’ve offered can help mentors and mentees to take significant steps toward carefully challenging the status quo of ideal working without jeopardizing their careers.</p>

<p>Ameen Kazerouni, chief data and analytics officer at Orangetheory Fitness (OTF), believes that AI’s role isn’t to replace human experts but rather to help them make better decisions. That’s why OTF collects heart rate and telemetry data during its in-studio fitness classes: so that AI algorithms can turn that data into feedback that empowers people to make real-time choices about their workouts and enables coaches to offer personalized recommendations. </p>
<p>On this episode of the <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> podcast, Ameen joins Sam and Shervin to describe how OTF’s data collection and algorithms are used to create a curated fitness experience for its members, and he explains why it’s critical to keep humans in the feedback loop when implementing artificial intelligence. </p>

<h4>Transcript</h4>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Real-time data collection means organizations can make many more informed choices based on metrics. But when do they still need humans? Find out on today’s episode.</p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> I’m Ameen Kazerouni from Orangetheory Fitness, and you’re listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite>.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Welcome to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite>, a podcast on artificial intelligence in business. Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I’m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I’m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite>.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I’m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG, and I colead BCG’s AI practice in North America. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI for six years, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Today, Shervin and I are excited to be joined by Ameen Kazerouni, chief data and analytics officer for Orangetheory Fitness. Ameen, thanks for joining us. Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> Thank you, Sam. It’s great to be here. Excited for the conversation. </p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Currently, you lead the data and analytics function at Orangetheory Fitness. Maybe tell us a little bit about the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> Absolutely. Orangetheory Fitness is a heart-rate-based, total-body group workout. It combines science, great coaching, technology, and it’s designed to provide what we like to think of as a more vibrant life. The workout’s developed to motivate each individual member to achieve their desired results. And, you know, if you’re starting on your wellness journey or you’re a seasoned fitness enthusiast, each OTF workout creates a community of shared experience but also uses heart-rate-based training to allow you to experience the workout in a way that’s most comfortable for you, and that’s honestly where my role comes in. There’s a tremendous amount of second-by-second telemetry data from the fitness equipment, from the heart rate monitors, that allows us to create the most curated, personalized kind of boutique fitness experience in the world. That’s Orangetheory.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> All right, what do you do with all this? You’ve collected all this data, you’ve got it, this telemetry, you’ve got heart rate information, I assume, since you’re heart-rate-based. How does the process work? Take us through the steps. </p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> Most Orangetheory members in the studio will be wearing what we call an OTbeat heart rate monitor, which is a proprietary piece of wearable technology. There’s two purposes to that. One is, it gives you a real-time feedback loop as to how you’re performing, what intensity level you’re outputting in the studio, but it also allows the coach to see the intensity level that you’re outputting in the studio and help effectively provide a kind of personalized fitness training experience in a studio, in a group setting. My role is focused on kind of unlocking that telemetry data and helping personalize the experience even more. </p>
<p>A really cool example is that we recently launched a personalized max heart rate algorithm, and members now experience a much more curated experience in the studio, and that’s allowing us to use proprietary algorithms to determine what the max heart rate — which is a physiological term for the maximum output that your heart can beat at — is for an individual member. And percentages of that max heart rate tell you which heart rate zone you’re training in. So anaerobic training versus aerobic training have different physiological impacts. Time spent in different intensity zones has been proven to have varying effects on longevity and health in general. And by being able to personalize that for a member, we’re able to make this experience even more curated in the studio, while most places that leverage max heart rate will rely on a generic age-based kind of equation. And … as you can imagine, every 30-year-old or 40-year-old doesn’t have the same heart. So things like that are an example of how we curate the experience for our members using this data. </p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That is a supercool example, right? Not the average for your age and gender. And then that goes by bands of 10 anyway, right?</p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> As if all 50-year-old males exactly have the same ability.  </p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> Yeah. It makes the experience safer, it makes you more aware of what you’re doing, what your capability is, and you see that cardiorespiratory fitness climb over your time with the program.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I like what’s sort of inherent in what you’re saying — the rapid feedback, right? Within a few seconds, you get feedback, but also, in a broader, symbolic sense, what you’ve been proposing is more and more experimentation in general as you build AI algorithms. So it’s not just the algo, but it’s also experimentation <em>because</em> you get feedback. </p>
<p>The philosophy of how to build AI models, which relies on feedback, you’re also translating that into a real use case based on rapid feedback. There’s some poetry there.</p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> I didn’t think of it that way, but absolutely there’s poetry there. I think that one of the beauties of artificial intelligence algorithms is that they’re so reliant on things they’ve seen before and constant feedback loops to get smarter. And that’s exactly what the Orangetheory experience is indexed on is, as the members are getting stronger, we’re getting smarter and making sure that we move with them.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Tell us more a bit about your data science development philosophy and how you balance experimentation with more methodical “get the algorithm to be perfect before you launch it.” Just give us a sense of the trade-offs and how you and your teams think about that.</p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> I love that question, and it’s almost like I’ll take it even a step outside of developing algorithms. I’m a firm believer that companies have started indexing so heavily on collecting as much data as is humanly possible; as much as their compute and their storage costs, and their boards and their investors, will allow them to, companies collect data. And I think that what happens is, once you have the data, the expectation is, “Let’s jump to machine learning, let’s jump to AI.” And I would argue that those ... How many debates have you been in on “What’s AI, and what’s machine learning, and what do the words mean?” </p>
<p>My philosophy is to go and find those mundane, repetitive tasks and automate them first with your data, where possible. Go and find intuitive, gut-based decisions that your stakeholders and verticals are uncomfortable making based off of intuition and would love to make off of data, and make that data democratized, clean, and available. </p>
<p>And after that, you start the whole machine learning journey. And I think when it comes to machine learning and AI, and developing an algorithm in particular, it really depends on the context and the domain in which you’re working — whether you’re focusing on that precision, whether you’re focusing on that recall — and it really depends on what the implications of the prediction are. But generally speaking, I always err on the side of, if it’s safe enough, experiment and learn rather than relying on training and validation sets to chase perfection. It’s kind of my rule-of-thumb philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> There’s something also interesting, and I know you’ve shifted slightly into thinking about how your organization uses data, but maybe going back to how you’re using it within the studios, how do you incorporate data from outside? You know, let’s say that I’ve been training and working and improving within the studio, but little do you know that I’ve hurt my foot or I’ve pulled a leg muscle. How does that sort of outside information come in? </p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> I like that question a lot, Sam, because I’ve got two answers there. </p>
<p>One is, the coach is the hero at Orangetheory. And the way we think about it is, there’s 20 to 30 people in a class, but you don’t want to think of it as group fitness as much as you want to think of it as — probably, at least I think of it as — subsidized personal training. So you’ve got a pretty good personal relationship with that coach, and there’s no algorithm that I’m going to build that’s going to be better than you telling your coach, “Hey, I hurt my foot last night. What do you think I should do?” And we’ve got alternative, low-impact cardio equipment in the studio so you don’t get on a treadmill and start trying to run 8 miles an hour. In fact, one of the things the coach says before every class starts is, “If you got any orthopedic issues, please let me know,” and so on and so forth. So I think that one thing that I’ve learned about data over the course of my career is that data is valuable, and it’s really good to make decisions with, but if there’s a human in the loop that can scalably provide the answer instead, it’s likely going be hard to beat that expert with an algorithm. So don’t get in the way of the expert. </p>
<p>The second part of that answer is, let’s say you had a bunch of caffeine, or you ran a marathon the previous day, or you didn’t sleep very well; all those external factors affect your cardiac output when you’re in the studio. So that real-time feedback loop allows you and the coach to modulate yourself. </p>
<p>One thing that we encourage is, if you’re not feeling it, take a “green day.” ... The zones are broken up into colors, orange and red being the anaerobic zones — zones 4 and 5 — green being your zone 3, blue being your zone 2. So we recommend, don’t shoot for those 12 to 20 minutes in the orange and red zone. Look at your heart rate zones, listen to that real-time feedback loop, and take a green day if you need to. So it’s a bit of a cop-out answer there, but we’ve got the coach, we’ve got the member, and we’ve got a real-time feedback loop. And when there’s an intuitive answer like that right in front of you, I don’t think you should interfere with an algorithm, is kind of the thought process there. </p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I don’t think that’s a cop-out answer at all, because historically, you had a … OK, you could have a personal trainer, or you could be in a group setting. I think I personally identify [with] this because you could either teach someone one-on-one as a tutor or you could teach someone in a giant classroom. And I’m just excited about applications like this that are letting us pull together the best of both of those worlds. I’m hungry for it in education, but I can see that you’re making a lot of progress on that — and Shervin and I have talked with Peloton as well. They’re starting to think about how you get to an individual-level experience at scale, and that seems like what you’re really trying to do. </p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> Absolutely. I couldn’t have put it better myself. I think that’s exactly it.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I like that a lot. This is all about rapid feedback, which is a cornerstone of building expertise in any system, whether it’s chess, or whether it’s running, or whether it’s machine learning. The more you combine experimentation and rapid feedback <em>and</em> the human in the loop and apply that across different industries, the more opportunity and values you’re going to unleash for personalized everything, not just fitness or shopping for pants but also education and everything else. You’re on to something here.</p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> Absolutely. In my prior life, I was in retail. And when you think about the role of machine learning and deep learning in retail, it’s that: You’re trying to re-create the in-person shopping experience on a website. Like, how do we curate this? How do we create a personal shopper? How do we create that boutique experience? How do we predict the size correctly? How do we use AR [augmented reality] so that you can see what a shoe looks like on your foot? We’re always trying to close that gap and arrive back at what the real thing would be like — personalized, but at scale. And I think that’s the secret sauce there: … a rapid feedback loop, algorithmic support with large volumes of data, but then also not trying to circumnavigate around the expert, the human in the loop.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Exactly. And I think that’s really critical, Sam, because I remember when we did the first few years of the <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/artificial-intelligence-business-strategy">AI report</a>, like back in 2018-2019. </p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So long ago.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> There were still a lot of folks — I mean, that’s only three years ago, but a lot of folks still today are thinking of AI as that which replaces human and that which must automate. And the more we think that narrowly, the more outcomes we’re leaving on the table, the more successful workforces and humans we’re disenfranchising, and also the more opportunities we’re leaving unaddressed because we think, “Well, there’s no way I can fully replace a human here, so I’m not going to do it.”</p>
<p>And there are so many of these things where it’s not just AI versus human but it’s AI <em>and</em> human.</p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> Yep. You know, I think that there is a conflation of companies where the product is AI. Like, when you think of AI, you think of Tesla, and there’s different industries all of them play in, but there’s a very core part of the product that’s a stand-alone piece of intellectual property that’s heavily rooted in artificial intelligence, and that’s not how a majority of the world is going to use artificial intelligence. And I think that’s one of the kind of key differences in what you were just talking about, Shervin — is that people try and use AI the way those companies use AI and see them as the gold standard, but our product is not AI. Our product is a curated, science-backed, coach-inspired fitness experience that’s just merely augmented in parts by AI.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> This is something that Shervin and I are pretty excited about. I don’t want to foreshadow too much, but we’re thinking about these mini uses of AI beyond just this kind of poster use of AI that you’re talking about. I mean, yes, we all are attracted to the Boston Dynamics robots that look very cool, but there’s a lot going on that isn’t that level, and there’s so much value in those. And I think you’re starting to capture some of that. </p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I wanted to segue from this. We talked quite a lot about the importance of a human in the loop, experimentation, being hypothesis-driven, all these things you said. Maybe tell us a bit around the operating model and the ways of working in a company that is not an AI <em>product</em> company but is a company like yours with a strong mission. What does it take to take a use case and bring it to life? </p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> I think it honestly comes down to three things. It’s having the data; you can’t really get around not having the data. Investment. I think a big mistake companies make is not investing in data engineers early, thinking that you can just sprinkle AI like some kind of magic powder on raw data sets and it’s going to produce something. I think data engineers are a critical commodity that you want to invest in early so your data is at a point where you can actually use it. So that investment is really important. Wherever it’s coming from, there needs to be a serious decision made to invest in your data practice if you’re going to really try and build one. And then finally, it’s buy-in. When the product is not AI, you’re convincing domain experts — in our case, fitness experts — that have been doing this for a long time, that are formally educated in these fields of study, that are always going to know more about the product than you do, that an algorithm is going to help them and make their job easier. </p>
<p>And I think that that relationship can be a beautiful partnership or it can be an extremely antagonistic one. One of the things that I’ve kind of strived toward in my role at Orangetheory is to have a strong partnership with our template design team, our workout design team, because at the end of the day, they are the protectors and designers of that product, and we’re, again, just a tool that’s supporting them. Their buy-in is very critical, because their understanding of the algorithms is what then makes it to coaches in learning and development material. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, we’ve got thousands of coaches across 24 countries explaining that max heart rate algorithm that I mentioned. And they’re not explaining it like a piece of mathematics; they’re explaining it like a piece of exercise fitness, like a piece of exercise physiology. And that requires that buy-in. The AI, the data team, and the fitness team need to be in lockstep; otherwise, it’s destined to fail. </p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And what does that mean in terms of the talent and the team — the technical team that you oversee and you hire and recruit? </p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> That they’re difficult to find, is what it means. I think there’s already a scarcity of talent in this space. I think in a mission-driven, purpose-driven company like Orangetheory, you’d think it’s harder to find, but it’s actually easier in the sense that if you find someone that’s aligned with the mission, it’s almost exciting to them that there’s an opportunity to apply that skill set on what they considered an outside-the-job passion. </p>
<p>But we’ve also focused on our data organization being a separate entity. So we’ve got my role, chief data and analytics officer, running a data organization reporting in to our CEO. And we’ve got our chief digital and technology officer running a separate digital and technology organization. And what’s really powerful about that is that we’re able to riff off of each other and have one team provide building blocks to the other team and vice versa. And what you’d imagine creates an interesting working experience actually drives a lot of velocity and drives a really cool partnership that’s very exciting to be a part of as well. So I think it’s all about that: partnerships and buy-ins and collaboration across teams.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Very well said. Ameen, we have a special segment here where we ask you five rapid-fire-style questions. Just give us the first thing that comes to your mind. The key thing is intuitive, whatever comes to your mind, and short and sweet answers. So, ready for that? </p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> Let’s do it. </p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> All right. What’s your proudest AI moment?</p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> When we solved it using a linear regression. </p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Love it. All right. What worries you about AI?</p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> A lack of consultation with domain experts.</p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Well said. Your favorite activity that involves no technology?</p>
<p><strong>Ameen Kazerouni:</strong> Hiking. </p>
<p><strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Was that a question?</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the ongoing climate crisis have put a spotlight on the central role businesses can play in tackling global challenges. We need companies to step up and help solve social and environmental problems at scale — for the sake of the economy as well as <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/09/the-net-positive-manifesto">people and the planet</a>.</p>
<p>Yet one of the incentives companies have for being more socially and environmentally active — shareholder influence — is limited by existing approaches for assessing a company’s social and environmental performance. The predominant frameworks are too narrow and fail to fully address key stakeholder concerns on their own. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) assessments focus on internal operational matters, such as labor relations and supply chain sustainability, but don’t fully consider the impact that a company’s products or services can have on outside stakeholders. Impact investing, in contrast, focuses on external issues, such as whether products and services address the needs of the poor, but it overlooks internal considerations, such as how companies treat their employees.</p>
<p>In reality, a company’s social and environmental impact is multifaceted. Consider Tesla, which builds electric vehicles that significantly reduce emissions across their life cycles but faces <a href="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/221629/this-is-why-teslas-esg-rating-isnt-great.aspx">questions about its labor practices</a>. From an impact-investing perspective, the company might achieve high marks, but it rates lower from an ESG standpoint, with neither framework capturing the whole picture. As a result, frustration with both approaches is mounting: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-19/tesla-s-removal-from-s-p-index-sparks-debate-about-esg-ratings#xj4y7vzkg">Tesla’s recent removal</a> from the S&P 500 ESG Index prompted CEO Elon Musk to describe ESG ratings as “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-18/musk-says-esg-an-outrageous-scam-after-tesla-index-exclusion#xj4y7vzkg">an outrageous scam</a>,” while criticism of impact investing has pushed some large asset managers to tone down the language of their impact funds and <a href="https://www.responsible-investor.com/blackrock-renames-impact-funds-to-esg-following-criticism/">rebrand them</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s time for an integrated framework for assessing impact — one that accounts for both the external and internal facets of a company’s social and environmental performance. Only then can managers and investors provide accurate evaluations and influence companies to tackle complex global challenges.</p>
<h3>An Integrated Approach to Impact</h3>
<p>Drawing on several decades of collective experience leading and researching socially and environmentally sustainable businesses, we offer a holistic approach to assessing and benchmarking companies’ impact performance, based on four different levers a company can pull to effect social and environmental changes. While each lever is distinct, the real value comes from considering all four together. By capturing the full range of ways that a company can have impact, our framework will help direct capital flows toward sustainable businesses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To develop this comprehensive framework, we started with a shared understanding of what <em>impact</em> truly means. The Impact Management Project (IMP) <a href="https://impactfrontiers.org/norms/">frames impact</a> as “a change in an outcome caused by an organization. An impact can be positive or negative, intended or unintended.” Managing impact requires identifying the positive and negative effects on people and the planet to increase positives and reduce negatives. For companies, it is only when initiatives translate into improved outcomes for people’s lives or the planet’s health that they create impact. Which kinds of outcomes should qualify? The <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals</a> offer a comprehensive list that can be used as a guide; the goals include good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, and decent work and economic growth.</p>
<p>We then considered the different levers that businesses can use to create impact across these areas. Our work has identified four critical levers: (1) the products and services a company develops or sells, (2) the customer segments it targets, (3) changes in operations, and (4) how profits are used.</p>
<p>Below, we explain these four areas of impact, highlight links to the legacy concepts of ESG and impact investing, and identify existing tools for assessing a company’s performance along each one.</p>
<p><strong>Create products and services that deliver positive social or environmental value.</strong> This lever focuses on the extent to which a company’s core products and services improve people’s lives or the planet’s health. It can be the most powerful lever, particularly if a company reaches significant scale, as improvements can then reach billions of people worldwide.</p>
<p>Headspace Health, the company behind the popular meditation app, has always been centered around helping people develop mindfulness and improve their well-being. Tesla has used this lever by focusing on electric vehicles designed to have a lower environmental footprint than internal combustion engine vehicles. In each case, scaling up to reach more customers not only increases revenues for the company; it also dramatically improves outcomes for people and the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Improve the affordability and accessibility of products and services to reach marginalized populations.</strong> Here, the focus is on the degree to which a company makes its products and services affordable and accessible to those most in need. Consider the examples of Lemonade, which provides low-cost insurance products in the U.S. and some European countries, and Grameen Bank, a microfinance organization that offers financial services to the world’s poorest populations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These first two levers draw inspiration from impact investing’s external focus in measuring company impact. Assessment tools developed for impact investors, such as IMP’s general <a href="https://impactfrontiers.org/norms/">dimensions of impact</a> or Omidyar Network’s more specialized <a href="https://omidyar.com/introducing-the-ethical-explorer-pack/">Ethical Explorer Pack</a>, can be used to measure a company’s performance on both levers. Big Society Capital, for example, uses IMP tools to <a href="https://bigsocietycapital.com/latest/what-is-an-impact-startup/">assess impact-driven startups</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Embed social and environmental considerations into a company’s operations.</strong> This lever is about <em>how</em> a company delivers its products and services, and the effect it has on people and the planet through those choices. As such, it is most closely aligned with existing ESG and sustainability approaches, including the <a href="https://www.globalreporting.org/">Global Reporting Initiative</a>, the <a href="https://mneguidelines.oecd.org/">OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises</a>, and the <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-26000-social-responsibility.html">ISO 26000</a> standard for social responsibility.</p>
<p>Companies focusing on this lever include <a href="https://www.unilever.com/planet-and-society/">Unilever</a>, which embeds sustainability principles and practices across the design of the entire value chain, and Apple, which prioritizes <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/privacy/">customer privacy</a> in its product designs.</p>
<p><strong>Use profits to support social or environmental value creation.</strong> Companies bring positive impact by directing profits or cash reserves to benefit people and the planet through philanthropy, cross-subsidization, or <a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/how-treasurers-can-lead-their-companys-impact-investing">cash investments</a>. For example, <a href="https://www.innocentfoundation.org/about-us/about-the-foundation/">Innocent Drinks</a> donates 10% of its profits to charities, while <a href="https://bulletin.ids.ac.uk/index.php/idsbo/article/view/2930/Online%20article">Danone</a> uses profits from its traditional, well-established brands to subsidize its nutrition-fortified yogurt, enabling it to reach low-income customers.</p>
<p>This lever is most closely aligned with existing corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate philanthropy approaches. Several CSR tools can be used to assess performance in this area, including <a href="https://www.carbonbankroll.com/">The Carbon Bankroll</a>, which estimates the carbon footprint of major companies’ cash investments; <a href="https://www.csrhub.com/csrhub/">CSRHub</a>, which provides CSR ratings and information; and records of corporate giving, such as those tracked by <cite>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</cite>.</p>
<h3>Implementing the Framework</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/climate/patagonia-climate-philanthropy-chouinard.html">Patagonia’s recent decision</a> to place company governance in the hands of a trust dedicated to preserving its purpose and to give all profits to a climate action charity is a striking example of a company achieving impact across all four levers. But unfortunately, it’s all too rare. Most companies focus on just one or two areas, overlooking opportunities for positive growth. </p>
<p>Implementing all four levers in the framework is challenging, but it can be done. It requires organizations to assess the quality and quantity of impact across each lever; the balance of positive and negative impacts, as well as intentional and unintentional impacts; and the materiality for people and the planet, not just shareholders. Companies assessing themselves can use the following key questions as a guide:</p>
<p><strong>1. What is the quality of the impact, and how much impact does each lever create?</strong> Clearly, more is better, but how much is enough? How can companies and investors benchmark across peer organizations? IMP’s <a href="https://impactfrontiers.org/norms/abc-of-enterprise-impact/">ABC framework</a> offers a useful starting point by distinguishing between efforts that avoid harm, those that benefit particular stakeholder groups, and those that contribute solutions to broader social and environmental problems such as climate change.</p>
<p><strong>2. Are both positive and negative impacts accounted for?</strong> No company will have solely positive impacts. Corporate leaders, as well as investors, need to take negative as well as positive impacts into account to arrive at a net impact assessment.</p>
<p><strong>3. Is double materiality considered?</strong> ESG analysis currently focuses on factors that are material to investors — an approach referred to as <em>single materiality</em>. <em><a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/double-materiality-what-is-it-and-why-does-it-matter/">Double materiality</a></em> is when that analysis also considers business-related factors that are material to society and the environment. From an impact perspective, the rationale for double materiality is clear, but the business community has so far resisted embracing this approach. As markets are increasingly affected by social and environmental factors, however, we anticipate that investors will increasingly take double materiality into account, and thus, so will companies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4. Does the assessment include unintentional as well as intentional impacts?</strong> The history of social policy, international development, and the third sector is littered with examples of unintended consequences arising from well-intentioned actions. Insecticide-treated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/31/global-use-of-mosquito-nets-for-fishing-endangering-humans-and-wildlife">malaria nets inadvertently polluted the ocean</a> when repurposed as fishing tools, for instance, and some crime prevention programs actually <a href="https://www.college.police.uk/research/crime-reduction-toolkit/scared-straight?InterventionID=2">increased people’s likelihood of offending</a>. Businesses entering the arena of creating social and environmental good need to be mindful of the complexities involved in effecting change. Through robust impact analysis, they should consider the degree to which they are accounting for potential unintended consequences and taking steps to mitigate the associated risks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adopting an integrative framework for impact is critical for moving away from assessments that aren’t working in their current form, but it’s only the first step. To move forward, companies and stakeholders alike will need to work their way through all four levers of impact in the framework. Founders and management teams need to consider these levers if they want to optimize their business for social and environmental impact, and socially minded and environmentally conscious employees should use them when choosing where to devote their careers. Ratings agencies need to provide data against these levers so that stakeholders can make informed decisions, and investors will need to broaden their scope to include all these levers when choosing where to deploy capital. Together, these changes will help all of us to realize business’s potential to address the world’s most pressing problems.</p>

<p>Almost 30 years ago, Bob Thomas, then an MIT professor, published a book called <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520087019/what-machines-cant-do"><cite>“What Machines Can’t Do.”</cite></a> He was focused on manufacturing technology and argued that it wasn’t yet ready to take over the factory from humans. While recent developments with artificial intelligence have raised the bar considerably since then for what machines can do, there are still many things that they can’t do yet or at least not do well in highly reliable ways.</p>
<p>AI systems may perform well in the research lab or under highly controlled application settings, but they still needed human help in the types of real-world work settings we researched for a new book, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047241/working-with-ai/"><cite>Working With AI: Real Stories of Human-Machine Collaboration</cite></a>. Human workers were very much in evidence across our 30 case studies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this article, we use those examples to illustrate our list of AI-enabled activities that still require human assistance. These are activities where organizations need to continue to invest in human capital and where practitioners can expect job continuity for the immediate future.</p>
<h3>Current Limitations of AI in the Workplace</h3>
<p>AI continues to gain capabilities over time, so the question of what machines can and can’t do in real-world work settings is a moving target. Perhaps the reader of this article in 2032 will find it quaintly mistaken about AI’s limitations. For the moment, however, it is important not to expect more of AI than it can deliver. Some of the important current limitations are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding context.</strong> AI doesn’t yet understand the broader context in which the business and the task to be performed are taking place. We saw this issue in multiple case studies. It is relevant, for instance, in a “digital life underwriter” job, in which an AI system assesses underwriting risk based on many data elements in an applicant’s medical records but without understanding the situation-specific context. One commonly prescribed drug, for example, reduces nausea for both cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and pregnant women with morning sickness. As of yet, the machine can’t distinguish between these two situations when assessing the life insurance risk associated with this prescription.</p>
<p>We also saw instances where AI systems couldn’t know the context of the relationship between humans. A fundraising application at a university, for example, selects potential donors and composes email messages to them, but it may not know about a recent death in the donor’s family (which might make it an inappropriate time to ask for a donation) or a recent win in the conference sport's championship game (which should perhaps be mentioned in the email). Today, there is no good way to represent broad and nuanced context in either mathematical algorithms or rules, and it seems unlikely that this AI deficiency will change anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>Prioritizing alerts.</strong> Computerized systems, sensors, and AI-based image and sound analysis systems create frequent alerts, whether they involve security, health, or machinery issues. In a case study involving security alerts at a large shopping mall connected to Singapore’s Changi Airport, it was clear that a human role was necessary to filter and prioritize the alerts. In complex and constantly changing settings, AI systems are often unable to distinguish between real and important alerts and false or less important ones. Though the AI surveillance systems are very good at prioritizing the most likely alerts for (human) investigation, the assistance of human security guards and system operators is needed to reliably do so.</p>
<p>A similar process and set of challenges took place at Singapore-based DBS Bank, where AI and humans work closely together to prevent money laundering and other types of fraud in its Transaction Surveillance organization. An older-generation rules-based AI system created alerts on suspicious transactions but with many false positives. Even though a newer-generation machine learning AI system prioritizes them, humans still needed to be involved in investigating the alerts.</p>
<p><strong>Weighing subjective elements.</strong> One of the managers we interviewed at DBS said there would always be a need for humans in the process because “there will always be a subjective element to evaluations of what is and is not suspicious.” They could include a customer’s extended business, personal, or family relationships, or previous contacts with bank personnel. Perhaps at some point, AI will be able to judge an individual’s honesty and trustworthiness through its analysis of facial images and voice patterns — some financial institutions in China already use this approach. We think it’s more effective to employ humans with subjective judgments to augment AI-data-driven, algorithmic assessments, especially when assessments are heavily influenced by cultural, contextual, and subjective factors. Of course, both humans and machines <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/taming-ais-can-should-problem/">may be biased</a> in their judgments, and human biases can sometimes be inadvertently trained into a machine learning system. Having humans check on machine decisions and vice versa can be one way to minimize bias.</p>
<p><strong>Analyzing tone.</strong> The financial software company Intuit introduced a tool for improving the grammar and language for internally generated content of various types. While the AI system could generate many suggestions for how to improve written text, it couldn’t effectively analyze tone. This issue is also found with AI-based social media analytics, which have had a difficult time understanding sarcasm. Even the most capable natural language generation tools sometimes generate content that is offensive to human readers. It seems likely, then, that humans will need to continue to evaluate content to ensure that it is palatable to sensitive human tastes.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding emotional situations and needs.</strong> One AI-human collaboration we observed at Stitch Fix, an online clothing retailer that distinguishes itself by making custom product recommendations, illustrates a key AI shortcoming. An AI system recommends clothing items that customers are likely to buy, but it is unable to take emotional needs related to special occasions into account. Clients are invited to send “request note” comments to their stylists, such as “My husband is returning from being stationed overseas” or “I’m just about to start a new job and need to dress to impress,” and, of course, the AI system doesn’t know what to do with them. Making sense of such comments is one of the reasons why Stitch Fix employs thousands of human stylists to work in partnership with the AI recommendation tool. Understanding emotional situations may be among the last things that AI learns how to do, if it ever does. Humans seem safe in this role for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluating and choosing the very best option.</strong> AI is good at taking an initial stab at a decision, but when that decision is consequential, humans often need to weigh in and make a final judgment. We observed this situation at Morgan Stanley, where a “next best action” system using machine learning identifies personalized investment opportunities for clients and suggests them to the company's financial advisers, who then decide which ones to send to the clients.</p>
<p>The “best option” issue rises to another level when life-or-death questions arise — as in health care situations in which humans and AI work closely to diagnose and treat disease. For instance, the Good Doctor intelligent telemedicine system in China and Southeast Asia uses AI to present triage and treatment recommendations to hundreds of millions of patients. Similarly, we saw a dermatology imaging application where AI helped in capturing and presenting relevant images to the dermatologist. In both cases, however, the physician made the final decision on diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>This modesty of ambition, particularly in medicine, is an important attribute of AI deployment success. While someday AI may be able to make comprehensive and accurate diagnoses and treatment suggestions directly to patients, today its powers are limited.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Framing problems, and then training and coaching.</strong> It is almost miraculous to us that AI can now automatically generate machine learning models, as in the case we researched at the supermarket chain Kroger and its data science subsidiary 84.51°. Automating some data science tasks is an ironic affront to highly intelligent data scientists, and some of the experienced data scientists at 84.51° were initially concerned that they would be moving to a world in which their hard-earned knowledge of algorithms and methods would have no currency. However, the scientists at Kroger were relieved to find that AI can’t frame the problem to be solved in the first place or find data to address that problem. Only humans can identify decisions that need to be made and identify data sets that might shed light on them.</p>
<p>The data scientists at 84.51° also spent considerable time training, coaching, and reviewing the work of less experienced amateurs who use automated machine learning capabilities. We saw similar scenarios at many other companies as well, and we believe the jobs of most data scientists will thus be safe for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Creating new knowledge and transferring it to a system.</strong> We discovered an implementation of AI-assisted augmented reality to be used for employee training at a U.S. manufacturing company called PBC Linear. That case illustrates the need for humans to create new knowledge before it can be transferred to an AI system: Experienced machinists were needed to create training materials that could then be consumed by novices using a learning management system and an augmented-reality headset. The system works well but only because it was created by a human in the first place. AI won’t be able to extract and appropriately organize work-relevant knowledge from experienced human brains anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>Orchestrating physical settings for analysis.</strong> AI can conduct analyses of physical or chemical entities, but that can’t happen without a human to set up the analysis process and situation. We found two examples — an AI-based predictive maintenance application for diesel locomotive oil at Massachusetts’s transit authority (the MBTA) and an AI system for automated visual inspection of disk drive head circuitry at the data storage company Seagate — in which an algorithm was effective in analyzing data and recommending appropriate action. However, neither analysis could happen without humans defining, gathering, and structuring the data; designing and setting up the apparatus; and monitoring whether the process is working appropriately. AI is excellent at solving problems that humans have structured for it, but it doesn’t know where to start by itself.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding complex, integrated entities.</strong> It’s clear that AI can provide useful predictions and insights about complex, interconnected entities. We found that capability in our Singapore Land Transport Authority case, where a government agency monitors and detects anomalies in a complex urban rail transportation network for the city-state. However, the insights were not reliable or accurate enough to eliminate the need for human staff members at the centralized operations monitoring center. As the managers in that case put it, the AI and related systems notify the staff of transit issues, and “this gives us the ability to make informed decisions on how to deal with the problem.” The transit network is too complex to turn it all over to even the best AI.</p>
<p><strong>Exercising discretion about when to use AI.</strong> Even when AI is technically capable of performing a work task, it might not be good at it. We studied the use of Flippy, a hamburger-flipping robot used in several hamburger chains. A franchise manager at one site decided that Flippy was good at frying but was not sufficiently accomplished at flipping burgers to be put to work on that job. We doubt that Flippy was aware of its own shortcomings, and that will generally be true of AI. Only humans, then, can decide whether AI should be used in a particular application.</p>
<p><strong>Considering ethical implications.</strong> Companies are beginning to realize that AI systems can have important implications for organizations, employees, and society. AI can’t consider and address these implications, but humans can. Thus far, the leaders in taking action on ethical issues in the commercial sector are software companies, perhaps because their industry has the most potential ethical problems.</p>
<p>The Salesforce ethical AI practice case we researched provides a good illustration of what humans can do. The members of that group evangelize inside and outside the organization, coach, develop guidelines and tactics to address ethics, and help to identify and implement frameworks and tools to support this effort. These tasks are unlikely to be taken over by AI itself in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>A case involving the use of AI-based gunshot detection technology and patrolling recommendations at the Wilmington Police Department in North Carolina had the potential for problematic ethical issues. Humans at ShotSpotter, the vendor for both of these applications, took many steps to address and mitigate such problems and designed them into their software. For example, for the patrolling recommendations, the system does not use any personally identifiable information for crime forecasting, and no individual citizens are ever identified by the system. Alarms on gunshot detection are sent only to the ShotSpotter command center and are reviewed by human experts to verify true gunshots versus other possible causes. Only after this vetting are alarms sent to the police. Of course, the police have to exercise great care in the way they make use of the data on gunshot detection so as not to inappropriately use it as evidence. This is another dimension of ethical consideration that requires human judgment.</p>
<p><strong>Correcting its own errors.</strong> In a “digital weeder” case that we studied, an AI image analysis system contained within a piece of robotic farm equipment distinguished between weeds and a farmer’s lettuce crops and then automatically cut down the weeds. But a human helper walks behind the weeding system, looking for signs of mechanical or software-based trouble. If something goes wrong, he has virtual access to a team of experts that can help him fix the system. While AI may sometimes be able to provide suggestions for how to fix itself, it seems unlikely that it could do a good job of this for every possible machine problem. Humans are necessary to fix AI systems on occasion, and human fixers will have long-term employment.</p>
<p><strong>Leading organizational change management.</strong> Several of our cases illustrate the need for organizational change if AI systems are going to be used effectively, and using an AI-based organizational change management system itself to perform those types of tasks seems unlikely even under the most optimistic scenarios.</p>
<p>At Southern California Edison, an AI system identified field service tasks done by employees servicing the electrical grid that were safety risks. Long-term education and lobbying were required for the system to be adopted by stakeholders. Similarly, at Morgan Stanley, the company made financial advisers’ use of the “next best action” AI system completely voluntary, and the company stimulated adoption by exercising informal persuasion, removing obstacles to usage, and internally publicizing measures showing that those advisers who used the system had better financial performance. Only humans can convince stakeholders to adopt a new approach, coordinate complex cross-functional change, and understand why humans are resisting the use of a new system.</p>
<p><strong>Providing job satisfaction and nurturing morale.</strong> At Radius Financial Group, a home mortgage company, we observed that employees had high morale and employee job satisfaction despite heavy use of AI and automation and close monitoring of individual performance with data and analytics. People told us that they liked their jobs because of the other people who worked there.</p>
<p>This echoed other comments we heard elsewhere and suggests that it’s the human element of management and collegial relationships that lead to positive emotions about work. A company’s approach to human engagement can counter any “dehumanizing” impacts of AI and other technologies.</p>
<h3>What to Do About AI Limitations and Human Strengths</h3>
<p>The implications of having areas in the work organization in which humans are better than AI — at least thus far — are perhaps obvious. If AI is to make decisions, in most cases it should be possible for humans to override the decisions, as Stitch Fix can with its AI-based clothing recommendations. Organizations may want to monitor the human overrides and assess their frequency and effectiveness. This type of evaluation can help both the system designers and the employees partnering with the AI support tool.</p>
<p></p>
<p>AI experts should spend time with managers and employees and explain what AI can and can’t do. These should be application- and domain-specific discussions since AI’s capabilities are so broad and can be used in so many different ways. The experts and the managers together should, in most cases, ease AI systems into a job task-by-task as opposed to taking any sort of “big bang” approach. It’s also not a bad idea to, as Morgan Stanley did, give employees some say in whether and when they adopt AI capabilities in their jobs, at least in the initial phases of deployment.</p>
<p>All those involved in AI, including developers and potential users and their managers, should understand that AI implementation is a change management activity. They should budget for change management assessments and interventions, and ensure that the necessary change management skills are available on teams. If human jobs are planned to be eliminated by AI, it is probably wise to move slowly in implementing that type of change. Ethical management, of course, also requires that employers are transparent with employees about future job prospects and how AI might affect them so that employees can prepare themselves for value-adding roles to AI or seek employment alternatives. However, we have found large-scale job loss from AI to be quite rare, and we believe most organizations benefit more from human-machine collaboration than from substituting machines for humans.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> and Boston Consulting Group have assembled an international panel of AI experts that includes academics and practitioners to help us gain insights into how responsible artificial intelligence (RAI) is being implemented in organizations worldwide. In our global survey, 70% of respondents acknowledged having had at least one AI system failure to date. This month, we asked our panelists to react to the following provocation on the topic: <em>Mature RAI programs minimize AI system failures.</em> The respondents overwhelmingly supported this thesis, with 85% (17 out of 20) either agreeing or strongly agreeing with it. That said, even among those who agree that mature RAI helps minimize AI system failures, they caution that it is not by itself a silver bullet. Other factors play a role as well, including how “failure” and “mature RAI” are defined, governance standards, and a host of technological, social, and environmental considerations. Below, we share insights from our panelists and draw on our own observations and experience working on RAI initiatives to offer recommendations for organizations seeking to minimize AI system failures through their RAI efforts. </p>

<h3>Putting Maturity and Failure in Context</h3>
<p>For many experts, the extent to which mature RAI programs can minimize AI system failures depends on what we mean by a “mature RAI program” and “failure.” Some failures are straightforward and easy to detect. For example, one of the most visible categories of AI failure involves bias. As Salesforce’s chief ethical and humane use officer Paula Goldman observes, “Some of AI’s greatest failures to date have been the product of bias, whether it’s recruiting tools that favor men over women or facial recognition programs that misidentify people of color. Embedding ethics and inclusion in the design and delivery of AI not only helps to mitigate bias — it also helps to increase the accuracy and relevancy of our models, and to increase their performance in all kinds of situations once deployed.” Mature RAI programs are designed to preempt, detect, and rectify bias and other visible challenges with AI systems. </p>
<p></p>
<p>But as AI systems grow more complex, failures can grow harder to pinpoint and more difficult to address. As Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov, eBay’s chief AI officer, explains, “AI systems are often the product of many different components, inputs, and outputs, resulting in a fragmentation of decision-making across agents. So, when failures occur, it is difficult to ascertain the precise reason and point of failure. A mature responsible AI framework accounts for these challenges by incorporating into the system development life cycle end-to-end tracking and measurement, governance over the role played by each component, and integration into the final decision output, and it provides the enabling capabilities for preventing AI system failures ahead of the technology’s decision-making.”</p>
<p>To tackle more and less visible failures, a mature RAI program should be broad in scale and/or scope, addressing the full life cycle of an AI system and its potential for negative outcomes. As Linda Leopold, head of responsible AI and data at H&M, argues, “For a responsible AI program to be considered mature, it should be both comprehensive and widely adopted across an organization. It has to cover several dimensions of responsibility, including fairness, transparency, accountability, security, privacy, robustness, and human agency. And it has to be implemented on both a strategic (policy) and operational level.” She adds, “If it ticks all these boxes, it should prevent a wide range of potential AI system failures.” Similarly, David Hardoon, chief data and AI officer at UnionBank of the Philippines, explains, “A mature RAI program should cover the breadth of AI in terms of data and modeling for both development and operationalization, thus minimizing potential AI system failures.” </p>
<p>In fact, the most mature RAI programs are embedded in an organization’s culture, leading to better outcomes. As Slawek Kierner, senior vice president of data, platforms, and machine learning at Intuitive, explains, “Mature responsible AI programs work on many levels to increase the robustness of resulting solutions that include AI components. This starts with the influence RAI has on the culture of data science and engineering teams, provides executive oversight and clear accountability for every step of the process, and on the technical side ensures that algorithms as well as data used for training and predictions are audited and monitored for drift or abnormal behavior. All of these steps greatly increase the robustness of the whole AI DevOps process and minimize risks of AI system failures.”</p>
<h3>The Role of Emerging Standards</h3>
<p>Some experts caution that without formal or widely adopted RAI standards, the impact of mature RAI programs on AI system failures is harder to establish. The Responsible AI Institute’s executive director, Ashley Casovan, argues, “In the absence of a globally adopted definition or standard framework for what responsible AI involves, the answer should really be ‘It depends.’” According to Oarabile Mudongo, a researcher at the Center for AI and Digital Policy in Johannesburg, such standards are on their way: “Companies are becoming more involved in shaping AI-related legislation and engaging with regulators at the country level. Regulators are taking notice as well, lobbying for AI regulatory frameworks that include enhanced data safeguards, governance, and accountability mechanisms. Mature RAI programs and regulations based on these standards will not only assure the safe, resilient, and ethical use of AI but also help minimize AI system failure.” </p>
<p>Philip Dawson, head of policy at Armilla AI, cautions that a superficial approach to AI testing across industry has also meant that most AI projects either fail in development or risk contributing to real-world harms after they are released. “To reduce failures,” he notes, “mature RAI programs must take a comprehensive approach to AI testing and validation.” Jaya Kolhatkar, chief data officer at Hulu, agrees that “to run an RAI program correctly, there needs to be a mechanism that catches failures faster and a strong quality assurance program to minimize overall issues.” In sum, standards for AI testing and quality assurance would help organizations evaluate the extent to which RAI programs minimize AI system failures. </p>
<h3>Acknowledging Maturity’s Limitations</h3>
<p>Even with the most mature RAI programs in place, failures can still occur. As Aisha Naseer, director of research at Huawei Technologies (UK), explains, “The maturity level of RAI programs plays a crucial role in contemplating AI system failures; however, there is no guarantee that such calamities will not happen. This is due to multiple potential causes of AI system failures, including environmental constraints and contextual factors.” </p>
<p>Likewise, Boeing’s vice president and chief engineer for sustainability and future mobility, Brian Yutko, notes, “RAI programs may eliminate some types of unintended behaviors from certain learned models, but overall success or failure at automating a function within a system will be determined by other factors.” Steven Vosloo, digital policy specialist in UNICEF’s Office of Global Insight and Policy, similarly argues that RAI programs can reduce but not minimize AI system failures: “Even if developed responsibly and not to do harm, AI systems can still fail. This could be due to limitations in algorithmic models, poorly scoped system goals, or problems with integration with other systems.” In other words, RAI is just one of several potential factors that affect how AI systems function, and sometimes fail, in the real world.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>A mature RAI program goes a long way toward minimizing or at least reducing AI system failures, since a mature RAI program is broad in scale and/or scope and addresses the full life cycle of an AI system, including its design and, critically, its deployment in the real world. Still, the absence of formal or widely adopted RAI standards can make it hard to assess the extent to which an RAI program mitigates such failures. In particular, there is a need for better testing and quality assurance frameworks. But even with the most mature RAI program in place, AI system failures can still happen.  </p>
<p>In sum, organizations hoping that their RAI efforts will help reduce or minimize AI system failures should focus on the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ensure the maturity of your RAI program.</strong> Mature RAI is broad in scale and/or scope, addressing a wide array of substantive areas and spanning wide swaths of the organization. The more mature your program, the likelier it is that your efforts will prevent potential failures and mitigate the effects of any that do occur.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace standards.</strong> RAI standardization, whether through new legislation or industry codes, is a good thing. Embrace these standards, including those around testing and quality assurance, as a way to ensure that your efforts are helping to minimize AI system failures.</li>
<li><strong>Let go of perfection.</strong> Even with the most mature RAI program in place, AI system failures can happen due to other factors. That’s OK. The goal is to minimize AI system failures, not necessarily eliminate them. Turn failures into opportunities to learn and grow.</li>
</ol>

<figure class="article-inline">
<img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022_1005_Oosterhuis-Supply-Chain-1290x860-1.jpg" alt="" /><br />

<p>Leaders are hyper-focused on developing overall supply chain resiliency to better prepare for and quickly respond to an ever-growing number of unpredictable challenges — from sudden global shocks to inflationary pressure to new ESG (environmental, social, and governance) requirements. A critical task for success on this front: building flexibility into the talent base. </p>
<p>Chief supply chain officers (CSCOs) know this; <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-175/Accenture-Resilient-Supply-Chain.pdf">Accenture research</a> shows that 82% of CSCOs believe their organization needs to develop employees with broad-ranging skills, rather than narrow technical competence, so that they can solve complex, cross-industry problems. At the same time, only 38% of surveyed CSCOs say their workforce is mostly or completely ready to leverage their technology tools, and under half (44%) have enough specialists (such as data scientists) in their talent pool. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Staffing the supply chain workforce is a big challenge — in fact, it’s one of the biggest challenges businesses have ever faced. Yet CSCOs may be overlooking or underestimating three essential elements of their talent strategy. This might be because they’re too slammed managing day-to-day crises to think even a few months ahead or because, given the ever-quicker pace of technology evolution, it’s difficult to pinpoint the particular skills they need most.</p>
<p><strong>The rise of cross-supply-chain thinkers.</strong> While deep, specialized skill sets in procurement, operations, manufacturing, and logistics will always be important, companies also need individuals attuned to driving important bigger-picture outcomes like greater resiliency, innovation, enhanced business responsibility, and sustainable cost reduction. Those high-priority areas aren’t easily addressed with siloed functional teams executing a series of transactional activities that rarely ultimately connect. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Meaningful ideas and insightful answers don’t come from an inventory specialist, demand planner, or warehouse manager working in isolation. Rather, they require a setting that recognizes and values creativity and, critically, those individuals who can understand dependencies and influences. Solving problems requires working beyond silos and divisions, including beyond the bounds of the company itself — perhaps even driving strategic ecosystem partnerships to address bigger issues.</p>
<p>One way to build your team’s skills in cross-supply-chain thinking is to implement a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/assignments-are-critical-tools-to-achieve-workplace-gender-equity">system of rotating assignments</a> among the various supply chain departments. Everyone involved will see the bigger picture firsthand; for example, demand planners will have a new perspective on their own role after a three-month stint in logistics, manufacturing, and procurement. This deeper knowledge of connections and interdependencies will not only improve demand planners’ performance in their current role but also help prepare them for the move toward a future network planner role. However, as a lot of companies are wrestling with filling their vacancies, job rotation or shadowing might be a luxury that is not affordable. Another way to stimulate more integrated thinking and enhance end-to-end understanding is to create autonomous teams (pods) with representatives from different departments to tackle topics like innovation or sustainability.    </p>
<p><strong>The use of AI and machine learning to uncover and develop new skills.</strong> Companies across the globe are already using <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/unlocking-the-potential-of-digital-twins-in-supply-chains">new digital technologies in the supply chain</a> to increase resilience and make faster, better business decisions. But they may not realize how effectively these tools can also help ensure that their human workforce has the right skills. An application called <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-159/Accenture-SolutionsAI-Talent-Skilling-2.pdf">Skills.AI</a> uses AI and machine learning to see how the skills currently associated with a particular role might themselves evolve as the role evolves. Our <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-165/Accenture-Supply-Chain-Workforce-of-the-Future-2021.pdf">research</a> shows a far bigger overlap in core skills critical to multiple roles than is immediately apparent. Employees may <em>already</em> have the skills they need for future roles, or similar ones to build on — skills they and their managers may see value in developing. </p>
<p>When people self-report their skills, they tend to have a narrow frame of reference. They typically identify, on average, 11 skills for a particular role. AI and machine learning can help identify hidden skills people don’t readily identify as theirs. Those 11 skills, for example, could more than triple with an assist from AI. Skills-matching data can reveal that people in very different roles actually have more similar skills than they realize; consider, for instance, a 63% skills match between the roles of inventory replenishment manager and e-commerce manager.</p>
<p>Today, individuals are selling themselves short — and their companies are overlooking valuable skills that could quickly translate to new roles. By harnessing AI tools to better identify all the skills a person has, and exactly what they need to move to a new role, a company can quickly create more tailored interventions to close the gap. Targeting reskilling for completely different roles can be accomplished far more quickly and effectively this way than through traditional training approaches. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The need to embrace all types of workers.</strong> As companies broaden their vision of a cross-skilled supply chain workforce, they must engage with every type of talent that contributes to their work. Beyond traditional employees, today’s workforces encompass a larger ecosystem of contractors, gig workers, and more. Companies are also gaining flexibility to adjust how people work — for example, tapping aging front-line workers to share their hard-earned knowledge so that their skills and perspectives carry forward to a new generation. </p>
<p>To engage talent and ensure that your entire workforce shares a deep understanding of the job changes on the horizon, surface and broadcast the new learning opportunities that digitization continues to create. Offering upskilling options and the opportunities to learn on the job, communicating early and often, and supporting your workforce’s ongoing development are three key ways to keep employees — as well as any unions that represent them — informed and engaged.</p>
<p>It may not be possible to solve all of tomorrow’s workforce issues today, but thinking big and acting boldly will take you far. Embracing more advanced technology in the supply chain can position your workforce to set your company apart from the competition. </p>

</figure>
<p>More than 90% of North American CEOs and CFOs believe that improving their corporate culture would boost financial performance.<a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Most of these executives ranked a healthy culture as one of the top three among <em>all</em> factors — including strategy, innovation, brand, patents, and others — in terms of its impact on results. More than 80% also acknowledged that their organization’s culture was not as healthy as it should be. </p>
<p>If leaders view culture as crucial and needing improvement, you might expect them to focus on improving it. Surprisingly, among executives who said their culture wasn’t working as well as it could, nearly all agreed that leadership failed to invest enough time upgrading corporate culture.<a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> Lack of leadership investment was, by far, the most important obstacle to closing the gap between cultural aspirations and current reality.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If corporate culture is critical and needs work, why don’t top leaders do more to improve it? Part of the reason is that many leaders aren’t sure where to start. For many executives “fixing culture” feels like a hopelessly daunting and amorphous undertaking. Which specific aspects of corporate culture should they focus on fixing? What concrete actions can they take? And how can they measure progress over time? </p>
<p>In an earlier study, we analyzed 128 topics that employees discussed in Glassdoor reviews, to identify those that best predicted extremely negative reviews. Our analysis identified five attributes of culture — disrespectful, noninclusive, unethical, cutthroat, and abusive — that rendered a culture toxic in the eyes of employees.<a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p>
<p>Toxic workplaces impose serious and lasting harm on affected employees. Workers who experience the elements of a toxic culture are more likely to suffer from greater stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout.<a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> They are also 35% to 55% more likely to be diagnosed with a serious physical disease.<a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p>
<p>Over time, a toxic culture also takes a heavy toll on organizational performance. For employees with medical benefits, their employer typically pays for health care costs, including those caused by a toxic workplace. When toxic subcultures are allowed to fester within an organization, affected employees are more likely to disengage from their work, bad-mouth their employer on employee review sites like Glassdoor or Indeed, or look for another job.<a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p>
<p>Toxic workplaces are not only costly — they are also common. Our research on large U.S. employers found that approximately 1 in 10 workers experience their workplace culture as toxic, an estimate that is in line with other studies.<a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Even companies with healthy cultures overall typically contain pockets of toxicity, due to abusive managers or dysfunctional social norms among certain teams. </p>
<p>By identifying and addressing these toxic subcultures, a process we refer to as a <em>cultural detox</em>, leaders can dramatically improve employees’ experience and minimize unwanted attrition, disengagement, negative word of mouth, and other costs associated with a toxic workplace.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Drivers of Toxic Culture</h3>
<p>For leaders who want to detox their culture, the next question is where to begin. The biggest obstacle, in practical terms, is not too little guidance but <em>too much</em>. A search for “culture change” in Amazon’s Business & Money section returns more than 10,000 books that offer conflicting advice and approaches.<a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> It’s difficult to know which recommendations to follow because most are grounded in personal anecdotes rather than systematic research. </p>
<p>To find evidence-based insights on culture change, we began with the large body of existing research on unhealthy corporate culture.<a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> We first identified 11 meta-analyses, each of which synthesized existing research on specific elements of toxic culture.<a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> One meta-analysis, for example, aggregated the results of 140 separate studies analyzing the drivers of unethical behavior. </p>
<p>We then looked for common findings across the meta-analyses.<a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> Although they focused on different aspects of toxicity, such as disrespect, unethical behavior, and abusive management, the 11 meta-analyses converged on the same three factors as the most powerful predictors of toxic behavior in the workplace: toxic leadership, toxic social norms, and poor work design. </p>
<p>The figure below shows the average correlation between each driver and the elements of toxic culture. (See “Leadership, Social Norms, and Work Design Drive Toxic Culture.”) When looking at these values, the most important aspect is the relative magnitude of each driver. How leaders behave and the social norms in work groups, for example, are an order of magnitude more important than age or seniority in predicting whether an employee is likely to experience toxic behavior. </p>

<h4>Leadership, Social Norms, and Work Design Drive Toxic Culture</h4>
<p class="caption">A meta-analysis of thousands of studies of corporate culture shows a remarkable level of convergence on the factors that best predict toxic behavior in the workplace. This chart shows the average correlation between each factor and elements of toxic culture across these studies. How leaders behave and the social norms in work groups, for example, are 10 times more highly correlated than an employee’s age or seniority regarding whether they will experience toxic behavior.</p>

</div>
<p>Leadership consistently emerged as the best predictor of toxic culture. The importance of leadership will surprise no one, but it does underscore a fundamental reality: Leaders cannot improve corporate culture unless they are willing to hold themselves and their colleagues accountable for toxic behavior. Our discussion of leadership will focus on both senior executives who set the tone for the organization as a whole, and middle managers and front-line supervisors who create distinctive microcultures within their teams.</p>
<p>Social norms define what behavior is expected and acceptable in day-to-day social interactions.<a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> A company might list “respect” among its core values, but its social norms, such as taking “take the time to learn employees’ names” and “don’t keep colleagues waiting for meetings” translate abstract values into concrete behaviors. Social norms can exist within a specific team or unit and shape its subculture. Alternatively, they can be shared across the organization as a whole and constitute an element of corporate culture.<a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a></p>
<p>Leadership and social norms are densely intertwined. Managers reinforce or undermine norms through their actions, and entrenched social norms influence who is promoted to leadership positions. It is important, however, to recognize that norms and leadership are distinct drivers and not to reflexively blame bad culture on jerk managers. Toxic social norms can take on a life of their own in a team or an organization and persist through multiple changes in leadership.</p>
<p>Along with leadership behavior and social norms, work design is the third area where leaders can focus effort to detox culture. More than a century of research has pinpointed a handful of elements of work design, such as overall workload and conflicting job demands, that consistently predict important outcomes, including toxic behavior.<a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a>  </p>
<p>When it comes to whether employees experience a culture as toxic, most demographic attributes — such as age, tenure with the organization, or educational background — have virtually no effect, with a few crucial exceptions. Women and racial minorities are more likely to experience their employer’s culture as toxic for reasons rooted in discrimination and harassment. (See “Race, Gender, and Toxic Culture.”)</p>

<h4>Race, Gender, and Toxic Culture</h4>
<p>Early studies found little relationship between race or gender and the likelihood that an employee would experience their workplace as toxic. A recent and comprehensive meta-analysis of nearly 400 studies, however, documents that women are more likely to experience toxic culture than men, and most of this difference is driven by mistreatment linked to their gender, specifically sexual discrimination and sexual harassment.<a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a></p>
<p>The same meta-analysis found that racial minorities are also more likely to experience a toxic culture. The gap between racial minorities and White employees was largest in terms of racial discrimination and racial harassment. Historically underrepresented minorities were also more likely to experience bullying and disrespectful behavior in the workplace.</p>

<p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to fixing a toxic culture. The best approach will depend on the individual organization, its strategy, and specific situation.<a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a> In the following sections, we summarize a variety of evidence-based interventions that leaders and companies can implement, organized around these key drivers of toxic culture: leadership (with top leadership and distributed leadership interventions broken out separately), social norms, and work design. (See “Key Drivers for Addressing a Toxic Workplace.”) Leaders can select the approaches best suited to their own context.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Top Leaders Commit to and Sustain Focus on Cultural Detox</h3>
<p>“The only thing of real importance that leaders do is to create and manage culture,” observed Ed Schein, who pioneered the study of corporate culture.<a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17</a> The tight link between leadership and culture is underscored by a survey of North American executives, who identified the CEO as the single most important factor in setting corporate culture.<a id="reflink18" class="reflink" href="#ref18">18</a></p>
<p>Without a commitment from the top team, any organizationwide culture change — including a cultural detox — is destined to fail. Cultural change requires a holistic approach that incorporates multiple interventions and a sustained focus over time.<a id="reflink19" class="reflink" href="#ref19">19</a> Only the top team has access to all the levers of cultural change, including hiring and promotion decisions, budgets for coaching, organizationwide measurement, and the ability to roll out these actions in a coordinated fashion. </p>
<p>A large body of research highlights the powerful effect the top team has on corporate culture. If a company’s CEO has served in the military, for example, it is 70% less likely to engage in corporate fraud compared with similar organizations.<a id="reflink20" class="reflink" href="#ref20">20</a> Unfortunately, toxic management also trickles downward.<a id="reflink21" class="reflink" href="#ref21">21</a> If a senior team tolerates opportunistic behavior, employees are more likely to commit accounting fraud and insider trading.<a id="reflink22" class="reflink" href="#ref22">22</a></p>
<p>Top leadership can use the following evidence-based interventions to effect positive cultural change throughout their organizations. </p>
<p><strong>Quantify the benefits of cultural detox to keep it on the top team’s agenda.</strong> Employees are understandably baffled when the top team fails to address toxicity. In the C-suite, however, dozens of worthwhile objectives vie for the leadership team’s attention.<a id="reflink23" class="reflink" href="#ref23">23</a> Once you layer on external shifts that demand executive attention, including ideological polarization, the pandemic, geopolitical instability, and macroeconomic uncertainty, it’s easier to understand why senior leaders lose focus on cultural change. </p>
<p>In our experience, the vast majority of CEOs are genuinely concerned about their employees and want to do the right thing. They can keep cultural detox on the agenda by explicitly linking cultural improvements to bottom-line benefits, such as lower attrition or employee health care costs. To be clear, leaders should address cultural toxicity because it’s the right thing to do, but quantifying the benefits can help keep culture detox a priority for top teams that are being pulled in many directions.</p>
<p><strong>Publicly report progress to keep the pressure on.</strong> Transparency and external pressure can help senior leaders maintain focus when it comes to detoxing their culture. Top teams can invite external pressure to stay the course by publicly reporting progress against their cultural aspirations (rather than simply posting a list of core values on the corporate website).</p>
<p>Any U.S. employer with more than 100 workers is required to file an annual report with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission listing the race, ethnicity, and gender of employees by job category. These reports are confidential, but companies can voluntarily disclose how well they are doing in terms of diversity. As of September 2021, only 11% of the largest 1,000 U.S. companies disclosed their results or more granular data.<a id="reflink24" class="reflink" href="#ref24">24</a> Large public companies might feel more pressure to report progress in the future as institutional investors push for clarity on how they treat their employees.<a id="reflink25" class="reflink" href="#ref25">25</a></p>
<p><strong>Model the behavior you expect from employees.</strong> Employees look to leaders for guidance on culture, but they tend to discount lofty statements about abstract values. Instead, they closely observe what leaders <em>do</em> for signals about what behavior is encouraged, expected, and tolerated. </p>
<p>Many employees are justifiably skeptical about how well their leaders live corporate values in their daily actions. More than 80% of large U.S. companies have official core values, with integrity, respect, and diversity among the most frequently listed, but there is no correlation between what companies aspire to and how employees assess them on corporate core values.<a id="reflink26" class="reflink" href="#ref26">26</a> When leaders act consistently with core values, however, it is one of the most powerful predictors of how positively employees rate their corporate culture.<a id="reflink27" class="reflink" href="#ref27">27</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Track progress with honest data.</strong> In many organizations, bad news about toxic behaviors gets filtered out as it moves up the hierarchy. As a result, top leaders often think they’ve done a better job addressing toxic culture than they actually have.<a id="reflink28" class="reflink" href="#ref28">28</a> In a survey of 16,000 managers across nearly 500 companies, top executives were 24% more likely to say that they addressed unethical behavior quickly and consistently compared with how well middle managers thought the C-suite dealt with unethical actions.<a id="reflink29" class="reflink" href="#ref29">29</a> Top executives were 48% more likely to believe they dealt effectively with cutthroat managers.</p>
<p>External data from job sites like Glassdoor or Indeed can provide <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/measuring-culture-in-leading-companies/#chapter-3">unvarnished feedback</a> on how well an organization is doing in addressing toxic culture throughout its ranks. The topics employees discuss in online reviews can reliably predict whether a company is likely to commit corporate misconduct or be sued.<a id="reflink30" class="reflink" href="#ref30">30</a> Leaders cannot afford to disregard external employee reviews when trying to assess their corporate culture, warts and all. </p>
<h3>Distributed Leaders Shape Healthy Microcultures</h3>
<p>Senior leaders shape corporate culture through their actions and the example they set. They also influence culture indirectly based on the distributed leaders they hire, retain, and promote. Middle managers and supervisors at every level in the organization can create distinctive microcultures, even when they are subject to the same corporate policies, compensation plans, and other organizationwide practices. </p>
<p>Misconduct among financial advisers illustrates the profound influence distributed leaders have when it comes to creating a toxic subculture.<a id="reflink31" class="reflink" href="#ref31">31</a> A recent study found that middle managers are 2.5 times more important in predicting employee misconduct compared with companywide factors. The relative importance of middle managers was even greater (six times the company-level effect) among managers who were farther away from headquarters and could exercise more discretion with less oversight.<a id="reflink32" class="reflink" href="#ref32">32</a> Empowering managers has many advantages, but autonomy also leaves more scope to create a toxic subculture.</p>
<p>Local leaders are twice as important as company-level policies in terms of whether an employee with a track record of misconduct is promoted or fired. Not dealing with unethical employees comes at a high cost because, for example, financial advisers who have committed misconduct in the past are five times more likely to do so in the future.<a id="reflink33" class="reflink" href="#ref33">33</a> Cumulatively, the personnel decisions made by distributed leaders can have a large impact on overall corporate culture. At USAA Financial Advisors, for example, less than 3% of brokers had committed misconduct, compared with nearly 20% at Oppenheimer & Co.<a id="reflink34" class="reflink" href="#ref34">34</a></p>
<p>Below are some evidence-based interventions to decrease toxic behavior among distributed leaders. These same steps can, of course, also help top teams improve their behavior.  </p>
<p><strong>Coach distributed leaders on nontoxic behavior.</strong> A substantial body of research finds that coaching enhances managers’ attitudes, helps them achieve work goals, and boosts resilience.<a id="reflink35" class="reflink" href="#ref35">35</a> There is less evidence on toxic behavior, but a few studies suggest that coaching may help managers avoid toxic behaviors.</p>
<p>In one study across four hospitals, nursing supervisors were randomly assigned to coaching sessions offering practical tips to treat employees with dignity and respect, demonstrate emotional support, and avoid bullying behavior.<a id="reflink36" class="reflink" href="#ref36">36</a> The researchers measured the impact of the coaching by tracking insomnia among the nurses who reported to the managers. Insomnia is a well-documented and objectively measurable consequence of a toxic workplace. Nurses whose managers had received the coaching had much lower levels of insomnia, and those benefits persisted at least six months after the training ended. </p>
<p>Not all managers, however, respond well to coaching. Some are primarily concerned about presenting a positive public image rather than genuinely treating people better.<a id="reflink37" class="reflink" href="#ref37">37</a> Managers who score higher on measures of psychopathy, for example, are more likely to abuse other people.<a id="reflink38" class="reflink" href="#ref38">38</a> These managers, characterized by aggression and a lack of empathy, are also less likely to modify their behavior even when they understand the pain they cause subordinates. Although the term “psychopath” is bandied about frequently in the business literature, the actual prevalence of such individuals is very low. Approximately 1% of the total population qualify as psychopaths (with a slightly higher percentage among managers), which suggests that the majority of managers struggling with toxic behaviors might benefit from coaching.<a id="reflink39" class="reflink" href="#ref39">39</a></p>
<p><strong>Make distributed leaders aware of the negative impact of their toxic behavior on colleagues.</strong> Organizations can reduce toxic behavior by making managers aware of the pain their behavior causes for their team, along with the impact that abusive behavior has on their own reputation. Two studies analyzed 271 managers across a range of industries and found that managers felt less valued at work after they mistreated a subordinate.<a id="reflink40" class="reflink" href="#ref40">40</a> To regain their feeling of social worth, managers treated team members better afterward to make amends for their earlier abuse. </p>
<p>Initiatives to improve workplace safety show that informing leaders about how their behavior affects subordinates can inspire positive change. Half of the supervisors in a manufacturing factory were randomly assigned to receive two coaching sessions. In each session, the shop supervisors received feedback on how their subordinates perceived the supervisor’s prioritization of safety (relative to other concerns, such as productivity or speed).<a id="reflink41" class="reflink" href="#ref41">41</a> The shop-floor supervisors also received tips and discussed tactics for reinforcing social norms that promoted safety. The teams led by leaders who received coaching reduced unsafe behavior and accidents, while there was no change in the control group.<a id="reflink42" class="reflink" href="#ref42">42</a></p>
<p><strong>Make behavioral expectations crystal clear.</strong> Organizations can also decrease the odds of toxic behavior simply by ensuring that managers are clear about the behavior that is expected of them. Financial advisers must pass an exam (known as the Series 66) to be licensed. Studying for the exam requires a significant time investment, typically at least 50 hours of preparation. Historically, 80% of the questions focused on knowledge of rules and ethical considerations, while the remaining 20% were devoted to technical topics like financial reporting and finance theory.<a id="reflink43" class="reflink" href="#ref43">43</a> Studying for the ethical component of the exam helped potential brokers build a clear understanding of exactly which behaviors were not acceptable. </p>
<p>In 2010, the Series 66 exam reduced the ethics and rules portion to half of all questions. Advisers who passed the exam with more emphasis on ethics were 25% less likely to commit misconduct than colleagues who took the ethics-light version of the exam. The advisers who passed the more ethics-intensive version of the exam were also more likely to quit companies that tolerated financial misconduct, such as Wells Fargo.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Deal with distributed leaders who deliver results but create toxic subcultures.</strong> Top leaders can send a strong signal about their commitment to a healthy culture by dealing with managers who achieve their financial objectives but contribute to a toxic culture. Unfortunately, this is more rare than one might imagine. In a survey of 16,000 managers, only 39% of respondents said that leaders dealt promptly with employees who hit their numbers but cut corners ethically.<a id="reflink44" class="reflink" href="#ref44">44</a> In the same survey, fewer than 1 in 5 managers reported that top executives promptly and consistently addressed leaders who delivered results but failed to collaborate with other teams. </p>
<p>Companies can nip the problem in the bud by not promoting toxic individuals to management positions in the first place. Unfortunately, companies too often make promotion decisions based on performance as an individual contributor rather than on a candidate’s ability to create a healthy subculture. A recent study of sales representatives and managers at 131 companies across multiple industries found that companies were more likely to promote “lone wolves” (who did not share leads or sales credits) to sales management positions, and bypass candidates who collaborated better with their colleagues.<a id="reflink45" class="reflink" href="#ref45">45</a> Promoting uncollaborative employees to management can foster cutthroat subcultures that ultimately hurt the bottom line. Sales teams led by lone wolves booked 30% less sales compared with teams led by more collaborative managers.</p>
<p>Firing abusive managers is another way to address toxic culture, and leaders should not shy away from making that decision when it’s warranted. But we view this as a last rather than first resort for a few reasons. In many cases, managers can be coached to smooth out their rough edges. It’s also important to verify that a manager truly is toxic rather than outspoken, demanding, or gruff. As Robert Sutton argues in his 2007 book <cite>The No Asshole Rule</cite>, it’s critical to exercise caution when labeling someone a jerk.<a id="reflink46" class="reflink" href="#ref46">46</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, it’s critical to guard against implicit biases when dealing with managers who are perceived as toxic. In the financial advising industry, for example, women are less likely to commit financial misconduct than men, and their misconduct is, on average, less serious.<a id="reflink47" class="reflink" href="#ref47">47</a> Women nevertheless are 20% more likely than men to be fired for misconduct and 30% less likely to find a new position after losing their job.</p>
<h3>Establish Healthy Social Norms</h3>
<p>It’s hard to overstate how powerfully social norms shape behavior, as the case of workplace safety illustrates. Although every worker has a strong incentive to avoid personal injury, there were over 2 million workplace injuries in the U.S. in 2020.<a id="reflink48" class="reflink" href="#ref48">48</a> The strongest predictor of on-the-job accidents is social norms around safety, which have a greater impact on workplace injuries than employees’ individual characteristics (such as how conscientious or risk-averse employees are), work pressure, or the riskiness of the job itself.<a id="reflink49" class="reflink" href="#ref49">49</a></p>
<p>Toxic social norms increase the odds that even good people will behave poorly. Less than 8% of financial advisers commit financial fraud.<a id="reflink50" class="reflink" href="#ref50">50</a> If a broker moves to a branch office where colleagues have a history of misconduct, however, they are 37% more likely to commit misconduct in the following three years.<a id="reflink51" class="reflink" href="#ref51">51</a> To give another example, when groups tolerate disrespectful behavior, their rudeness invites retaliation. Reciprocal retaliation hardens into social norms that fuel a downward spiral of continued incivility.<a id="reflink52" class="reflink" href="#ref52">52</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>When it comes to improving toxic norms, the most important thing to remember is that norms act at the group level rather than the individual level. People follow social norms because their colleagues do the same. Any improvement of social norms, therefore, requires a coordinated change in expectations and behavior for the group as a whole, rather than one or two team members making unilateral changes.<a id="reflink53" class="reflink" href="#ref53">53</a>  </p>
<p>The following evidence-based interventions provide concrete guidance on improving toxic norms. </p>
<p><strong>Let work groups define their own social norms.</strong> The best-documented case of changing social norms to improve a toxic culture comes from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the health system that provides medical care to veterans of the U.S. military.<a id="reflink54" class="reflink" href="#ref54">54</a> The Civility, Respect, and Engagement in the Workplace (CREW) intervention was launched in 2005 after a series of internal studies revealed that disrespectful and abusive behaviors were widespread and contributed to increased medical staff stress, employee attrition, and patient dissatisfaction.  </p>
<p>The CREW process takes place in an intact work group (typically 10 to 15 employees) who meet weekly for six months to brainstorm, test, and adopt new social norms to improve respect in the workplace. In the early sessions, teams discuss evidence on how respectful interactions improve outcomes and discuss what respectful interactions look like in their context. (Norms of civility in a rural Southern clinic might vary from those in a large hospital in New York City, for example.) The teams collect initial data on employee and patient perceptions of civility to establish a baseline and measure future progress. Rather than implementing a one-size-fits-all methodology dictated by corporate, each group develops social norms customized to its unique situation — and is thus more likely to adhere to those norms.<a id="reflink55" class="reflink" href="#ref55">55</a></p>
<p>Throughout the course of their weekly meetings, participants brainstorm concrete ideas to improve respectful interactions. Facilitators help keep the discussions on track, but the team members themselves identify the sources of incivility in their work group and take responsibility for developing and incorporating new ways of interacting, tailored to their unique team dynamics.<a id="reflink56" class="reflink" href="#ref56">56</a> Team members track progress over the course of the week, logging acts of civility or disrespect they observe during the week, for example, or calling out colleagues who violate emerging norms. </p>
<p>The initial pilots of the CREW process significantly improved respectful behavior in the VHA work groups, and these benefits persisted over time. As of 2022, the VHA has rolled out the CREW program to over 1,200 work groups.<a id="reflink57" class="reflink" href="#ref57">57</a></p>
<p>CREW has proved to be effective outside the VHA network as well. An experiment in a Canadian hospital system, for instance, found that compared with control teams, groups that implemented CREW achieved significant improvements in respectful behavior, job satisfaction, and trust in management, while employee burnout and absenteeism dropped.<a id="reflink58" class="reflink" href="#ref58">58</a> The CREW model works only when team members voluntarily choose to participate and they have the slack and staffing to participate in the weekly discussions.<a id="reflink59" class="reflink" href="#ref59">59</a></p>
<p><strong>Have distributed leaders lead discussions of social norms.</strong> Leaders at every level in the organization can reduce toxic behavior by explicitly discussing social norms with their teams. Consider, for example, a program to bolster ethical behavior among combat troops in the U.S. Army. In the wake of human rights violations and detainee abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, the U.S. Army administered a survey to assess the state of battlefield ethics among soldiers.<a id="reflink60" class="reflink" href="#ref60">60</a> The results were sobering. Fewer than half of the soldiers said they were willing to report a member of their unit for unethical behavior, 13% said they had damaged a civilian’s property, and 6% admitted to striking noncombatants. </p>
<p>In response, the commanding general in Iraq commissioned a program to improve battlefield ethics. The program was designed to ensure that every soldier participated in at least one highly interactive discussion of the norms of acceptable behavior in combat situations.<a id="reflink61" class="reflink" href="#ref61">61</a> The sessions focused on common battlefield scenarios, including the treatment of noncombatants, rules of engagement, and the reporting of ethical violations.<a id="reflink62" class="reflink" href="#ref62">62</a> Soldiers watched short vignettes of battlefield scenes from movies like <cite>Platoon</cite> and <cite>Black Hawk Down</cite>, discussed them, and then talked through similar situations they faced in Iraq. </p>
<p>The discussions were led not by external consultants but by commanders in the field — signaling that officers from the top brass down considered battlefield ethics important. Each officer led a discussion with their immediate subordinates in a small group setting using the video vignettes as a framework to discuss common ethical dilemmas. After participating in a discussion led by their commanding officer, a subordinate would then lead a similar discussion with their own direct reports. Similar to medical education, which has long relied on the approach of “see one, do one, teach one” to accelerate and solidify learning among interns, this cascading approach allowed combat leaders to consolidate how they would approach ethical dilemmas by discussing it with their commanding officer and then with their subordinates.<a id="reflink63" class="reflink" href="#ref63">63</a></p>
<p>The Army surveyed a random sample of soldiers a few months after the training program and found sharp reductions in unethical behavior. Soldiers reported a 63% reduction in damage to private property and an even larger reduction in the mistreatment of noncombatants. Soldiers also said they were 80% more likely to report a member of their unit for destroying private property. </p>
<p><strong>Collect credible, granular data on subcultures and leaders.</strong> When it comes to toxicity, you cannot manage what you do not measure. Unfortunately, in most organizations, formal reporting procedures do not surface bad behavior. One study of sexual harassment found that only 30% of employees told anyone at their employer about their experience and an even smaller percentage lodged a formal complaint.<a id="reflink64" class="reflink" href="#ref64">64</a></p>
<p>A comprehensive study by one mining company found that less than 8% of employees who experienced bullying, sexual harassment, or racism reported the incidents through formal reporting channels.<a id="reflink65" class="reflink" href="#ref65">65</a> Employees, especially women and minority men in management positions, avoid speaking up because they are afraid of being fired or passed over for promotions in retaliation for surfacing issues.<a id="reflink66" class="reflink" href="#ref66">66</a></p>
<p>Most large organizations collect cultural and leadership data from multiple sources, including engagement surveys, pulse surveys, upward feedback, 360-degree reviews, and exit interviews. They often fail, however, to combine these data sources into a holistic view of leadership and culture throughout the organization. </p>
<p>Leaders need holistic, granular data to identify toxic microcultures, root out abusive leaders, and understand the perspectives of distinctive demographic groups. The principles below summarize what we’ve learned about translating the voices of employees into actionable insights to eliminate toxicity and achieve other cultural objectives.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mine the powerful insights buried in free-text responses.</strong> Most employee surveys include a series of multiple-choice questions, with one or two open-ended questions tacked on as an afterthought. Employees’ free-text responses, however, often provide the most powerful and actionable insights. The choice of which topics an employee mentions surfaces the issues that matter most to <em>them</em> rather than limiting their feedback to the topics covered by the multiple-choice questions. Free-text responses provide rich and nuanced insights on the reasons underlying employees’ numerical ratings. Free-text questions also prevent employees from switching to autopilot. We’ve found that when employees are faced with a long list of multiple-choice questions, nearly three-quarters of them answer virtually every question — regardless of topic — with the same two responses.</li>
<li><strong>Check in on a regular basis.</strong> Short surveys that ask a few open-ended questions are less cumbersome to complete compared to a long list of five-point items. With short, free-text based surveys, organizations can check in with employees on a regular basis without overwhelming them with long surveys.</li>
<li><strong>Benchmark against competitors and peers.</strong> Managers sometimes dismiss toxic behavior as par for the course in their industry, but companies like HEB and Costco have built extremely healthy cultures in industries plagued by toxicity. Benchmarking allows leaders to understand what is possible. Employee review platforms such as Glassdoor or Indeed are valuable resources for understanding how a culture compares with those of industry peers and an aspirational set of benchmark companies.</li>
<li><strong>Measure microcultures at a granular level.</strong> When fielding surveys and opportunities for feedback, it’s important to remember that distinctive pockets of culture can coexist within the organization and diverge widely from one another. Relying solely on corporate culture averages obscures crucial differences across teams.</li>
<li><strong>Measure subcultures created by individual leaders.</strong> A front-line supervisor or middle manager is often the most powerful determinant of toxicity at the team level. By aggregating employee feedback from a manager’s direct and indirect reports, you can build a rich picture of the subculture distributed leaders have built.</li>
<li><strong>Measure leadership traits and capabilities.</strong> The free text of performance reviews or terms employees use in upward feedback often provide important clues about toxic behavior among managers. Even if employees avoid harsh criticisms like “toxic” or “abusive,” their feedback couched in disclaimers (“could appear that you are aggressive”) or watered-down terms (“overly assertive”) collectively provides important clues to potentially toxic behavior. Similarly, if a leader is never described as “supportive” or “inclusive,” whereas such terms are frequently used to describe their peers, you may have uncovered a problem. Combining feedback on individual managers with the subcultures of their teams provides powerful insights on which leadership traits have the biggest impact on culture.</li>
<li><strong>Make it safe for employees to provide useful feedback.</strong> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/fostering-ethical-conduct-through-psychological-safety">Psychological safety</a> is critical to surfacing and rooting out toxic behavior. Employees will not provide candid feedback if they fear that managers can figure out who said what and retaliate for negative comments. Managers must guarantee anonymity and protect employees from retribution.</li>
<li><strong>Take action based on employee feedback.</strong> One of the most common complaints we hear is that management administers survey after survey but never acts on the feedback it receives. If employees are going to take the time and effort to provide their insights, leaders owe it to them to act on the key findings, communicate actions taken, and make progress visible.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Redesign Work to Reduce Stress</h3>
<p>A large body of evidence supports what most of us know instinctively — that high-stress workplaces contribute to negative outcomes, including employee attrition, mental health issues, physical illness, burnout, and increased risk of death.<a id="reflink67" class="reflink" href="#ref67">67</a> Less well known, but equally important, is that stressful jobs are a breeding ground for toxic behavior.<a id="reflink68" class="reflink" href="#ref68">68</a></p>
<p>Regulating emotions and resisting negative impulses require energy.<a id="reflink69" class="reflink" href="#ref69">69</a> Mental stress depletes limited stores of energy, making it harder for people to control their negative impulses. Research has documented that managers who are stressed out and exhausted are more likely to lapse into abusive behavior. The employees on the receiving end of abuse are themselves more likely to exhibit toxic behavior when they, too, are stressed.<a id="reflink70" class="reflink" href="#ref70">70</a></p>
<p>Dozens of factors go into work design, but a few specific aspects are especially important in predicting employee stress.<a id="reflink71" class="reflink" href="#ref71">71</a> When rethinking work design, it’s best to focus on elements of the job known to influence employee stress, such as the following.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce nuisance work.</strong> It might seem that the most obvious way to mitigate occupational stress is to reduce workloads by removing tasks from employees' plates, capping the number of hours they work per week, or providing more resources and staffing without increasing job demands. Not all work, however, has the same effect on stress.</p>
<p>Employees may frame certain elements of a heavy workload, such as expanded job responsibilities or tight deadlines, as a challenge that will help them advance their career or develop new skills. When work is framed as a positive challenge, it is still associated with higher levels of stress but also with increased employee engagement.<a id="reflink72" class="reflink" href="#ref72">72</a></p>
<p>Other elements of the job, such as dealing with red tape, unclear roles and responsibilities, or insufficient resources, are typically viewed as nuisances that provide no tangible benefits to employees. Annoying job demands are more highly correlated with employee stress and burnout than work that employees frame as challenging.<a id="reflink73" class="reflink" href="#ref73">73</a></p>
<p><strong>Clarify job descriptions and responsibilities.</strong> Employees are more likely to find their job stressful and their workplace toxic when their duties are ambiguous, or when their job requires them to balance conflicting demands.<a id="reflink74" class="reflink" href="#ref74">74</a> Leaders can reduce stress by clearly structuring job descriptions and defining roles and responsibilities. One recent study found that team members who work for an abusive boss are less likely to resort to toxic behaviors themselves when they have more structured job descriptions.<a id="reflink75" class="reflink" href="#ref75">75</a> </p>
<p>Although role conflict is a major source of stress, eliminating it is difficult in cases where jobs require employees to manage trade-offs across multiple stakeholders and objectives.<a id="reflink76" class="reflink" href="#ref76">76</a> In these situations, providing employees with more frequent, high-quality feedback on their performance can help them manage conflicting demands with less stress.<a id="reflink77" class="reflink" href="#ref77">77</a></p>
<p><strong>Give employees more control over their work.</strong> In our synthesis of toxic culture meta-analyses, giving employees autonomy over their work was almost as powerful at predicting reductions in toxic behavior as reducing employees’ workloads. Providing employees more control over their work can mitigate the negative impact of unclear or conflicting roles and responsibilities.<a id="reflink78" class="reflink" href="#ref78">78</a> Leaders should not, however, view this as a license to pile ever more tasks on their employees, because empowerment cannot offset extreme levels of work.<a id="reflink79" class="reflink" href="#ref79">79</a> </p>
<p>Allowing remote work may — or may not — increase employee stress and the likelihood of toxic behavior. A few studies conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic provide suggestive evidence that remote work may reduce employee stress.<a id="reflink80" class="reflink" href="#ref80">80</a> The physical demands of a job — including temperature, noise, and ergonomics — are strongly correlated with stress.<a id="reflink81" class="reflink" href="#ref81">81</a> To the extent an employee’s home workspace is more pleasant than their office, working from home might well reduce stress. On the other hand, social support is an important factor in reducing workplace stress, and remote work may increase worker isolation.<a id="reflink82" class="reflink" href="#ref82">82</a> At this stage, the jury is still out about whether, and under what circumstances, remote work reduces employee stress. </p>
<p><strong>Help employees get a good night’s sleep.</strong> A stressful job can cause insomnia, both by leaving fewer hours to sleep and causing stress that results in sleepless nights.<a id="reflink83" class="reflink" href="#ref83">83</a> Sleep-deprived managers are more likely to abuse their subordinates or act in an unethical manner. This can fuel a vicious cycle, because a toxic workplace further interferes with employees’ sleep.<a id="reflink84" class="reflink" href="#ref84">84</a></p>
<p>Fortunately, interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy have proved effective in helping employees improve their sleep.<a id="reflink85" class="reflink" href="#ref85">85</a> Although improving sleep hygiene might not directly reduce workplace stress, it does help employees cope, and can attenuate the link between stress and toxic behavior.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Employees can respond to a toxic workforce through exit (disengaging from their work or quitting the organization), voice (lodging complaints with management or posting negative reviews of their employer), or loyalty (sticking with the employer despite the toxicity).<a id="reflink86" class="reflink" href="#ref86">86</a> Employers that have ignored feedback about toxic behavior — whether widespread or in small pockets — should not be surprised when employees’ loyalty wears thin and they head for the exits.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many leaders bemoaned employee turnover during the Great Resignation. High rates of job switching, however, provide powerful signals that corporate culture is not working for many employees. A tight labor market can also provide a much-needed impetus to address toxicity. Surgical interns complained about 100-hour workweeks for decades, but it wasn’t until applications for surgical internships dropped in the early 2000s that teaching hospitals began to improve working conditions for doctors in training.<a id="reflink87" class="reflink" href="#ref87">87</a></p>
<p>Employees who vote with their feet send a clear signal that they will no longer tolerate disrespect, exclusionary behavior, abuse, and other toxic behaviors. In such situations, organizational leaders face two choices. They can detox their corporate culture or lose the war for talent. We hope this article serves as a useful resource for leaders as they begin to address toxic culture, stop unwanted attrition, and create a healthy work environment that respects the dignity of all employees. </p>
