      <title>Introducing: A Theranos Whistleblower from A Slight Change of Plans</title>
      <description>Sharing a special episode this week from another podcast, A Slight Change of Plans. On the show, host Dr. Maya Shankar and guests help us better understand who we are and who we become in the face of big change.

In this preview, Maya talks to Theranos whistleblower Erika Cheung. Erika’s first job out of college was as a scientist at the now infamous biotech company. Erika realized early on that the company’s proprietary technology was not delivering accurate blood results to patients. And even though she had so much to lose by speaking out, she saw no other option.

      <title>Introducing: Chameleon: Wild Boys</title>
      <description>The latest season of the wildly popular con-themed podcast Chameleon takes place in the summer of 2003 when two half-starved young men turned up in a small Canadian town telling an incredible story. They’d been raised in the British Columbia wilderness, and this was their first-ever contact with society — they’d never seen a TV, gone to school, or registered for IDs. So the community took them in and set about introducing them to the modern world. Before long, the international media descended on the town, enthralled by the mysterious “Bush Boys.” There was just one problem: not a word the boys said was true. Nearly 20 years later, award-winning comedian and journalist Sam Mullins uncovers the bizarre true story of the strangers who turned his hometown upside-down.

      <description>Elizabeth Holmes wowed investors, board members and journalists with live, in-person demonstrations that made it seem like her blood-testing machine worked.
