   <media:description>For simulation to be valuable as a learning tool, it has to closely match our target domain – performing rider-only trips for Waymo One and goods delivery trips for Waymo Via in the real world– in which case, there is only one question that matters. Did the Waymo Driver safely and efficiently complete the trip? 

To answer this question, Waymo created a software solution internally dubbed SimulationCity to add to our industry-leading evaluation tools. SimulationCity automatically synthesizes entire journeys to assess the Waymo Driver's performance – whether it's safely completing a 20-minute Waymo One rider-only trip across San Francisco or efficiently running an 11-hour goods-only Waymo Via trip from Phoenix to Dallas. Come to this talk to learn more!

   <media:description>DataStore is a new and improved data storage solution, replacing SharedPreferences. Built on Kotlin coroutines and Flow, DataStore provides two different implementations: Proto DataStore, that stores typed objects (backed by protocol buffers) and Preferences DataStore, that stores key-value pairs.
In this talk, you’ll see what DataStore offers over SharedPreferences, how to migrate easily and cover the basics of data storage - reading, writing, and error handling.  Finally, we will see how to use it along with Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.

   <media:description>There are so many discussions about web VS native apps. Will we get to the point where the Web becomes truly Native for the majority of the platforms? Progressive Web Apps, Project Fugu, WebAssembly &amp; other technologies actively contribute to moving in this direction. In this session, we go through a list of details that make the integration of an application &amp; operating system seamless, and map it to the APIs available for the web platform. With the knowledge of what's available today and what's coming soon, you are empowered to build truly Native Web Apps to deliver the best user experience!
