						<description><![CDATA[<p>BoF’s editor-in-chief Imran Amed spoke with the founder of degrowth brand Early Majority about the power of energised communities and what the future of token-gated commerce looks like.</p><br><p><strong>Background:</strong></p><br><p>The seed of inspiration for Early Majority has been growing in founder Joy Howard’s mind since her days at Patagonia in the early 2010s. Howard grew to understand the contradiction between fashion’s constant drive to sell more against the industry’s efforts to curb its environmental impact. This sparked the question in her: can a brand focus on selling timeless products rather than an endless array of new collections?</p><br><p>Early Majority sells “layered” outerwear, which it packages in “kits” that include everything from light windbreakers to cold weather puffers.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>BoF’s editor-in-chief Imran Amed spoke with the founder of degrowth brand Early Majority about the power of energised communities and what the future of token-gated commerce looks like.</p><br><p><strong>Background:</strong></p><br><p>The seed of inspiration for Early Majority has been growing in founder Joy Howard’s mind since her days at Patagonia in the early 2010s. Howard grew to understand the contradiction between fashion’s constant drive to sell more against the industry’s efforts to curb its environmental impact. This sparked the question in her: can a brand focus on selling timeless products rather than an endless array of new collections?</p><br><p>Early Majority sells “layered” outerwear, which it packages in “kits” that include everything from light windbreakers to cold weather puffers. It also offers a membership programme, where customers who mint an NFT gain access to lower prices, exclusive products and other benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“[Early Majority is] a different experience than ‘just buy this,’” she said. “These very transactional experiences that we have with brands are not that great for either side in the long-term.”</p><br><p>Since founding Early Majority, Howard has bet on paying members enabling the brand to meet its aim of creating the fewest number of products for the maximum possible number of uses and just as critically engaging a community well versed in the brand.

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The Somali-American model joins Imran Amed to discuss her journey from a refugee camp in Kenya to the US to the top of the fashion industry — and what she’s learned since taking a step back.</em></p><p>Somali-American model Halima Aden nabbed an IMG contract and quickly shot the centre of the fashion world after she earned first attention as the first hijab-wearing Muslim to compete in Minnesota’s Miss USA pageant. She walked for Yeezy, Fenty, Dolce and Gabbana and Tommy Hilfiger, and posed in <em>Vogue</em>, <em>Elle</em> and <em>Allure</em>. Then, in November, she stepped away from it all, announcing her intention to leave the industry. In retrospect, she thinks the best thing she did for herself in her career was never just see herself as a model.&nbsp;</p><p>“I found that some of the most fulfilling campaigns or photoshoots I got to be part of always tended to be when it wasn’t just about me. It wasn’t just Halima,” said Aden. “I was sharing stories that I brought from the refugee camp, sharing stories of other Muslim women in all different fields … I found that my work was more meaningful when it was tied to giving back.”</p><p>Key Insights:</p><ul><li>Aden was born in a refugee camp in Kenya before moving to St. Louis, Mo. Eventually, her family resettled in St. Cloud, Minn, which is home to a large Somali immigrant community.</li><li>She went on to compete in Minnesota’s Miss USA pageant in search of a scholarship. She didn’t win the pageant, but got something arguably even better: A call from Rihanna’s team to shoot for Fenty Beauty.</li><li>Aden’s quick ascent meant she came into the industry at a more privileged vantage point. She didn’t have to go to casting calls and received private dressing rooms. However, that no one else received the same treatment started to bother her.&nbsp;</li><li>The ex-model said her experiences of extreme poverty made her look at the fashion industry’s excess with a bit of disdain, and perhaps, fuelled some of her anger at it.&nbsp;</li><li>After a journey of self-discovery, she’s realised she needs to turn that pain into power as she maps out her future in the industry.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Additional Resources:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/media/halima-aden-plots-her-return-to-fashion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Halima Aden Plots Her Return to Fashion</a></li><li><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/events/luxury/voices-2021-the-fashion-systems-push-to-evolve/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Voices 2021 - The Fashion Systems Push to Evolve</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p><em>To subscribe to the BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <em>this link.</em></a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>BoF’s editor-in-chief and editor-at-large walk through the highlights and unforgettable moments of fashion weeks in Milan and Paris. </p> <p>Background:</p> <p>Fashion’s Spring/Summer 2023 season was jam-packed with debuts, returns and chatter-inducing moments. Alessandro Michele was inspired by his mother and identical twin sister for his “Twinsburg” Gucci presentation which featured 68 pairs of identical twins. Rick Owens drew a dress from a 700 million year-old jellyfish. Dior and Yves Saint Laurent crafted elaborate grotto and fountain backdrops for their collections, while Dries Van Noten staged his Paris comeback in lockstep with Japanese designers including Junya Watanabe, Noir Kei Ninomiya and Jun Takahashi for Undercover — BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks’ favourite of the season. </p> <p>“To me that felt like one of the best commentaries on the pandemic that we've had from fashion — of everything that's passed, everything that's lost, everything that's been lost,” said Blanks. “And then at the same time, the celebration with the fact that he's still there.”</p> <p>Key Insights:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In Milan, four major houses — Ferragamo, Missoni, Etro and Bally — debuted the first collections from new designers, with hopes to replicate the success big names like Tom Ford and Alessando Michele have been able to create for Gucci, said Tim Blanks. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">For Balenciaga, Demna staged a mud-drenched show with battered and bruised, hoodie-clad models that provoked an intense emotional reaction from the crowd, while Nicolas Ghesquière showed an energetic and future-looking collection for Louis Vuitton. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This fashion month, many catered to both in-person and online audiences to varying degrees of success. Valentino, for one, notably struggled with an element of the show just for cameras, another for people outside and an uber-long runway that saw a number of models take their shoes off. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Fashion traditionally provides a sense of escape, said Blanks, but it’s increasingly harder to turn away from the real world. Economies are deteriorating, Russia’s assault on the Ukraine continues and the artist formerly known as Kanye West put a shirt emblazoned with “White Lives Matter,” a phrase deployed by hate groups, on the runway. </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Additional Resources: </p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/reviews/fashion-week/chanel-miu-miu-louis-vuitton-paris-fashion-week-ready-to-wear-spring-summer-2023/"> https://www.businessoffashion.com/reviews/fashion-week/chanel-miu-miu-louis-vuitton-paris-fashion-week-ready-to-wear-spring-summer-2023/</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/reviews/fashion-week/sacai-thom-browne-kanye-west-paris-fashion-week-ready-to-wear-spring-summer-2023/"> https://www.businessoffashion.com/reviews/fashion-week/sacai-thom-browne-kanye-west-paris-fashion-week-ready-to-wear-spring-summer-2023/</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/reviews/fashion-week/junya-wantanbe-noir-comme-des-garcons-paris-fashion-week-ready-to-wear-spring-summer-2023/"> https://www.businessoffashion.com/reviews/fashion-week/junya-wantanbe-noir-comme-des-garcons-paris-fashion-week-ready-to-wear-spring-summer-2023/</a></li> </ul> <p><em>To subscribe to the BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2"> <em>this link.</em></a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>BoF’s founder and editor-in-chief Imran Amed speaks with the BoF 500 cover star about the ups and downs of her personal and professional trajectory and what the West needs to understand about India and its rich, diverse culture.&nbsp;</p><p>Background:</p><p>Deepika Padukone, one of Bollywood’s highest-paid actors, started her career as a former professional badminton player before appearing in her first film, “Om Shanti Om,” in 2007, for which she won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. In 2017, she crossed over to Hollywood with the action film “XXX: Return of Xander Cage.” More recently, she’s become a force in fashion as a global brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton, Adidas, Levi’s and Cartier.</p><p>Padukone grew up far from the limelight and was an outsider to both the film and fashion industries. Setting herself up on the global stage as a young Indian woman, she had to combat preconceptions at every corner, she said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Of course, the hustle is much harder [as an outsider]. You've got to wait much longer for the right opportunities,” she says. “But also, from my perspective, the gratification is so much more.”</p><p>This week on The BoF Podcast, BoF’s founder and editor-in-chief Imran Amed speaks with the actor and BoF 500 cover star about the highs and lows of her career and why India needs more recognition from the West on the global stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Key Insights:</p><ul><li>Padukone said her heritage is fundamental to who she is and how she represents herself on the global stage. “I just feel like India has so much to offer and I’ve been able to do everything that I do, just being Indian and being based out here,” she says. “In a way that feels authentic to me and to who I am.”</li><li>Padukone says Indians are still stereotyped — especially in Hollywood. “You are the scientist. You are the computer geek. You are the taxi driver. You are the therapist. You are the owner of a convenience store,” she says. “I’ve had my fans ask me why I’ve not done more [global] movies. But that’s not what I’m settling for, because I am — and we are — so much more than that.”</li><li>Padukone says fashion brands need to understand more about India’s rich heritage. . “It’s extremely diverse. It’s not one India, it’s many Indias,” she says. “And as Indians, we’re also extremely proud of our history, our culture and our heritage.”</li><li>After being diagnosed with clinical depression, Padukone felt the need to open up conversations about mental illness in India. “No one in India had spoken about it like this before, and it felt to me that there was this huge burden on our country’s shoulders that everyone was dealing with, but dealing with silently,” Padukone says.</li><li>Padukone advises having&nbsp;patience for people who want to achieve their dreams. “I think the one thing that isn’t given enough importance to me is the power of patience,” she says. “Everything is instant gratification, but if there’s one thing that has worked for me it has been to be patient.”</li></ul><p>Additional Resources:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/global-markets/deepika-padukone-launch-bof-500-class-of-2022-fashion-industry-model-muse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Deepika Padukone: The Bollywood Star That Fashion’s Megabrands Are Betting On</a>: With India set to become the world’s third-largest fashion market, Bollywood’s most-popular actress has become a global brand ambassador for the likes of Levi’s, Adidas, Louis Vuitton and now, Cartier.

Held at Venice’s Tempio Votivo, a shrine to the fallen soldiers of the two world wars, Owens centred the show around the sombre themes of “anger and darkness.” Despite this ominous outlook, Owens told BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks in January 2021 that a pivot in political circumstances with the inauguration of Joe Biden gave him a sense of optimism.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>On this week’s episode of the BoF Podcast, we revisit this thought provoking conversation with Owens about his Autumn/Winter 2021 collection, his reflections on lessons learned from the  pandemic and his renewed hope for society. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Key Insights:</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">For Owens, constraints can create fertile ground for creativity. “It has been quiet change and I like the idea of working within small boundaries,” says Owen. “I like the idea of doing the best with what you have got.”</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Owens created his collection when the world was facing  growing political uncertainty and instability but he  says “one of the most reassuring things [in this world] is that everything usually balances out.

Just enough to keep us surviving.”</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"> Owen’s men’s shows in particular are deeply personal. “My men’s runway shows are always about men’s flaws and men’s worst urges because they are auto-biographical,” he says. “When I am thinking about men I am thinking about my own experience and my own experience is very critical and I am always very conscious of my worst urges and where they are coming from.” </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Additional Resources: </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/reviews/fashion-week/rick-owens-control-and-abandon/"> Rick Owens: Control and Abandon</a></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/reviews/fashion-week/tim-blanks-top-fashion-shows-of-all-time-rick-owens-september-26-2013/"> Tim Blanks’ Top Fashion Shows of All-Time: Rick Owens Spring/Summer 2014, September 26, 2013</a></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/what-fashion-wants-from-a-biden-presidency/"> What Fashion Wants From a Biden Presidency</a></li> </ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>In a rare interview, the influential Japanese designer speaks with BoF’s Imran Amed about the philosophy that underpins his boundary-breaking career.</p> <p>Background: </p> <p>After graduating from Keio University with a law degree, Yohji Yamamoto realised he wasn’t interested in the law.</p> <p>“I didn’t want to join the ordinary society,” he says. “So I told my mother after graduation … ‘I want to help you.’” </p> <p>She agreed to let him work at her dressmaking shop in Kabukicho, an entertainment district in Tokyo’s Shinjuku ward, and learn from the sewing assistants if he enrolled at Bunka Fashion College, now famous for training designers such as Kenzo Takada, Junya Watanabe and Yamamoto himself.</p> <p>After graduating, Yamamoto went on to set up a small ready-to-wear company that slowly acquired buyers in all of Japan’s major cities. This success eventually led him to Paris, where his signature tailoring and draping in oversized silhouettes created an aesthetic earthquake at Paris Fashion Week in 1981.</p> <p>Since then, Yamamoto has developed a cult following of loyalists who swear by his avant-garde designs. “I’m not working in the mainstream,” he says. “I’m working in the side stream.”</p> <p>This week on The BoF Podcast, we revisit Imran Amed’s rare interview with the legendary Japanese designer about his storied career — and the mindset designers need to succeed. </p> <p>Key Insights:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Yamamoto says the fashion industry’s increasingly fast-pace has come at the expense of true creativity. “For me the fashion business became a money business,” he said. “I felt I’ve been losing my competitors year by year.”</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Yamamoto believes that modern technology can be a distraction. “When I speak with young designers, I [tell] them shut your computer,” he said. “If you really want to see real things, real beauty, you have to go there by walking.”</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Yamamoto believes it’s a designer’s job to completely immerse themselves in design. “If you want to create something, keep resisting the mediocracy of ordinary things.

Among them, the growth of e-commerce, which has slowed after spiking in 2020, and the growing consumer appetite for curated, in-person shopping experiences that allow them to stumble upon new designers. “That discovery is still so important, and now [shoppers are] relying on a cool third-party retailer to sort of facilitate that discovery,” said Chen.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">“Wholesale is very American,” noted Chen, making it an attractive vehicle for international labels looking to enter the lucrative US market.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Brands are having more of a say over how their products are marketed through retailers, like sharing campaign assets or designing shop-in-shop setups.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Both parties are also increasingly open to exploring other models like concession, consignment — more typical to European department stores — and drop-shipping, where the brands themselves are responsible for fulfilling orders made through retailer’s websites.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Brands are returning to wholesale, but not at the expense of their direct-to-consumer and retail offerings. “I think we're at a point where everybody has a more well-rounded business so that if things do go bad again in whichever channel, they can be agile and adapt very quickly,” said Chen. </li> </ul> <p> </p> Additional resources: <p> </p> <ul> <li><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/farm-rio-global-expansion-contemporary-womenswear/"> How to Take a Brand From Local to Global | BoF</a> </li> <li><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/searching-for-the-next-barneys/"> Searching for the Next Barneys</a> </li> <li><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/luxury/inside-neiman-marcus-post-bankruptcy-playbook/"> Inside Neiman Marcus' Post-Bankruptcy Playbook</a></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-debrief/id1617844496"><em> Follow</em></a> <em>The Debrief wherever you listen to podcasts. </em></p> <p><em>To subscribe to the BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2"> <em>this link.</em></a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

But, when she feels pinched, William is reminded of one of her favourite quotes from Billie Jean King: “pressure is a privilege.” </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Additional Resources: </p> <p> </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/entrepreneurship/serena-williams-the-champions-mindset/?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=ep-notes&utm_campaign=debrief1208"> Serena Williams: The Champion’s Mindset</a> </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/media/serena-williams-style-icon-retiring-from-tennis/?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=ep-notes&utm_campaign=debrief1208"> Serena Williams, Style Icon, Retiring From Tennis</a></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/how-athletes-went-from-selling-merch-to-building-fashion-brands/?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=ep-notes&utm_campaign=debrief1208"> How Athletes Went From Selling Merch to Building Fashion Brands</a></li> </ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>The founder and CEO of retail pop-up marketplace Appear Here shares his entrepreneurial journey and advice for young founders looking to break through. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Background: </p> <p> </p> <p>Ross Bailey’s love of entrepreneurship didn’t start  in business school or a corporate job, but at the hair salon his parents owned in London. </p> <p> </p> <p>“I watched my parents take this little shop and it became their livelihood,” he says to BoF’s founder and editor in chief, Imran Amed, describing himself as a “busybody” who rearranged furniture and conducted customer satisfaction surveys from a young age. “To me, entrepreneurship was a game. It was about ‘how do I get people involved and have a bit of fun?’”</p> <p> </p> <p>That mindset eventually led him to found Appear Here, “the Airbnb of retail,” in 2014. “The story of the world … was that the high street is dead, nobody wants it. And we had a contrarian view on that. When you have small high street stores and streets, people want to be on them … our data has always backed it up.”</p> <p> </p> <p>By 2019, Appear Here was a global business with 250,000 entrepreneurs signed up to the platform and 30,000 stores launched. The company has facilitated pop-ups for fashion giants like Louis Vuitton, Loewe and Supreme, a bookstore for Michelle Obama’s autobiography, as well as Harry’s House for pop superstar Harry Styles. </p> <p> </p> <p>Then the pandemic hit. Appear Here went from having its best year ever and closing a funding round with a nine-figure valuation, to losing 95 percent of revenue with just months’ worth of cash left.</p> <p> </p> <p>On this week’s episode of The BoF Podcast, Bailey shares his lessons and advice from the early days of founding a business and the role leaders play in leading employees and stakeholders through challenging times. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Key Insights: </p> <p> </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The traditional world of commercial real estate and retail is inaccessible and opaque, creating systemic barriers for entrepreneurs from marginalised backgrounds. But small independent stores are also the backbone of entrepreneurship for immigrants and other communities. “Whether it's the local takeaway restaurant, whether it's the local shop, all of those places… were people who were entrepreneurial, who were doing something, who were trying to build a livelihood.”</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Despite Covid’s impact on retail, Bailey doubled down on Appear Here’s mission. Seeing people returning to streets, even when non-essential retail was curbed, and queuing for coffees highlighted the human desire for in-person community. “I just felt that this wasn't the time to pivot, this wasn't the time to relax on our idea or rein it in. Actually, Appear Here would make more sense coming out of this than ever before.” </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The future of retail is hyper-local, says Bailey, citing examples of global brands playing into cultural niches, like Adidas and Gucci’s takeover of a working men’s social club in Peckham. “It's no longer about Fifth Avenue and Regent Street or the Champs-Élysées, it's about neighbourhoods and interesting places.”</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Additional Resources: </p> <p><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/pop-ups-retail-real-estate-disruption/"> How Temporary Pop-Ups Became a Permanent Strategy</a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/what-happens-when-the-e-commerce-boom-ends/"> What Happens When the E-Commerce Boom Ends</a>  </p> <p><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/how-to-open-a-store-in-2022/"> How to Open a Store in 2022 | BoF</a> </p> <p> </p> <p><em>To subscribe to the BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2"> <em>this link.</em></a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>At the BoF Professional Summit, RTFKT’s co-founder explained why he agreed to sell to Nike in 2021, and unpacked how brands can leverage web3 and associated technologies to grow  their communities.</p> <p>“A lot of brands are getting it wrong — they need to stop thinking about their business and ask instead: ‘what can I do for my community?’” said Benoit Pagotto, co-founder of virtual fashion start-up RTFKT Studios. </p> <p>Pagotto added that fashion brands need to invest in incentivising individuals to build an engaged community in the long run. </p> <p>Giving people access to digital assets or tokens such as NFTs, which can increase in value over time, helps customers feel they are contributing to a brand’s growth story, he explained, but adding that brands also need a new mindset.</p> <p>“The word ‘consumer’ is over,” he said, noting how the democratising nature of the web3. “has shifted power to the individual, and now brands’ communities will define their value.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Key Insights: </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Co-founded by Benoit Pagotto at the beginning of the pandemic as a virtual fashion platform, RTFKT was <a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/nike-acquires-virtual-fashion-start-up-rtfkt/#:~:text=The%20company%2C%20which%20specialises%20in,virtual%20sneakers%20produced%20by%20RTFKT."> acquired by Nike</a> in December 2021, marking the sportswear giant’s most significant push into the metaverse. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In late April, the two companies <a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/technology/nike-and-rtfkt-reveal-their-first-virtual-sneakers/"> revealed their first product</a>: a pair of virtual Nike Dunk sneakers, whose look owners can change with different digital skins.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Pagotto believes that building and engaging communities is a long-term endeavour that requires customer incentivisation, rather than social media strategies.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Additional Resources:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/how-brands-are-using-nfts-to-keep-customers-hooked/"> How Brands Are Using NFTs to Keep Customers Hooked</a>: Brands like Adidas, Gucci and The Hundreds are finding the tokens are a great way to reward their superfans.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>At the BoF Professional Summit, RTFKT’s co-founder explained why he agreed to sell to Nike in 2021, and unpacked how brands can leverage web3 and associated technologies to grow  their communities.</p> <p>“A lot of brands are getting it wrong — they need to stop thinking about their business and ask instead: ‘what can I do for my community?’” said Benoit Pagotto, co-founder of virtual fashion start-up RTFKT Studios. </p> <p>Pagotto added that fashion brands need to invest in incentivising individuals to build an engaged community in the long run. </p> <p>Giving people access to digital assets or tokens such as NFTs, which can increase in value over time, helps customers feel they are contributing to a brand’s growth story, he explained, but adding that brands also need a new mindset.</p> <p>“The word ‘consumer’ is over,” he said, noting how the democratising nature of the web3. “has shifted power to the individual, and now brands’ communities will define their value.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Key Insights: </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Co-founded by Benoit Pagotto at the beginning of the pandemic as a virtual fashion platform, RTFKT was <a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/nike-acquires-virtual-fashion-start-up-rtfkt/#:~:text=The%20company%2C%20which%20specialises%20in,virtual%20sneakers%20produced%20by%20RTFKT."> acquired by Nike</a> in December 2021, marking the sportswear giant’s most significant push into the metaverse. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In late April, the two companies <a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/technology/nike-and-rtfkt-reveal-their-first-virtual-sneakers/"> revealed their first product</a>: a pair of virtual Nike Dunk sneakers, whose look owners can change with different digital skins.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Pagotto believes that building and engaging communities is a long-term endeavour that requires customer incentivisation, rather than social media strategies.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Additional Resources:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/how-brands-are-using-nfts-to-keep-customers-hooked/"> How Brands Are Using NFTs to Keep Customers Hooked</a>: Brands like Adidas, Gucci and The Hundreds are finding the tokens are a great way to reward their superfans.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>Designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez speak to BoF’s Lauren Sherman about their journey from one-time fashion wunderkinds to seasoned entrepreneurs, navigating a series of ups and downs.</p> <p>Fresh out of fashion school — armed with approval from then Barneys New York fashion director Julie Gilhart, who bought their Parsons senior thesis collection in 2002, and <em>Vogue</em> editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who helped them stage their first show in 2003 — Proenza Schouler designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez followed early 2000s American fashion’s script for success. They took investment quickly, produced buzzy runway shows and an ‘it’ item in the form of the PS1 bag, and began launching new categories and distribution deals — but struggled to achieve sustained commercial success.</p> <p>“By 2018, the board of directors was quite large and in charge and we weren’t. That’s when, I guess, shit hit the fan,” said Hernandez. </p> <p>So, 15 years after its 2002 launch and on the brink of bankruptcy, McCollough and Hernandez bought Proenza Schouler back from private equity firm Castanea Partners, installed fashion turnaround veteran Kay Hong as chief executive, and positioned the brand for growth in 2020, just before the pandemic hit. It appears their strategy is working: Proenza Schouler broke even in 2021 and is on a path to profitability in 2022. </p> <p>On the latest episode of The BoF Podcast, McCullough and Hernandez join BoF’s chief correspondent Lauren Sherman following her feature, “<a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/luxury/the-nine-lives-of-proenza-schouler/">The Nine Lives of Proenza Schouler</a>,” to chat about their experience so far — and the brand’s next chapter.</p> <p><em>Join</em> <a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&int_campaign=podcast-description"><em>BoF Professional</em></a><em> for the analysis and advice you need. </em><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial"><em>Get 30 days for just $1</em></a><em> or </em><a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial"><em>explore group subscriptions</em></a><em> for your business.</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>The last time Kim Jones showed in his hometown was 2003, the year after he graduated from Central Saint Martins.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>For fashion aficionados of a certain age, the name “Thierry Mugler” throbs with memories of showgirl spectacles cast with extraordinary beauties and weirdos, garbed in looks of an other-worldly glamour. Such was their alien dazzle that there are times in this more prosaic era when I wonder if they ever really happened. Fortunately, there is now ample proof of their existence at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, where <em>Thierry Mugler: Couturissime</em> is on display until April next year. It’s been on a world tour since it first opened in Montreal in 2019, but its homecoming was significant enough that Mugler sat down to talk about it, and everything else, for The BoF Podcast. And, being one of those fashion aficionados of a certain age, I was slightly awestruck.</p><p>Mugler turned his back on fashion at the millennium, reclaiming his first name Manfred and devoting himself to costume design for the likes of Cirque du Soleil. He dressed Beyoncé's 2009 world tour. But the only fashion outfit he has designed in the past two decades was the “wet look” dress Kim Kardashian wore to the Met Gala in 2019. It apparently took eight months to make. Mugler had never seen her TV show, but when she walked into the room — not a word to anyone else, never a smile or a handshake — he said, “It was love at first sight.” He saw her body as that of “the original female, an antique goddess.”</p><p>It’s clear what kind of woman has always attracted and inspired Mugler. In his fashion heyday, it was Iman and Jerry Hall who embodied his very particular aesthetic. “Fashion needs a great animal to wear it,” he told me. He photographed his clothes on those women, draped over the Art Deco eagles on the Chrysler Building in New York, posed against massive Saharan sand dunes and Arctic icebergs. They were dressed like superheroines but Mugler made them small against the monumental backdrops. “It looks like they’ve been dropped from another planet,” he says now. “That was the idea.”</p><p>He claimed he wanted to help people find something strong in themselves that they could bring into their real lives. That’s why he loved photographing the acrobats and circus people he worked with after his fashion life. And, talking to Mugler, I sensed that struck a chord for him too. Metamorphosis was always a theme. The natural world was an obsession. “When you look up close, the gorgeous creatures on our planet are so out of this world.” In his couture, he never used fur, or rare feathers, or exotic skins. “I don’t want to torture animals for that,” Mugler said.</p><br><p>That sensibility made him an outlier in fashion at the time. He was often criticised. Now, it simply looks like his radicalism was ahead of its time. Mugler embraced queer culture, showed men and women in exactly the same clothes, was open to experiment of all kinds. His queer peer Jean Paul Gaultier offered a similarly idiosyncratic humanist vision, couched in the most extreme style fashion could offer. Look back at their work now and I defy you to deny their status as totems of a golden age in fashion.</p><p>Obviously, Manfred and I had a very busy podcast. Reeling out of the exhibition, head spinning with extreme visions of accomplishment (memorably celebrated in a bizarre, funny Iman-Bowie video), I had questions. Hopefully, you’ll find the answers when you listen. But one thing that stood out was Mugler’s obsession with technique. He tracked it back to his early days, when his ambition was to be a ballet dancer. “I learned at the barre how you can do nothing without technique,” he said. And his greatest points of pride related to that: personally, the body he has built for himself; professionally, his perfume Angel, a battle he waged for years with fragrance industry orthodoxy. It’s still a global top-five seller. There is supreme vindication in that, as there is in <em>Couturissime</em>and clothes which will boggle minds for centuries to come.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>In recent decades, the race to attract and retain customers saw dizzying amounts of money spent on clienteling — the industry term for building a 1 on 1 relationship with customers. Today, for major players of scale with the resources to invest in it, successfully digitising personalised in store service, which generates much high conversion rates through recommendations and experience, is being looked to as a key driver of future competitive advantage.</p> <p>Indeed, the luxury service revolution is now rooted in creating a single customer view, enabling businesses to guide an individual consumer to the products and services it offers that match their specific needs. An opportunity that stems from significant shifts in generational attitudes towards data sharing and its use.</p> <p>To discover what this means for the future of the luxury goods industry, BoF spoke with three global authorities to share their insights.</p> <p>Sebastian Siemiatkowski is the CEO and co-founder of Klarna. In 15 years, Siemiatkowski has grown Klarna into one of Europe’s largest financial institutions, which provides alternative payment services to over 90 million shoppers, partnering with over 250,000 retailers globally and its own direct-to-consumer shopping app.</p> <p>“The whole purpose of digitalisation is utilising data to create value. It’s the information that allows us to create richer experiences. If you sit down and have a [...] conversation with a consumer and you say, ‘yes, you are in control of what data is being shared and you have full transparency, and if you then would be willing to share some specific aspects of your data in order to get a better experience, a better price, a better whatever it might be,’ then the answer is always going to be yes.”</p> <p>Holli Rogers is chair of renowned concept store Browns and chief brand officer of its parent company, Farfetch. Rogers quadrupled Browns’ business while CEO between 2015 and 2021. Previously, Rogers held roles at Chanel and Neiman Marcus before joining Net-a-Porter as a founding member in 2002.</p> <p>“In the past as everything has been separate and disparate in terms of the different technologies. When you speak to different businesses everyone talks about, ‘yeah, I’ve got a client telling app. We use WhatsApp.’ But actually if you break it down, none of them are connected one to the other. So you don’t get a single customer view. It’s this idea of how do you pull all of these pieces together in one space, collecting all of these hundreds of data points that allow you to give the customer what they want when they want.”</p> <p>Melissa Morris is the founder and designer of Métier, an independent leather maison best known for its logo-free handbags, travel bags and accessories. Prior to launching Métier in 2017, Morris studied sculpture and business at Emory University before working for Armani, Helmut Lang and Belstaff.</p> <p>“The bespoke aspect of our business is such a great way for us to deepen our relationships with our clients and also get a really clear understanding of what’s missing in the assortment and gives me a clear direction on what to make next. What I’ve found is when I’ve gotten one bespoke request, what’s good for one is good for everyone. So a lot of our bespoke requests that I’ve been brought into the line have turned out to be big successes.”</p> <p><a href="https://follow.series/"><em>Follow the series</em></a> <em>to ensure you never miss an episode and discover actionable insights into the opportunities and challenges a redefined industry will bring and how luxury’s transformation will impact your business.</em></p> <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href="http://bit.ly/BoFnews">Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>For comments, questions, or speaker ideas, please e-mail: podcast@businessoffashion.com.</p> <p>For all sponsorship enquiries, it’s: advertising@businessoffashion.com.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[The fashion system has been broken for some time, said trend forecaster Li Edelkoort at VOICES 2016. But, it can still regain its cultural cachet, and fix its exploitative practices. <p>When trend forecaster Li Edelkoort first published a manifesto called “Anti-Fashion” in 2015, people across the fashion industry told her that her critique had finally put how they felt into words.</p> <p>“Fashion is old-fashioned,” said Edelkoort. But she believes the system can evolve to fit today’s reality and regain the cultural value it has lost over the years.</p> <p>On the latest episode of The BoF Podcast, we revisit Edelkoort’s talk on the BoF VOICES stage in 2016. Her prescient ideas have only become more urgent and applicable in 2021 as the world emerges from a pandemic that forced the industry to further reevaluate its systems, values and place in society.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Fashion’s tendency towards individualism, which sees the industry place near-exclusive focus on the creator, doesn’t fit with today’s society, which is “hungry for consensus and altruism,” said Edelkoort. The problem stems in part from fashion schools, which, for the most part, have not updated their curriculum to reflect the current issues plaguing the industry.</p> </li> <li> <p>The race to the bottom regarding prices is destroying fashion’s cultural value as well as harming garment workers. “How can a product that needs to be sewn, grown, harvested, combed, spun, knitted, cut and stitched, finished, printed, labeled, packaged and transported cost a couple of euros? It’s impossible,” said Edelkoort. As a starting point, she suggested implementing legislation on minimum prices.</p> </li> <li> <p>The retail experience also needs to be reinvented to be more focused and better presented to consumers. Edelkoort points to Dover Street Market, whose curated approach sets it apart from traditional department stores. “Everything we do is from the 20th century.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>In Episode 2 of Transforming Luxury, BoF’s new podcast presented by Klarna, we investigate what will inform the luxury product mix of the future.</p><p>Indeed, the definition of a luxury good has expanded dramatically in recent years to now include a host of disruptive new categories, from the luxury sneakerhead culture that dominated the past decade, to collectibles, curios, NFTs and even some mass produced products capturing attention in the luxury market.</p><p>Evolving consumer sentiment is also increasingly influencing luxury’s manufacturing process. Today, customers demand brands and businesses authentically represent global cultures in a way that serves the communities themselves and not the industry’s shareholders. They also hold brands accountable for the impact of their supply chains and production processes. Yet, workers’ rights was among the worst-performing categories in BoF’s Sustainability Index.</p><p>To discover what this means for the future of the luxury goods industry, BoF assembled four global authorities to share their insight.</p><p>Aaron Levant is an entrepreneur working at the intersection of fashion, culture, events and media. Levant co-founded streetwear and music festival ComplexCon, and streetwear trade show Agenda Today, Levant is CEO of NTWRK, a mobile-first video shopping platform — backed by Drake and LeBron James — that hosts events and exclusive, limited-edition product drops available to purchase immediately within its app.</p><p>“For the last hundred years, luxury was easily defined as European couture — fashion houses who own the luxury space — and now, seemingly newer brands not only create luxury in their own right, but then collaborate with true luxury brands. I think the definition around luxury is ever evolving as for who fits in that category.”</p><p>Zerina Akers is an American fashion stylist and costume designer. She is the founder of the self-funded e-commerce site Black Owned Everything and has worked as Beyoncé Knowles Carter‘s stylist, as well as costume designing the 2020 visual album, Black Is King, for which she won an Emmy in 2021.</p><p>“Generally, many of these companies have benefitted from rap culture and imagery that we’ve created for them. We’ve created so much marketing for these companies and I’m just hoping that there continues to be real, sustainable change for them in the way that they shine light on our community.”</p><p>Bethany Williams is a UK-based menswear designer with a focus on affecting social change. She founded her namesake label in 2017, won the Queen Elizabeth II Award in 2019 and the British Fashion Council and British Vogue Designer Fashion Fund in 2021.</p><p>“For me, luxury is about having a product that you don’t feel guilty owning. Luxury is about beautiful craftsmanship and the slowing down of the manufacturing process, working with artisans and supporting local community projects.”</p><p>Fewocious is the youngest artist ever to be featured by Christie’s — and the first to crash its site. He is one of the most successful and visible members of a growing community of crypto artists finding success in the NFT market, launching a shoe collaboration with design studio RTFKT earlier this year, with more than 600 pairs selling out in seven minutes and netting around $3.1 million.</p><p>“With the NFT space, art can move. You can interact with art. There’s programmable art, you can programme layers so that someone can change how your art looks [...].

						<itunes:subtitle>Noted economist and author Carlota Perez joins BoF’s Imran Amed to discuss the cyclical resets and reorganisations of the capitalist system — and how we can actively harness the information revolution to preserve the earth and benefit all people.</itunes:subtitle>

						<description><![CDATA[<p>The world is in the middle of an information revolution, and it’s a situation, economist Carlota Perez says, we’ve been in before. Capitalism resets every few decades, and follows a familiar pattern: An investment frenzy boosts new technologies that change how people live and interact, but when that craze eventually collapses, it leaves behind social upheaval and resentment.</p><p>To stop that cycle, this time, Perez says on the latest episode of The BoF Podcast, we need to deliberately disassemble society’s most harmful systems and ingrained beliefs so that every country and every person is included in the sustainable future of the earth.</p><p>“We can shape the Information Revolution into a green golden age,” said Perez. She added that the fashion industry has a huge role to play, saying, “It’s up to you to reinvent what we understand by fashion… and it’s up to you to rethink, reinvent, redesign.”</p><p>That reinvention and redesigning means interrogating what wealth, well-being, and pleasure are — and untethering those ideas from physical things. Perez joined Imran Amed last year at <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/events/news-analysis/watch-all-the-talks-from-voices-2020-bofs-annual-gathering-for-big-thinkers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> VOICES</a>, BoF’s annual gathering for big thinkers, to discuss what needs to happen to harness the information revolution to become more sustainable and inclusive.</p><ul><li>Globalisation is happening, but it needs to be reworked to include all people and nations. Until now, globalisation has seen businesses chasing lower costs, and has been concentrated in Asia. “We need to discover what each area of the world, what each country can do, and re-invent, but with consensus — not just with government deciding but working together with business to re-conceptualise each bit of territory, each city,” says Perez.</li><li>Both individual lifestyle changes as well as government action are required to create a greener, more sustainable future — which benefits businesses and the whole of society, not just the one percent. “We need to work together… Every golden age has been a win-win... with the government staging the game,” says Perez.</li><li>The fashion industry needs to stop perpetuating a cycle of waste and instead focus on creating high-quality, long-lasting products that can be reused and redesigned. That requires completely rethinking the clothing industry — a daunting but feasible and necessary task. “If you put your brilliant heads to solving this problem and making money along the way, you will succeed,” concludes Perez. “But you’ve got to recognise the obstacles. If you deny it, you’re going to die, and you can’t die — we need you.”</li></ul><p><em>To learn more about BoF VOICES 2021, to be held from Dec 1-3, 2021, please</em> <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/voices-2021-bofs-annual-gathering-for-big-thinkers-is-back" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>click here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Related Articles:</p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/the-definitive-guide-how-to-build-a-sustainable-fashion-brand" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> The Definitive Guide: How to Build a Sustainable Fashion Brand</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/fashion-sustainability-data-greenwashing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Fashion’s Greenwashing Problem Begins with Bad Data</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/marketing-pr/greenwashing-fashion-sustainability-marketing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> How to Avoid the Greenwashing Trap</a></p><p><em>Join</em> <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&amp;int_campaign=podcast-description" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <em>BoF Professional</em></a> <em>for the analysis and advice you need.</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

If you deny it, you’re going to die, and you can’t die — we need you.”</li></ul><p><em>To learn more about BoF VOICES 2021, to be held from Dec 1-3, 2021, please</em> <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/voices-2021-bofs-annual-gathering-for-big-thinkers-is-back" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>click here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Related Articles:</p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/the-definitive-guide-how-to-build-a-sustainable-fashion-brand" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> The Definitive Guide: How to Build a Sustainable Fashion Brand</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/fashion-sustainability-data-greenwashing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Fashion’s Greenwashing Problem Begins with Bad Data</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/marketing-pr/greenwashing-fashion-sustainability-marketing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> How to Avoid the Greenwashing Trap</a></p><p><em>Join</em> <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&amp;int_campaign=podcast-description" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <em>BoF Professional</em></a> <em>for the analysis and advice you need.</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>American stylist and fashion designer Misa Hylton rose to prominence in the ‘90s for her work with hip-hop and R&B legends such as Lil’ Kim and Mary J. Blige. She played a major role in bridging fashion and hip-hop. But in the past, Hylton didn’t received due credit for her lasting impact on fashion trends — and even contributing to the financial success of select fashion companies — according to BoF columnist Jason Campbell. This week on The BoF Podcast, Campbell is joined by Hylton and Nick Nelson, an adjunct professor at The New School who teaches a course on fashion styling, to discuss Hylton’s life and work, as well as the enduring significance of hip-hop culture in fashion.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Hylton’s family emphasised traditional academic subjects, like science and math, during her childhood. Style was a way for her to channel her more creative side; she changed up to five times a day based on her mood at the moment. “That was the first place that I got to work with image … the energy would change, and I’m like, ‘OK, time to change my clothes — wardrobe change,’” says Hylton.</p> </li> <li> <p>In styling, Hylton ditched the ball gowns to dress her clients in looks that were true to who they were, increasing representation for a group that had been left out of pop-culture conversations. “So many young girls related to it in the inner city and in the hoods. And it was really powerful because of that, because we were now able to see ourselves and see our style in the forefront on TV,” says Hylton.</p> </li> <li> <p>When the looks Hylton styled for the likes of Blige and Lil’ Kim gained popularity, brands quickly followed, replicating them for the mainstream and leaving Hylton, and the other originators out. “I was not ever asked until recently to come into any luxury fashion house and create, or any photo shoot that was in a high end fashion magazine,” she says. “I wasn’t invited to style it, but our style was being emulated.” Nelson adds that “to know the history was behind that ... is incredibly important for this new generation of creators.”</p> </li> </ul> <p><em>Join</em> <a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&int_campaign=podcast-description"> <em>BoF Professional</em></a> <em>for the analysis and advice you need.</em> <a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial"> <em>Get 30 days for just $1</em></a> <em>or</em> <a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial"> <em>explore group subscriptions</em></a> <em>for your business.</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Style was a way for her to channel her more creative side; she changed up to five times a day based on her mood at the moment. “That was the first place that I got to work with image … the energy would change, and I’m like, ‘OK, time to change my clothes — wardrobe change,’” says Hylton.</p> </li> <li> <p>In styling, Hylton ditched the ball gowns to dress her clients in looks that were true to who they were, increasing representation for a group that had been left out of pop-culture conversations. “So many young girls related to it in the inner city and in the hoods. And it was really powerful because of that, because we were now able to see ourselves and see our style in the forefront on TV,” says Hylton.</p> </li> <li> <p>When the looks Hylton styled for the likes of Blige and Lil’ Kim gained popularity, brands quickly followed, replicating them for the mainstream and leaving Hylton, and the other originators out. “I was not ever asked until recently to come into any luxury fashion house and create, or any photo shoot that was in a high end fashion magazine,” she says. “I wasn’t invited to style it, but our style was being emulated.” Nelson adds that “to know the history was behind that ... is incredibly important for this new generation of creators.”</p> </li> </ul> <p><em>Join</em> <a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&int_campaign=podcast-description"> <em>BoF Professional</em></a> <em>for the analysis and advice you need.</em> <a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial"> <em>Get 30 days for just $1</em></a> <em>or</em> <a href= "https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial"> <em>explore group subscriptions</em></a> <em>for your business.</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>A panel of experts discussed strategies for making physical retail a strong service touchpoint that builds brand loyalty.</p> <p>Shopping is evolving. Consumers now experience brands across channels: they may be introduced to a brand on social media, try on its products at a store, and then make a purchase online. Or, they may browse online and then pick-up an item in-person. For retailers, that means a sale can happen anywhere, at any time.</p> <p>This week on The BoF Podcast, our retail correspondent Cathaleen Chen is joined by Adam Levene, founder of digital customer service platform Hero; Elyse Walker, boutique and concept store owner; and Dan Schoening, Nordstrom’s vice president of business strategy and operations to discuss how retailers can service customers in a way that creates a seamless, individualised experience across retail channels.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Beyond conversions, a strong digital strategy can serve as a way to get customers into a store and foster further engagement, according to Levene. “It’s all about giving that customer that comfort, and that desire and reason to actually head into store, having that confidence knowing the item will be there, it’s going to be in their size, and they can be greeted by the stylists they connected with online,” says Levene.</p> </li> <li> <p>Convenience can actually drive business efficiency. Nordstrom links inventory across all markets, so that “customers have access to all that product, way more choice, and way more control around how they get it,” says Schoening. Then, the company provides easy access points for pick-up and returns, which, in turn, allows Nordstrom to get merchandise back into its ecosystem to sell again.</p> </li> <li> <p>Building a lasting relationship with customers is essential to success. To do so, retailers should have store associates focus on building trust with kindness and authenticity. “If you pressure your sales team to hit certain numbers and it’s not authentic and it’s not organic, you might have a good day, but that hurts the long-term potential of your business,” says Walker.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/videos/retail/how-to-build-customer-loyalty'> How to Build Customer Loyalty</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/customer-retention-loyalty-programme-repeat-purchases'> 5 Ways to Boost Customer Loyalty</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/how-to-build-a-one-on-one-relationship-with-your-customer'> How to Build a One-on-One Relationship With Your Customer</a></p> <p><em>Join </em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&int_campaign=podcast-description'><em>BoF Professional</em></a><em> for the analysis and advice you need. </em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial'><em>Get 30 days for just $1</em></a><em> or </em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial'><em>explore group subscriptions</em></a><em> for your business.</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="article-lead">The fashion industry is one of the world’s worst polluters, and this week’s grim report from the UN’s IPCC made clear that change needs to come quickly.</p> <p> </p> <p>This week, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/sustainability/global-warming-will-hit-15-degrees-by-2040-without-drastic-cut-to-greenhouse-gas-emissions-un-ipcc-report-warns'> released a new report</a> from the world’s top climate scientists, warning that global temperatures will rise 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040 and underscoring that human influence is “unequivocally” responsible for global warming since the late 19th century.</p> <p>The fashion industry’s greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be between 4 and 10 percent of the global total. “In the last two years, many of the industry’s biggest brands have taken steps to address emissions within their own supply chains,” says BoF deputy editor Brian Baskin. “It can be hard to tell how effective the industry’s efforts have been and what else needs to be done to address climate change.”</p> <p>On this week’s BoF Podcast, Baskin is joined by Michael Sadowski, a sustainability advisor and former vice president of sustainability at Nike; Laila Petrie, chief executive of sustainability consultancy 2050, which works with the Fashion Pact; and Hannah Phang, head of marketing and advocacy at sustainability consultancy Futerra to unpack fashion’s role in slowing global warming.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Real action on emissions will require collaboration across the industry and cooperation with investors, financial institutions and policymakers. “Fundamentally, this is a problem which no individual company can solve on its own,” says Petrie. “We have all sorts of intractable issues around infrastructure, around incentives, around policy and no one actor can really operate within that system without being affected by it.”</p> </li> <li> <p>The industry often offers carbon offsets as a climate change solution. But according to Sadowski, planting a tree or donating a dollar is not a path to achieving meaningful change. “The focus should be on reducing emissions. That’s what the science says, that’s what the NGOs work in the science-based target initiatives [say] — we must decarbonise all sectors, at a much more ambitious pace,” says Sadowski.</p> </li> <li> <p>A brand’s messaging about sustainability is important, too.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p class="article-lead">The fashion industry is one of the world’s worst polluters, and this week’s grim report from the UN’s IPCC made clear that change needs to come quickly.</p> <p> </p> <p>This week, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/sustainability/global-warming-will-hit-15-degrees-by-2040-without-drastic-cut-to-greenhouse-gas-emissions-un-ipcc-report-warns'> released a new report</a> from the world’s top climate scientists, warning that global temperatures will rise 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040 and underscoring that human influence is “unequivocally” responsible for global warming since the late 19th century.</p> <p>The fashion industry’s greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be between 4 and 10 percent of the global total. “In the last two years, many of the industry’s biggest brands have taken steps to address emissions within their own supply chains,” says BoF deputy editor Brian Baskin. “It can be hard to tell how effective the industry’s efforts have been and what else needs to be done to address climate change.”</p> <p>On this week’s BoF Podcast, Baskin is joined by Michael Sadowski, a sustainability advisor and former vice president of sustainability at Nike; Laila Petrie, chief executive of sustainability consultancy 2050, which works with the Fashion Pact; and Hannah Phang, head of marketing and advocacy at sustainability consultancy Futerra to unpack fashion’s role in slowing global warming.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Real action on emissions will require collaboration across the industry and cooperation with investors, financial institutions and policymakers. “Fundamentally, this is a problem which no individual company can solve on its own,” says Petrie. “We have all sorts of intractable issues around infrastructure, around incentives, around policy and no one actor can really operate within that system without being affected by it.”</p> </li> <li> <p>The industry often offers carbon offsets as a climate change solution. But according to Sadowski, planting a tree or donating a dollar is not a path to achieving meaningful change. “The focus should be on reducing emissions. That’s what the science says, that’s what the NGOs work in the science-based target initiatives [say] — we must decarbonise all sectors, at a much more ambitious pace,” says Sadowski.</p> </li> <li> <p>A brand’s messaging about sustainability is important, too. Providing accessible information on progress — and missteps — goes a long way. Beyond just being honest, “the other thing that consumers are interested in is: how are you helping them be more sustainable? How are you helping them be more climate friendly?” says Phang.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/sustainability/a-crash-course-on-the-bof-sustainability-index'> A Crash Course on The BoF Sustainability Index</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/the-climate-fix-addressing-fashions-emissions-problem'> The Climate Fix: Addressing Fashion’s Emissions Problem</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/the-sustainability-regulations-that-could-reshape-the-fashion-industry'> The Sustainability Regulations That Could Reshape Fashion</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>Join</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&int_campaign=podcast-description'> <em>BoF Professional</em></a> <em>for the analysis and advice you need.</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial'> <em>Get 30 days for just $1</em></a> <em>or</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial'> <em>explore group subscriptions</em></a> <em>for your business.</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="article-lead">Retail futurist Doug Stephens is joined by a panel of experts to tackle the tricky business of collecting, understanding and using data to improve retail.</p>   <p>In retail, data can be a powerful tool to help brands understand their customers and how they engage with products. But just as retail itself has changed dramatically over the past few years, so have a retailer’s most important metrics of success — it’s no longer just about sales. As highlighted in the <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/the-bof-professional-summit-whats-a-store-for'> BoF Professional Summit: What’s a Store For?</a>, it’s not sufficient for retailers to solely measure variables related to purchase — such as sales per square foot, or average footfall. But while there is no shortage of data that retailers can capture (and hundreds of ways to do it), not all data is worth paying attention to. Knowing what data is worth paying attention to can be tricky.</p> <p>“Simply because you can measure something, doesn’t necessarily mean that you should or it doesn’t necessarily make it important,” said Doug Stephens, retail futurist and BoF columnist.</p> <p>This week on the BoF Podcast, Stephens is joined by Brittany Hicks and Jessica Couch of Fayetteville Road, a consulting firm which helps retailers understand niche markets and women of colour, as well as Alexei Agratchev, co-founder and chief executive of in-store analytics firm RetailNext to discuss how retailers should be using retail data.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Retailers have access to an overwhelming amount of information: what percentage of passersby enter a store, how much time those visitors spend inside, what merchandise they interact with and how many times they return to the space, as well as demographic details like age and gender. “The most important thing that stores can do to be great is to constantly invest in tools and processes to listen and respond to their customers,” said Agratchev.</p> </li> <li> <p>Retailers need to be agile and translate the information they gather into actionable strategies for trying out new formats, layouts and sales associate engagement tactics. “It’s not not just a matter of implementing the technology to gather data but potentially using it as a means of experimentation and testing as well,” said Stephens.</p> </li> <li> <p>Couch says retailers also need to dig deeper to understand some of the more complicated attributes about their consumers, like where they come from, what communities they belong to, and what their sentiments are about the brand. “There is a disconnect,” said Couch. “A lot of brands don’t understand how people feel about their products or experience.”</p> </li> </ul> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/the-bof-professional-summit-whats-a-store-for'> The BoF Professional Summit: What’s a Store For?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/briefings/retail/whats-a-store-for'> What’s a Store For?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/luxury/selfridges-andrew-keith-on-post-pandemic-retail'> Selfridges’ Andrew Keith on Post-Pandemic Retail</a></p> <p><em>Join</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&int_campaign=podcast-description'> <em>BoF Professional</em></a> <em>for the analysis and advice you need.</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial'> <em>Get 30 days for just $1</em></a> <em>or</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial'> <em>explore group subscriptions</em></a> <em>for your business.</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

In doing so, the retailer is making fundamental changes to the metrics it uses for success. “We’re not only changing the way people shop, we’re also changing the way we approach business,” says Keith, adding that the company’s focus will shift to more sustainable metrics like longevity of customer lifecycle, balancing margin opportunities, and changing the way it looks at acquisition.</li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>When the Covid-19 crisis struck, Karen Walker —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/karen-walker" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">known for her</a>&nbsp;offbeat designs that have been worn by the likes of Meghan Markle and Michelle Obama, and carried by retailers such as Barneys and Harvey Nichols — found that she was propelled to shift the way she thought about her business, her mission as a designer and her community. Walker’s home country, New Zealand, battled the Covid-19 pandemic with a swift hand — its citizens saw only five weeks of lockdowns before the virus disappeared from within its borders. Despite the relative brevity of the country’s lockdowns, business owners and brands were still faced with the same existential crises and questions as the rest of the world. Now that people within the country have returned to something close to normal life (just without tourists), Walker notes several shifts in attitude: people want to treat themselves, but they also want to support the nation and local businesses that supported them. More generally, consumers have come out of lockdown more interested in buying products aligned with what they stand for.</p><p>On this week’s BoF Podcast, Walker joins Tim Blanks in a conversation about dealing with change, defining desire and life on the other side of the Covid crisis.</p><ul><li>When New Zealand’s prime minister announced the country would go into lockdown in March, Walker had just finalised the next year’s budget. Instead of being able to sit back and do business as usual, she was forced to rethink everything and ask existential questions about her business that would go on to have a lasting impact. “If this goes on for six months or a year, and I really have to fight for this, what am I fighting for? What will my audience miss? What’s at stake? Why should I go into battle for this?” she said.</li><li>After going through what Walker calls nature’s “forced contemplation,” she stopped thinking of herself as primarily a designer, but rather, a retailer who serves the needs of her community. As part of that mindset shift, Walker abandoned the traditional fashion calendar, for one, because she realised it was more in her customer’s interest to do so. Even though she sees the change as good, it was still unsettling. “Change is uncomfortable, alright, even if you know you have to do it — it’s still an uncomfortable place.” Walker said.</li><li>Walker has observed transformations in what consumers think about and look for when shopping. First, they want to know what retailers stand for and how it aligns with what they care about. Second, they want products that are both beautiful and functional. “They want it to be a good product, not necessarily a new product. That speaks to how it’s made, how it’s designed, how it functions, the cost of its making — the unseen costs on people and planet,” said Walker. “Those are very much in people’s minds, and that’s what motivates me too.

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="article-lead">The Milan-based, American designer speaks with Tim Blanks about how he plans to introducing the cult brand’s enduring values to a new global audience.</p> <p>When Lawrence Steele was named creative director at Aspesi in November, it was a home-coming of sorts.

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="article-lead">The Valentino creative director and London menswear designer discuss their process reimagining the Roman brand’s signature rockstud.</p> <p>The Valentino rockstud has become a brand icon. To mark its tenth anniversary, creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli teamed up with British menswear designer Craig Green to create a sneaker adorned with the Valentino symbol. It was a collaboration forged over Zoom during the pandemic, with Piccioli based in Rome and Green in East London. On this week’s episode of The BoF Podcast, editor-at-large Tim Blanks speaks with Piccioli and Green about creative collaboration and reimagining design icons.</p> <ul> <li> <p>When collaborating, designers’ differences can often offer the best source of creative inspiration, says Green. “A collaboration works best when it’s from two separate worlds coming together and seeing what can be born out of that.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Shifting meaning while upholding tradition has been Piccioli’s mantra.  The new sneaker aims to honour Valentino’s heritage and traditions, but also find the power in reinterpreting an established symbol. “I want to use the same objects, the same signs, but I want to give them a different meaning,” says Piccioli.</p> </li> <li> <p>Above all, collaboration is an education. “I think with every collaboration and with every person that you work with, especially working with someone like Pierpaolo, you learn a lot,” says Green. “You kind of inevitably change in the future what you plan to do.”</p> </li> </ul> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/reviews/fashion-week/can-valentino-bring-radicalism-to-its-romanticism'> Can Valentino Bring Radicalism to Its Romanticism?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/reviews/fashion-week/valentino-haute-couture-autumn-winter-2021'> Valentino Delivered the Digital Experience the Industry Has Been Waiting For</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/entrepreneurship/the-bof-podcast-craig-green-says-fashion-can-come-from-anywhere'> The BoF Podcast: Craig Green says, ‘Fashion Can Come From Anywhere’</a></p> <p><em>Join</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&int_campaign=podcast-description'> <em>BoF Professional</em></a> <em>for the analysis and advice you need.</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial'> <em>Get 30 days for just $1</em></a> <em>or</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial'> <em>explore group subscriptions</em></a> <em>for your business.</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>Jane Clay, strategic director at workplace design consultancy Gensler talks to BoF’s Imran Amed about how offices of the future will play a critical role in creating a sense of culture, community and belonging.</p> <p>Almost overnight, the pandemic fundamentally altered the way we work, forcing both employers and employees to embrace the idea of working from home. But now, as vaccination rates rise, offices re-open and employee expectations around flexible working models grow, business leaders everywhere are asking the same question: what’s the role of an office in a post-Covid world?</p> <p>This week on the BoF Podcast, Jane Clay, strategic director at workplace design consultancy Gensler, joins editor-in-chief Imran Amed to discuss why offices are more than just functional workplaces. Office spaces are crucial for young employees to benefit from mentoring and guidance through shadowing their more experienced colleagues. “If you have a lot of people in your organisation who are quite young and may need a lot of mentoring and a lot of looking after, in the sense of their growth and learning, then it might not be such a great idea to not have them around you [in an office],” said Clay.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Clay recommends taking a more holistic view, establishing how shared spaces can creating a sense of culture, community and belonging. “Whether you are in fashion, whether you are in art and design, whether you are in fintech, and actually whether you are legal, I think no matter what arena of work you are in the office will be that totem for culture and connection.”</p> </li> <li> <p>As organisation leaders plan to redesign their office, Clay said sustainability must be factored into decision-making from the start. “There is something in the idea of how do we reposition real estate? Why build something new when you can reposition something old?” she said. “There is a relevance in the old that also has a great story when it comes to sustainability.”</p> </li> <li> <p>While Zoom calls have been democratising during the pandemic, the gradual return to the office in a hybrid working model is likely to create challenges. “While we have all been in our own little boxes [on Zoom calls], we have all had the same experience, but as soon as you start to have some in and some out [of offices] we have to be very mindful,” Clay said. “This means communications and behavioural protocols really have to be looked at.”</p> </li> </ul> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/workplace-talent/how-fashion-brands-are-making-remote-work-permanent'> How Fashion Brands Are Making Remote Work Permanent</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/workplace-talent/camilla-lowther-on-building-a-career-as-a-fashion-creative%5D'> Camilla Lowther on Building a Career as a Fashion Creative</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/selling-office-clothes-to-the-work-from-home-woman'> Selling ‘Office’ Clothes to the Work-From-Home Woman</a></p> <p><em>Join</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&int_campaign=podcast-description'> <em>BoF Professional</em></a> <em>for the analysis and advice you need.</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial'> <em>Get 30 days for just $1</em></a> <em>or</em> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial'> <em>explore group subscriptions</em></a> <em>for your business.</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="article-lead">The designer’s teacher turned close collaborator and friend, reflects on how Elbaz communicated his fashion dreams to the world.</p> <p> </p> <p>Ever since the news of Alber Elbaz’s death broke last weekend, the fashion world has been in a collective state of mourning. Many have eulogised and memorialised the designer’s unique ability to make women feel empowered in the clothes designed. But few knew him better than Shelly Verthime, his close friend and collaborator, who first met him as his teacher at the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design in Israel.</p> <p>This week on The BoF Podcast, editor-in-chief Imran Amed and editor-at-large Tim Blanks speak with Verthime and reflect on Elbaz’s influence, recounting the highs and lows of his career defining moments.</p> <ul> <li> <p>From the beginning of his career, Verthime said Elbaz created a clear path for the steps he wished to take with the industry. “I knew that there was just something so special about him, it was so clear to me where he is going,” she said. “At the time I was his teacher but very, very soon he became my teacher, and then he became [the industry’s] teacher and mentor and friend.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Throughout his career, Elbaz exercised the power of communication as well as creativity.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p class="article-lead">The designer’s teacher turned close collaborator and friend, reflects on how Elbaz communicated his fashion dreams to the world.</p> <p> </p> <p>Ever since the news of Alber Elbaz’s death broke last weekend, the fashion world has been in a collective state of mourning. Many have eulogised and memorialised the designer’s unique ability to make women feel empowered in the clothes designed. But few knew him better than Shelly Verthime, his close friend and collaborator, who first met him as his teacher at the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design in Israel.</p> <p>This week on The BoF Podcast, editor-in-chief Imran Amed and editor-at-large Tim Blanks speak with Verthime and reflect on Elbaz’s influence, recounting the highs and lows of his career defining moments.</p> <ul> <li> <p>From the beginning of his career, Verthime said Elbaz created a clear path for the steps he wished to take with the industry. “I knew that there was just something so special about him, it was so clear to me where he is going,” she said. “At the time I was his teacher but very, very soon he became my teacher, and then he became [the industry’s] teacher and mentor and friend.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Throughout his career, Elbaz exercised the power of communication as well as creativity. Elbaz was an “original creator, emotional creator but he was a fantastic communicator,” Verthime said. “He knew what works and what doesn’t work for him.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Elbaz was known for his efforts to empower women, dressing them suit to their needs and build their confidence. His close relationship to his mother facilitated his understanding of women as multifaceted. “What he wanted to do was that his clothes would enhance the personality, where you see the face… it was about the woman who would wear it,” said Verthime. “He wanted assertive women [and] he wanted women to love themselves.”</p> </li> </ul> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/luxury/lessons-for-the-fashion-industry-from-alber-elbazs-talk-at-voices-2018'> Lessons for the Fashion Industry From Alber Elbaz’s Talk at VOICES 2018</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/luxury/alber-elbaz-on-making-his-return-to-fashion'> Alber Elbaz on Making His Return to Fashion</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/fashion-week/inside-alber-elbazs-return-to-fashion'> Inside Alber Elbaz’s Return to Fashion</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>T</em><em>o subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="article-lead"><em>The late designer shared his musings, wisdom and advice for the fashion industry in a talk at BoF VOICES in 2018.</em></p> <p>Alber Elbaz, who died aged 59 of Covid-19 over the weekend, was a revered and beloved figure in the fashion industry. The designer, famed for revitalising the fortunes of Lanvin before a dispute with his owner led to his abrupt departure, had just returned to fashion after a five-year hiatus.</p> <p>He debuted his new venture, AZ Factory, during Paris Couture Week in January. The joint venture with Richemont was designed to reflect a better model for the fashion system, the pressures and strains of which Elbaz knew all too well.</p> <p>In a heartfelt, funny, thoughtful and poignant address at BoF VOICES in November 2018, Elbaz shared a mix of personal anecdotes, observations and lessons for the fashion industry:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Fashion needs to pare back its unfettered production cycle to a level that’s manageable for young designers straining under the “speed of the system,” he said. Elbaz compared the industry’s constant demand for newness to an old recipe that uses too much fat: “Maybe [it’s time] to cut the butter out and make it healthier.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Creative instinct and improvisation are far more valuable than the tech tools that might be available to designers. “Life is full of codes, formulas, databases and algorithms,” said Elbaz. “Overuse of all of those can kill intuition and intuition is the essence of creation. This is the essence of life itself.”</p> </li> <li> <p>There’s more to fashion creation than just empty aspirational content. Long-time muse and client Meryl Streep “said that I never tried to transform her, but I helped her to be a better version of herself,” said Elbaz. “I believe that’s what fashion does best. It’s dreams, but it’s no longer just dreams. It’s also about solutions. It’s also about solving problems with a dream.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Above all, celebrate your audience. “For years, I felt I was hugging people with my clothes,” he said. “I thought that every dress I make would be hugging the woman who is wearing it. Years later, I received all these hugs back from you fashion people.”</p> </li> </ul> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/fashion-week/inside-alber-elbazs-return-to-fashion'> Inside Alber Elbaz’s Return to Fashion</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/news-analysis/colins-column-inside-mind-alber-elbaz'> Inside the Mind of Alber Elbaz</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/luxury/alber-elbaz-on-making-his-return-to-fashion'> Alber Elbaz on Making His Return to Fashion</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>T</em><em>o subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="article-lead">The pioneering designer spoke to BoF’s Imran Amed about continuing to push the envelope for sustainable luxury at the BoF Professional Summit: Closing Fashion’s Sustainability Gap.</p> <p>British designer Stella McCartney has been an advocate and pioneer for sustainability long before it became an industry buzzword. But she is still developing new ways to work. More recently that’s included experiments with leather-like material made with mycelium — or mushroom root structures — and efforts to use cotton and wool sourced from regenerative farms, which restore the health and biodiversity of the land instead of purely extracting from it.</p> <p>”It’s very simple but today it seems very radical, and really it could be the future of fashion,” she told BoF editor in chief Imran Amed in a keynote address at the BoF Professional Summit: Closing Fashion’s Sustainability Gap. McCartney also shared the compromises she has to make as a designer to work within the parameters of sustainable materials and low-waste production methods and what it will take for the wider industry to wake up to its imperative to change:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Consumer pressure and better regulation will be key for the fashion industry to make changes that are urgently needed. “I don’t think we can rely on our industry to commit to this, as much as we can rely on tomorrow’s customers insisting that this is the only thing they’re going to invest in,” she said. “The only way truly to have significant change in the timeline that we have is for policies to be set into place, for there to be legislation.”</p> </li> <li> <p>When LVMH <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/stella-mccartney-lvmh-acquisition-kering'> took a minority stake</a> in her brand in 2019, McCartney took on a role advising the luxury conglomerate’s CEO Bernard Arnault on sustainability. “The reality with Monsieur Arnault is that he would never have invested in a brand like mine if he didn’t think that this was the future,” she said. “I think it gives off a huge message of positivity for the industry.”</p> </li> <li> <p>For the crop of young designers looking to work sustainably, McCartney has some sage advice: value collaboration and mutual learning over competition; “be a fighter” when it comes to securing better incentives for sustainable practices; and always look for new information on how to be better. “You never stop learning when you work sustainably,” she said.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/stella-mccartney-lvmh-acquisition-kering'> Why LVMH Struck a Deal with Stella McCartney</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/stella-mccartney-announces-un-charter-for-sustainable-fashion'> Stella McCartney Announces UN Charter for Sustainable Fashion</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/sustainability/the-bof-podcast-stella-mccartney-everything-is-at-stake'> The BoF Podcast: Stella McCartney: ‘Everything Is at Stake’</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>T</em><em>o subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="article-lead">A new generation of direct-to-consumer brands like Topicals and Parade are finding success with a powerful community-based approach to marketing.</p> <p>In a fashion and beauty market packed with look-alike labels, a new generation of digitally native direct-to-consumer brands are adopting a new playbook, pushing bolder messages and aesthetics starting with their key differentiator: community. Skincare brand Topicals and lingerie label Parade have turned celebrating their customers’ skin issues and body shapes that don’t conform to traditional ideals of beauty into a powerful and authentic marketing centrepiece.</p> <p>In this episode of the BoF Podcast, Topicals’ co-founders Olamide Olowe and Claudia Teng and Parade’s co-founder and chief executive Cami Téllez speak with BoF senior editorial associate Alexandra Mondalek on the power of community and the new direct-to-consumer model.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The new generation of community-focused DTC brands are abandoning the increasingly standardised marketing playbook that has resulted in a proliferation of identical-looking “blands.” Instead, they’re finding new ways to identify with their customer base.  “We now know that branding is about creatively finding where [the customer] is and centring around reintroducing the customer to self-expression,” Téllez explains.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consumers particularly respond to products that speak to their issues in a way that’s relatable and fun. Digitally native brands have often made the consumer experience “quite sterile and bland and their product experience was lacklustre,” says Topicals’ Olowe. Instead Topicals is  “celebrating the fun of flare ups.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Authenticity is key to building community with the new generation of DTC brands utilising their founders’ stories to speak about their products as customers too. Topicals brings “a different perspective to the way that people experience the beauty community… [and] speaking authentically with our community in a different kind of way,” Teng says.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/videos/marketing-pr/4-ps-digital-marketing-boflive-video'> The New 4 Ps of DTC Marketing</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/marketing-pr/blands-direct-to-consumer-marketing-playbook'> How Not to Be a Boring Direct-to-Consumer Brand</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/videos/retail/boflive-the-new-rules-of-going-dtc'> The New Rules of Going DTC</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>T</em><em>o subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Skincare brand Topicals and lingerie label Parade have turned celebrating their customers’ skin issues and body shapes that don’t conform to traditional ideals of beauty into a powerful and authentic marketing centrepiece.</p> <p>In this episode of the BoF Podcast, Topicals’ co-founders Olamide Olowe and Claudia Teng and Parade’s co-founder and chief executive Cami Téllez speak with BoF senior editorial associate Alexandra Mondalek on the power of community and the new direct-to-consumer model.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The new generation of community-focused DTC brands are abandoning the increasingly standardised marketing playbook that has resulted in a proliferation of identical-looking “blands.” Instead, they’re finding new ways to identify with their customer base.  “We now know that branding is about creatively finding where [the customer] is and centring around reintroducing the customer to self-expression,” Téllez explains.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consumers particularly respond to products that speak to their issues in a way that’s relatable and fun. Digitally native brands have often made the consumer experience “quite sterile and bland and their product experience was lacklustre,” says Topicals’ Olowe. Instead Topicals is  “celebrating the fun of flare ups.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Authenticity is key to building community with the new generation of DTC brands utilising their founders’ stories to speak about their products as customers too. Topicals brings “a different perspective to the way that people experience the beauty community… [and] speaking authentically with our community in a different kind of way,” Teng says.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/videos/marketing-pr/4-ps-digital-marketing-boflive-video'> The New 4 Ps of DTC Marketing</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/marketing-pr/blands-direct-to-consumer-marketing-playbook'> How Not to Be a Boring Direct-to-Consumer Brand</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/videos/retail/boflive-the-new-rules-of-going-dtc'> The New Rules of Going DTC</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>T</em><em>o subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

But a brand, even if small, can still be mighty. The key is focus and finding a relevant niche, Doug Stephens said at VOICES 2020, previewing his new book, Resurrecting Retail, out on April 13.”</p> <p>In the post-pandemic retail era, purpose will be the new positioning,” Stephens said. “What will be your brand’s reason for existing?” he asked.Stephens outlines 10 reasons why retail should exist in 2021 and beyond, from product education to activism.</p> <ul> <li> <p>“I see Covid-19 not as a mere accelerator, I see it as a threshold,” said Stephens. “As a unique wormhole in time where society as a whole is being pulled out of the industrial era and across the threshold of the digital age.” Though 2020 was challenging for a lot of retail companies, it has made the big ones like Amazon, Alibaba, <a href='http://jd.com/'>JD.com</a> and Walmart even stronger and better prepared to capture more of the global retail economy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Brands must think about purpose: what is the question your brand answers? Companies that succeed in the marketplace do this well. “When we buy Nike products, we’re buying a cultural point of view, and Nike answers a very specific consumer question. The question, of course, is ‘Who inspires me?’” Stephens said.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the post-pandemic world, the media will no longer be just the message. “Every form of media now, that the consumer has exposure to, is no longer simply a call out to go to the store,” Stephens said. “Every form of media must be the store.”</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/take-a-look-inside-the-post-pandemic-store'> Take a Look Inside The Post-Pandemic Store</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/the-new-rules-of-brick-and-mortar-retail'> The New Rules of Brick-and-Mortar Retail</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://businessoffashion.arcpublishing.com/composer/edit/3JSWX5Q73VFM5DH5AJB2NORKDY/'> Tapping Into the Future of Physical Retail</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>T</em><em>o subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<em>Billions of people across the world call themselves gamers. And as gaming technology improves and increasingly acts as an extension of the real world, it’s becoming a prime market for fashion brands. BoF's Imran Amed talks to Herman Narula, co-founder and CEO of Improbable to learn more.</em>   Gaming is often synonymous with entertainment. But Herman Narula, co-founder and chief executive of Improbable, a London-based gaming company, says that’s a misconception — games dominate all kinds of culture. Footballers perform dances that happened first on Fortnight, and gamer verbiage like “level up” is now used in human resources initiatives.   Now, Narula says, the multiplayer games people play have become part of their social lives. Gaming is no longer just entertainment, but a space for experiences and learning lessons. Further, with the growth of gaming, Narula predicts we will see the rise of the multiversal self: people will no longer have just one identity, but many distinct selves within the various game worlds they occupy.   On the latest edition of the BoF podcast, BoF’s Imran Amed chats with Narula about how the notion multi-versal self is driving the rise of virtual fashion, and how brands can position themselves to thrive in the space. <ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet"> <li>People who start playing games typically don’t ever stop — even as they shift life stages. “The primary reason people remain engaged and keep playing games, especially online and social games, boils down to three key motivations: a desire to be more competent at something, a need to relate to other people, and a desire to self-express,” Narula said.</li> <li>Games are no longer just something people do to pass the time, and that has consequences related to their real-world significance. “Games are something that the majority of gamers are seeking out doing, and avoiding other activities to go and do, and beginning to contest other forms of spending,” Narula said. “That means that they are where culture is going to be born.”</li> <li>The opportunity for fashion is real. “I think [gaming] will become not merely a place for brands to go, but a place in which brands will be born, a place in which first class cultural ideas will emerge and begin to populate other aspects of how our society works,” Narula said. But, he warned customers will be able to see through superficial engagement with gaming, so brands must find a way to  authentically engage in order to not cheapen the experience of their brand in either realm — the real world or the gaming world.</li> </ul> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/briefings/technology/nfts-for-fashion-fad-or-opportunity'> NFTs for Fashion: Fad or Opportunity?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/what-the-nft-gold-rush-means-for-fashion'> What the NFT Gold Rush Means for Fashion</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/gucci-is-selling-12-virtual-sneakers'> Gucci Is Selling $12 (Virtual) Sneakers</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>T</em><em>o subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

The issues facing Asian people are unique — for one, the term “Asian” represents a diverse group of people often clumped into a monolith that neglects to recognise nuances in culture and history. And racism against Asians often doesn’t culminate in easily-identifiable signs or symbols, sometimes making it difficult to spot from the outside. But, it’s pervasive, and has real, lived consequences.</p> <p>On the latest BoF podcast, BoF’s Imran Amed spoke with designer Phillip Lim, Michelle Lee, the editor in chief of <em>Allure</em> and British journalist Susanna Lau about their experiences being Asian in fashion, examining painful stereotypes and learning on how fashion professionals can be better allies.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Anti-Asian racism is not new, but Lau believes it has become an unavoidable topic in 2021 because of the visceral nature of the images and videos coming from social media. “Everyone has these stories pertaining back to their past but they were sporadic… because they were sporadic you would bury them, and then they would come up again, but you would bury them again. And then the cycle repeats itself,” Lau said.</p> </li> <li> <p>Often, Chinese people are conflated with the growing superpower that is the country of China, ignoring the fact that many Asians live below the poverty line and often face racial bias. “When it comes to public sentiment, I think it boils down to whether or not the mainstream thinks that there is a group that is oppressed,” Lee said. “Ultimately, unfortunately for Asians because of the ‘model minority’ myth, people don’t think that we’re oppressed, and they think that racism against Asians doesn’t exist.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Lim acknowledged that while brands are no longer silent, they need to be thoughtful in speaking out, looking for talent and trying to foster change. “Lend us your microphone, lend us your platform, but don’t speak for us.

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="article-lead"><em>A year after coronavirus lockdowns swept the world, BoF’s Imran Amed looks back at a period of sweeping change in conversation with leading voices from inside and outside fashion.</em></p> <p>Last March, when the Covid-19 virus that had already swept across China was officially declared a global pandemic, few grasped the extent to which the fashion industry stood on the precipice of a paradigm-shifting year, but everyone seemed to understand that this was an opportunity for great change. Amid lockdowns and social distancing measures, stores were forced to close, sales plummeted, and shocks were felt across the supply chain as garment factories were shut down around the world. Across societies, stark economic inequalities were laid bare and exacerbated by the crisis. Millions of people across all industries and professions lost their jobs; millions more lost their lives.</p> <p>From virtual fashion weeks to the booms in e-commerce and sweatpants, the fashion industry learned how to adapt to the “new normal” — and fast. Many saw an opportunity to reset a broken fashion system and build a more sustainable, inclusive way of operating. But the last year has also underscored deeper failings within the industry. While the pandemic has underscored broad social inequalities, fashion has had to grapple with its role in perpetuating racism and elitism — from boardrooms to magazine pages and contributing to a looming climate crisis.</p> <p>In this week’s episode of The BoF Podcast, we reflect on the events of the year gone by, a period of sweeping change, uncertainty and hope in conversations with leading voices from inside and outside the industry.</p> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/luxury/how-covid-19-is-catalysing-a-new-era-of-luxury'> How Covid-19 Is Catalysing a New Era of Luxury</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/the-state-of-fashion-2021-reality-check'> The State of Fashion 2021: Reality Check</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>To subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>The Black model and entrepreneur speaks with BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks about paving the way for a more inclusive fashion industry — and the work that remains to be done.</p> <p> </p> <p>Iman stands out as a trailblazer in the fashion industry. She was one of the first Black models to star on the catwalk and followed her modelling career with a successful cosmetics business designed for women of colour. While she helped pave the way for more representation, she also experienced first hand the racism and discrimination that persists within the industry today.</p> <p>In the latest episode of the BoF Podcast, Iman speaks with BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks about her experiences and the work that still needs to be done to address the problem.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The supermodel credits her mother’s empowering vision of self-worth for enabling her to navigate a tricky industry. “[Self-worth] is what [my mother] heavily instilled in me to be able to walk away from anything that doesn’t serve you well regardless [of] how enticing it is,” she said. “Whether it’s a man or work or whatever it is … I would always make the right decision for myself if I had a sense of self-worth.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Iman has achieved stellar success and helped pave the way for greater representation throughout the industry, but throughout her career, she’s had to work harder than her peers to secure her place. “Most of the time makeup artists had no clue how to do our makeup,” says Iman. “Forget about hair, that is why most of the pictures you will see [Black women’s] hair is just pulled back because [stylists] didn’t know what to do with it.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Iman remains actively involved in efforts to tackle racism in the industry through The Black Girls Coalition, a pressure group she co-founded with close friend Bethann Hardison to highlight the lack of representation in the fashion industry. “It’s a learning experience because you just have to manoeuvre and find your place in this system [as a Black woman and model.]”</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/secrets-of-the-supermodel-trade'> Secrets of the Supermodel Trade</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/workplace-talent/the-bof-podcast-tackling-systemic-racism-in-the-fashion-industry'> The BoF Podcast: Tackling Systemic Racism in the Fashion Industry</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/news-analysis/op-ed-racism-on-the-runway'> Op-Ed | Racial Diversity on the Runway</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>To subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

While she helped pave the way for more representation, she also experienced first hand the racism and discrimination that persists within the industry today.</p> <p>In the latest episode of the BoF Podcast, Iman speaks with BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks about her experiences and the work that still needs to be done to address the problem.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The supermodel credits her mother’s empowering vision of self-worth for enabling her to navigate a tricky industry. “[Self-worth] is what [my mother] heavily instilled in me to be able to walk away from anything that doesn’t serve you well regardless [of] how enticing it is,” she said. “Whether it’s a man or work or whatever it is … I would always make the right decision for myself if I had a sense of self-worth.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Iman has achieved stellar success and helped pave the way for greater representation throughout the industry, but throughout her career, she’s had to work harder than her peers to secure her place. “Most of the time makeup artists had no clue how to do our makeup,” says Iman. “Forget about hair, that is why most of the pictures you will see [Black women’s] hair is just pulled back because [stylists] didn’t know what to do with it.”</p> </li> <li> <p>Iman remains actively involved in efforts to tackle racism in the industry through The Black Girls Coalition, a pressure group she co-founded with close friend Bethann Hardison to highlight the lack of representation in the fashion industry. “It’s a learning experience because you just have to manoeuvre and find your place in this system [as a Black woman and model.]”</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/secrets-of-the-supermodel-trade'> Secrets of the Supermodel Trade</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/workplace-talent/the-bof-podcast-tackling-systemic-racism-in-the-fashion-industry'> The BoF Podcast: Tackling Systemic Racism in the Fashion Industry</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/news-analysis/op-ed-racism-on-the-runway'> Op-Ed | Racial Diversity on the Runway</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>To subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex — also known as Harry and Meghan — rocked the world when they revealed intimate details about their experiences in the British royal family and their decision to step back as ‘senior members’ in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. What they revealed in the interview has left not just the UK and the Commonwealth reeling, but challenged the entire world’s perception of the monarchy. BoF’s Imran Amed sat down with Elizabeth Holmes, a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, notable ‘royal watcher’ and style expert to contextualise the conversation with Winfrey and what it means for the future of royal fashion.</p> <p>”When Princess Diana left the Royal Family, she made it very clear she did not need fashion in the same way, because she was able to use her own voice… And I think Meghan — now in her move to California — definitely doesn’t need it either,” Holmes said. “She will still continue to use it and promote brands that she believes in and has connections to, but when you can use your voice, you’re not relying on your fashion to talk for you.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/marketing-pr/have-we-reached-peak-royalty'> Have We Reached Peak Royalty?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/monetising-meghan-markle'> Monetising Meghan Markle</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/media/could-meghan-markle-cash-in-on-her-powerful-influencer-status'> Could Meghan Markle Cash In on Her Powerful Influencer Status?</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>External clips courtesy of Today, India Today, Sky News Australia, CPAC, Good Morning Britain, Harpo Productions/CBS, and CTV News.</em></p> <p> </p> <p><em>To subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>Vestiaire Collective’s chief executive Max Bittner opens up about the resale platform’s big deal with the French luxury group.</p> <p> </p> <p>This week, a new €178 million round of financing put Vestiaire Collective’s valuation above $1 billion and gave it a high-profile new partner in the form of Kering, one of the world’s leading luxury groups. Having acquired a 5 percent stake in the Paris-based resale company, Kering joined investors like Condé Nast, French private equity firm Eurazeo and tech-focused investment firm Tiger Global Management.</p> <p>Though resale has become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks to the growth of platforms like Vestiaire Collective, luxury brands have been reticent to get involved.

Having acquired a 5 percent stake in the Paris-based resale company, Kering joined investors like Condé Nast, French private equity firm Eurazeo and tech-focused investment firm Tiger Global Management.</p> <p>Though resale has become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks to the growth of platforms like Vestiaire Collective, luxury brands have been reticent to get involved.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>The designer speaks with BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks about his latest collection, making change and the importance of elevating the next generation of fashion creatives.</p> <p> </p> <p>When Virgil Abloh first broke into fashion he remembers feeling like a tourist. The designer began his career in architecture and says he struggled to find his place in an industry of insiders. But after three years at the helm of Louis Vuitton’s menswear division, the Off-White founder is now very much part of the establishment. In the latest episode of the BoF Podcast, Abloh speaks with BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks about his hopes of paving the way to a more democratic and inclusive industry for the younger generation and why he’s launched a TV station.</p> <p>The designer is increasingly focused on lifting up the next generation of young designers, conscious of his responsibility to open up the industry. Last year, he raised $1 million to launch the “Post-Modern” Scholarship Fund for Black students.</p> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/reviews/fashion-week/virgil-abloh-you-have-to-choose-your-message-wisely'> Virgil Abloh: ‘You Have to Choose Your Message Wisely’</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/luxury/whats-off-white-without-virgil'> What’s Off-White Without Virgil?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/luxury/virgil-abloh-i-am-not-a-designer'> Virgil Abloh: ‘I Am Not a Designer’</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>To subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p> <p> </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

But after three years at the helm of Louis Vuitton’s menswear division, the Off-White founder is now very much part of the establishment. In the latest episode of the BoF Podcast, Abloh speaks with BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks about his hopes of paving the way to a more democratic and inclusive industry for the younger generation and why he’s launched a TV station.</p> <p>The designer is increasingly focused on lifting up the next generation of young designers, conscious of his responsibility to open up the industry.

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>This week, Doug Stephens speaks with Kalkidan Legesse and Robert Hoppenheim about the imperative for fashion to take responsibility for the people it impacts.</em></p> <p> </p> <p>The pandemic’s economic impact is radically changing the retail landscape, but for fashion, the fallout is not just financial.

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The artistic director of Dior Men who is now also leading the women's collections at Fendi, speaks with BoF’s Imran Amed about the enduring power of youth and desire and the making of the Air Dior shoe.</em></p> <p>Designer Kim Jones went from being a teenager with joint custody over one pair of on-sale Jordan 5s with three friends to creating one of the most sought after shoes in the world by bringing together three iconic brands: Nike, Jordan and Dior. To create the Dior X Air Jordan, which dropped mid-pandemic in June of 2020, he took the Jordan 1 silhouette, applied Dior’s leather and Italian techniques and infused it all with Michael Jordan’s personal cool-guy style.The much-hyped, $2,200 shoe sold out in minutes after being released online. Soon after, <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/briefings/retail/diors-air-jordans-and-the-return-of-pre-pandemic-hype'> the shoes</a> were spotted being resold for as much as $12,000 on StockX.In this conversation from VOICES 2020, Jones covers everything from ethical consumption to the enduring power of youth and desire.  </p> <ul> <li>Young people influence the way Jones thinks about his designs. He invites his god children and children of friends over to watch them dissect his wardrobe, listening carefully to what they have to say. “Young people are learning they want to buy less, and things that last longer,” Jones said.</li> <li>Buying vintage, handing things down through generations, and luxury all tie together for Jones. “The thing about luxury that I like is it’s clothes that are built to last and there’s not that many made of things,” he said. “I care about the world a lot so it’s something I do consider that there’s not much waste. We don’t have tons of stuff left over.”</li> <li>The streetwear-meets-luxury space has exploded in the last few years. Jones sees it as a mix of comfort and easiness that fit in with modern daily life. His go-to is tailored pants and jackets with knitwear or a jersey piece. “When you’re working quite often, when it’s with your hands it’s easy,” he said.</li> <li>He advises aspiring designers and other young creatives to think less about status and more about fulfilment. “Never think about the money, think about doing the job. Work hard,” he said. “Don’t think about social media, think about the actual reality. Just get on with it, and ask questions. I ask questions all the time and that’s why I’ve learned so much.” <p> </p> </li> </ul> <p>Related Articles:</p> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/luxury/kim-jones-named-fendis-artistic-director-for-womenswear'>LVMH Is Trusting Kim Jones to Define Fendi’s Post-Karl Look</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/briefings/retail/diors-air-jordans-and-the-return-of-pre-pandemic-hype'> Dior’s Air Jordans and the Return of Pre-Pandemic Hype</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/will-luxury-streetwear-get-millennials-into-department-stores'> Will Luxury Streetwear Get Millennials Into Department Stores</a> <p> </p> Find out more about #BoFVOICES <a href= 'https://events.businessoffashion.com'>here</a>.   <p>To contact The Business of Fashion with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email <a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>podcast@businessoffashion.com</a>.</p>   <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/spa#/app/account/personal/subscriptions'> Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p>   <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The celebrated designer talks to BoF’s Imran Amed about fashion’s new digital landscape and the launch of AZ Factory during Haute Couture Week.</em></p> The timing of Alber Elbaz’s return to fashion is apt. After a five-year hiatus following his departure from Lanvin in 2015, the designer debuted his new venture AZ Factory this week. The philosophy underpinning the label, a partnership with Richemont, is to tackle fashion’s challenges of excess, irrelevance and exclusivity with technology, focus and innovation.In the latest episode of The BoF Podcast, editor-in-chief Imran Amed and Elbaz discuss how the designer fell back in love with fashion why it is necessary to slow the pace of the industry. <ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet"> <li>AZ Factory was born out of Elbaz’s disillusionment with the fashion world. His goal is to bring greater transparency to the design process and a more inclusive feel to customers. His first collection runs from size XS to XXXL. “We always have to remember again and again that this is 2021. How do women live, what do they need, how can I give them what they need?” said Elbaz. “It is taking all this information and processing it and then [giving my] take on it.”</li> <li>The label made a digital debut at Paris couture week with a fashion film. Elbaz said the restrictions created by the pandemic were both a creative challenge and opportunity. “I cannot tell you that it was always easy” Elbaz said. “The night before we air[ed] the film I was still working in editing and looking and changing the music.”</li> <li>One outcome of fashion’s current crisis that the designer is fully onboard with is the move towards a slower pace. Elbaz is increasingly focusing on new and innovative fabrics that require time to fully understand from a design perspective. “I cannot do it every couple of weeks so I know that I will have to keep [it to] two projects [at a time],” said Elbaz.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/fashion-week/inside-alber-elbazs-return-to-fashion'> Inside Alber Elbaz’s Return to Fashion</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/fashion-week/couture-in-the-time-of-covid-19-realism-or-fantasy'> Couture in the Time of Covid-19: Realism or Fantasy?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/luxury/the-bof-podcast-alber-elbaz-is-a-zoombie-now'> The BoF Podcast: Alber Elbaz Is a ‘Zoombie’ Now</a></p>     <p> </p> <p>To contact The Business of Fashion with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email <a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>podcast@businessoffashion.com</a>.</p>   <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/spa#/app/account/personal/subscriptions'> Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p>   <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The American designer speaks with BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks about his latest collection, born from ‘anger and darkness,’ and why limitations often make way for creative ingenuity.</em></p> <p> </p> The location of Rick Owens latest show is a reflection of the ongoing sense of global loss as the death toll from Covid-19 continues to rise. The designer’s new men’s collection was presented at Tempio Votivo, a shrine to the fallen soldiers of the two world wars. The collection, Owens tells BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks, was born out of “anger and darkness,” despite a fresh sense of optimism brought about by Joe Biden’s recent inauguration.In the latest episode of The BoF Podcast, Owens and Blanks discuss the many references that informed the American designer’s new collection and why imperfection is central to his pursuit of creativity. <ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet"> <li>The show, although full of music and models, was without a live audience, a move that turned the presentation into “personal ritual,” Owens said. “We are doing it for ourselves… Some of the people [I’m working with] have been with me for 18 years. For us to be able to nurture and develop the collection to this point together, we’ve never fully done that before. It’s been this great bonding exercise.”</li> <li>For Owens, lockdown life has not deviated far from his pre-pandemic routine. “I don’t participate or circulate in the world as much as most people do,” he said. But the social restrictions have reminded him that limitations can be central to creative ingenuity. “I like the idea of working within small boundaries,” he told Blanks. “I like the idea of doing the best with what you’ve got.”</li> <li>References for Owens’ work include the Bible, the Rocky Horror Show and S&M, as well as his own imperfections and personal experience of manhood. “My men’s runway shows are always about men’s flaws, and about men’s worst urges because they’re autobiographical,” he said. “When I’m thinking about men, I’m thinking about my own experience.

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Speaking with Imran Amed, the Washington Post’s senior critic-at-large shares her thoughts on the controversially ‘familiar’ image of the vice president-elect, and explains where it sits within the wider political climate of the United States as it is due to enter a new chapter.</em></p><p>When the cover of American&nbsp;<em>Vogue</em>’s February issue leaked on Saturday, January 9, a flurry of controversy ensued. Many took to social media to deride the image of vice president-elect Kamala Harris, lensed by Tyler Mitchell, for its casual styling, unflattering lighting and lack of gravitas. The criticism focused on the argument that the portrait lacked the stately deference they believed such a political figure — not least the first Black, South Asian female vice-president — should command.Among those to share their thoughts was Robin Givhan,&nbsp;<em>The Washington Post’s</em>&nbsp;senior critic-at-large who penned a column on January 11 in which she said “the cover did not give Kamala D. Harris due respect… It was a cover image that, in effect, called Harris by her first name without invitation.”&nbsp;Givhan, who became the first fashion writer to receive the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 2006,&nbsp;sat down with Imran Amed in the latest episode of The BoF Podcast, to further discuss the cover’s significance and the wider tumultuous landscape of US politics.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Debating Harris’ portrait is about more than just a critique of the technicalities and production value of a fashion glossy. Its release comes at a time of political division and fraught race relations, just days after a violent right-wing mob stormed Washington D.C.’s Capitol building, an event incited by President Trump, who now faces a second impeachment for his involvement in the incident. “The last few years have been an exhausting, emotionally draining time,” said Givhan. “I was very surprised that [the cover] became such an issue. I was really stunned that people were so exercised about it. When you think about it, it’s [like] pain from a thousand papercuts, and this was the 1001st papercut.”</li><li>The informality of the image chosen for the print cover carries greater historical significance and weight.&nbsp;<em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;and Anna Wintour defended it as an extension of the Biden-Harris campaign’s platform of accessibility, which Givhan described as a “legitimate” point of view. But, she said, “I think that the upset is rooted not so much in the current moment but its history. Throughout history, Black women in particular were not given the kind of respect that white women were. People had this familiarity with Black women that was not about friendship and equality but was condescending. Understanding the complicated nature of that would give one pause in presenting the first female vice president — a Black woman — in that way.”</li><li>While the alternative digital cover image, which depicts Harris in a more presidential light and formal style, offers some reprieve, this print issue has significance as a cultural souvenir (“you can’t give a screengrab to your grandchildren,” said Givhan), and there is no real opportunity for a do-over. “There’s no way to make people happy,” said Givhan, adding that it’s important to instead listen to criticism and “recognise where things went astray” in allowing this misstep to happen. “You just have to do better the next time, and the time after that and the time after that.”</li></ul><p><em>External clips courtesy of Good Morning America and ABC7 News</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Many took to social media to deride the image of vice president-elect Kamala Harris, lensed by Tyler Mitchell, for its casual styling, unflattering lighting and lack of gravitas. The criticism focused on the argument that the portrait lacked the stately deference they believed such a political figure — not least the first Black, South Asian female vice-president — should command.Among those to share their thoughts was Robin Givhan,&nbsp;<em>The Washington Post’s</em>&nbsp;senior critic-at-large who penned a column on January 11 in which she said “the cover did not give Kamala D. Harris due respect… It was a cover image that, in effect, called Harris by her first name without invitation.”&nbsp;Givhan, who became the first fashion writer to receive the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 2006,&nbsp;sat down with Imran Amed in the latest episode of The BoF Podcast, to further discuss the cover’s significance and the wider tumultuous landscape of US politics.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Debating Harris’ portrait is about more than just a critique of the technicalities and production value of a fashion glossy. Its release comes at a time of political division and fraught race relations, just days after a violent right-wing mob stormed Washington D.C.’s Capitol building, an event incited by President Trump, who now faces a second impeachment for his involvement in the incident. “The last few years have been an exhausting, emotionally draining time,” said Givhan. “I was very surprised that [the cover] became such an issue. I was really stunned that people were so exercised about it. When you think about it, it’s [like] pain from a thousand papercuts, and this was the 1001st papercut.”</li><li>The informality of the image chosen for the print cover carries greater historical significance and weight.&nbsp;<em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;and Anna Wintour defended it as an extension of the Biden-Harris campaign’s platform of accessibility, which Givhan described as a “legitimate” point of view. But, she said, “I think that the upset is rooted not so much in the current moment but its history. Throughout history, Black women in particular were not given the kind of respect that white women were. People had this familiarity with Black women that was not about friendship and equality but was condescending. Understanding the complicated nature of that would give one pause in presenting the first female vice president — a Black woman — in that way.”</li><li>While the alternative digital cover image, which depicts Harris in a more presidential light and formal style, offers some reprieve, this print issue has significance as a cultural souvenir (“you can’t give a screengrab to your grandchildren,” said Givhan), and there is no real opportunity for a do-over. “There’s no way to make people happy,” said Givhan, adding that it’s important to instead listen to criticism and “recognise where things went astray” in allowing this misstep to happen. “You just have to do better the next time, and the time after that and the time after that.”</li></ul><p><em>External clips courtesy of Good Morning America and ABC7 News</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<em>It’s hard to imagine running a successful brand in 2021 without advertising on Instagram, buying search ads on Google or selling on Amazon. At BoF VOICES, H&M’s Christopher Wylie and venture capitalist Roger McNamee talked about why that’s probably not a good thing — and how the industry can reduce its reliance on tech giants.</em>   Before the pandemic, social media and e-commerce giants like Facebook and Amazon were ascendant. The physical isolation caused by the ongoing global health crisis has only consolidated their power. Nevertheless, fashion brands can’t rely on a handful of Silicon Valley firms to run their businesses, venture capitalist Roger McNamee said at BoF’s VOICES.   In an interview with Christopher Wylie, who blew the whistle on Cambridge Analytica’s improper use of Facebook user data during the 2016 election, McNamee outlined how big tech has touched off a “cascading series of catastrophes going from the online world into the real world.” In fashion, Facebook, Amazon and Google have inserted themselves between brands and their customers. Though they offer unparalleled marketing and commerce capabilities, McNamee noted their clients pay a steep price in the long run by ceding control of such crucial elements of their businesses. But all is not lost.   “The fashion industry has a superpower,” he said. “You’re actually connected to culture, so people care what you have to say. You have to recognise as an industry that these guys are changing the rules and you have to fight back.”     Find out more about #BoFVOICES <a href= 'https://events.businessoffashion.com/'>here</a>.   To contact <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'> The Business of Fashion</a> with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email <a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>podcast@businessoffashion.com</a>.   Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.

At BoF VOICES, Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson laid out how to turn the industry’s new awareness into meaningful action.</em></p> <p>In 2020, the fashion industry reckoned with its history — and present — of racial discrimination. Companies promised to address the lack of Black voices on their creative teams and in the C-suite, as well as toxic internal cultures.But visibility is only the first step. Now is the time to “translate caring into action,” Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said at BoF’s VOICES.The most important change the industry can make, he said, is to stop talking about race in a passive voice. It’s not that Black people are less likely to get hired in the fashion industry — rather, the fashion industry excludes Black people.Inclusivity measures such as mentorship and creating career pipelines for Black employees are inadequate, he went on to say. Too much effort is focused on “fixing” individuals, without addressing the system that created barriers to advancement in the first place.“When we talk about vulnerable communities, we spend our time trying to fix those people,” Robinson said. “When we talk about systems and structures, we spend our time trying to fix those systems and those structures.”</p> <p> </p> <em>Find out more about #BoFVOICES  </em><em><a href= 'https://events.businessoffashion.com'>here</a></em><em>.</em>   <em>To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em> <em>with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em>   <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

Job loss or worry about job loss and general anxiety surrounding staying healthy are among the chief causes for why sleep, on the whole, has become worse both in quality and quantity for so many.With “sleep hygiene” more important than ever, BoF’s CEO and founder Imran Amed spoke with Dr. Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California Berkeley, and Harpreet Singh Rai, CEO of wearable technology company Oura, as part of BoF’s 2020 VOICES conference.Deep sleep is when you refresh your “immune weaponry in your health arsenal,” Walker said.

That’s bad for sleep quality, especially when coupled with an increase in screen time. “All of us are sleeping less on average and we’re more distracted than ever before,” said Singh Rai. Sleep progress should really be tracked like diet or a workout regimen because “whatever gets measured gets mastered,” he said.</li><li>A cavalier attitude to sleep can be costly because it is intimately linked to health and productivity. For example, Walker cited a study that found insufficient sleep costs most nations about two percent of their gross domestic product, amounting to $411 billion in the US. “If we could solve the sleep loss crisis within most first-world nations, [we] could almost double the budget for health care or for education,” Walker said. He added: People should consider sleep to be an “investment in tomorrow” rather than a cost on one’s time.</li><li>Among Walker and Singh Rai’s top sleep hacks: saunas and warm baths are highly effective at helping the body expel heat once you exit those environments, and help set ideal conditions for sleep; setting sleep alarms (those reminders that nudge you to bed at roughly the same time every evening) is just as important as an alarm to help you wake up in the morning; avoiding naps during the day, caffeine in the afternoon and alcohol in the evening allow people to grow tired enough for sleep at night; and finally, abide by the 25-minute rule: if you’re lying in bed for longer than that trying to sleep, then go and do something else (that does not include screen time or food) until your body is tired. “You would never sit at a dinner table waiting to get hungry.

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The American designer discusses the power of many businesses to be advocates for change.</em></p> <p> </p> The last few years have offered Tory Burch, founder of her namesake womenswear label, time to focus less on business and more on design, particularly since her husband Pierre-Yves Roussel took on the role of chief executive in 2018. Now, the pandemic is giving her even more time to focus on perfecting product, a rare silver lining of an otherwise challenging situation.   In the latest episode of the BoF Podcast, BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks speaks with Burch about her activist-focused approach to business and how the last 10 months have shaped her fashion label.   <ul> <li>Restriction is a crucial component of creativity. To Burch, the travel restrictions and social distancing measures have opened new avenues of creativity, fostering agility and resourcefulness. “One thing that’s happened because of lockdown is it makes you stand still,” said Burch. “To be able to be in one place has been really transformative on many levels.”</li> <li>Burch emphasises that what constitutes luxury needs to be reconsidered. “I really believe luxury isn’t about a price point, and I think that’s relatable particularly today,” she said. “How do you design beautiful things that are timeless and that will last? That’s what I’ve been thinking about,” she said, adding that having time to spend is the ultimate luxury.</li> <li>Through the Tory Burch Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to advancing women’s empowerment, Burch is finding new avenues through which to support women and help them weather the coronavirus crisis. “Its horrendous for women right now,” said Burch. “They are taking care of children at a much higher rate than men. We have had to help many women figure out how to take out PPP loans… We had to pivot to really be a resource for women.”</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles: <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/luxury/tory-burch-names-pierre-yves-roussel-ceo'> Tory Burch Names Pierre-Yves Roussel CEO</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-week/independent-women-spring-summer-2021-stella-mccartney-sacai-chitose-abe-tory-burch'> Independent Women Brought Hope to Fashion’s Virtual Spring</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-week/visual-metaphors-at-tory-burch'> Visual Metaphors at Tory Burch</a></p>     <em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live'>here</a></em><em>.</em>   <em>To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em> <em>with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em>   <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

As the title suggests, the photographer is less interested in reminiscing about the past, and more keen on pushing himself and others to look beyond first impressions. </p> <p><em> </em></p> <p>The memoir delves into Bailey’s past and includes sometimes-scathing accounts of his relationships with heavyweights in the world of fashion, media, show business and politics — though he maintains he told the stories “in the nicest possible way.” </p> <p><em> </em></p> <p>“Being a photographer, you have to know how to deal with anyone, from the bloke on the [street] corner to the Queen, so you have to behave,” he said.</p> <p><em> </em></p> <p>Speaking in conversation with BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks, the famed photographer shares anecdotes from his storied and colourful past. </p> <p><em> </em></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight:400;">Since he first burst onto the scene in 1960, photography has drastically changed alongside technology. “iPhones killed photography in a way, because everyone can take a picture,” he said, adding, “it’s made it into a kind of folk art,” which has its merits.  </li> <li style="font-weight:400;">As Blanks notes, Bailey lost interest in fashion photography for a while in the 1970s, a period  Bailey blames on  his dislike of some editors and the grind of the fashion cycle. It was “another frock and another frock and another girl and another girl.” It took the emergence of Kate Moss — alongside ‘60s supermodel Jean Shrimpton one of Bailey’s top muses — to excite him again. “They’re both exceptional,… important people, much more important than people think.”</li> <li style="font-weight:400;">While Bailey is not one for nostalgia, he can pinpoint one photograph that defines an era — and himself as a photographer. “I’ve got one picture that I feel sums up everything: [British actor] Michael Caine with an unlit cigarette,” he said. “I feel it sums up the ‘60s for me.

						<description><![CDATA[<em>Imran Amed talks to the designer, also known as Denim Tears, about the US election and putting conditions on his collaboration with Converse.</em>   This is just the beginning for designer Tremaine Emory. Following the US election, the designer, who is also known as Denim Tears, spoke to BoF’s Imran Amed about negotiating with big brands, leading with purpose and the work still ahead. “It’s been an incredible week and there’s a lot more work to do,” said Emory. “I hope this is the start.”   <ul> <li>For Emory, principles come first when it comes to working with big brands, especially if they are using corporate activism in their marketing. The designer notably withheld the release of a collaboration with Converse earlier this year, posting a set of conditions for parent company Nike on Instagram that ranged from disclosing the number of Black employees in leadership roles to stopping all support for the Republican party. “I can’t put these sneakers out if all the company is doing is donating money,” said Emory. “I need to know specifically what they’re doing to combat police brutality in Black neighbourhoods… Who are we protecting with this money?” In negotiations with brands, Emory delineated the tango that comes with corporate partnerships: “Their number one thing is making money... how can I dance their bottom line with my bottom line?”</li> <li>Reflecting on the results of the election, Emory emphasised the importance of registering young voters and getting them excited about the upcoming senate elections, particularly in his home state of Georgia. “We’re going to work to get people to vote and get Democrats in those seats,” he said.</li> <li>Emory also hopes to introduce young consumers to new ideas and ways of thinking about American history and civil rights. “That’s probably my favourite part of my practice is being a bridge of knowledge between generations,” he said. “How can I condense... a James Baldwin book [or] a Black Panther book into a T-shirt?”</li> </ul>   <em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live'>here</a></em><em>.</em>   <em>To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em> <em>with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em>   <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

						<description><![CDATA[The BoF team and industry experts Sharifa Murdock and Stephen Lamar discuss what the close vote means for the future of fashion.   LONDON, United Kingdom — Election night ended in the US without a clear answer as to who will lead the country for the next four years. And though former Vice President Joe Biden appeared to have established a small lead over President Donald Trump in several key states as of Thursday afternoon, many questions remain about what will happen next.  Sharifa Murdock, co-owner of Liberty Fashion & Lifestyle Fairs, and Stephen Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association joined BoF’s Lauren Sherman, Brian Baskin and Imran Amed to discuss what’s at stake for tariffs, trade agreements and corporate activism whatever the outcome.  Trade policies have changed under the current administration. Trump renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement and levied tariffs on goods imported from China and some European countries. Biden may not have implemented these polices given the choice, but his administration will be cautious about retreating from Trump’s trade positions, Lamar said. “They don’t want to be seen as the new government immediately going soft on China,” he said.  Trump campaigned in 2016 on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US, but in the fashion industry at least, American factories cannot compete directly with overseas rivals on price, said Murdock of Liberty Fashion & Lifestyle Fairs. “News flash, stuff that left isn’t coming back,” said Lamar, who added that a Trump or Biden administration should focus instead on creating new kinds of apparel production jobs in the US.  Sales of luxury goods are holding up relatively well in the US as the wealthy redirect money that normally would be used on trips and hotels toward handbags and apparel. Trump’s tax cut has also played a role, giving wealthy consumers more disposable income. Biden campaigned on raising corporate taxes and reversing some of Trump’s tax policies. However, his ability to implement his vision depends on Democratic control of the Senate, which appeared unlikely as of Wednesday afternoon.  Corporate activism has flourished under the Trump presidency, as brands and retailers that previously remained neutral on political issues came under increased pressure by consumers to take a stance. The panelists predicted that activism was likely to continue, no matter who wins the election. “One thing that Trump did do was bring out… views that haven’t been looked at previously,” said Murdock. “No matter who wins [diversity and inclusion] is going to be on people’s minds.” Related Articles: The US Election: What’s at Stake for Fashion? American Fashion Executives on What Happens Now   Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations here.   To contact The Business of Fashion with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email podcast@businessoffashion.com.   Sign up for BoF’s Daily Digest newsletter.

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The British designer tells Tim Blanks about his latest creative endeavour, a documentary about creating his first collection in two years.</em>&nbsp;LONDON, United Kingdom — Acclaimed designer Gareth Pugh showed his last collection in September 2018. Two years on, he has returned to the industry at a time of global tumult. Its effects are clearly reflected in “The Reconstruction,” a documentary made by Pugh, his husband Carson McColl and Showstudio director Nick Knight showcasing 13 new designs and the inspiration behind them.&nbsp;“This project really has been born out of some insane historical moments,” said Pugh. “2020’s been a shitty year and so much has gone on,” he continued, and he would be remiss “not to look it in the face and acknowledge its presence.”&nbsp;</p><ul><li>No stranger to the medium, Pugh has previously released films of his designs in lieu of a fashion show, and in 2019 made a documentary with McColl about the fight for LGBTQ+ rights across the UK. In the latest episode of The BoF Podcast, Pugh discussed what the current state of the industry means for young designers, and how he considers film to be a medium loaded with potential depth. The “new normal” can also mean opportunities. “The playing field is now level; you don’t have that established way of having to do things. like young designers being forced into this idea that ’we have to spend a load of money doing a show,’” said Pugh. “You never had to do that anyway, but now more than ever you really don’t.”</li><li>For many designers, film has been the go-to medium in the absence of in-person fashion shows, but it presents its own challenges. “Once you have that physical exchange taken away, you have that hole, that vacuum that you need to fill,” said Pugh. That said, alternative art forms allow for a more profound exploration of themes. “In a [fashion] show context it’s very difficult to dig down deep… simply because you’ve got this tennis match-esque way of presenting things,” he added.</li><li>“The Reconstruction” is a meditation on permanence, longevity and wider political significance as it pertains to creativity — from the “monumental” looks showcased in the film, to an entire section documenting the Black Lives Matter movement and activism of trans women of colour. “Wanting to build something really febrile and really temporal doesn’t sit with me,” said Pugh, admitting that he “never did very well with playing that commercial game” as a designer. “Fashion for me is part of the wider cultural conversation and does link to so many things we are part of… [It] doesn’t exist within a vacuum.”</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Related Articles: <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-show-review/gareth-pughs-fashion-battlefield" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Gareth Pugh's Fashion Battlefield</a> <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-show-review/gareth-pughs-macabre-movie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Gareth Pugh's Macabre Movie</a> <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/video/a-life-in-extreme-style-michele-lamy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> A Life in Extreme Style: Michèle Lamy</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

After much of the year working under lockdowns, brands largely shifted to digital channels to showcase their newest collections. In the latest episode of the BoF podcast, BoF Founder and CEO Imran Amed and BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks reflect on the season's most compelling moments and lasting impact.</p> <ul> <li>Virtual presentations haven’t always landed, but this season felt different, said Blanks. “There was so much thought and creativity and ingenuity applied to new ways of doing business and new ways [of showing work]... It was a very different ball game.”</li> <li>In London, Blanks was struck by female designers like Bianca Saunders, Ahluwalia and Supriya Lele who “did these super strong presentations that were provocative and affirmative and positive,” he said. Overall, London Fashion Week was defined by a joyful defiance during a time of crisis. In Milan and Paris, Blanks and Amed referenced Prada and Rick Owens as two of many shows that stood out to them.</li> <li>This season also made clear the power of strong partnerships. Through creative collaborations between designers and filmmakers, brands have managed to bring their collections to life to audiences the world over. “It changes the fundamental conception of fashion being about the designer, now we have a much more collaborative thing happening,” said Blanks. “That’s a shift, I think.”</li> </ul> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/digital-fashion-week-shows-mens-resort-couture-dior-loewe-prada-valentino'> How Impactful Were the Digital Fashion Week Shows, Really?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/fashion-week-digital-instagram-youtube-coronavirus'> Who Will Win the Digital Fashion Week Battle?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/how-to-make-digital-fashion-weeks-work'> How to Make Digital Fashion Weeks Work</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live'>here</a>.</em><em> To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em><em> with comments, questions, or speaker ideas please </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>e-mail podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em></p> <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The American designer talks about his efforts to destigmatize mental health issues and the importance of improving emotional wellbeing in the fashion industry. </em></p> <p>LONDON, United Kingdom — “[There] needs to be a cultural shift… a new narrative, a new vocabulary, a new way to talk about mental health that [isn’t] debilitating, but is in fact empowering,” designer and social activist Kenneth Cole told BoF Founder and Editor-in-Chief Imran Amed. </p> <p>Cole recently brought together leading US mental health organisations and high-profile advocates and media platforms to launch the Mental Health Coalition, an organisation that seeks to destigmatize the topic. In the latest episode of The BoF Podcast, he discussed how the issue pervades the fashion industry and efforts to address it. </p> <p> </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight:400;">“The fashion industry is a perception industry, and how we are perceived often is how we see ourselves,” Cole said, warning of the dangers to mental health when designers become preoccupied with reviews, likes on a post or comments from editors. “We define ourselves so often by these external forces that we can’t control and to a degree if you allow them to take hold then you become a victim of that. I often say, ‘fashion is what I do, it's not who I am.’”</li> <li style="font-weight:400;">The pressures on designers have become even more intense with the rise of social media. That’s more true than ever in an era where the pandemic has at times made digital the only available avenue of communication. Constantly being exposed to the feedback and opinions of others can feel debilitating Cole said.  “Unfortunately our industry embraces it and rewards it… and the more likes you have and the bigger audience you have, the more access you will often have.” </li> <li style="font-weight:400;">What’s next is changing the way people speak about mental health so it there’s less stigma attached to it. The best way to do that “be supportive and non-judgemental and listen,” Cole said. “We all have different degrees and we have ups and we have downs. And we have periods where we’re feeling more in control than other [times]...

						<description><![CDATA[The designer speaks with BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks about his ongoing Moncler collaboration and his dream of designing a wardrobe classic.   LONDON, United Kingdom — Known for his intricate seaming and detailed designs, Craig Green is currently hard at work on his Spring/Summer 2021 collection — which he is aiming to reveal in October. This time, however, it won’t be in a fashion show format. Rather, Green is exploring alternative ways of showcasing his collection that he feels are more appropriate to the times. “The way everything changed so suddenly shows you can’t really plan for anything,” Green told BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks. In the latest episode of The BoF Podcast, Green and Blanks reflect on the designer’s ongoing collaboration with Moncler, his love of problem-solving, and his dream of designing a wardrobe classic. <ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet"> <li>Protection and functionality are the two words that come to Green’s mind when he thinks of Moncler, so it was crucial to incorporate them into the collections he continues to design for the heritage skiwear label. “The first collection we did with Moncler, I thought it would be interesting to think about the most obvious imagery that we associate with [the brand] like mountains and the outdoors,” the designer said. The initial partnership gave birth to many years of collaboration that most recently saw Green reimagining Moncler’s staple winter jackets into wearable art for Collection 5, which launched last December.</li> <li>“Fashion can come from anywhere and can come from anyone,” said Green. “You have an idea of what fashion as a career will be, and then you discover designers who are so uncompromising in what they do and so individual in their voice.” For Green, it is problem-solving that continues to draw him to fashion; the endless possibilities of constructing new shapes and silhouettes using a range of textiles and patterns.</li> <li>Green’s ultimate goal is to design a wardrobe classic, like a Burberry trench coat. But for Green, the staple is more likely to be a workwear jacket. “For a brand or designer to create one of those items is really an achievement,” said Green. “I have great respect for designers that own wardrobe classics.”</li> </ul> Related Articles: <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-show-review/packaging-the-body-at-craig-green'> Packaging the Body at Craig Green</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/podcasts/the-bof-podcast-craig-green-talks-creative-evolution'> Craig Green Talks Creative Evolution</a>     <p><em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live'>here</a>.</em><em> To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em><em> with comments, questions, or speaker ideas please </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>e-mail podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em></p> <p> </p> <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

For Blanks, what has come out of this period of uncertainty — and the modes of communication adopted — shouldn’t be forgotten. “I hope that there will be this immediate contact, this sort of intimacy,” he said. “I find that more interesting than maybe the way that we used to deal with things.

Just like the brands and designers who pivoted and adopted new digital tools to reach buyers and consumers amid show cancellations, publications maximised their online presence to guide the industry at large through a period of upheaval.</p><p>In the latest episode of The BoF Podcast, Horyn sat down with BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks to discuss reviewing the upcoming shows this month (a mixture of both physical and live events) and her outlook for a post-Covid-19 fashion industry.</p><ul><li>For Horyn, the media reflects and adapts to the needs of its time. “There’s been incredible [fashion] writers all the way back to the 1830s at least… and they all did something different. Journalists adapted to whatever was going on at that time,” she said. With the advent of the internet and social media, the industry saw the emergence of new voices and new talent. Amid this current period of uncertainty, Horyn remains optimistic that the industry will emerge stronger and transformed. “We’ve seen a lot of experimentation in the last… two months… I think going forward...it’s going to be an adjustment for everybody covering fashion, [but] I certainly think it should be covered.”</li><li>Will the show go on? This has been one of the questions on the minds of designers across the globe, but with New York Fashion Week given the go ahead (sort of) industry insiders and consumers are in for a fashion week unlike anything ever seen before: a mixture of in-person shows, livestreams, films and virtual panel discussions. What does this mean for journalists, like Horyn, that usually review the collections gracing the runway? “We don’t even know if we’re going to be covering shows like we did till possibly next fall,” she said. “My long-term feelings for the industry are really strong… [fashion] will transform itself but we just don’t know what that’s going to [look like].”</li><li>For Horyn and other critics, it would be remiss to ignore the allure of the physical runway show. A collection “doesn’t [always] translate so well on television or on a video screen,” Horyn said.

But one thing that remains, whether via a screen or in real time, is the “sense of discovery and [realisation] that some of that stuff ... moves the historical needle of fashion and we get to see that,” she said.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Related Articles:</p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/the-best-case-worst-case-for-fashions-media-giants" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> The Best-Case, Worst-Case for Fashion Media</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/fashion-print-magazines-coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> For Fashion Magazines, It's Crunch Time</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/at-conde-nast-and-hearst-its-about-more-than-the-current-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> At Condé Nast and Hearst, It’s About More Than the Current Crisis</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>.&nbsp;To contact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Business of Fashion</em></a><em>&nbsp;with comments, questions, or speaker ideas please&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>e-mail podcast@businessoffashion.com</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

In the latest episode of the BoF Podcast, BoF Founder and Editor-in-Chief Imran Amed speaks with Elie Saab Jr., chief executive of Elie Saab Group, as well as Lebanese designers Roni Helou and Amine Jreissati about what it will take to rebuild Lebanon's local fashion industry.</p><ul><li>The challenges facing many people in Lebanon are overwhelming.

It is often such desperate times that can generate an influx of progress and growth in the long term. “I have been emphasising the importance of reshaping the [fashion] industry. We have seen both locally and globally that something isn’t working,” said Helou. “If we don’t put a plan in place to recover, we are taking the hope away from people of putting food on the table.” It is crucial that this plan includes careful financial planning, added Jreissati, in order to navigate the economic uncertainty that has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and implement the foundations of a more resilient industry.</li><li>When looking to the future, the importance of patience and hope is underscored by all three designers, but global solidarity and aid is just as crucial. “Brands located in Lebanon today have been very limited with everything that’s been happening.

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The Fear of God designer talks American luxury and why feeling like an outsider is a strength.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LONDON, United Kingdom —&nbsp;For Fear of God Founder Jerry Lorenzo, being an outsider is an advantage. “I just feel like I never fit,” he told BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks in the latest episode of The BoF Podcast. “I’ve gotten to a place where I’m ok with that and I don’t need to fit within fashion to be validated… and so I know that I’m outside but I feel like my strength is that I’m outside. My strength is that I see [things] differently.”</p><p>Lorenzo has often taken a less-beaten path, but it’s his approach to collection drops — his latest is the first he has released in two years — as well an ability to use fashion as a platform to foster social change, that have helped to position him as an industry leader.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p><em>The Fear of God designer talks American luxury and why feeling like an outsider is a strength.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LONDON, United Kingdom —&nbsp;For Fear of God Founder Jerry Lorenzo, being an outsider is an advantage. “I just feel like I never fit,” he told BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks in the latest episode of The BoF Podcast. “I’ve gotten to a place where I’m ok with that and I don’t need to fit within fashion to be validated… and so I know that I’m outside but I feel like my strength is that I’m outside. My strength is that I see [things] differently.”</p><p>Lorenzo has often taken a less-beaten path, but it’s his approach to collection drops — his latest is the first he has released in two years — as well an ability to use fashion as a platform to foster social change, that have helped to position him as an industry leader. An outsider no longer?</p><ul><li>"The Pelican Brief," "The Breakfast Club," "License to Drive" and "Rocky IV" are just some of ‘80s movies Lorenzo often references. “There’s something about that time period that to me was the highest level of effortlessness and sophistication,” he said.

For Ben Cobb, editor-in-chief, men’s, of LOVE Magazine, and Pierre A. M’Pelé, the title’s senior editor, community and collaboration is key. Launching August 4, the latest iteration of the biannual magazine is two volumes of hardback books, titled “LOVE ‘Diaries 3 March - 4 July’ Volumes 1 and 2”&nbsp;featuring a total of four covers. “I hesitate to even call it a magazine,” said BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks in conversation with Cobb and M’Pelé. “[It’s] a remarkable time capsule of this remarkable time.”</p><ul><li>Despite its triumphant final form, the process behind creating the magazine has not been without its challenges. “There were three senior members very ill with Covid,” said Cobb, describing how the team stepped in to carry out work depending on how healthy they were feeling each day, ahead of M’Pelé joining the team in late June. “We were exhausted and suffering from fatigue, [but] Pierre came in with so much energy.” As a highly collaborative process, it also dissolved the traditional hierarchy of the masthead — “a new way of putting together a magazine,” said Blanks, reminiscent of “the idealistic height of the ’60s.”</li><li>Producing a fashion magazine — particularly one as extensive as LOVE’s two-tome edition — typically takes a long period of planning and forethought, but the seismic and fast-developing events of the last six months required quickfire changes. The Black Lives Matter protests of May and June “changed the course of action,” said M’Pelé, who himself attended protests in Paris. “The team was very reactive because it was a matter of ‘let’s speak now, let’s take a stance now and let’s be clear of our intentions now...’ If we hadn’t added these Black Lives Matter and systemic racism conversations into the magazine, it would have been too late.” In the wake of the murder of George Floyd, M’Pelé’s “manifesto,” a portable pamphlet-like insert in the book, “became a lot more about new voices, bringing people of colour into the picture,” he said. “I want someone to be able to take it out and give it to their racist aunt.”</li><li>This period has also called into question the formats and fundamental role that fashion magazines assume. “Editorial perspective…[typically] crystallises a moment and it’s about dictating what that moment means,” said Cobb. “I think what’s been really incredible and transformative about this is that … that dynamic has been completely reversed and the moment tells you what it needs to be.” As for what the next issue of LOVE will look like, “Who knows?” said Cobb. “Maybe a magazine can just be a film.”</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Related Articles: <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/bof-exclusive/katie-grand-taps-ben-cobb-to-be-love-co-editor-in-chief" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Katie Grand Names Ben Cobb Co-Editor-in-Chief of LOVE</a><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/fashion-print-magazines-coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> For Fashion Magazines, It's Crunch Time</a><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/how-to-make-a-magazine-under-lockdown" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> How to Make a Magazine Under Lockdown</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The celebrated art director Fabien Baron talks to BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks about the future of image-making.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LONDON, United Kingdom —&nbsp;For famed art director Fabien Baron, the chaos and uncertainty brought on by the pandemic presents an opportunity for the fashion industry to go “back to basics.”</p><p>“When there’s doubt like this there’s not really an answer… so there’s opportunities to take more risks and be more creative,” Baron told BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks in the latest episode of The BoF Podcast. “It’s going to bring a lot of changes… but there’s something very optimistic about change. To be forced to change allows one to really [reflect] on the issues we are all facing.”</p><ul><li>This period of uncertainty has unlocked conversations that were rippling below the surface, said Baron. Both the pandemic and the recent political unrest has highlighted an opportunity for the fashion industry at large to reshape “old formats” that feel at odds with the world’s new normal. For Baron, that means “a new way of looking things… which may lead you to a new path… it’s going to be an evolution [for the industry].”</li><li>According to Baron, creativity is the key to unlocking change and as the world adjusts to a new set of challenges, industries must do the same. From this health crisis a new way of approaching magazines, photography, styling and the buying and selling of merchandise will emerge where storytelling must supersede superficiality, said Baron. Brands and publications must hone an authentic voice which reflects the time and inspires “people with new ideas and new ways of looking at things. You need freshness and you need a lot of positiveness.”</li><li>Simplicity could be the antidote to the incessant pace at which the industry has been operating. The months of travelling it took to view runway shows or presentations, whether it was buyers or editors, hopping from “this city to that city just to see a show… After a while it [didn’t] make sense.” However, the outbreak of the coronavirus brought the fashion calendar to a standstill and designers turned towards digital tools in order to showcase their collections. This new way of using technology means “the way we communicate is going to change because the tools are changing and they’re opening new doors,” he said.They allow us to do different things and view things [from] different angles.”</li></ul><p>Related Articles:</p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/a-year-without-fashion-shows" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> A Year Without Fashion Shows</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/fashion-week-digital-instagram-youtube-coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Who Will Win the Digital Fashion Week Battle?</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/fashions-new-2020-outlook" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Fashion’s New Outlook on 2020</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tims-take/fabien-baron-is-not-nostalgic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Fabien Baron Is Not Nostalgic</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

For Baron, that means “a new way of looking things… which may lead you to a new path… it’s going to be an evolution [for the industry].”</li><li>According to Baron, creativity is the key to unlocking change and as the world adjusts to a new set of challenges, industries must do the same. From this health crisis a new way of approaching magazines, photography, styling and the buying and selling of merchandise will emerge where storytelling must supersede superficiality, said Baron. Brands and publications must hone an authentic voice which reflects the time and inspires “people with new ideas and new ways of looking at things. You need freshness and you need a lot of positiveness.”</li><li>Simplicity could be the antidote to the incessant pace at which the industry has been operating. The months of travelling it took to view runway shows or presentations, whether it was buyers or editors, hopping from “this city to that city just to see a show… After a while it [didn’t] make sense.” However, the outbreak of the coronavirus brought the fashion calendar to a standstill and designers turned towards digital tools in order to showcase their collections. This new way of using technology means “the way we communicate is going to change because the tools are changing and they’re opening new doors,” he said.They allow us to do different things and view things [from] different angles.”</li></ul><p>Related Articles:</p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/a-year-without-fashion-shows" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> A Year Without Fashion Shows</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/fashion-week-digital-instagram-youtube-coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Who Will Win the Digital Fashion Week Battle?</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/fashions-new-2020-outlook" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Fashion’s New Outlook on 2020</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tims-take/fabien-baron-is-not-nostalgic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Fabien Baron Is Not Nostalgic</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>In an exclusive conversation with BoF’s Imran Amed, Geoffroy van Raemdonck expresses optimism for the retailer’s bankruptcy process and explains why brick-and-mortar remains integral to its core business.</p> <p>LONDON, United Kingdom — When facing both a nation-wide retail shutdown and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing, Neiman Marcus Group Chief Executive Geoffroy van Raemdonck found solace in one fact: his most loyal customers, even at stores that have yet to re-open to the public, are shopping more than they did last year.</p> <p>“Neiman Marcus is a relationships business,” Van Raemdonck told BoF Editor-in-Chief Imran Amed in an exclusive interview this week.</p> <p>Despite the global health crisis — and a dire debt problem that loomed even pre-pandemic — Van Raemdonck sees an opportunity for growth.</p> <ul> <li>As consumers continue to migrate online, Neiman Marcus’ 43 stores remain integral to forging lasting connections between shoppers and sales associates. Prior to the coronavirus, every Neiman Marcus store that was open for more than a year was profitable. That’s why the retailer is planning on closing fewer than 10 stores, Van Raemdonck said.</li> <li>Neiman Marcus’ primary problem is debt. In 2019, the company generated $415 million in adjusted EBITDA, which represented 9 percent of its sales. The issue is that $365 million of that profit had to go toward paying down its debt.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In an exclusive conversation with BoF’s Imran Amed, Geoffroy van Raemdonck expresses optimism for the retailer’s bankruptcy process and explains why brick-and-mortar remains integral to its core business.</p> <p>LONDON, United Kingdom — When facing both a nation-wide retail shutdown and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing, Neiman Marcus Group Chief Executive Geoffroy van Raemdonck found solace in one fact: his most loyal customers, even at stores that have yet to re-open to the public, are shopping more than they did last year.</p> <p>“Neiman Marcus is a relationships business,” Van Raemdonck told BoF Editor-in-Chief Imran Amed in an exclusive interview this week.</p> <p>Despite the global health crisis — and a dire debt problem that loomed even pre-pandemic — Van Raemdonck sees an opportunity for growth.</p> <ul> <li>As consumers continue to migrate online, Neiman Marcus’ 43 stores remain integral to forging lasting connections between shoppers and sales associates. Prior to the coronavirus, every Neiman Marcus store that was open for more than a year was profitable. That’s why the retailer is planning on closing fewer than 10 stores, Van Raemdonck said.</li> <li>Neiman Marcus’ primary problem is debt. In 2019, the company generated $415 million in adjusted EBITDA, which represented 9 percent of its sales. The issue is that $365 million of that profit had to go toward paying down its debt. In the bankruptcy process, Neiman Marcus has been able to convince more than 75 percent of its debtholders to exchange what they are owed for equity in the company.</li> <li>The retailer's objective now is to maximise its existing relationships with customers and meeting them where they are. To do so, it recently unveiled a new clienteling app called Neiman Marcus Connect. The app allows sales associates to connect with their individual customers wherever and however they like to shop.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/neiman-marcus-files-for-bankruptcy-can-it-survive'> Can Neiman Marcus Survive Bankruptcy?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/department-stores-2020-saks-nordstrom-neiman-marcus'> Can the American Department Store Be Saved?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/why-neiman-marcus-is-getting-rid-of-its-off-price-stores'> Why Neiman Marcus Is Getting Rid of Its Off-Price Stores</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live'>here</a>.</em><em> To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em><em> with comments, questions, or speaker ideas please </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>e-mail podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em></p> <p> </p> <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

						<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The supermodel, actress and environmental activist talks to BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks about why the fashion industry cannot return to ‘business as normal.’</em></p> <p> </p> <p>LONDON, United Kingdom — “The uncertainty has forced us to get really present.... We have an amazing opportunity to restart and to begin again,” Amber Valletta told BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks in the latest episode of The BoF Podcast. “It is an incredible opportunity to stop and really figure out where we want to go from here. We can redesign a future.”</p> <p> </p> <p>The American supermodel and actress, who has graced the cover of American <em>Vogue</em> 13 times and starred in various television and film series, including Revenge, Legends and Hitch, shared her thoughts on why the pandemic and political unrest has signalled the need for an equitable supply chain and an overhaul of the fashion calendar to reflect the industry’s “new normal.” </p> <p> </p> <ul> <li style="font-weight:400;">Following the outbreak of the coronavirus, many garment workers in countries like India and Bangladesh were left destitute as textile factories shuttered and retailers in the west cancelled orders. “Before the designers make this amazing piece, [garment workers] are the people who put in the blood, sweat and tears,” Valletta said. . “In the 21st century, we should have a supply chain that’s fair and equitable.” </li> <li style="font-weight:400;">Affecting change may not be simple but it is definitely required, Valletta said. In order to thrive in a post-pandemic climate, the fashion industry at large needs “to be resilient… which means we have to really stop doing business as normal because normal is archaic now.” For Valletta, fashion is about change and innovation: “I don’t want to work in an industry that is the same as before,” she said. </li> <li style="font-weight:400;">“Why aren’t we slowing down the calendar?,” Valletta asked, addressing the industry’s incessant output of clothes that has accelerated over the years. “I was blessed to live in the most spectacular time in fashion… the crews were smaller, everything… There was an intimacy and excitement that we don’t have today,” she said, reflecting on her modelling career. . “There was no [social media]... and there was anticipation of the next season… Everything coming at you was a discovery.”</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live'>here</a>.</em><em> To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em><em> with comments, questions, or speaker ideas please </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>e-mail podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em></p> <p> </p> <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

Aside from social media posts and one-time donations, fashion companies need to push for a larger, longer-term change. Diversity and inclusion at its core is about creating shared realities that understand what each employee is facing. “What is our relationship to each other going to be and is it going to be as fair and equitable as it can be?” asked Williams.</li> </ul>   <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/fashion-diversity-inclusion-corporate-strategies'> When Your Corporate Diversity Strategy Isn’t Enough</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/how-to-navigate-workplace-bias-discrimination'> How to Navigate the Workplace as a Minority Voice</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/how-to-create-an-inclusive-workplace'> How to Create an Inclusive Workplace</a></p>   <p><em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live'>here</a>.</em><em> To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em><em> with comments, questions, or speaker ideas please </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>e-mail podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em></p> <p> </p> <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

						<description><![CDATA[The American designer talks to BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks about the future of the industry, sustainability and runway shows.<em>To subscribe to the BoF </em> LONDON, United Kingdom —  “This is science’s moment...so my responsibility was to study as much as I could so when my turn to contribute came I would be ready,” Rick Owens told BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks in the latest episode of the BoF Podcast. “I’m concentrating on absorbing as much information, aesthetic information, that will serve me and nourish me in the future.” The American designer, who has earned a cult following for his “’grungy glamorous” aesthetic, has been spending the pandemic studying the work of English architect Edward William Godwin, as well as listening to operas including “Elektra” and “Salome” by German composer Richard Strauss. Owens shared his thoughts on why the pandemic and political unrest has accelerated the conversation around responsibility in the fashion industry. <ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet"> <li>“This period of resetting and enforced reflection has just recharged me,” Owens said. The designer revisited his past work and discussed how fashion is a powerful mode of communication. “When I think back on everything I’ve been doing I feel like I was able to do beautiful things but I was also able to talk about values that I believe in.” The outbreak of Covid-19 and the killing of George Floyd, which has led to protests across the globe, has brought conversations about fashion’s contributions to systemic racism to the surface.</li> <li>Owens pointed out that the broader discussion around sustainability is forcing brands to reassess their businesses and consumers now more than ever are holding companies to account.</li> <li>Even as lockdown measures begin to ease and designers pivot to live stream their shows, Owens underscored that runways are not obsolete. “Adorning oneself and communicating through the way you look, it’s an ancient ritual and it’s an important part of communication… [Fashion shows will] always be there in one way or another.”</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles: </p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/constructing-rick-owens-creative-bubble'> Constructing Rick Owens' Creative Bubble</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/a-year-without-fashion-shows'> A Year Without Fashion Shows</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/people/the-depraved-kindness-of-rick-owens'> The Depraved Kindness of Rick Owens</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Sign up for BoF’s Daily Digest newsletter <a href= 'http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>here</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

						<description><![CDATA[<em>The renowned stylist and fashion director talks to BoF’s Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks about his time creating under lockdown.</em>   Quarantine hasn’t stopped stylist and art director Ibrahim Kamara from creating. Although he is unable to work on his usual fantastical fashion visuals, the time spent in his London home is nonetheless far from wasted. “I might not be able to achieve my dreams right now, but I can write them and make a note of them,” Kamara told BoF’s Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks in the latest episode of the BoF Podcast. Born in Sierra Leone, Kamara moved to London in his early teens. He has since worked with some of fashion’s biggest names, including Stella McCartney, Fenty and Hermès as well as <em>British Vogue</em>, <em>Love</em> and <em>AnOther</em>. During lockdown, Kamara and Blanks touched base to talk about photography as a force for change.  <ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet"> <li>Kamara’s ethereal aesthetic pays tribute both to his West African roots and to London, the city he has lived in for the past ten years. For Kamara, the beauty of his visuals exist in this intersection of cultures. “When I’m making work, I want people to stop and take in so much,” he said. “If an image doesn’t stop you, it doesn’t really do it’s job… That’s how I make photos, I want people to look at them twice.”</li> <li>Kamara sees technology as a source of endless inspiration. It is through Instagram he met and befriended Kristin-Lee Moolman, one of Kamara’s longtime collaborators, with whom he has worked on countless projects. “It’s so good to find people who you think can bring something to your world,” he said. Social media has also upended fashion’s longstanding hierarchies, Kamara said, adding that people can now more easily collaborate on ambitious projects without the approval and support of established magazines. </li> <li>Looking to the future, Kamara hopes to inspire a new generation of young image-makers to find confidence in their ways of seeing and believe in their creative visions. Only by supporting, cultivating and promoting the next generation of creative talent can the fashion industry progress: “[I want to] push the industry [forward]… and make it a space where everyone can dream.”</li> </ul> <p> </p> Sign up for BoF’s Daily Digest newsletter here: <a href= 'http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>http://bit.ly/BoFnews</a>. <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

						<description><![CDATA[The American designer speaks to BoF’s Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks about how fashion mirrors politics. LONDON, United Kingdom — The world has changed immeasurably since designer Anna Sui’s last fashion show took place in New York in February. Her next collection is likely to reflect this transformation. “Fashion is a mirror of the times — you can define an era by the clothes,” Sui told BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks. “What people are wearing mimics the politics of the times.” Over the last few months, the world has grappled with a pandemic, a steep economic downturn and, more recently, widespread anti-racist protests. In this week’s special edition of the BoF podcast, Sui makes predictions on how these global events might impact the future of her industry.   <ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet"> <li>People have spent much of the lockdowns at home in sweats and a T-shirt. Sui believes that people might go polar opposite once social distancing restrictions are relaxed. “Suddenly [people] are going to want to be seen,” Sui said, adding that eating at restaurants and drinking at bars will once become occasions for self-expression.</li> <li>Handicrafts may see a resurgence as “people are now taking the time to relearn those skills,” Sui said. Tie dying, crocheting and knitting might well become popular creative outlets for the many people investing time in new hobbies — and this shift could be reflected in upcoming collections.</li> <li>Sui hopes the pace of the industry will slow down and allow space for self-reflection. Looking back to the 1990s, “[There] wasn’t this frantic need to be working all the time, I remember enjoying the holidays,” Sui said. “Let’s hope that this gets back under control and that we learn how to balance out our lifestyles again.”</li> </ul> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/sweatsuits-and-yoga-pants-are-selling-like-crazy-what-happens-when-lockdowns-end'> Sweatsuits and Yoga Pants Are Selling Like Crazy.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>LONDON, United Kingdom —&nbsp;&nbsp;“Magazines bring the world to you more than newspapers do and more than books do,” Graydon Carter, former editor of<em>&nbsp;Vanity Fair</em>and creator of email newsletter Air Mail, told BoF Editor-in-Chief Imran Amed in the latest episode of the BoF Podcast. “They bring the cultural nuances of what’s going on now to your door. They [tell] you about a world outside of the small town that you’re living in.”Carter’s journalism career spans over four decades, during which he was a staff writer at&nbsp;<em>Time</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Life</em>, co-founded&nbsp;<em>Spy</em>&nbsp;magazine in 1986 and served as the editor of&nbsp;<em>The New York Observer.</em>&nbsp;His “<a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/graydon-carter-to-step-down-as-vanity-fair-editor-after-25-years" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third act</a>,” the digital weekly newsletter Air Mail, employs a team of remotely working individuals from across the globe.Carter shared his thoughts on the state of the publishing industry in this time of upheaval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>An upended global economy is not uncharted territory for magazines. During the Great Recession, publications were hit hard as brands cut their advertising budgets to retain cash, Carter said. More than a decade later, magazines are faced with these same challenges, and for Carter, although there remains “a certain romance for magazines” the print industry “is going to have its issues and I think the strong magazines will survive and thrive and the weak ones will go away. That is a natural process in any industry.” The winners that emerge from this crisis will be the publications that form a connection with their readers. “You have to be the first or second favourite magazine of your reader… if you’re the fifth favourite magazine of a reader, they could probably do without you,” he said.</li><li>During his time running&nbsp;<em>Vanity Fair</em>, Carter spearheaded several newsmaking issues, including the 2015 “Call Me Caitlyn” cover, revealing Caitlyn Jenner for the first time as a woman and the “Africa Issue” that was designed to amplify the region and came with 20 special covers fronted by the likes of Muhammad Ali, Dr Maya Angelou and Barack Obama. However, his leadership was not without controversy. In a recent Netflix documentary, “Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,” allegations resurfaced that Carter removed information about the sexual abuse of Annie and Maria Farmer from an article about the disgraced billionaire written by Vicky Ward in 2003. In response to the claims, Carter said: “The legal and fact-checking elements of Vanity Fair, which was quite extensive,... is your line of defence and my head of fact-checking, my legal review editor and the lawyer for the company said we simply do not have what we needed to print this and it came in late,” he said. “In this case, they said we did not have the information we needed to publish that little bit of information in the story... I feel great pain and sorrow for the women he took advantage of, it’s an appalling situation.”</li><li>As the publishing industry pivots to adapt to a new normal, relying on digital tools like Zoom, cutting back the number of issues and reassessing the diversity of their organisations, Carter believes there are opportunities to be capitalised on. “I think there is more good journalism being produced now than there was 25 years ago… The fact is, now… you can start your own thing, you can do it on your kitchen table.” In a sea of start-ups it can be difficult to stand out, but “it’s just about being good at doing something that somebody else doesn’t do… You can make a name doing anything as long as it’s done well.”</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>The bestselling author and business professor offers his insight into the challenging market and M&A landscape that industry players of all sizes have to navigate.</p> Scott Galloway is no stranger to expressing views as provocative as they are incisive. The author, business school professor and serial entrepreneur has a lot to say about the state of the market in the era of Covid-19, but his observations and predictions are also, crucially, grounded in wider social, political and economic arguments — whether that’s the now-untenable position of American exceptionalism, the burden of student debt or the failings of intergenerational wealth distribution. Speaking in conversation with Imran Amed, Galloway shares his thoughts on the state of the luxury sector, importance of e-commerce and the indomitable power of Amazon, a company he describes as “firing on all 12,000 cylinders” yet still can’t crack the fashion market. Here are some of the key takeaways:   <ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet"> <li>“The class of IPOs that will come to the markets in the next 3-6 months will boom,” said Galloway. “I think the markets are going to accelerate but people conflate the markets with the economic health of america. The markets are nothing more than an indication of how the top decile of Europe and America are doing.” </li> <li>Amazon’s tricky relationship with fashion and luxury is hard to reconcile. “Amazon partners with an industry the way a virus partners with a host,” he said, which explains why luxury brands have traditionally kept the e-commerce giant at arm’s length. Even with the remarkable acceleration of e-commerce in the past eight weeks, however, Amazon’s algorithmically driven retail model does not allow for the forward-looking trend cycle on which the fashion industry operates.</li> <li>Luxury is a relatively well-positioned industry. “The majority of sectors in the world would pray for luxury’s problems right now,” he said, but much like big tech companies, conglomerates in the luxury space create “an unhealthy environment where too few players are allowed to [accrue] too much power... if you wanted to oxygenate the economy around luxury you would go ahead and break them up.”</li> </ul> Related Articles: <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/the-new-normal-a-darwinian-shakeout-will-create-fresh-opportunities'> The New Normal: A Darwinian Shakeout Will Create Fresh Opportunities</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/for-luxury-an-acceleration-of-the-inevitable-bof-mckinsey-state-of-fashion-coronavirus'> For Luxury, an Acceleration of the Inevitable</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/education/case-study-luxury-ecommerce-online-retail'> Case Study: The Next Wave of Luxury E-Commerce</a>      Sign up for BoF’s Daily Digest newsletter here: <a href= 'http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>http://bit.ly/BoFnews</a>. <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?

						<description><![CDATA[The New York-based “merchant prince,” best known for his time at J. Crew and <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/gap'>Gap</a>, is now watching the American retail landscape crumble as brands and retailers struggle under store shutdowns and debt restructuring. He did offer some advice, and warnings, on the state of American shopping, and what it might look like after the pandemic. <ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet"> <li>“If you’re not a micromanager, you’re not doing your job well,” said Drexler.

First up is José Neves.
