</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/vanishing-harry-pace-trailer-dolly-parton/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, Dolly Parton's America fans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're sharing a new trailer for our new 6-part series The Vanishing of Harry Pace -from the creators of Dolly Parton's America, Jad Abumrad and Shima Oliaee - now premiering at &lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/projects/vanishing-harry-pace"&gt;Radiolab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Motown before Motown, FUBU before FUBU: Black Swan Records. The label founded 100 years ago by Harry Pace. Pace launched the career of Ethel Waters, Louis Armstrong, inadvertently invented the term rock n roll, played an important role in W.C. Handy becoming "Father of the Blues," inspired Ebony and Jet magazines, and helped desegregate the South Side of Chicago in an epic Supreme Court battle. Then, he disappeared. The Vanishing of Harry Pace is a series about the phenomenal but forgotten man who changed America. It's a story about betrayal, family, hidden identities, and a time like no other.&lt;/p&gt;

The answer is deeply surprising. In this episode, Dolly tells a story of finding God in an abandoned church filled with X-rated graffiti.  And she speaks of her plans for how she'll be remembered after she’s gone—how her voice will live on for the next 50, 100, 200 years.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dixie-disappearance/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode delves into the controversy surrounding Dolly Parton’s Stampede (formerly known as “Dolly Parton’s &lt;span data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb=""&gt;Dixie&lt;/span&gt; Stampede”)—a dinner theater that presents the Civil War as a friendly competition between neighbors. In the wake of the Charlottesville Riots in 2017, the &lt;span data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb=""&gt;Dixie&lt;/span&gt; Stampede was called out by the press, and then became embroiled in the larger national conversation about Civil War monuments and the white-washing of history. Dolly’s business conglomerate decided to eliminate “&lt;span data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb=""&gt;Dixie&lt;/span&gt;” from the name, which caused further uproar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dolly embodies “a quivering mass of irreconcilable contradictions” in a way very few other American figures do… but has America arrived at a place where such contradictions are no longer defensible or tolerable? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This episode tells the story of the “Porter years,” the period during which Dolly arguably discovers her power - both as a performer and songwriter - and then makes the difficult (and radical for its time) decision to strike out on her own. Through interviews with Dolly, country music star Marty Stuart, Wagonmaster Buck Trent, and Porter’s daughter Deborah Wagoner, we explore how Dolly handled what’s sometimes called the great “hillbilly divorce” with such characteristic grace. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Helen Morales, author of “Pilgrimage to Dollywood,” gave us a stern directive – look at the lyrics! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we dive into &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dolly’s discography, starting with the early period of what Dolly calls “sad ass songs” to find remarkably prescient words of female pain, slut-shaming, domestic violence, and women being locked away in asylums by cheating husbands. We explore how Dolly took the centuries-old tradition of the Appalachian “murder ballad”—an oral tradition of men singing songs about brutally killing women—and flipped the script, singing from the woman’s point of view. And as her career progresses, the songs expand beyond the pain to tell tales of leaving abuse behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How can such pro-woman lyrics come from someone who despises the word feminism? Dolly explains.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
