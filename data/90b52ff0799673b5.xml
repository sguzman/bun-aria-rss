   <media:description>This video is a fast-paced introduction to Spacetime Algebra (STA), which is the geometric algebra of Minkowski space.  In it, we figure out what the problems are with the way introductory textbooks usually describe special relativity and how we can solve those problems by using spacetime and redefining length in terms of the spacetime interval.  This creates Spacetime Algebra.  We then study STA and learn about spacetime splits and Lorentz transformations.

This video is my submission for SoME2, and just in time too!  It was probably the hardest video to make that I've ever done because of the length of the video and the difficulty of the material being presented.  In the end, I hope it can be of use to you.

Here's a link to my original video on geometric algebra: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60z_hpEAtD8
I also have an important addendum that I made to that video as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bOiy0HVMqA

When it comes to resources for applications of STA, you can't go wrong with Doran and Lasenby's Geometric Algebra for Physicists.  It includes chapters on every topic discussed here.  Here's a few other resources:
Relativistic Mechanics: New Foundations for Classical Mechanics by Hestenes, although he actually uses VGA instead of STA
Electrodynamics: Understanding Geometric Algebra for Electromagnetic Theory (starts out in VGA but switches to STA later on)
Relativistic Quantum Mechanics: Spacetime Algebra by Hestenes.  Also, everything on https://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/html/GAinQM.html is good, and it includes some information on the zitterbewegung interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Gauge Theory Gravity: The original paper describing GTG is &quot;Gravity, Gauge Theories and Geometric Algebra&quot; which can be found online on arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0405033

   <media:description>This video is an alternative introduction to trigonometry that uses oscillations, not triangles, as its starting point.  In my experience, thinking of trigonometry in terms of oscillations makes much more sense than using triangles.  Furthermore, it shows us that one of our fundamental mathematical constants is not what you think it is...

Happy τ day!  Here's a link to the τ manifesto: https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto

To actually calculate the sine and the cosine, you need some calculus.  Here is how we do this.  In the video, we said that the magnitude of the spring's acceleration is equal to the magnitude of its displacement, and the acceleration points in the opposite direction of the displacement.  This leads to the differential equation y'' = -y.  Then the sine is the solution to this equation with the initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 1.  The cosine is the solution to this equation with the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0.  From this description, there are a few options for how to solve this equation:
1. You can use generic numerical analysis techniques.  Most of the simple differential equation algorithms aren't that accurate though.
2. From y'' = -y, we in general have y^(n) = -y^(n - 2).  We can use this to determine the value of the (co)sine and all of its derivatives at 0, and then use this to find the Taylor series around zero.  For example, sin(0) = 0, sin'(0) = 1, sin''(0) = 0, sin'''(0) = -1, sin^(4)(0) = 0, sin^(5)(0) = 1, ...  This leads to the Taylor series sin(x) = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - x^7/7! + ...  Around zero, this Taylor series can be pretty accurate with only a few terms, and then because the sine and cosine are periodic we can add or subtract multiples of τ to get the input close enough to zero for the accuracy to be high.
3. If you want to learn more about this subject, you can look up various algorithms such as CORDIC.

   <media:description>Some spanning sets are better than others.  But what are the properties that make one spanning sets better than another one?  In this video, we focus on one important property that vectors can have: linear independence. 

This video was a pain to make!  It took me a long time to find a way to describe linear dependence/independence in a way that felt intuitive to me.  I hope that the video was worth the wait.

This video is a part of &quot;From Zero to Geo&quot;, a series where we formulate geometric algebra, an incredibly powerful branch of mathematics, from the ground up.  Full playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVuwZXwFua-0Ks3rRS4tIkswgUmDLqqRy

   <media:description>This video is an addendum to my most popular video, A Swift Introduction to Geometric Algebra.  It clears up some misunderstandings that have arisen from the original video, and then describes two useful ways of understanding the geometric product.  This also leads to a discussion of the other flavors of geometric algebra, such as PGA and CGA.

If you want to learn geometric algebra at a much slower pace, check out my video series From Zero to Geo.  Here's a link to the playlist for it: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVuwZXwFua-0Ks3rRS4tIkswgUmDLqqRy

   <media:description>While we learned in the last video how to describe spaces with vectors, it can be helpful to be able to describe spaces with just a few vectors.  In this video, we explore how to do this.  This leads us to consider the important ideas of linear combinations and spans.

   <media:description>What is space?  In this video, we learn about the many different things that we might call &quot;space&quot;.  We come up with both a geometric and an algebraic definition, and the discussion also leads us to the important concept of subspaces.

Sorry for how long this video took to make!  I mentioned in a community post that I had personal things interfering with making this video, but even after that was out of the way, this video was really hard to make.  I kept rewriting parts of it to be less confusing, and a few changes I made required drastic modifications to whole video (for example, I was originally going to define linear combinations here but then decided to wait until the next video, but I had used linear combinations in the rest of this video so I had to remove all references to them).  Hopefully the video is worth the wait.

   <media:description>How can you add vectors?  In this video, we look at the addition of numbers to find a way to define addition for vectors.  We also explore how to find the negative of a vector and how to subtract vectors.

This video is a part of &quot;From Zero to Geo&quot;, a series where we formulate geometric algebra, an incredibly powerful branch of mathematics, from the ground up.  Full playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVuwZXwFua-0Ks3rRS4tIkswgUmDLqqRy

   <media:description>How do you find the length of a vector?  And how do you change that length?  We'll answer that in this video, and we will see that finding the length of a vector is like finding the absolute value, and that scaling a vector is like multiplication.

   <media:description>Why do we care about vectors?  Vectors are an incredibly important concept both in geometric algebra and in modern mathematics in general.  In this video, I show the motivation for the interpretation of vectors as arrows.  After that, I describe the basics of this conception of vectors.

   <media:description>This video is the introduction to my series on geometric algebra, From Zero to Geo.  In this series, we will build geometric algebra from the ground up, starting from just high school algebra.  My hope is that this series can be used by motivated high schoolers (or anybody above that level) to learn geometric algebra.

And yes, I do know that a few of the things I presented aren't quite correct (such as when I reflected a shape across a line or when I divided by a bivector).  The point of this video is just to be an introduction to the series, not to teach anything.

Also, I can't make videos this fast!  I actually had almost finished this one before deciding to make the calculus one for SoME1.

&quot;But sudgy,&quot; I hear you say, &quot;you haven't finished the series yet!  I want to learn geometric algebra now!&quot;  If you want to, you can try learning through the materials that I learned from.  I learned mainly from some of David Hestenes' work such as his Oersted medal paper (http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf/OerstedMedalLecture.pdf) and his book &quot;New Foundations for Classical Mechanics&quot;.  Another very helpful resource for me was Doran and Lasenby's &quot;Geometric Algebra for Physicists&quot;.  Other books that I've heard great things about but didn't use while learning are MacDonald's &quot;Linear and Geometric Algebra&quot; (which is the most beginner-friendly book of the bunch) and Dorst et al's &quot;Geometric Algebra for Computer Science&quot;.  However, many of the things I've learned about geometric algebra I learned through random papers and discussions with others.  Some of the things I've learned I figured out for myself, too.

   <media:description>This video presents a new method for expository mathematical material: the Developmental Method.  It focuses on discovering mathematics ourselves rather than blindly following a textbook.  To describe this method, most of the video is me developing calculus using the method.  It is important that you will have already learned at least the basics of calculus before watching this video, because the point is to compare this method of presenting calculus with the traditional method.  While I produced the video mainly for people who create expository mathematical material, I'm sure many people might enjoy some of the insights into calculus that are present.

   <media:description>This video is an introduction to geometric algebra, a severely underrated mathematical language that can be used to describe almost all of physics.  This video was made as a presentation for my lab that I work in.  While I had the people there foremost in my mind when making this, I realized that this might be useful to the general public, so I also tried to make this useful to others as well.

This video was made using manim (https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim), a math animation library.

Several things in this video were incorrectly simplified.  Please watch the video before reading the rest of the description.

Before I get into the things that were incorrectly simplified, I need to state a few definitions.  The grade of a k-vector is defined to be k.  A blade is defined to be the outer product of vectors.  A k-blade is a blade of grade k.  Some of the terminology between linear algebra and geometric algebra can be confusing, such as the use of the terms vector space and dimension.  Because multivectors form their own vector space, but we don't consider all of them to be vectors, some people use the term linear space instead of vector space.  While we think of dimension in terms of spatial degrees of freedom, the mathematical definition means that the 3D geometric algebra shown here is actually eight-dimensional.  This is part of the reason for the distinction between the terms grade and dimension.

The following are the things that I purposefully got wrong to make things simpler:

The biggest thing I glossed over is the distinction between blades and vectors.  A lot of the ways that I described k-vectors intuitively actually only applied to k-blades, not k-vectors.  For example, in four or more dimensions, all 2-blades can be represented as an oriented area, but not all 2-vectors can.  I didn't mention this fact for two reasons: first, for a first look, the distinction is not that important.  Second, the distinction doesn't even matter until you reach four or more dimensions.  In three dimensions, all k-vectors are k-blades.

My use of the term basis was not quite right, and I should have used the term &quot;orthonormal basis&quot;.  I wanted this video to be understood by people who had learned about vectors in a physics class where they don't go into too much detail about the exact definitions a linear algebra class would give you, so I didn't want to use the term orthonormal.  I tried to mitigate this somewhat by always using terms like &quot;the basis&quot; and assuming that it was known that I meant the standard orthonormal basis.  Hopefully this doesn't cause any confusion.

I mentioned that the inner product can get complicated when generalized to generic blades.  What I didn't mention is that there is a large amount of disagreement on what this generalization is.  I've seen at least five different extensions of the inner product to higher-grade blades.  I didn't mention this because it was not pertinent to the discussion.  However, even though I didn't talk much about the inner and outer products in this video, they are essential to the usage of geometric algebra in many applications.

This wasn't necessarily wrong, but I assumed that space is Euclidean throughout the video.  In some applications, especially in relativity, space is not Euclidean, and a few things aren't the same.

In general, the pseudoscalar for a geometric algebra is the highest-grade element, but this does not always square to -1.  In the three main applications of geometric algebra (2D Euclidean space, 3D Euclidean space, and 4D Minkowski space), this does happen to be the case, but in general it is not true.

When I mentioned dividing vectors, I didn't mention the fact that when dividing, you have to &quot;divide on the left&quot; or &quot;divide on the right&quot; because multiplication is not commutative.  I actually prefer just to divide by multiplying by the inverse, because then you don't have to worry about how you're dividing.  I didn't mention this because I never mentioned inverses again after I introduced them.

Another issue with inverses is that while vectors have inverses, not all multivectors have inverses.  Also, in other spaces, such as the Minkowski space used in relativity, even some vectors don't have inverses.  Again, this was because I didn't really use inverses much after this.

This one is small, but we assumed several properties of the geometric product that we didn't prove or state, such as distributivity and associativity.  To be precise, the set of multivectors along with addition and the geometric product forms an associative algebra.  I defined the geometric product in a bit of a roundabout way and I couldn't find a good place to insert these facts.  The kind of people this video is aiming at are those who don't know a lot of abstract algebra and so I assumed that they would assume associativity and distributivity.

Rotors actually have many different definitions, so don't always think of them as a complex exponential.</media:description>

   <media:description>This is a cover of Creation Calls by Brian Doerksen.

I actually did this for a homework assignment, and was a bit rushed.  As such, the quality is not as good as I would like.  I've also switched operating systems since my last video and had to switch to a different video editor.  For some reason, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't quite get the audio and video to sync up.  Oh well.</media:description>
