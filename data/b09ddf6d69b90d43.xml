   <media:description>Why the Congressional midterms matter so much.

Subscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

On January 6th, 2021 (yes, during the capitol riots) the final Senate race of the 2020 election was called for a Democrat. All of a sudden Democrats had achieved something improbable: trifecta control of the presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives. It transformed the possibilities for Biden‚Äôs first two years, giving his party the ability to legislate on their own - which they did.

The trillion-dollar stimulus, the infrastructure bill, the climate investments of the Inflation Reduction Act ‚Äî all of that was only possible because of unified Democratic control. But even under divided government, both houses of Congress will still wield an enormous amount of power over national affairs and policy. That‚Äôs why the 2022 election isn‚Äôt just a referendum on whether Democrats should keep Congress ‚Äî it‚Äôs a question of who gets that power, and how they‚Äôll use it. And there are three ways it could all play out.

Lithium-ion batteries are a transformative technology in the fight against climate change. Most notably, they power electric vehicles, which have the potential to replace emissions produced by road transportation. 

But there‚Äôs a problem. These batteries require nickel. And in Indonesia, where the majority of nickel is produced, the production process emits large amounts of carbon and pollution. It‚Äôs impacting the people who live by the production centers, who are registering an increase in respiratory illnesses. The US is essentially outsourcing carbon emissions and pollution in exchange for green energy. 

It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. Indonesia sits along the Ring of Fire, one of the most geologically active regions in the world, making it an ideal place to produce geothermal energy.

Geothermal energy taps into the heat beneath the ground mostly found in volcanic regions. To use the heat beneath the earth‚Äôs surface, we need to drill into the ground, draw up the hot water, and use it to turn turbines that produce electricity. After, the water is funneled back underground, making geothermal a mostly clean and renewable energy source. 

While the exploration and development process of geothermal energy can be expensive, Indonesia already has more than 30 active geothermal facilities. 

As the world‚Äôs need for lithium-ion batteries increases, Indonesia and the companies invested in the region have the opportunity to make their processes greener from start to finish ‚Äî and protect the people that live next to nickel production centers.

To understand the repercussions of nickel production in Indonesia and how geothermal energy could help fix the air pollution and emissions it produces, watch our video.

   <media:description>Mass timber has gone from novelty to trend. But how does it change the construction process?

Is there a way to replace steel and concrete with wood? That‚Äôs the idea behind mass timber ‚Äî a relatively new construction technique that‚Äôs making its way from Europe to the United States.

In the above video, you can learn how mass timber changes the construction process. Vox‚Äôs Phil Edwards visited Ascent Milwaukee, the tallest mass timber building in the world, to see how it all comes together. Many different partners have to reinvent the construction process to make a building like this a reality.

Watch the video above to learn more.

   <media:description>Lula da Silva wants to be president for a second time. But Brazil has changed.

On October 2, 2022, Brazilians voted in the first round of their presidential election. The top two finishers were current president Jair Bolsonaro and former president Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. Both candidates will face each other in a run-off on October 30. Lula is considered likely to win. 

Lula is arguably Brazil‚Äôs most well-known and complex politician. He helped form a powerful political party, had two successful terms in office, and even served jail time over corruption and bribery allegations. After four years of Bolsonaro‚Äôs presidency, the core of Lula‚Äôs campaign has focused on restoring the Brazil of his own presidency. But a lot has changed in Brazil since his time in office.

Watch this video for a glance at Lula‚Äôs career and to understand why his second time as president would be very different than his first.

   <media:description>Jake Blount, a banjo scholar, explains.

Jake Blount has built a career out of understanding the banjo‚Äôs connection to Black American folk music. In this video, he walks us through the instrument‚Äôs history ‚Äî from West Africa to enslaved people in the US to the early record industry ‚Äî to explain how Black folk music has evolved. 

For example: The early record industry confined Black musicians to ‚Äúrace records‚Äù and white musicians to ‚Äúhillbilly records.‚Äù Hillbilly music would have been early country and string band music. Race records restricted Black musicians to blues and jazz genres. Which meant Black musicians playing bluegrass-style banjo weren‚Äôt recorded ‚Äî even if they were responsible for teaching white musicians.  

Using field recordings, their own banjo and fiddle skills, and a deconstructed version of one of their own songs, Jake explains how Black musicians have long been left out of the current canon of folklore recordings and American folk music history. And what he‚Äôs doing to keep the tradition alive, with fresh observations and a musical style that looks both forward and backward.  

This video was filmed on location at Hancock Shaker Village in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

   <media:description>Do the benefits of zoos justify the fact that some animals are clearly stressed out?

Many of us have fond memories of visiting the zoo as a child (or at any age), and more than a few of us probably credit those visits with turning us into animal-lovers. So, how should we square those warm fuzzy feelings with research that shows the psychological harms of captivity for some animals? 

That‚Äôs what Vox subscriber Gaurav Patil wanted to know, so producer Liz Scheltens started digging in. One way that zoos maintain their social license to operate despite our growing understanding of the harms to certain species is by marketing themselves as beacons of conservation. 

Proponents argue that not only do zoos help preserve endangered wild populations, they also help make humans better conservationists. But when you look at the research, a different picture starts to emerge. 

Check out the video above to learn more.

   <media:description>The way a football moves through the air is almost paradoxical.

Subscribe and turn on notifications üîî so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

When a football player throws a tight spiral pass, the ball glides through the air in a smooth arc, its nose pointing up toward the sky at the beginning of the toss, and then dropping down toward the earth as it lands in the receiver's hands.

The spiral pass is so familiar it‚Äôs easily overlooked as just being common sense ‚Äî but it took physicists nearly 20 years to understand this trajectory.

Conservation of angular momentum suggests that the ball should not act this way. It should either keep its nose angled toward the sky the whole time or the ball should be flipping over itself as it moves through the air; but the fact that it just tips over elegantly is ‚Äî to use a scientific term ‚Äî weird as hell. 

But it turns out the solution is easy enough to understand ‚Äî as long as you have a spinning top.

   <media:description>The design secrets that make hiking trails feel ‚Äúorganic‚Äù

Subscribe and turn on notifications üîî so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Designing a hiking trail seems simple enough: It has to take a person from A to B, pass through scenic nature, and last through years of wear and tear. And for most of human history, trails did that without much intentional design at all.

But as trails shifted from essential transportation to a recreational destination, the way we make them did, too. Now, hidden in every trail is a carefully made design language of angles, alignment, and materials that keep them enjoyable for generations.

Watch our video to hear trail ecologist Jeffery Marion explain how these principles work ‚Äî and why they‚Äôre more important now than ever.

   <media:description>Can we actually kill all the spotted lanternflies?

Subscribe and turn on notifications üîî so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Over the summer, for the first time in what feels like a while, Americans united under a single cause: to murder an invasive bug.

Okay, that‚Äôs a bit dramatic, but the situation itself was a bit dramatic. Social media was flooded with people in New York City, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey striking down spotted lanternflies in the most creative ways. Videos of the plant-sucking bugs that are native to parts of Asia showed them overtaking trees. Reports from Pennsylvania said they were capable of wiping out vineyards. Researchers warned they also threaten fruit trees and the hardwoods like black walnut. The public went on high alert. The messaging was clear: Stop this bug before it decimates the fruit and timber industries and costs the US tons of money.

People struck them down all summer long, and now that it‚Äôs fall ‚Ä¶ well, they‚Äôre still here. And they‚Äôve spread.

Is it futile? That depends. If you set out with your flyswatters and sticky traps thinking we could wipe out every lanternfly, then you were a bit misguided. But just because we can‚Äôt stop them entirely doesn‚Äôt mean we should quit. 

Kristie Reddick, an entomologist and director of The Bug Chicks, put it best: ‚ÄúPeople cleaning trash out of creeks aren't going to be like, ‚ÄòOh, I picked up, like, three bags of trash and there's still more trash. I guess there's just trash now.‚Äô‚Äù Spotted lanternflies are the trash in this metaphor. 

Check out the video above to find out more about spotted lanternflies and the part humans have played in spreading them around the US.

   <media:description>The SC Johnson administrative building was Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äôs corporate masterpiece. What does it feel like?

SC Johnson‚Äôs Administrative Building and Research Tower in Racine, Wisconsin, have become legendary as corporate headquarters buildings. The Administrative Building‚Äôs Great Workroom is a stunning example of architect Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äôs unique approach to office design.

But what did it really feel like? Vox‚Äôs Phil Edwards visited the HQ to find out ‚Äî and try actually working there. He also visited the Hardy House, an earlier Wright design that features many of the same Wright signatures found in the SC Johnson building, from custom designed furniture to ideas about compression and expansion.

Watch the video to see what it really feels like to work in such a space.

Further Reading:
https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Johnson-Buildings/dp/048642748X
Jonathan Lipman‚Äôs book about Sc Johnson is one of the best-sourced and most comprehensive books about the building‚Äôs history.

https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Lloyd-Wrights-Hardy-House/dp/0764937618
Mark Hertzberg‚Äôs exhaustive knowledge of the Hardy House ‚Äî and his experiencing photographing it ‚Äî is evident in his book about the building. His blog, Wright in Racine (https://wrightinracine.wordpress.com/) also has great facts and stories about Wright‚Äôs work.

SC Johnson provides free tours of the Administrative Building as well as of Wingspread, a nearby home that Wright also designed.

   <media:description>Hint: water scarcity in the Western US has more to do with our diets than our lawns.

The Western United States is currently battling the most severe drought in thousands of years. A mix of bad water management policies and manmade climate change has created a situation where water supplies in Western reservoirs are so low, states are being forced to cut their water use. 

It‚Äôs not hard to find media coverage that focuses on the excesses of residential water use: long showers, swimming pools, lawn watering, at-home car washes. Or in the business sector, like irrigating golf courses or pumping water into hotel fountains in Las Vegas. 

But when a team of researchers looked at water use in the West, they uncovered a very different story about where most Western water goes. Their findings may hold the solution to dwindling water supplies in the West. 

Check out the video above to learn more, and take a look at the study that this story is centered on: https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/323061602.pdf

   <media:description>The Commonwealth, explained.

After centuries of colonizing much of the world, the British Empire began its fast descent in the 1960s amid a global wave of independence movements. But when Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022, she was not only still queen of 14 countries besides the United Kingdom, she was also still the leader of an organization that on a map looks a lot like the British Empire.

The British Empire created the first iteration of the Commonwealth to appease white settler colonies looking for more autonomy. It granted them more independence to govern themselves but kept them under the crown. As British leaders realized their power might be at risk throughout their colonies worldwide, the monarchy made a play to keep ties and preserve their global influence by allowing newly independent republics to join the Commonwealth too. The only catch: They had to accept the queen as the leader of the organization. With the death of Queen Elizabeth II, this vestige of the British Empire is now under the leadership of King Charles III. So, what exactly is the Commonwealth? Why is it still here? And will it survive?

Correction: A previous version of this video mistakenly showed Myanmar as a member of the Commonwealth on a 1994 map, mislabeled Sierra Leone and Gold Coast for a brief moment on a 1927 map, and omitted Greenland, all of which have now been corrected. 

We have also clarified that India became a republic shortly after independence with a new line of narration at 3:12; corrected Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs title at 00:16 and 00:47; and updated the date Barbados became a republic from November 29, 2021, to November 30, 2021.
