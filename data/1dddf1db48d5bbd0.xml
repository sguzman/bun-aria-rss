      <title>Ep 120: Gayest Month</title>

      <description>Go to Function of Beauty now to take your Hair Goals Quiz and save 25% on your first order.

In This Episode: Erika starts the episode out with a listener telling us about the red flags their father gives, then a woman wants to know if they are an asshole for embarrassing their father in law by asking him to explain his unfunny joke, next a pregnant wife leaves the party after her husband makes the worst toast possible, and a listener wants to know if they are the asshole for not inviting their senile grandma to her baby shower. And for this week's Circle Jerdge Christian teaches everyone a bunch of new words in different languages.

      <title>Ep 105: Big Baking Soda is behind Inflation! feat. GhostHoney</title>
      <description>In This Episode: We brought on a very special guest, Ghosthoney aka Tyler Gaca, to help us judge our longest story YET! We have a "friend" who demands to be part of a new relationship, this boyfriend swears Mr. Floppy-Ear's is trying to end his marriage, and a listener sends in some secret family tea from their grandma. And for this week's Circle Jerdge Christian gives us a peak into the baking soda conspiracy world.

      <title>Ep 99: Sticky Bean Bags ft. EmoJoseph</title>

We have boyfriend made about the bikini his girlfriend wore, a role-player gets kicked from a party because of his race, a neckbeard reaches to the internet to help find the perfect gift, and a listener sends in a wild submission. And for this week's Circle Jerdge we read some Judgies fan fiction to EmoJoseph.

      <description>In This Episode: We go over a D&amp;D session turn sour when DM's ex-girlfriend comes to play, a girlfriend wants to know if she shouldn't have called her boyfriend a beta, a wife sides with her husband over her brother after he kicks him out of the engagement party, a listener gets annoyed with her boyfriend about his mom, and a listener has arguably the worst roommate of all time. All Josh does Christian and Erika a favor by finding them some possible baby names.

Christian also got Josh-isms from his co-workers perspective!

      <title>Ep 62: We Want Mail!</title>
      <link>https://anchor.fm/the-judgies</link>
      <description>*********Disclaimer: We removed a story that was being used to harass an individual.  The story was fabricated, yet targeted, and we do not stand for that.  Sorry for any inconvenience to our listeners, but we do not want any hate or harassment to be derived from our content. ********

Today's proceedings:  A wild fan fic, a relationship turns south when baby talk is introduced, a best man goes nuclear in his wedding speech, and a listener has a potential problem with her boyfriend's parents.  Josh also goes over some Aurora-isms and some jokes that didn't land at work.     We also launched our P.O. box, so feel free to send us whatever!

      <link>https://anchor.fm/the-judgies</link>
      <description>Today's proceedings:  We announce new merch available NOW, designed by Christian! SHEEESH! We also delve into the possibility of #NotAllMen are garbage (spoiler alert, they are).  A man gives his girlfriend's brother some dating advice, a man is upset with his girlfriend's old look, a hook up session goes wrong after an interruption, and a teen mistakes his girlfriend's mom for some one else.  We also delve into our horoscopes from the day of recording as well as in 1979!

      <link>https://anchor.fm/the-judgies</link>
      <description>Today's proceedings: We welcome new listeners from Headgum's "If I Were You" as we deliberate over a man accidentally finding a new fetish, a woman having and unplanned bathroom break, a toothless first kiss, and a man who accidentally gained a murder of crow bodyguards.  Also, in this week's Circle Jurdge, Josh calls out Christian for last week's Circle Jurdge fiasco.
