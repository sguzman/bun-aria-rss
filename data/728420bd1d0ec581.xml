      <title>Cholesterol, metabolic health and heart disease | Dr Alan Flanagan and Danny Lennon</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/cholesterol-metabolic-health-and-heart-disease-dr-alan-flanagan-and-danny-lennon/</link>
      <description>In Episode #231, I sit down with Dr Alan Flanagan and Danny Lennon to examine cholesterol, statins, the ketogenic diet, and longevity. Dr Alan Flanagan and Danny Lennon address whether cholesterol matters if you’re metabolically healthy, why our veins don’t get atherosclerosis, and why our body makes cholesterol if it’s “bad for us”. They also offer advice on dietary adjustments you can make regardless of your dietary pattern, claims by social media “health gurus”, and much more.
LDL cholesterol has been making waves on social media in recent years. With some diet camps making bold claims about its relevance and the apparently open-ended nature of the evidence, many folks are no doubt left unsure of how important cholesterol levels really are. In this episode, I’m joined by Danny Lennon and Dr Alan Flanagan to consider the role and importance of LDL cholesterol as we recap what the literature says.
Specifically, we discuss:

Intro (0:00)

Basics of Cardiovascular Health (4:29)

ApoB for Predicting Disease (12:18)

Heart Disease: Where things go wrong (23:23)

What Causes Artery Damage? (38:47)

Paul Saladino Claims (50:36)

Is low cholesterol a problem? (1:04:07)

Future of Gene Editing (1:27:12)

Veins vs Arteries (1:32:28)

Diet Claims (1:41:08)

Healthy Keto Diet (1:54:08)

MCT Oil (2:00:02)

Healthy Fats (2:03:28)

Final Thoughts (2:09:54)

Outro (2:19:05)


You can find Dr Alan Flanagan on Instagram, and learn more about Alinea Nutrition at https://www.alineanutrition.com/. Listen to his previous appearances on the show in Episode #159, Episode #225, and Episode #227.
To connect with Danny Lennon, head to his on Instagram and Twitter. Make sure to check out the Sigma Nutrition website and podcast. Danny previously appeared on The Proof in Episode #173.
Discover additional resources, supporting studies, and more insights in the full show notes.

      <title>Can dairy be regenerative? | Ecologist Nicholas Carter</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/can-dairy-be-regenerative-ecologist-nicholas-carter/</link>
      <description>In Episode #230, I’m joined by ecologist Nicholas Carter to examine the role of dairy and other animal foods on the environment. We discuss the implications of our food choices, detailing the impact of dairy specifically. Nicholas Carter breaks down the ways we measure environmental impact, and the strengths and shortfalls of these systems. We also cover “carbon neutral” dairy, regenerative grazing, biodiversity loss, and much more.
Over the course of recent episodes, we’ve worked towards building a more comprehensive picture of the topics covered. Alongside some incredible guests, we’ve covered the theory, mechanisms, and implementation of exercise, and this episode we continue building out this broader view with dairy. In Episode #225, Dr Alan Flanagan honed in on the health implications of dairy. Today, I sit down with Nicholas Carter to examine the planetary effects of dairy production and consumption, helping you make more informed decisions in support of sustainability.

Specifically, we discuss:

Intro (0:00)

What Causes Climate Change (2:22)

Agriculture Today vs in the Past (7:06)

Biodiversity Loss (11:28)

Incentives for Sustainability (17:26)

Cattle Grazing &amp; Wildfires (25:15)

Red Meat &amp; Dairy (28:40)

Global Dairy Production (30:55)

Myths about Regenerative Agriculture (36:03)

Comparing Sheep/Cow Milk (45:46)

‘Carbon Neutral’ Dairy (47:35)

Milk Substitutions (58:50)

Precision Fermentation (1:06:36)

Diet for Planetary Health (1:10:22)

Future of Food (1:16:23)

Outro (1:22:12)


To connect with or reach out to Nicholas Carter, you can find him on Twitter and Instagram. For more information on environmental welfare, find an abundance of resources and summaries of the most reputable research on Nicholas’ website, https://www.plantbaseddata.org/. Listen to Episode #225 with Alan Flanagan to learn about the human health aspect of dairy consumption.

      <link>https://theproof.com/specific-exercise-to-avoid-disease-and-live-longer-with-dr-paul-taylor/</link>
      <description>In Episode #229, I’m joined by Paul Taylor to discuss how to exercise to live better for longer. We cover the importance of intermittent stressors, the relative impact of nutrition and exercise, and the significance of biological evolution in health. Paul also breaks down exactly how to build an exercise regimen, with considerations for age and gender.
Over the past month, The Proof has increasingly explored the role of exercise in relation to long-term health outcomes. In today’s episode, we build on previous conversations with an overarching goal: to consolidate our learning so far, giving you practical and tangible information to implement into your own lifestyle. Paul Taylor offers his advice on how to better your personal exercise routine through realistic recommendations, setting you up for a long health span.

Specifically, we discuss:

Intro (0:00)

Paul’s Navy Experience (4:32)

Good Stress (9:28)

Paul’s Boxing (21:22)

Exercise vs Nutrition - What Matters More? (25:56)

Cardiovascular Fitness (34:58)

Myokines and Longevity (40:03)

How Much Exercise? (49:25)

Referencing Biological Evolution (54:10)

A Multi-Modal Exercise Plan (59:56)

Age &amp; Gender Training (1:13:18)

Death by Comfort (1:24:46)

Outro (1:27:38)


To connect with Paul Taylor, you can find him on Instagram or LinkedIn. Listen to his podcast, The MindBodyBrain Project, and learn more on his website. Paul’s new book, Death by Comfort, is now available for preorder.

      <title>How much protein do we need | Dr Stuart Phillips and Dr Christopher Gardner</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/how-much-protein-do-we-need-with-stuart-phillips-phd-and-christopher-gardner-phd/</link>
      <description>In Episode #228, I sit down with Dr Stuart Phillips and Dr Christopher Gardner for a discourse on how much protein we really need. We discuss nitrogen balance, lack of protein vs lack of exercise, and protein restriction. We also cover protein quality, satiety, and environmental considerations. Recommended daily intake (RDA) is a key factor in this conversation, with discussion points including its definition, the studies used to inform it, and whether you should eat above it.
There is ongoing conversation about protein requirements across all eating patterns, with this contentious topic often sparking debate on social media. With protein regularly used as a marketing tool or to push an agenda, many online sources are diluted and separated from the evidence. Dr Gardner and Dr Phillips – both from different fields – have recently taken varying stances on protein, engaging in a Twitter dialogue. In this episode, we bring both of their informed perspectives to the table, and ask: how much do their opinions really differ?

Specifically, we discuss:

Intro (0:00)

Analyzing the RDA for Protein (3:13)

What is Optimal? (17:36)

Dr. Gardner’s Approach to Protein (22:25)

Aging &amp; Muscle Preservation (33:38)

How much is TOO much? (38:32)

Plant Protein (44:21)

Environmental Concerns (56:54)

Satiety (1:01:52)

Outro (1:07:24)

      <title>The carnivore diet, veganism and nutrition misinformation | Dr Alan Flanagan</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/the-carnivore-diet-veganism-and-nutrition-misinformation-with-dr-alan-flanagan/</link>
      <description>In Episode #227, I sit down with Alan Flanagan, PhD and Drew Harrisberg to discuss the carnivore diet and veganism, assessing many of the popular claims made by health and nutrition “influencers”. We discuss Big Pharma, social media censorship, and vegan protein intake. We also zoom in on the ethics of veganism, spotting a legitimate academic, and why socioeconomic and environmental factors impact nutrition decisions.
In the current social media climate, it is crucial that we develop the skills necessary to analyse the validity of nutritional claims. During this week’s episode, The Proof welcomes two fan favourites to the show to cover a broad scope of topics in a well-rounded discussion, uncovering the reasoning behind a number of these claims and informing listeners on how to assess them.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Training Injuries (7:40)

Climate Change (14:44)

Misinformation &amp; Liver King (18:54)

Should Platforms Censor? (30:25)

Mark Zuckerberg on Rogan (35:30)

Paul Saladino &amp; Trusting Science (39:50)

Big Pharma/ Big Food (50:14)

How to Communicate with Transparency, Asking the Right Questions (57:35)

Danger of Bodybuilding (1:09:13)

Socioeconomic Barriers to Healthy Living (1:16:38)

Identifying with Diet (1:32:39)

Vegan Protein Intake (1:39:20)

Well-Planned Veganism (1:57:53)

Habits of Social Media Quacks (2:00:29)

Alan’s Diet (2:16:00)

Canola oil in a healthy diet? (2:28:17)

Seed Oil Debate Episode (2:32:08)

Veganism &amp; Ethics (2:36:33)

Red Meat &amp; Carnivore Diets (3:00:22)

Meal Timing &amp; TRE (3:27:45)

Supplement Recommendations (3:39:07)

Conclusion (3:41:46)

      <title>Exercising for brain health | Drs Dean &amp; Ayesha Sherzai</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/exercising-for-brain-health-with-drs-dean-ayesha-sherzai/</link>
      <description>In Episode #226, I’m joined by Drs Ayesha and Dean Sherzai to examine how exercise impacts brain health. We focus on two main considerations: what we know about the relationship between exercise and cognition, and how we can explain this relationship from an evolutionary lens. We discuss how movement impacts cognition, engaging your brain while exercising, and aging and brain health. We also cover neurogenesis, brain trauma, exercise and mood disorders, and motivation versus discipline.
Drs Dean and Ayesha Sherzai are no strangers to The Proof Podcast. As community favourites, we’ve previously covered topics focusing predominantly on the relationship between nutrition, neurodegenerative disease, aging, and other factors of brain health. In today’s episode, we step away from food to focus on the way exercise can impact our brain’s functioning and health.
Specifically, we discuss:

Intro (0:00)

Defining Exercise &amp; Cognition (7:51)

Studies on Exercise/ Brain Power (13:16)

Normal vs Pathological Aging (16:34)

Aging: What’s Possible (22:30)

Evolution of the Brain (27:31)

Combining Thinking &amp; Movement (42:23)

Improving Brain Function (50:40)

Mild Cognitive Impairment (58:27)

Exercise for Brain Health (1:01:05)

VO2 max &amp; brain health (1:09:53)

Danger of Exercise (1:12:36)

Can you reverse pathology? (1:24:51)

Mood Disorders (1:29:00)

Motivation vs Discipline (1:31:06)

Outro (1:37:35)


To hear more from Drs Ayesha and Dean Sherzai, you can listen to their previous episodes #65, #78, #97, #117, #126, and #188. You can also head to their podcast, The Brain Health Revolution.

      <title>Is dairy good or bad for us | Dr Alan Flanagan</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/is-dairy-good-or-bad-for-us-with-dr-alan-flanagan/</link>
      <description>In Episode #225 I sit down with Alan Flanagan, PhD to discuss the health implications of consuming dairy. We have a broader conversation about misinformation and public health before specifically examining the health outcomes of dairy consumption. We also cover whether you can trust industry-funded studies, the representation of dairy on social media, and how much information we actually have.
Misinformation is an ongoing occurrence in online nutrition conversations. The capacity to spread misinformation to huge audiences is only a few clicks away, and many laypeople aren’t equipped to accurately evaluate these claims. Similarly, there are many instances where ideology may influence people to ignore the evidence. Dr Alan Flanagan joins me today to discuss this in the context of dairy.
Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

      <itunes:summary>In Episode #225 I sit down with Alan Flanagan, PhD to discuss the health implications of consuming dairy. We have a broader conversation about misinformation and public health before specifically examining the health outcomes of dairy consumption. We also cover whether you can trust industry-funded studies, the representation of dairy on social media, and how much information we actually have.
Misinformation is an ongoing occurrence in online nutrition conversations. The capacity to spread misinformation to huge audiences is only a few clicks away, and many laypeople aren’t equipped to accurately evaluate these claims. Similarly, there are many instances where ideology may influence people to ignore the evidence. Dr Alan Flanagan joins me today to discuss this in the context of dairy.
Specifically, we cover:

      <title>Eating for your unique biology | Dr Tim Spector</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/eating-for-your-unique-biology-with-dr-tim-spector/</link>
      <description>In Episode #224, I sit down with Dr Tim Spector to address the significance of eating for your specific biology. We discuss research on twins, exploring nature versus nurture; the role of the microbiome in health outcomes; and whether conditions such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes are genetic. Dr Spector also offers advice on adapting your diet to your specific needs.
When we place so much focus on population-level data for health outcomes, it can be easy to lose sight of the unique biology that defines the way each person interacts with food. Dr Tim Spector joins me today to discuss how personalised nutrition may be the key to unlocking the healthiest version of ourselves.
Specifically, we discuss:

Intro (0:00)

The Twin Study (2:33)

How Medicine Has Changed (7:24)

Obesity: Genetics &amp; The Microbiome (13:30)

How much Genetics plays a role (23:36)

Zooming in on the Microbiome (32:36)

Big Picture (54:37)

Artificial Sweeteners (1:05:30)

Changing the Microbiome (1:14:58)

Blood Glucose (1:18:18)

Blood Lipids (1:26:40)

Vision for the Future (1:32:22)

Outro (1:35:45)


If you found this conversation informative, Dr Tim Spector has an abundance of resources and contact points available. To connect with Dr Spector, you can do so on Instagram and Twitter.

      <title>Developing an exercise plan | Drew Harrisberg</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/developing-an-exercise-plan-with-drew-harrisberg/</link>
      <description>In Episode #223, Drew Harrisberg and I sit down to discuss how to optimise your exercise. Drew provides a detailed outline of how to develop an exercise program, working around different time constraints. We recap past episodes with Dr Richard Johnson and Professor Kieran Rooney, sharing our thoughts on these conversations. We also cover my recent Bali retreat, HIIT training and VO2 max, resistant starch and cancer, and much more.
With new episodes of The Proof weekly and an abundance of new studies to keep up with, taking the time to unpack these is incredibly valuable. In this content-packed episode, we recap previous episodes and apply this knowledge into actionable tips you can use to get the most out of exercise.

Specifically, this episode covers:

Intro (0:00)

Time Spent in Bali (1:47)

The Richard Johnson Episode (18:37)

Discussing Potential benefits of Dairy (30:23)

Exercise Optimisation (35:49)

HIIT &amp; Cardiovascular Disease (1:08:38)

Developing an exercise program (1:13:16)

Resistant Starch &amp; Cancer (1:32:34)

Building bigger biceps (1:42:43)

Bear Grylls Post (1:59:32)

Feeding Stray Dogs in Bali (2:08:33)

Good News (2:16:24)

Book/Show Recommendations (2:22:21)

Outro (2:26:59)


It’s always great to have Drew on the show to further discuss the answers to questions we may not have covered in previous episodes. I hope this exploration provided you with practical information you can implement into your own life.

      <title>Fasting, autophagy and cell repair | Dr Satchin Panda</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/fasting-autophagy-and-cell-repair-with-dr-satchin-panda/</link>
      <description>In Episode #221, I sit down with Dr Satchin Panda to continue The Proof’s conversation on time restricted eating. We discuss circadian rhythms, circadian disruption, and health impacts. We also cover TRE in the context of circadian biology, blood glucose, and calorie restriction. Dr Panda offers his advice on the optimal TRE lifestyle.
Time-restricted eating (TRE) has caused a stir on social media in recent years. Many studies on TRE are misrepresented online, with people drawing absolute conclusions that often don’t consider all the data. Dr Panda joins me in this episode to look further into TRE, with a focus on circadian rhythm.
Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Circadian Rhythms (2:20)

Why Circadian Disruption is a Problem (9:35)

Dr. Panda’s Early Research (15:29)

What Causes Sleep Deprivation (21:05)

Disease &amp; Circadian Disruption (26:07)

Light Exposure (28:59)

Time Restricted Eating (35:19)

Optimal Eating Window (43:57)

Impact on Blood Glucose (57:51)

TRE vs Calorie Restriction (1:03:35)

Addressing Concerns (1:24:12)

Is Fasting Safe for Everyone? (1:26:52)

Extended Fasts (1:35:35)

Big Picture (1:39:00)

Outro (1:43:14)


To connect with Dr Satchin Panda, you can find him on Twitter and read his peer reviewed papers on Google Scholar. To learn more about circadian biology, his books, The Circadian Code and The Circadian Diabetes Code, are an incredible resource. You can also better understand your circadian rhythm while contributing to research with Dr Panda’s app, myCircadianClock.

      <title>A doctor’s guide to lung health | Dr MeiLan Han</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/a-doctors-guide-to-lung-health-with-dr-meilan-han/</link>
      <description>In Episode #220, Dr MeiLan Han joins me to discuss the lungs and respiratory system.
Despite being an incredibly important factor of our overall health, the respiratory system is often overlooked. Most people’s knowledge is surface level, and we aren’t educated on the importance of the lungs or how to best support respiratory health. Dr MeiLan Han joins me in this episode to explain what the respiratory system is, how it works, and what we can do to optimise it.
In this episode, Dr Han establishes what the respiratory system is and how it works. We discuss the prevalence of lung conditions, Covid-19 and its impact on the respiratory system, and air quality. We also discuss healthy habits for pregnancy, the effects of smoking and vaping on lung health, diet, and how to reduce exposure to toxic compounds.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Breathing Lessons: The Book (2:09)

Meilan’s Story (5:59)

Importance of Lung Awareness (11:07)

Lung Tests (24:25)

Impact of Covid (29:57)

How the Lungs Work (33:32)

Childhood Lung Health (44:52)

Air Quality (53:55)

Cleansing the Lungs (1:15:20)

COPD (1:19:47)

Final Thoughts (1:27:32)

Outro (1:29:35)


If you are interested in learning more about lung health, Dr Han’s book is the perfect resource. You can find her book, Breathing Lessons: A Doctor’s Guide to Lung Health, here. You can also connect with Dr Han on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn. Her website, www.drmeilanhan.com/, contains more information and trusted resources.

      <title>Does insulin make us fat? | Layne Norton</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/does-insulin-make-us-fat-with-layne-norton/</link>
      <description>In Episode #219, I sit down with Layne Norton, PhD to answer one very topical question: does insulin make us fat?
Welcome to the first bite-sized episode of The Proof. In these short conversations, I am joined by a guest to tackle a single topic in a brief, digestible time frame. In this episode, Layne Norton, PhD addresses recent online claims by Ben Bikman, PhD. Dr Bikman claims that if we keep insulin low and control seed oils, fat cells can stay smaller and healthier. But is there any truth to this claim, and would that necessarily be a good thing?
In this episode, Dr Norton takes a highly scientific approach to the topic at hand. We discuss adipocyte hypertrophy, the difference between and significance of hypertrophy versus hyperplasia, and the consequences of misinformation. We also examine the uses and drawbacks of mechanistic data.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Dr. Bikman’s Claims (2:24)

Hyperplasia and hypertrophy (7:19)

Gap of Research (12:17)

Why this is problematic (15:56)

Motives (20:14)

Outro (22:53)


To connect with Layne Norton, PhD, you can find him on Instagram and Twitter @biolayne, and on Facebook as Layne Norton. You can also visit his website, https://biolayne.com/, to learn more about his work and other resources.

      <description>In Episode #218, I’m joined by entrepreneur Arturo Elizondo to discuss the future of egg production.
Ground-breaking changes are happening in our food industry every single day. While animal agriculture continues to grow, there is an increasing field of innovation seeking sustainable, ethical alternatives to the foods most people consume daily. Arturo Elizondo joins me today to pull back the curtain on one such initiative, The EVERY Co., revealing his journey and where this technology will take us.
Think real eggs, just made differently.
In this episode, we continue The Proof’s investigation into the future of animal-free proteins. Arturo expands on previous episodes, discussing the triumphs and challenges of current technologies in this space, the journey of The EVERY Co., and where the industry is heading. We also discuss food equity and availability, government regulations and funding, environmental considerations, concerns about genetic modification, and much more.
Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Day in the Life of Arturo (2:19)

What Inspired a Chickenless Egg (13:10)

Existing Products with Animal Protein (47:22)

      <title>Nutrition myths in the vegan community | Ginny Messina </title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/nutrition-myths-in-the-vegan-community-with-ginny-messina/</link>
      <description>In Episode #217, I sit down with dietician Ginny Messina to address common nutrition myths about the vegan diet.
With an abundance of nutrition “information” presented to us any time we use social media, it becomes difficult to identify whether a claim is fact or fiction. Misinformation is a common issue across all patterns of eating — including a plant-based diet — and understanding the full picture is incredibly important to ensure health and longevity. Ginny Messina, MPH, RD joins me to address common nutrition myths about the vegan diet, providing a broader view that will help plant-based eaters make sense of nutrition needs.
In this episode, we address 16 myths that could have negative health implications if followed. Ginny Messina speaks to the limitations and strengths of the evidence that we have, provides recommendations for optimal health, and discusses the ethical reasons for making diet choices. We also cover supplementation, concerns about vegan diets, and how to evaluate claims you find online.
Specifically, we discuss:

Intro (0:00)

Becoming Vegan (3:13)

Risks of Vegan Misinformation (10:16)

Whole Food Diets (20:36)

Are Humans Herbivores? (22:55)

      <itunes:summary>In Episode #217, I sit down with dietician Ginny Messina to address common nutrition myths about the vegan diet.
With an abundance of nutrition “information” presented to us any time we use social media, it becomes difficult to identify whether a claim is fact or fiction. Misinformation is a common issue across all patterns of eating — including a plant-based diet — and understanding the full picture is incredibly important to ensure health and longevity. Ginny Messina, MPH, RD joins me to address common nutrition myths about the vegan diet, providing a broader view that will help plant-based eaters make sense of nutrition needs.
In this episode, we address 16 myths that could have negative health implications if followed. Ginny Messina speaks to the limitations and strengths of the evidence that we have, provides recommendations for optimal health, and discusses the ethical reasons for making diet choices. We also cover supplementation, concerns about vegan diets, and how to evaluate claims you find online.
Specifically, we discuss:

Intro (0:00)

Becoming Vegan (3:13)

Risks of Vegan Misinformation (10:16)

Whole Food Diets (20:36)

Are Humans Herbivores? (22:55)

Protein Myth (25:42)

Processed Vegan Food (28:05)

Calcium Needs (30:07)

Dairy: Cancer &amp; Addiction (33:40)

Seafood &amp; Mercury (39:34)

Low Fat (44:18)

Whole Foods vs Processed (51:47)

Oil-Free (59:01)

Raw Foods Diet (1:04:30)

Vitamin B12 (1:08:35)

Supplementing (1:23:16)

Medication &amp; Statins (1:31:38)

Industry Funded Research (1:34:36)

Greatest Risk to Vegans (1:39:40)

      <title>Lower your cholesterol with these foods | Dr David Jenkins</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/lower-your-cholesterol-with-these-foods-with-dr-david-jenkins/</link>
      <description>In Episode #216, I sit down with Dr David Jenkins to discuss the relationship between cholesterol and health.

Cholesterol levels are concerningly high among populations consuming a standard Western diet. On the flip side, plant-based diets are often criticised for their lack of cholesterol. We know that cholesterol is an essential component of the human body — but is it necessary to consume it, and is this a concern for plant-based eaters? Dr David Jenkins answers this question and much more in today’s episode.

In this episode, we dig into cholesterol and the health implications of sub-optimal levels. We discuss the Portfolio Diet, weight loss, and the current research on cholesterol. Dr Jenkins also shares his recommendations on how and what to eat for optimal cholesterol levels, as well as how medication compares to a lifestyle approach.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Researching Cholesterol &amp; Diet (2:35)

What this means for you (15:00)

Weight Loss Factor (17:23)

The Portfolio Diet Explained (20:14)

Nuts &amp; Seeds (30:37)

Weight (39:45)

Raising HDL (44:45)

Plant Sterols (50:51)

Should We Eat Fish? (58:52)

Statins (1:07:49)

Outro (1:11:22)


You can learn more about Dr Jenkins and discover his publications on his University of Toronto profile. To view or purchase his daughter’s book, The Portfolio Diet for Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction, you can do so here.

      <title>Is fructose driving metabolic disease? | Dr Richard Johnson</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/is-fructose-driving-metabolic-disease-with-dr-richard-johnson/</link>
      <description>In Episode #215, I’m joined by Dr Richard Johnson to discuss obesity, fructose, and metabolic disease.

“Fructose” has become something of a fear word in modern diet culture. It is often positioned as the villain, without the in-depth breakdown of where we are sourcing this fructose and the quantities it is consumed in. Similarly, the relationship between health and obesity is hotly contested. Dr Richard Johnson sits down with me today to clarify the scientific relationship between these factors, getting into what the evidence tells us.

In this episode, we take a broader view at the history of obesity before honing in on the biology and mechanisms. We discuss the ideology of obesity, whether you can be healthy at any size, and the degree of risk related to where you store fat. We also cover a variety of animal studies, sources of fructose, and how the modern food environment shapes our body weight.

Specifically, we discuss:

Intro (0:00)

History of Obesity (2:30)

Body Fat &amp; Health Span (10:36)

Causes &amp; Behavioral Patterns (23:55)

Fructose vs Excess Calories (38:18)

The Hazda (1:03:50)

Fructose &amp; Fruit (1:11:10)

Fruitarians (1:22:25)

Not All Carbs are the Same (1:32:30)

Purines &amp; Uric Acid (1:39:55)

Carnivore Diet (1:42:22)

Summarizing Obesity (1:53:56)

Outro (2:02:46)


To connect with Dr Richard Johnson, you can find him on Instagram and Twitter. You can also learn more at his website, https://drrichardjohnson.com/. His latest book, Nature Wants Us To Be Fat, is now available.

      <title>Producing animal proteins without animals | Josh Tetrick</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/producing-animal-proteins-without-animals-with-josh-tetrick/</link>
      <description>In Episode #214, I sit down with Josh Tetrick to discuss reshaping our food system towards plant-based products and slaughter-free meat alternatives.

As animal-free proteins grow in popularity, technologies for creating them are too. Josh Tetrick wants to reshape our food system, and joins me today to share his journey with Eat Just. Josh is committed to facilitating innovation in the plant-based sphere and offers valuable insight into emerging technologies in today’s episode.

In this episode, we discuss business as a force for change and the future of the animal-free industry. Josh shares some of his story, explaining where he found the drive to act and how he raised more than half a billion dollars. We look deeper into Eat Just’s products, specifically their very successful “Just Egg”. We also discuss the nutritional profile of cultivated meat and other plant-based alternatives; challenges Josh has overcome; and the benefits of alternative products.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Josh’s Story (2:20)

Having the Courage to Act (9:51)

Evaluating the Meat Industry (20:12)

The Mission of JUST (29:10)

Negative Press &amp; The Egg Industry (47:27)

Cultivated Meat (1:10:30)

Challenges &amp; Pushback (1:36:24)

Nutritional Profile (1:44:58)

Skeptics &amp; Timeline (1:48:32)

Outro (2:05:47)


To connect with Josh, you can find him on Twitter or send him an email. You can also learn more about Eat Just at their website, and discover the future of cultivated meats at the Good Meat website.

      <description>In Episode #213, Dr Jenna Macciochi joins me for a deep dive into the human immune system.
“Immunity” has become a buzzword in health spheres at the moment.

Dr Jenna Macciochi joins me today to look deeper into what actually creates a balanced immune system.
In this episode, we cover broader explanations of what the immune system is and what it does before getting into the finer details. Dr Macciochi also provides an abundance of applicable information, explaining the mechanisms behind what impacts the immune system. We discuss the extent of control we have over our own immune system, indications of a disrupted immune system, and the importance of gut health. Dr Macciochi also shares insight into vaccines, inflammation, diet, and supplementation.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Becoming an Immunologist (5:38)

Explaining the Immune System (9:00)

Impact of Genetics (15:05)

Immunity &amp; Immune-Washing (19:07)

Reaction to Virus’ (28:04)

Pregnancy &amp; Childhood (31:00)

Understanding Your Immunity (44:53)

Bacterial VS Viral Infections (56:00)

Antibiotics (58:48)

Germ vs Terrain Theory (1:04:36)

Natural Immunity (1:09:23)

Inflammation Explained (1:18:38)

Anti-Inflammatory Diets (1:29:28)

Phytonutrients &amp; Toxic Plants (1:44:31)

Eat the Rainbow (1:57:52)

Beta-Glucans (2:05:40)

Animal Foods (2:07:37)

Healthy Fats (2:12:48)

Supplementing Vitamins (2:16:04)

Outro (2:32:10)


To connect with Dr Jenna Macciochi, you can do so on Instagram, Twitter, and her website. Make sure to check out her first book Immunity: The Science of Staying Well. Her new book, Your Blueprint for Strong Immunity, is now available as well.

      <title>Creatine for brain health &amp; physical performance | Dr Eric Rawson</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/creatine-for-brain-health-physical-performance-with-dr-eric-rawson/</link>
      <description>In Episode #212, Dr Eric Rawson joins me to examine the muscular and cognitive effects of creatine.
Performance supplementation is a flooded field. With supplementation sceptics on one hand and relentless marketing promotion on the other, it can be difficult to know what to believe. Dr Eric Rawson joins me today for an in-depth conversation on creatine, breaking down everything you need to know about this widely studied compound.

In this episode, we cover the basics of creatine consumption and push deeper into specific, common questions people may have. You will learn about the muscular performance and brain health benefits of creatine for people of different demographics, including age, gender, and diet. Dr Rawson also outlines dosage guidelines, addresses common concerns people may have, and speaks to the evidence we have about safety.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Breakthrough Creatine Research (1:53)

What Creatine is (11.00)

Is Creating Essential? (12:48)

Testing Creatine Levels (17:10)

Vegetarian vs Omnivore (23:01)

Improving Performance (28:40)

Analyzing Other Compounds (52:24)

Safety of Supplements (1:05:48)

Gender Impact (1:21:30)

Creating Dosage (1:27:50)

Brain Health &amp; Creatine (1:29:06)

Outro (1:57:55)


Dr Rawson offers specific guidelines that you can action, as well as covering the science behind why. In a world where anyone and everyone online makes nutrition claims, it’s critical to have reliable, rigorous evidence to support these. I hope you found this episode clarifying and useful.

If you enjoyed hearing from Dr Rawson, you can connect with him via Twitter. You can also read more at his university faculty page, or email him if you have further questions.

      <title>The future of dairy | Dr Jared Raynes</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/the-future-of-dairy-with-dr-jared-raynes/</link>
      <description>In Episode #211, I sit down with Dr Jared Raynes to discuss precision fermentation and the future of dairy.

As our world becomes more populated and animal agriculture continues to unsustainably expand, we need to examine alternatives to the products people know and love. While animal-free dairy may sound like an impossible feat, innovation in the field of precision fermentation is proving otherwise. Dr Jared Raynes joins me today to explain what precision fermentation is, where this technology is now, and where it can take us in the future.

By listening to this episode, you’ll gain an understanding of what precision fermentation is from both a scientific and outcome-based perspective. We break down the benefits of animal-free dairy, explain how it is created, and address potential concerns about genetic modification. Dr Raynes also offers insight into where this technology is used already, where it’s heading, and when we can expect to see animal-free dairy products on the shelves.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Biochemistry &amp; Jared’s story (4:08)

Studying recreating casein (8:59)

Alternative protein companies (24:45)

Precision fermentation explained (27:39)

GMOs: what can go wrong (33:00)

What’s possible with precision fermentation (41:25)

Environmental changes (53:00)

Looking forward (1:00:15)

Outro (1:17:40)


If you found this episode insightful, you can connect with Dr Raynes on LinkedIn. You can also discover more of All G Foods, who Dr Raynes works for, on their website, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn profiles. Learn more about their brands Buds Burger and Milk Cell through the linked websites.

      <title>Using science to build muscle and grow stronger | Dr Stuart Phillips</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/using-science-to-build-muscle-and-grow-stronger-with-stuart-phillips-phd/</link>
      <description>In Episode #210, Professor Stuart Phillips returns to expand on our conversation about using science to improve training outcomes.

One very common criticism of a plant-based diet is that it’s difficult to meet protein requirements due to both quantity and quality of plant-based protein sources. “Evidence” provided for this often centres around amino acid profiles, linking back to the DIAAS and PDCAAS protein scoring systems. Today, Professor Stuart Phillips offers clarity on this topic and much more useful information on what to consume, in what form, and when.

In this episode, we cover a whole suite of information that is highly relevant and applicable for those looking to improve their training outcomes. In addition to briefly revisiting the basics of protein consumption, we discuss distribution and timing, protein needs for older people, and protein quality scoring systems. We also dive into supplementation for those looking to improve performance and muscle protein synthesis, including caffeine, beta alanine, nitrates, creatine, omega-3s, and hormones.

Specifically, we discuss:

Intro (0:00)

Protein distribution (1:20)

Scoring systems for protein (11:13)

Supplements for performance (28:08)

Sodium bicarbonate (43:40)

Nitrates (51:29)

Creatine (56:10)

Omega 3s (1:05:25)

Hormones &amp; protein synthesis (1:10:30)

Aging &amp; muscle gain (1:13:20)

Exciting new studies (1:24:12)

Outro (1:27:19)


To listen to my previous conversation with Professor Philips, head to Episode #190. You can also learn more about him via the McMaster University profile, and connect with him on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

If you found this episode informative and a looking for ways to introduce more plant-based protein into your diet, you can download my free recipe eBook, Plant Perform. This recipe guide includes high-protein recipes and more to optimise physical performance and recovery.

        <![CDATA[<p>In Episode #210, Professor Stuart Phillips returns to expand on our conversation about using science to improve training outcomes.</p><p><br></p><p>One very common criticism of a plant-based diet is that it’s difficult to meet protein requirements due to both quantity and quality of plant-based protein sources. “Evidence” provided for this often centres around amino acid profiles, linking back to the DIAAS and PDCAAS protein scoring systems. Today, Professor Stuart Phillips offers clarity on this topic and much more useful information on what to consume, in what form, and when.</p><p><br></p><p>In this episode, we cover a whole suite of information that is highly relevant and applicable for those looking to improve their training outcomes. In addition to briefly revisiting the basics of protein consumption, we discuss distribution and timing, protein needs for older people, and protein quality scoring systems. We also dive into supplementation for those looking to improve performance and muscle protein synthesis, including caffeine, beta alanine, nitrates, creatine, omega-3s, and hormones.</p><p><br></p><p>Specifically, we discuss:</p><ul>

      <title>Omega 3’s during pregnancy and lactation | Dr Kristina Harris</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/omega-3s-during-pregnancy-and-lactation-with-kristina-harris-phd/</link>
      <description>In Episode #209, I sit down with Dr Kristina Harris Jackson to deep dive into the effects of omega-3 consumption on lactation and pregnancy.

Dr Kristina Harris Jackson furthers The Proof’s exploration of omega-3s in this episode, offering her expertise in a discussion centred around maternal health. Nutrition during pregnancy can be a sensitive and confusing topic; when parents are trying to do everything they can to ensure optimal health outcomes, the abundance of available information is overwhelming. Today, Dr Harris Jackson provides some much-needed clarity and insight into omega-3s and pregnancy.

In this episode, we cover a whole suite of information around omega-3s across early life stages. You will learn about the importance of nutritional biomarkers and exactly how important omega-3s are during pregnancy. We also discuss the potential effect of DHA on gestation length, inflammation during pregnancy, and how genetic variations may affect omega-3 conversion. Finally, Dr Harris Jackson shares supplementation guidelines, outcomes, and plant-based sources of omega-3s.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Kristina’s story (1:42)

Omega-3s explained (17:51)

Pregnancy &amp; omega-3s (22:15)

Explaining the mechanisms (30:58)

Optimal intake of omega-3s (38:12)

Supplementing (1:02:26)

Long-term effects on children (1:47:43)

Summary of what’s important (1:53:55)

Outro (2:00:56)

      <title>Optimising your omega 3 intake | Dr Bill Harris</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/optimal-omega-3-intake-with-bill-harris-phd/</link>
      <description>In Episode #208, I’m joined by expert researcher Dr Bill Harris to discuss the relationship between omega-3 fatty acids and human health.

Increasingly, online nutrition conversation is moving away from scientific literature and is more heavily influenced by marketing and controversial claims for personal gain. Whether people are making these statements to grow their online community or capitalise on a financial opportunity, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are yet another topic surrounded by bold claims.

In this episode, you’ll learn about the different types of dietary fats and why saturation is important in terms of human health. We cover the connection between cholesterol, fat saturation, and heart disease; the benefits or potential concerns of consuming omega-3s; supplementation guidelines; omega-6s and inflammation; the difference between adequate and optimal intake; and much more.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

What are fats? (5:21)

Harris’ research (10:28)

Dietary guidelines &amp; saturated fats (12:45)

Monounsaturated fats (24:40)

Unsaturated fats (27:37)

Omega-6s (33:47)

Omega-3s (49:21)

Supplementing (1:21:04)

DHA - prostate cancer &amp; brain health (1:40:16)

Outro (1:55:09)


You can learn more about Dr Bill Harris’ research at the Omega Quant and Fatty Acid Research Institute websites. To connect with Omega Quant team, you can access their Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook pages.

      <description>In Episode #207, Dr Gil Carvalho explains how to approach nutrition information from an evidence-based viewpoint, breaking down the details of data analysis.

In recent years, we’ve seen a huge influx of information being presented as fact without any real scientific foundations. Being able to assess the validity of these claims is critical, and Dr Carvalho offers useful insight into how a layperson can approach them.

In today’s episode, we shift the focus away from what to think about the science of nutrition onto how to think about it. You’ll learn how to assess scientific claims with Dr Carvalho’s “Three P’s” framework. We apply this framework to a few examples, exploring cooking oils, red meat, eggs, and cholesterol. We also discuss the nuance of evidence hierarchies, and much more.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Gil’s Story (4:50)

How we Think About Nutrition (10:30)

What is Proof (14:50)

Observational &amp; Randomized Control Trials (28:40)

Evaluating the Impact of Oil (44:07)

Red Meat (1:22:14)

Outro (1:54:33)

      <title>Seed oils, blood tests and how sleep affects body weight | Drew Harrisberg</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/seed-oils-blood-tests-and-how-sleep-affects-body-weight-with-drew-harrisberg/</link>
      <description>In Episode #206, Drew Harrisberg joins me to debrief The Proof’s first debate and discuss blood tests, sleep, and the interaction between HIIT training and blood glucose.

Last week, I released a special episode on YouTube: a debate on seed oils and heart disease between Tucker Goodrich and Dr Matthew Nagra. You can find it here. Regardless of whether you’ve watched the debate, you’ll gain insight from the reflections we share in this episode.

Our discussion of this debate covers the interpretation of studies, consistency of arguments, and whether either argument was compelling enough to change our minds. Moving on from the debate, you’ll also learn about how sleep interacts with calorie consumption, blood glucose and HIIT training, and blood tests you may want to request. Drew and I also offer insights into our own diets, and I share some results from a recent blood test.

Specifically, we cover:

Intro (0:00)

Training (3:40)

The Seed Oil Debate (12:03)

Understanding Healthy ApoB Levels (55:25)

The Biohacking Trap (1:07:08)

CGMs for People without Diabetes (1:17:30)

HIIT for Diabetes (1:28:13)

Sleep Deprivation &amp; Weight Gain (1:51:55)

Clarifying the Mediterranean diet (2:03:00)

The “Kale Buster” (2:08:32)

Good News (2:16:11)

Book/ Show Recommendations (2:25:44)

Answering Your Questions (2:33:36)

Outro (2:36:40)


To connect with Drew, you can reach him via his Instagram or website, Drew’s Daily Dose. You can also listen to his previous appearances on the show on your favourite podcast app.

      <title>Dr Andrew Huberman | Understanding your brain + optimising its function</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/understanding-your-brain-with-neuroscientist-andrew-huberman-phd/</link>
      <description>In Episode #205, I sit down with Dr Andrew Huberman to discuss the nervous system and how lifestyle choices impact your brain. As a neuroscientist and tenured professor at Stanford University, Dr Huberman has made numerous significant contributions to the field of brain development, brain function, and neural plasticity.

In this episode, we break down the basics before moving on to the impact of specific lifestyle decisions and behaviours. We cover what neuroscience is and why it’s important, covering some significant discoveries in the past century. You’ll also learn how caffeine impacts the nervous system, how to improve learning, and the benefits of non-sleep deep rest (NSDR). We discuss tools you can use to wind down from intense alertness, supplements and brain health, and much more.

Specifically, we discuss:


Intro (0:00)

What is Neuroscience (4:07)

Milestones in Neuroscience (10:04)

Neurons and Performance Enhancement (18:48)

What Caffeine does to the Body (29:08)

The Ideal Exercise (32:40)

Adrenal Burnout and Pineal Calcification (43:46)

Caffeine Withdrawal (52:38)

Using Breath to Calm the Nervous System (1:02:10)

Yoga Nidra for Deep Rest (1:06:38)

Balance of Rest and Work (1:15:00)

Tips for Better Sleep (1:32:28)

Brain Fog &amp; Focus (1:50:32)

Motivation &amp; Top Down Control (1:54:53)

Dopamine &amp; Social media (2:07:30)

Cold &amp; Heat Exposure (2:14:22)

Outro (2:29:30)


You can learn more about Dr Huberman on his Stanford University page, and visit his website Huberman Lab. To secure tickets for the upcoming Huberman Lab tour (taking place on May 17 and 18), follow this link. He is also active on social media, and you can connect with him on YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter. Listen to his episode on the Rich Roll Podcast here.

      <title>Fasting controversies | Dr Courtney Peterson &amp; Dr Emily Manoogian</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/fasting-controversies-with-courtney-peterson-phd-emily-manoogian-phd/</link>
      <description>In Episode #204, I’m joined by leading researchers Dr Emily Manoogian and Dr Courtney Peterson. Drs Emily and Courtney both research the way food timing interacts with the body, focusing on time-restricted eating (TRE).

In this episode, we approach the topic with a key question: is there any advantage of time-restricted eating other than helping people eat fewer calories to achieve a healthy body weight? You’ll learn the specifics of what TRE is, the purported benefits, what we know, and what we’re yet to discover. We also discuss the work of Drs Emily and Courtney, and comment on the recent study from China that is making waves.

Specifically, we cover:


Intro (0:00)

Debate of Fasting Benefits (2:11)

Fasting Defined (6:20)

Circadian Rhythm &amp; Meal Timing (17:26)

History of TRE Studies (25:32)

Calorie Restriction vs TRE (46:29)

Debunking Trials that DIDN’T work (58:27)

Cancer (1:25:40)

Aging (1:31:56)

Women’s Health &amp; Lean Muscle (1:35:37)

Optimal Eating Windows (1:41:55)

Training &amp; Breaking the Fast (1:48:36)

Shift Workers (1:55:15)

Longevity &amp; Protein (2:02:13)

Outro (2:04:33)


You can learn more about Dr Courtney Peterson here. To connect with Dr Emily Manoogian, you can do so via Twitter, LinkedIn, or her website.

Today’s episode was made possible by The Proof partner Eimele Essential 8. Plant-based eaters may fall short on some key nutrients, and Eimele Essential 8 offers a convenient solution to encourage your best health. I helped formulate this product, and take it every morning.

      <title>The Hadza, chocolate, and resistance training | Drew Harrisberg</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/the-hadza-chocolate-and-resistance-training-with-drew-harrisberg/</link>
      <description>In Episode #203, I welcome Drew Harrisberg back to the show for another episode to discuss a variety of topics, from the Hadza tribe and their diet to the importance of movement throughout the day.

There’s a lot to learn in Episode #203. We discuss red meat consumption and associated health outcomes, sleep and insulin resistance, and the dietary pattern of the Hadza tribe. We also cover the importance of maintaining activity levels throughout the day and tips to incorporate movement in environments where it’s difficult to do so. For any chocolate lovers listening, we dive into a recent study on cocoa flavanols, and note how much chocolate you can eat for maximum benefit and minimum negative health outcomes.

Specifically, we cover:


Intro (0:00)

Eye Health (2:35)

The Hazda Diet (8:28)

Carnivore Craze (28:03)

Revisiting CGMs (50:49)

Tips for Regulating Glucose (1:04:00)

Benefits of Chocolate (1:19:58)

Daily Steps (1:37:49)

Resistance Training (1:55:12)

Book/ Show Recommendations (2:24:34)

Outro (2:33:18)


To connect with Drew, you can reach him via his Instagram or website, Drew’s Daily Dose. You can also listen to his previous appearances on the show on your favourite podcast app.

Thank you to The Proof partner Eimele Essential 8 for sponsoring this episode. This is a supplement I helped formulate, designed for plant-predominant eaters who may typically fall short on some key nutrients. I personally take Eimele Essential 8 every day with breakfast. You can save 5% on your first order by heading to theproof.com/friends.

Make sure to head to The Proof website for the full show notes.

Enjoy, friends.

      <title>How the microbiome affects your health and ways to optimise it | Drs Erica &amp; Justin Sonnenburg</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/how-the-microbiome-affects-your-health-and-ways-to-optimise-it-with-drs-erica-justin-sonnenburg/</link>
      <description>In Episode #202, I’m joined by Drs Erica and Justin Sonnenburg to learn more about microbes and the gut microbiome.
This episode, we recap (or introduce for new listeners) what microbes are and what the microbiome is. Then we dive into a more in-depth conversation about evolution and the microbiome, the impacts of industrialisation on the gut, and what inflammation really means for human health. You’ll learn about probiotics; microbiome diversity; the relationship between microbiota and disease; how low-fibre, animal-based diets effect the gut; and more.

Specifically, we cover:


Intro (0:00)

Fasting &amp; Gut Health (2:42)

What the Microbiome is (7:06)

      <title>The power of phytochemicals | Dr Jed Fahey</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/the-power-of-phytochemicals-with-dr-jed-fahey/</link>
      <description>In Episode #201, I welcome Dr Jed Fahey to The Proof to discuss phytochemicals and their impacts on human health. As a nutritional biochemist with an impressive resume, Dr Fahey is well positioned to educate on this incredibly interesting topic.
In this episode, we really dig into phytochemicals (also called phytonutrients). As well as hearing about Dr Fahey’s background, you’ll learn more about what phytochemicals are, what we know and don’t know about them, and to what extent they form an important part of human nutrition. We also cover the potential for negative effects, impact on specific communities including people with autism and Parkinson’s disease, and practical applications you can implement.

Specifically, we cover:


Intro (0:00)

Jed Fahey’s Story (1:30)

Discovering Phytochemicals (8:57)

Organic vs Conventional (13:30)

Classifying Phytochemicals (17:01)

Why we need them (24:04)

Unpacking Plant “Toxins” (42:53)

Sulforaphane &amp; How it Works (50:35)

Impact of Gut Microbiome (1:10:54)

Freshness vs Supplementation (1:14:54)

Resveratrol: Good or Bad? (1:30:04)

Outro (1:41:10)


If you want to hear more from Dr Jed Fahey, you can access his website and connect with him on Twitter. He has lots of exciting things in the works.

Episode #201 was made possible by Eimele Essential 8, a product I helped formulate and take every day. To get 5% off Eimele’s Essential 8 multi-nutrient head to theproof.com/friends.

      <title>Soy foods, hormones and cancer | Dr Matthew Nagra</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/soy-foods-hormones-and-cancer-with-dr-matthew-nagra/</link>
      <description>In Episode #197, Dr Matthew Nagra shares his evidence-based knowledge on soy and its relationship to cancer and hormones. Soy’s health benefits are hotly contested online, from claims that soy causes cancer to accounts of men experiencing feminisation. There is an array of misinformation and poorly interpreted studies that slander soy, and today Dr Nagra helps clear the confusion on this highly debated topic.

Specifically, we cover what soy is; what phytoestrogens are and their effects on hormones in men and women; soy’s relationship with prostate and breast cancer; the potential effects of soy on infants; claims about the harms of soy; and much more.

To learn more or connect with Dr Matthew Nagra, you can reach him on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and his website. You can also listen to his previous episodes, Episode #113 and Episode #133, and check out the Plant Proof website for the full show notes.

      <title>How to regain hormonal health with PCOS | Dr Nitu Bajekal</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/how-to-regain-hormonal-health-with-pcos-with-dr-nitu-bajekal/</link>
      <description>In Episode #196 I’m joined by Dr Nitu Bajekal to discuss PCOS and how to manage it. Hormonal health is an area that is often underdiagnosed, undertreated, and stigmatised. Dr Nitu Bajekal has dedicated her career to helping people manage their hormonal and reproductive health, and in this episode we deep dive into her wealth of knowledge on PCOS.

Specifically, we cover:


What PCOS is and its prevalence [7:15]

Diagnosis criteria and symptoms [24:45]

Defining and approaching insulin resistance [41:35]

Concerns about low carb, animal-based diets [1:01:20]

Lifestyle recommendations for symptom management and long term health [1:01:40]

Supplement and food recommendations [1:32:30]

And much more.


To learn more or connect with Dr Nitu Bajekal, you can access her website and Instagram. Her book, Living PCOS Free, is now available for pre-order Book Depository and Booktopia. You can listen to her previous episode here, and check out the Plant Proof website for the full show notes.

Enjoy, friends.

      <title>Managing hunger hormones | Nutritionist Kelly LeVeque</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/managing-hunger-hormones-with-nutritionist-kelly-leveque/</link>
      <description>There are a myriad of defining factors linking the way we eat to the way we experience health. Regulating blood sugar and hunger hormones help form these, and Kelly LeVeque uses her platform to educate and inform people on how to eat to feel fuelled and grounded.
Kelly is a holistic nutritionist, wellness expert, celebrity health coach, and bestselling author of Body Love and Body Love Every Day. With a background in cancer and genetics research, Kelly returned to study a postgraduate degree in nutrition. She places a particular focus on eating to optimise blood sugar balance, developing personalised plans for her clients that consider lifestyle sustainability and ensuring they feel their best.
At the end of the day, Kelly’s focus is ensuring that her clients feel in control of and empowered by their food choices. Her philosophy revolves around the “Fab 4” structure, prioritising protein, fat, fibre, and leafy greens to promote blood sugar balance.

In this episode, you’ll learn about blood glucose control and Kelly’s food choice recommendations. We discuss the benefits of elongating the blood sugar curve, with actionable steps to do so. We also cover the negative impacts of poor blood glucose control, with Kelly offering more information on hunger hormones and how to regulate them. She shares her lifestyle recommendations, tips for sticking to dietary changes, and explains how her Fab 4 framework helps people improve their health and how they feel day-to-day.
I hope you learn something new from this episode and appreciate the importance of broadening our scope to explore differing ideologies around food and lifestyle changes. It is always eye-opening to bring alternative perspectives to the table.

If you’d like to explore further, other resources mentioned in this episode include:
- David Raubenheimer and Stephen Simpson’s book Eat Like the Animals
- Episodes with Cyrus Khambatta, PhD and Robby Barbaro, MPH of Mastering Diabetes: Episode 74, Episode 94, Episode 168
- Atomic Habits by James Clear
- To connect with Kelly and discover more of her work, you can find her on Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. She also hosts The Be Well By Kelly Podcast, and you can access her website here. Kelly has two books, Body Love and Body Love Every Day.

Enjoy, friends. - Simon

      <title>Your appetite for protein | Professors David Raubenheimer and Stephen J Simpson</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/your-appetite-for-protein-with-professors-david-raubenheimer-and-stephen-j-simpson/</link>
      <description>In Episode #194 I had the great pleasure of sitting down with Professor’s David Raubenheimer and Stephen J. Simpson. For over 30 years, David and Stephen, leading researchers from the University of Sydney, have been studying ways in which nature can teach us about the science of healthy eating. How and why we eat, how appetites are fed and regulated - and how, in the end, it all comes back to five appetites.

Topics covered include: 


How Steve and David’s project ‘Eat Like The Animals’ came about and how they found themselves working together in their field of science

The findings from their study on the dietary patterns of locusts

The process by which signals are released that create an appetite for protein

The negative health outcomes of consuming ultra processed foods and reducing protein intake

What happens when you over-consume protein

The importance of protein quality

Changes in protein requirements as we age and protein supplementation

      <title>Fermented foods, fibre and immunity | Dr Justin Sonnenburg &amp; Dr Christopher Gardner</title>
      <description>In Episode #191 I sit down with Stanford University Professor's Dr Christopher Gardner and Dr Justin Sonnenburg to talk about fermented foods, fibre, gut health and immunity. This conversation was organised following the results of their latest randomised controlled trial 'Gut-microbiota-targeted diets modulate human immune status' which was published in Cell Press in 2021.

In this conversation we cover:

Dr Sonnenburg’s background and journey into studying the microbiome

Defining the terms ‘microbiome’ and ‘microbiota

The development of technology in learning more about the microbiome

What defines a healthy microbiome and dysbiosis

Studying the microbiomes of traditional populations such as the Hadza tribe

The benefits of microbiome diversity

Lack of microbiome diversity

Intestinal permeability

How Justin and Christopher came to working together

The mission behind their study of fibre and fermented foods

The methodology of the study

The definition of fermented foods

Microbes being added to packaged fermented foods

What the study found in terms of fermented food

Conducting studies with humans vs animals

What can the study tell us about the effectiveness of probiotics

Sodium in fermented foods

What the study found in terms of fibre intake

Accuracy of stool/microbiome testing

Key takeaways from the study

and plenty more


Justin Sonnenburg, PhD bio:
Dr Sonnenburg is an associate professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, where he studies the gut microbiota in health and disease and co-directs the Center for Human Microbiome Studies. He and his wife Erica, are the authors of the book The Good Gut: Taking Control of Your Weight, Your Mood, and Your Long-Term Health. Their laboratory at Stanford develops and employs diverse technologies to understand basic principles that govern interactions within the intestinal microbiota and between the microbiota and the host. An ongoing objective of the research program is to devise and implement innovative strategies to prevent and treat disease in humans via the gut microbiota. Current pursuits include genetic engineering commensal bacteria to enable therapeutic delivery within the gut, as well as understanding the health impact of microbiome change that has occurred during industrialization. Justin conducted his Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences at the University of California, San Diego in the laboratory of Ajit Varki. His postdoctoral work was conducted at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri in the laboratory of Jeffrey Gordon. He has received an NIH Director’s New Innovator Award and Pioneer Award. He serves on several scientific advisory boards and is a co-founder of Novome Biotechnologies.

Christopher Gardner, PhD bio:
Dr Gardner is the Rehnborg Farquhar professor of medicine at Stanford, the director of Stanford Prevention Research Center’s (SPRC) Nutrition Studies Group, and the director of the SPRC postdoctoral research fellow training program. His primary research focus for the past decade has been randomized controlled nutrition intervention trials (soy, garlic, antioxidants, ginkgo, omega-3 fats, vegetarian diets, weight loss diets), testing the effects of these on chronic disease risk factors that have included blood cholesterol, weight, inflammatory markers, and the microbiome. His research interests have recently shifted to two new areas. The first is to approach helping individuals make healthful improvements in diet through motivators beyond health, linking to ongoing social

      <title>Diet and mental health with nutrition scientist Megan Lee</title>
      <description>In Episode #187 I sit down with Megan Lee, BPsychSc, to talk about food and mental health. Megan is a career researcher, scientist, and academic at Bond University on the Gold Coast here in Australia. She has a Bachelor in Psychological Science (with Honours) and her PhD in nutritional psychiatry is currently under examination. She has published research on food and mood, body image, disordered eating, dietary patterns, and mental health, and occupational stress in academia.

There’s an interesting backstory as to how this exchange came about. Megan and I recently had some back and forth on Twitter after I did a thread expressing concern with regards to the way the media had misinterpreted a study that she, along with her colleagues, had published in British Medical Journal on plant-based dietary patterns and depressive symptoms.

Following some productive dialogue on twitter I thought it would be a good idea to have Megan on the show.

I hope you enjoy it.

Some of the topics covered in this conversation include:
- Megan’s background and discovering an interest in the link between nutrition and mental health
- Classifying depression
- The incidence of depression
- The science we currently have on the effect of diet on mental health
- Anti-depressant medications and the lack of lifestyle approaches to dealing with mental health
- Potential causes of depression
- The results from her study of vegans and depression
- The media misrepresenting the results of Megan's study
- The pros and cons of cross-sectional studies
- What other types of studies could be useful in examining the relationship between diet and mental health going forward
- Fatty fish/omega 3’s and depression
- The negative effects of alcohol on mental health
- Intuitive eating

Resources:

My tweet on the Channel 7 article

Books mentioned: Pyschobotioic Revolution, This naked Life and Brain Changer

      <title>Vegan Propaganda with Earthling Ed</title>
      <description>In Episode #183 I sit down with the iconic and incredibly eloquent Ed Winters, aka Earthling Ed, to chat about all things veganism. Whether you're vegan or not I think you'll find this conversation interesting and thought provoking.

In this conversation we cover:
- Ed’s time spent at USA universities holding debates
- How he stays calm in his conversations and what he thinks about a more aggressive approach to activism
- Ed’s childhood and journey from being a vegetarian to vegan
- Factory farming - beef, chicken, dairy, eggs
- Our relationship with animals and the ways we devalue them
- Ed’s response to the most common arguments against veganism
- Regenerative agriculture
- Influencers who stop being vegan
- Ed’s response to Joe Rogan and hunting/over-population of wild animals
- Ed’s mission to reduce suffering

and plenty more.

I hope you enjoy it.

      <title>Food ideology with Melanie Joy, PhD</title>
      <description>In Episode #178 we hear from Harvard trained Psychologist Dr Melanie Joy on food ideology and speciesism. This is a condensed throwback of a previous episode we recorded together.

Key things covered in this episode:

- What lead Melanie to studying psychology and veganism
- Learning how to communicate the vegan message
- Cognitive dissonance and why people may react negatively to the vegan message
- What is carnism and the system that disconnects us from our food
- The difficulty of communicating the vegan message
- Vegan allies and using psychology to open the conversation to non-vegans
- The potential harm of using comparisons of slavery, the holocaust &amp; rape
- How to approach people in a way that they will be receptive to the message
- Vegans using shaming techniques is demotivating
- Moral superiority in vegans and privilege
- Trauma narratives and toxic moral perfectionism
- Finding a healthy process of communicating
- Focusing on feeding compassion
- The rapid growth of the vegan movement

- Buying food locally and the importance of what you eat
- The risk of losing Native American wisdom
- The current state of Native Americans
- The descendants of settlers and their relationship with Native Americans today
- The lack of awareness of Native American history
- Reparations and giving land back
- What was shocking to Sanjay about his film ‘Gather’
- How we can support Native Americans

and much more

      <title>Is happiness the key to solving climate change with Nicholas Carter</title>
      <description>What if tackling the world's biggest problem, climate change, was not actually the world's biggest problem? What if solving happiness was - and in restoring happiness we would create a healthier planet?

In episode #175 Environmental Scientist Nicholas Carter returns to give us an update on the health of our planet, explain what COP26 is, and offer a suggestion for what we may actually need to consider if we are going to create a brighter future for humanity.

Hope you enjoy it.

      <title>Is plant-based meat as healthy as animal-based meat with Christopher Gardner, PhD</title>
      <description>In Episode 167 I sit down with Stanford Professor Christopher Gardner to chat about his recent SWAP-MEAT trial that compared plant-based meat with animal-based meat.

If you're wondering how healthy plant-based burgers and sausages are, relative to their organic animal-based counterparts (yes he compared against organic animal products) then I am sure you will find this episode interesting and quite thought provoking.

We also touch on another study that compared the nutrient makeup of plant-based meat to animal-based meat.

​Hope you enjoy it.

      <title>What you eat matters with Ocean Robbins</title>
      <description>In Episode #165 I sit down with Ocean Robbins, co-founder of the Food Revolution Network. Ocean is the son of John Robbins who authored Diet for a new America and grandson of Irv Robbins who co-founded Baskin Robbins ice-creamery in 1945 with Burt Baskin.

This is a great conversation about our health, the food system, taking action to live better for longer and looking after the environment.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

      <title>The ethics of eating animals with Seb Alex</title>
      <description>In Episode #164 we hear a throwback to an earlier episode with Seb Alex on the ethics of eating animal foods.

As you know I like keep the topics of nutrition seperate from ethics. But at the same time I think it's very important we are aware of the impact that our food choices have on the world around us, including the non-human animals we share this place with.

Hope you enjoy the episode. Be sure to keep an eye out for Seb's new podcast launching soon.

Disclaimer: This episode contains descriptive accounts of what happens to various animals that we eat.

      <title>Activating your inner guidance with Light Watkins</title>
      <description>In Episode#163 I sit down with Light Watkins to talk about his new book knowing where to look, living with 'less', meditation, the still small voice and much more.

Little bit of a different conversation to normal. While it's not nutrition focussed it's still highly relevant to finding true health and wellness. Particularly in this current climate where it can be difficult to quieten the mind and tap into the inner voice that we all have. My hope is that Light provides you with inspiration to find the time to do exactly that - to quieten the mind so you can learn more about who you are and what you want to do with your life. I've been doing this imperfectly for a long time now and it's been enormously beneficial.

While it's not nutrition focussed it's still highly relevant to finding true health and wellness. Particularly in this current climate where it can be difficult to quieten the mind and tap into the inner voice that we all have. My hope is that Light provides you with inspiration to find the time to do exactly that - to quieten the mind so you can learn more about who you are and what you want to do with your life.

      <title>Eco friendly food choices with Hannah Ritchie, PhD</title>
      <description>In Episode #160 we hear from Hannah Ritchie, PhD. Hannah is a wonderfully well researched Geoscientist who works with Our World in Data to bring complex environmental science to the mainstream.

How do our food choices affect the world around us? Is palm oil sustainable? Can cows help solve climate change? What's more important - what we eat, or where our food comes from? Find out by listening to this 24 minute information packed distillation of our earlier episode together (Episode #120).

Hope you find it interesting and instructive.

      <title>Protect your heart with Alan Flanagan Msc</title>
      <description>In Episode #159 I sit down with nutrition scientist Alan Flanagan to take a deep dive into the history of the diet-heart-hypothesis with emphasis on the work of Ancel Keys.

Specifically we cover:

The context for researching heart disease in the post World War 2 period

Metabolic ward trials establishing how dietary components affect cholesterol

Teasing out the effects of saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and dietary cholesterol

The motivation for Ancel Keys' Seven Countries Study (SCS) - the worlds first multi-country nutritional epidemiological study

The SCS study design and findings

Common criticisms of the SCS and Ancel Keys

The North Karelia Project as an example of what lowering saturated fat intake can do to heart disease mortality

More recent evidence speaking to the causal affect of LDL cholesterol in the development and progression of heart disease

What we can take away from this large body of evidence to make heart healthy food decisions in our day to day

and much more


This is by far one of my favourite conversations to date. Cardiovascular disease remains as the number one cause of death globally. In fact, in the US, someone dies of cardiovascular disease every 36 seconds - mind blowing given there is so much science showing how we can reduce risk through lifestyle changes.

A lot of the information in this episode I had included in the first draft of my book 'The Proof is in the Plants'  but removed due to word limit - if you have read my book this will provide some extra context behind all of the information in Chapter 5. It's probably a little more in depth than other episodes but I am sure if you listen through it will make sense - and towards the end we summarise and talk to the key takeaways from a more practical point of view (what foods to eat more and less of).

It's probably a little more in depth than other episodes but I am sure if you listen through it will make sense - and towards the end we summarise and talk to the key takeaways from a more practical point of view (what foods to eat more and less of).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p><p>Alan on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/">Instagram</a></p><p>Alinea <a href="https://www.alineanutrition.com">Nutrition</a></p><p>Sigma <a href="https://sigmanutrition.com">Nutrition</a></p><p>Nutrikynd <a href="https://nutrikynd.com">Essential 8 multi-nutrient</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Guidelines/Position Statements:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.jacc.2019.03.010">https://www.jacc.org/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.jacc.2019.03.010</a></p><p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/24/2313/5735221?login=true">https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/24/2313/5735221?login=true</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5837225/pdf/ehx144.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5837225/pdf/ehx144.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/1/111/5556353">https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/1/111/5556353</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000510">https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000510</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mendelian Randomisation Studies:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109712047730?via%3Dihub">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109712047730?via%3Dihub</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6101243/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6101243/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1604304">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1604304</a></p><p><a href="https://www.cardiology.theclinics.com/article/S0733-8651(17)30151-0/fulltext">https://www.cardiology.theclinics.com/article/S0733-8651(17)30151-0/fulltext</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want to support the show?</strong></p><p>If you are enjoying the Plant Proof podcast a great way to support the show is by leaving a review on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/plant-proof-evidence-based-nutrition/id1367773989">Apple podcast app</a>.

      <link>https://theproof.com/psychosis-anxiety-addiction-and-ocd-with-osher-gunsberg/</link>
      <description>In Episode #156, a Wednesday Wisdoms throwback, Australian TV icon Osher Günsberg opens up about his struggles with psychosis, anxiety, addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder.

If you find Osher's story interesting I highly encourage you to grab a copy of his book Back, After the Break - it's incredible.

Also, I'm sure Osher would love to hear from you - connect with him on Instagram.

      <title>Nutrition for families with Brenda Davis, RD</title>
      <description>In episode #153 I sit down with Registered Dietitian Brenda Davis for a conversation I wanted to have for some time now. Brenda is one of the most revered experts across the globe when it comes to Plant-Based nutrition - with over 3 decades of experience, communicating nutrition science without hype, to help people optimise their diet.

With the release of her 12th book Nourish, which she co-wrote with Paediatrician Dr Reshma Shah, I thought it would be a great opportunity to have her on the show, to share her story and talk about some of the important things for families to consider when shifting to a plant-based approach. The benefits that are up for grabs? The ins and outs of fat, fibre, protein, various micronutrients and much more.

I hope you enjoy it.

      <title>Rethinking diet &amp; exercise with Herman Pontzer, PhD</title>
      <description>In Episode #151 I sit down with Evolutionary Anthropologist Herman Pontzer, PhD to talk about ancestral eating how his work with the Hadza can help us think about both diet and exercise as tools for weight loss.

Specifically we talk about:


What an evolutionary anthropologist is

The origins of the genus homo

What we know about ancestral diets

Why the 'Paleo diet' is an over simplification

Herman's time spent with the Hadza

What the Hadza diet looks like

Why the Hadza diet isn't 'low carb'

What Herman learned about metabolism by studying the Hadza

The constrained energy model

How we should think about exercise when it comes to weight loss

What a healthy diet looks like at an individual level

How to address the chronic disease pandemic at a community level

and much more


Resources:

Connect with Herman on Twitter
Grab a copy of Herman's new book BURN
Read Herman's 2016 paper on the constrained energy model
Read Herman's 2015 paper on diet variability among hunter gatherer tribes
Donate to support the Hadza - donations help improve healthcare for the Hadza people

      <title>Improving thyroid health with Endocrinologist Dr Brittany Henderson</title>
      <description>In Episode 149 I sit down with Endocrinologist Dr Brittany Henderson to talk about thyroid health. Whether you have a thyroid condition yourself, or are just interested in learning more about how this organ affects your health, I'm sure you will enjoy this episode.

Specifically we cover:


What the field of Endocrinology is focussed on

What makes an organ an endocrine organ

Type of endocrine related disorders

What our thyroid is and why it's important to our health

Common thyroid disorders (e.g Hashimotos)

Blood tests to monitor thyroid health (e.g antibody tests)

Managing thyroid conditions with a particular focus on foods and nutrients (e.g iodine and selenium)

and much more


Brittany Henderson, MD:

Brittany Henderson, MD, ECNU is board-certified in internal medicine and endocrinology, with advanced training in thyroid disorders, including Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Graves Disease, thyroid nodules, and thyroid cancer. Originally from Cleveland, Ohio, she graduated near the top of her class at Northeastern Ohio Medical University, where she received the honor of Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA). She completed her endocrinology fellowship training under a National Institutes of Health (NIH) research-training grant at Duke University Medical Center. She then served as Medical Director for the Thyroid and Endocrine Tumor Board at Duke University Medical Center and as Clinical Director for the Thyroid and Endocrine Neoplasia Clinic at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. She is also one of the founders and the current Co-President of the American College of Thyroidology.

She has received multiple prestigious grants from the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and ThyCa (Thyroid Cancer Survivors’ Association, Inc.). Her work has been featured on the cover of Thyroid and in many other scientific journals including Endocrinology, Gut, and Oncotarget. She desires to improve quality of life for those living with thyroid disease both through novel research and medical guidance. For patients living with Hashimoto’s disease, she believes that knowledge is power.

Her clinical practice is dedicated to patients with thyroid disease. She specializes in autoimmune thyroid disease, thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer, ethanol ablation, and advanced minimally invasive techniques. In addition to using a mainstream medical approach, Dr. Henderson also uses complementary medicine to explore underlying root causes of thyroid disease.

      <description>In Episode #145 I sit down with Professor Christopher Gardner from Stanford University to chat about his research looking at low versus high carb diets for weight loss.

How Dr Gardner became interested in nutrition science and what led him to studying weight loss

Why Dr Gardner conducts Randomised Controlled Trials

The A to Z study

The DIETFITS study

Why diet quality is important

Why average weight loss in studies doesn't show the full story

The carbohydrate-insulin model

What we do and don't know about diet and weight loss

much more

      <title>Love as a catalyst for lifelong change with Adam Sud</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/love-as-a-catalyst-for-lifelong-change-with-adam-sud</link>
      <description>In Episode #144 we hear from Adam Sud on his battle with depression and addiction, and ultimately how he turned his life around by flipping the narrative from on of self-hatred to self-love. A heart wrenching yet extremely beautiful story that is sure to inspire.

Hope you enjoy it.

Disclaimer: This episode makes mention of suicide. If this is a trigger for you I recommend giving it a miss and stopping by next episode instead.

Need someone to talk to? Other than friends, family and people in your community, there are 24/7 help line services all around the world. For example, in Australia, if you are feeling down, anxious or depressed, and want someone to listen to you, or someone to help guide you through the problems you're experiencing, Beyond Blue is available around the clock. You can call them on 1300 22 4636 or if you'd rather chat via text you can do so with an online operator here.

Dysbiosis

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

Celiac Disease

Colorectal Cancer

Probiotics and gut health

As these were by far some of the most popular episodes to date my team and I went back through and pulled out the most important parts and brought them together into this 2 part series.

In Part 1 (this episode) we cover:


What the microbiome is

What dysbiosis is

The 3 parts of dysbiosis including what's often described as 'leaky gut'

The importance of fibre

What short chain fatty acids are

Animal foods and gut health

The ketogenic diet and gut health

Kombucha

Bone Broth

Dairy

Gluten and IBS

Juice cleanses

Spicy food

Alcohol

and much more


Part 2 of this series, which is out in a weeks time, is more focussed on specific gut health conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

Happy listening. I hope you find it equal parts informative and instructive.

      <itunes:summary>In Episode #141 we hear from three Gastroenterologists as part of a two part series on optimising gut health - Dr Sarina Pasricha, Dr Alan Desmond and Dr Will Bulsiewicz.

As these were by far some of the most popular episodes to date my team and I went back through and pulled out the most important parts and brought them together into this 2 part series.

In Part 1 (this episode) we cover:


What the microbiome is

What dysbiosis is

The 3 parts of dysbiosis including what's often described as 'leaky gut'

The importance of fibre

What short chain fatty acids are

Animal foods and gut health

The ketogenic diet and gut health

Kombucha

Bone Broth

Dairy

Gluten and IBS

Juice cleanses

Spicy food

Alcohol

and much more


Part 2 of this series, which is out in a weeks time, is more focussed on specific gut health conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

Happy listening. I hope you find it equal parts informative and instructive.

Who tends to get colorectal cancer

How colorectal cancer is diagnosed

What the survival rate is once diagnosed with colorectal cancer

The importance of colorectal cancer screening and who should be doing this

Lifestyle modifications to lower our risk of developing colorectal cancer

Alcohol and colorectal cancer risk

Dr Desmond's thoughts on meat-rich low carbohydrate diets and colorectal cancer

and much more

      <title>Paleo, plant-based or other with Dr David Katz</title>
      <description>In Episode #138 we hear from David Katz, MD about eating for optimal health. In a world of diet extremes, and dogma, Dr Katz offers a much needed voice of reason.

This is a condensed version of his earlier episode (Ep #108) on the show 'Can we say what diet is best for health?'

If you are looking for a no nonsense summary of nutrition science to help make healthier food choices for you, and your family, then I am certain you will find this a really valuable listen.

      <title>Animal vs plant protein for building muscle and strength with scientist Hamilton Roschel</title>
      <description>In Episode #137 I sit down with scientist Hamilton Roschel to discuss his recent study investigating whether the source of protein, animal or plant, affects muscle strength and growth in young healthy adults performing resistance training.

Specifically we discuss:

Why this study was performed

What the study methodology was

What makes this study unique

      <title>Ageing better with Dan Buettner</title>
      <description>In Episode #134 I sit down with Dan Buettner, best-selling author of The Blue Zones, to chat about longevity lessons from the healthiest and longest living populations on planet Earth. These populations, together described as the 'Blue Zones', being Loma Linda (California), Ikaria (Greece), Nicoya (Costa Rica), Sardinia (Italy) and Okinawa (Japan). When we understand how people in these parts of the world are living we can begin to understand where we may want to adjust our lifestyles. Adjustments that may well lead to the health and longevity that they experience!

Hope you enjoy the episode.

      <title>Protein truths with Dr Matthew Nagra</title>
      <description>In Episode #133 I sit down with Dr Matthew Nagra to tackle the almighty protein topic! You know, the nutrient we are all fascinated by.

What is protein? How much do we need? What's the difference between animal and plant protein? The best types of protein for good health? How do we optimise protein intake for promoting lean muscle and strength?

We cover all of this and more - all through an evidence-based lens. Not what random folks are saying at the gym or online in the comments section. But what the highest quality science says.

Specifically we cover:


What protein is

How much protein we need

How much protein the average omnivore and vegetarian/vegan consumes

Incomplete versus complete protein - how people are incorrectly using these terms

Protein quality - how scoring systems work

The difference between animal and plant protein when it comes to quality - and what this means for your food selection

Animal versus plant protein and health outcomes

Is soy protein safe? (e.g tempeh, tofu and soy milk)

Best protein swaps you could consider making today

Animal versus plant protein and performance outcomes (e.g lean muscle and strength)

Optimising protein intake for performance

        <![CDATA[<p>In <strong>Episode #133 </strong>I sit down with <strong>Dr Matthew Nagra</strong> to tackle the almighty protein topic! You know, the nutrient we are all fascinated by.</p><p><br></p><p>What is protein? How much do we need? What's the difference between animal and plant protein? The best types of protein for good health? How do we optimise protein intake for promoting lean muscle and strength?</p><p><br></p><p>We cover all of this and more - all through an evidence-based lens. Not what random folks are saying at the gym or online in the comments section. But what the highest quality science says.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Specifically we cover:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul>
<li>What protein is</li>
<li>How much protein we need</li>
<li>How much protein the average omnivore and vegetarian/vegan consumes</li>
<li>Incomplete versus complete protein - how people are incorrectly using these terms</li>
<li>Protein quality - how scoring systems work</li>
<li>The difference between animal and plant protein when it comes to quality - and what this means for your food selection</li>
<li>Animal versus plant protein and health outcomes</li>
<li>Is soy protein safe? (e.g tempeh, tofu and soy milk)</li>
<li>Best protein swaps you could consider making today</li>
<li>Animal versus plant protein and performance outcomes (e.g lean muscle and strength)</li>
<li>Optimising protein intake for performance</li>

      <title>The power of choice with actor Adrian Grenier</title>
      <description>In Episode #129 I sit down with Hollywood actor, musician and environmentalist Adrian Grenier to chat about his learnings from his life and the changes he has made in more recent years to add greater meaning and purpose.

Feeling numb

The moment when he was forced to critically review his life

Practices and books that Adrian has leaned into that have helped him become more self aware, more sure of his path and more in harmony with the world around him

The power of choices versus being forced to do something

Environmental activism

The not for profit organisation The Lonely Whale


Making the world a better place through purpose driven business

and much more

      <title>A predominately plant-based diet for babies and toddlers with Registered Dietitian's Alexandra Caspero and Whitney English</title>
      <description>In Episode #128 I'm joined by Alexandra Caspero, RND and Whitney English, RND to discuss raising babies and toddlers on a predominately plant-based diet.

Specifically we cover:


Why would one want to consider a predominately plant-based diet?

Plant-predominant versus plant-exclusive diets

Advantages of a plant-predominant diet

Obesity in children

Science looking at growth and development in plant-based populations

Why the fear on social media and in the media surrounding plant-based diets and children

Further research that they would like to see

Where a plant-based diet could go wrong

Key nutrients of focus including B12, iron and DHA.

Importance of dietary fat

Are soy products safe for babies and toddlers?

Things to consider when using infant formula

and much more

      <title>Getting Down to Earth with Darin Olien</title>
      <description>In Episode #125 I sit down with New York Times best selling author Darin Olien to chat about his view on human and planetary health, as well as his time spent producing the super popular Down to Earth Netflix show that he co-hosts with Zac Efron

Specifically we cover:



Fatal conveniences - Darin provides his view on chemical and plastic exposure from convenient items that we all use (tea bags, tap water, spray deodorant etc).

How Down to Earth came about

Working with Zac Efron 


Down to Earth season 2 in Australia


Solutions to solving climate change

and much more



As I mention in the introduction Darin raises some extremely interesting things in this episode. Not all of which are supported by in depth science due to the nature of the conversation. So take them with a grain of salt. Many of these ideas I intend to dive even deeper into in upcoming episodes - with Darin and other guests to actually get to know where the science lies (fluoride in water for example).

        <![CDATA[<p>In <strong>Episode #125</strong> I sit down with New York Times best selling author <strong>Darin Olien</strong> to chat about his view on human and planetary health, as well as his time spent producing the super popular<strong> Down to Earth</strong> <strong>Netflix show</strong> that he co-hosts with Zac Efron</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Specifically we cover:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Fatal conveniences</strong> - Darin provides his view on chemical and plastic exposure from convenient items that we all use (tea bags, tap water, spray deodorant etc).</li>
<li>How <strong>Down to Earth</strong> came about</li>
<li>Working with <strong>Zac Efron </strong>
</li>
<li>Down to Earth <strong>season 2 in Australia</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Solutions to solving climate change</strong></li>
<li>and <strong>much more</strong>
</li>
</ul><p><br></p><p>As I mention in the introduction Darin raises some extremely interesting things in this episode. Not all of which are supported by in depth science due to the nature of the conversation. So take them with a grain of salt. Many of these ideas I intend to dive even deeper into in upcoming episodes - with Darin and other guests to actually get to know where the science lies (fluoride in water for example).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p><p>Connect with Darin on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/darinolien/?hl=en">Instagram</a></p><p>Visit Darin's <a href="https://darinolien.com">website</a></p><p>Get a copy of Darin's book <a href="https://darinolien.com">Superlife</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want to support the show?</strong></p><p>If you are enjoying the Plant Proof podcast a great way to support the show is by leaving a review on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/plant-proof-evidence-based-nutrition/id1367773989">Apple podcast app</a>.

      <title>Healing the planet with our food choices with Dr Hannah Ritchie</title>
      <description>In Episode 120 I sit down with Dr Hannah Ritchie, Geoscientist and senior researcher at Our World in Data, to dive deeper into our food system and the changes we need to make in the coming decades to meet climate goals.

Specifically we cover:


Her journey into the world of geoscience and environmental research

What Our World in Data is

Why it's important to zoom out and look at data over a long period of time

Insights into COVID-19 data

Why it's important we consider agriculture when looking at planetary health

The parts of planetary health that we needs to consider when looking at agriculture and our personal food systems (such as greenhouse gas emissions, land-use, biodiversity)

Major drivers of deforestation

Plant foods versus animal foods and planetary health

Soy and deforestation

Palm oil and deforestation

and much more


Resources:

A few of Hannah's articles to read
1- You want to reduce the carbon footprint of your food? Focus on what you eat, not whether your food is local
2 - Cutting down forests: what are the drivers of deforestation?
3 - Less meat is nearly always better than sustainable meat, to reduce your carbon footprint
4 - If the world adopted a plant-based diet we would reduce global agricultural land use from 4 to 1 billion hectares

My new book The Proof is in the Plants is out May 4th. Preorder your copy here.

      <title>Approaching climate change like a game of chess with Dr Jonathan Foley</title>
      <description>In Episode #119 I sit down with Dr Jonathan Foley, one of the worlds most highly regarded Climate and Environmental Scientist's. Jonathan has published over 130 peer reviewed papers in the the field of sustainability in highly prestigious journals such as Science and Nature. He is also an author, a highly sought after guest speaker and is the Executive Director at Project Drawdown, a not-for-profit organisation which is widely considered as the worlds leading resource for information on climate solutions. However, as brilliant as his resume is, his communication is arguably what makes his work so incredibly powerful.

 In this episode we cover:

How the climate change conversation has moved from debate around its existence to debate around solutions

What Project Drawdown is

Individual versus government action

Looking at climate change as a game of chess

Why climate change doesn't have to be scary

The changes we can make as individuals with a specific focus on three key areas: water, energy and food.

and much more


If you are wanting to learn real facts about climate change and the solutions we have, from someone who not only values science but contributes to it, then I highly suggest you make time to listen to this...probably more than once! And of course, share it to any friends or family members who you think may benefit from hearing from Dr Foley.

Resources:


Project Drawdown

Jonathan's Bio

Jonathan on twitter

Jonathon's blog 'Beef rules'

Jonathan's blog on seeing Climate change as a game of Chess

Confused about holistic grazing and whether grass-fed beef is a real climate solution? Read this paper out of Oxford University Dr Tara Garnett which discusses some of the problems with claims from certain people in this industry. You can also read a piece I co-wrote with Environmental Researcher Nicholas Carter here for more on this topic.

      <title>Omega 3s and brain health with Drs Dean &amp; Ayesha Sherzai</title>
      <description>In Episode 117 I sit down with Dean &amp; Ayesha Sherzai, MD leading Neurologist's who specialise in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's. Recently Dean and Ayesha performed a thorough review of the literature to find out how important omega 3s are for brain function and whether or not we should supplement them. Naturally they ended up splitting this review into two parts, one covering pregnancy, infancy, childhood and adolescence and the other covering adulthood. In this episode we break down their findings with the goal of helping you understand what omega 3s are, where we get them from and whether we should consider supplementation. It was a pleasure to have them back on the show. I love everything that they are about and I'm sure you're going to find this a very informative episode.

Specifically we cover:


What Omega 3's are

Difference between short chain and long chain omega 3's

Omega 3's and pregnancy, infancy, childhood and adolescence

Omega 3's and adulthood

Omega 3's and cognitive impairment

Considering supplementation

and much more

      <title>Is grass-fed beef good for our planet?</title>
      <description>In Episode 116 I sit down with Environmental Researcher Nicholas Carter to talk further about grass-fed beef and planetary health.

Specifically we cover:

1 - Results from a new peer-reviewed study on White Oaks Pasture, a farm that for years has claimed their beef is carbon negative.
2 - The importance of rewilding for cooling our planet
3 - How changing the foods we eat can help free up land to be rewilded and protect existing forests
4 - The GHG footprint of our food - how important is transport in this conversation? Beef versus Avocado as an example.
5 - The UK's Regenuary movement and some of their claims
6 - and much more

Resources:

John Hokpkins University study published in 2020 which combined data from 140 countries and identified the single greatest way for someone to lower the GHG footprint of their diet was by adopting a vegan diet. Next best was a vegan diet with insects and molluscs and then a two-thirds vegan diet (2 vegan meals and snacks a day with one meal containing animal products).

You want to reduce the carbon footprint of your food? Focus on what you eat, not whether your food is local. Article by Hannah Ritchie

Author of White Oaks Pastures study acknowledging that their beef is NOT carbon negative and such claims are false.

      <title>When we eat matters - how time restricted feeding helps nurture our circadian rhythms with Emily Manoogian, PhD</title>
      <description>In Episode 114 I sit down with Emily Manoogian, PhD from the Panda lab at Salk Institute to learn about how we can improve our health by nurturing our our circadian rhythms. Emily and her team are considered world leaders in the field of science known as 'chronobiology' and have published several studies (and many others currently under way) investigating how the timing of our meals effects our health.

In this episode we specifically cover:


What circadian rhythms are

Why we need circadian rhythms

What circadian disruption is

What social jet-lag is

Learning from shift workers

How external cues such as light exposure and meal timing affect our circadian rhythms

Time restricted feeding (TRF) and what Emily's research has identified so far

The difference between TRF and fasting

Why Emily recommends having more calories in the first half of your day

What to do if you are someone who routinely has dinner very late (e.g many Europeans)

Lots of practical information that you can put into play

Future research Emily would like to conduct

and much more


As I note at the beginning of this episode in the introduction. While the time restricted eating that we talk about is far from an extreme protocol, if you suffer from an eating disorder and find the subject of meal timing in any way to be triggering then this may not be the best episode for you, which is totally fine! You can just pick the show back up next episode, and come back to this episode in the future if you feel the timing is more appropriate for you.

NOTE: Unfortunately the audio quality of this episode is not as high as I would ordinarily like. While I much prefer having these conversations in person (and hope to get back to that format soon) with COVID-19 I've needed to record remotely in order to continue having such informative guests on the show.

Emily and her team are considered world leaders in the field of science known as '<strong>chronobiology' </strong>and have published several studies (and many others currently under way) investigating how the timing of our meals effects our health.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>In this episode we specifically cover:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul>
<li>What circadian rhythms are</li>
<li>Why we need circadian rhythms</li>
<li>What circadian disruption is</li>
<li>What social jet-lag is</li>
<li>Learning from shift workers</li>
<li>How external cues such as light exposure and meal timing affect our circadian rhythms</li>
<li>Time restricted feeding (TRF) and what Emily's research has identified so far</li>
<li>The difference between TRF and fasting</li>
<li>Why Emily recommends having more calories in the first half of your day</li>
<li>What to do if you are someone who routinely has dinner very late (e.g many Europeans)</li>
<li>Lots of practical information that you can put into play</li>
<li>Future research Emily would like to conduct</li>
<li>and much more</li>
</ul><p><br></p><p>As I note at the beginning of this episode in the introduction. While the time restricted eating that we talk about is far from an extreme protocol, if you suffer from an eating disorder and find the subject of meal timing in any way to be triggering then this may not be the best episode for you, which is totally fine! You can just pick the show back up next episode, and come back to this episode in the future if you feel the timing is more appropriate for you.</p><p><br></p><p><em>NOTE:</em> Unfortunately the audio quality of this episode is not as high as I would ordinarily like. While I much prefer having these conversations in person (and hope to get back to that format soon) with COVID-19 I've needed to record remotely in order to continue having such informative guests on the show.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.mycircadianclock.org"><strong>My Circadian clock</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrBYSinpEtU"><strong>Emily's Tedx Talk</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Continue the conversation:</strong></p><p>We would love to hear from you</p><p>Emily Manoogian, PhD: <a href="https://twitter.com/emilymanoogian?lang=en">Twitter</a>.</p><p>Simon Hill: <a href="https://dashboard.whooshkaa.com/instagram.com/plant_proof">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://dashboard.whooshkaa.com/twitter.com/plant_proof">Twitter</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want to support the show?</strong></p><p>The single best way you can support the show is by leaving a review on Apple podcast app - it only takes a few minutes and would be much appreciated.

      <title>Upgrade your health by changing the foods you eat with Matthew Nagra, ND</title>
      <description>In Episode 113 I sit down with Naturopathic Doctor Matthew Nagra to talk about how he uses evidence based nutrition science to help his patients upgrade their health. If you are looking for an episode that consolidates several things previously spoken about on the show, along with findings from new research then I think you will really enjoy this episode. Particularly if you like the more in-depth science episodes.

In this episode we talk about:


The latest EPIC-Oxford study on bone health

The health advantages that people have who adopt plant-predominant or exclusive dietary patterns

Naturopathy as a form of health care

How Dr Nagra helps his patients make sustainable changes

Common questions Dr Nagra gets from patients (Including questions about protein, soy, lectins, cooking oils etc)

His personal food philosophy

LDL-Cholesterol being an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and his thoughts on the carnivore diet

Important nutrients and supplements for people reducing their consumption of animal foods

A new study on iodine status in Norwegian pescatarians, vegetarians and vegans.

and much more

      <title>Vegans...we need to talk with Psychologist Melanie Joy</title>
      <description>In Episode 112 I sit down with Harvard-educated Psychologist and best selling author Melanie Joy to discuss how we form our beliefs about food and how vegans can have healthier, more productive, conversations with non-vegans. An episode that I believe will be highly instructive regardless of the diet that you follow.

In this episode we cover:


Melanie's personal journey to studying Psychology at Harvard and writing her award winning book "Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows: An Introduction to Carnism" 


Why our food choices matter

The carnism ideaology

Carnistic defense systems and the three N's: 'Normal, Natural and Necessary

Effective vegan advocacy: how to communicate better as a vegan

Shame vs guilt

The idea of thinking about process vs content when communicating with someone who holds a different opinion to you

Why the debate format sets us up to fail

How you can be a part of the solution

What a 'vegan ally' is

The idea of watering the right seeds

and much more


While my episodes usually focus on nutrition science I found this exchange fascinating and believe many of the learnings hold true for our communication in general, whether that be related to food choices and the exploitation of animals or not. My plan is to extend this into a 3-4 part series, with Melanie to return and another high profile vegan activist in the coming months so we can continue exploring this topic together.

Resources:
The 3 minute video on Carnism created by Melanie and her team Beyond Carnism that I referred to in this conversation
Connect with Melanie on Instagram @beyondcarnism

Melanie's Book Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows: An Introduction to Carnism, 10th Anniversary Edition
The Vegan Matrix - another book written by Melanie exploring what she believes is a serious problem with the vegan movement: unexamined privilege.
Melanie's 2015 TedX Talk Toward Rational, Authentic Food Choices

My Book:
My book is coming out early 2021 published with Penguin - I cannot wait to share with you. In the lead up the launch I am going to share information about the title, cover, ways to win a copy, live event dates, free e-books etc. Register your email here so I can keep you up to date.

      <title>Can holistic grazing reverse climate change? A review of Kiss the Ground</title>
      <description>In Episode 111 I sit down with Environmental Researcher Nicholas Carter to discuss claims made in the Kiss the Ground documentary that was released on Netflix a few weeks ago.

Specifically we cover:

The claims made by the documentary around reversal of climate change

Pro's and Con's of the solutions put forward by the documentary

Holistic grazing and carbon sequestration

Alan Savory and science

Importance of conservation and restoration of forests

Grasslands versus forests for carbon sequestration

What a shift to holistic grazing would mean for diets globally

The evidence based way for individuals to lower their food based environmental footprint

and much more


Resources:

      <itunes:summary>In Episode 111 I sit down with Environmental Researcher Nicholas Carter to discuss claims made in the Kiss the Ground documentary that was released on Netflix a few weeks ago.

Specifically we cover:

The claims made by the documentary around reversal of climate change

Pro's and Con's of the solutions put forward by the documentary

Holistic grazing and carbon sequestration

Alan Savory and science

Importance of conservation and restoration of forests

Grasslands versus forests for carbon sequestration

What a shift to holistic grazing would mean for diets globally

The evidence based way for individuals to lower their food based environmental footprint

and much more


Resources:

FCRN Grazed and Confused Report


Paul Hawken's Drawdown Review solutions - Sort by impact and you will see Plant-Rich diets are in the top 4 of all solutions in both scenario 1 and scenario 2 that they put forward.

Maria Nordborg's review of Holistic Grazing and Alan Savory's claims

Tim Searchinger's paper on land use

Matthew Hayek's paper on what a shift from factory farmed cows to grazing cows means for beef supply

      <title>Clearing the confusion and making evidence-based food choices</title>
      <description>In Episode 110 I sit down with Drew Harrisberg to talk about my book and how we should be using science to make public health recommendations as well as answering a bunch of questions sent in from the community.

Specifically we cover:


The evidence hierarchy in nutrition science

Why fibre recommendations may in fact be lower than what's optimal

The carnivore diet and secondary bile salts

Omega 3's and the evidence surrounding protection against heart disease

Supplementing B12, Vitamin D

Getting enough calcium in your diet

A few food groups that are particularly beneficial for brain performance and protection against cognitive decline

and much more

      <title>Cell based meat and the future of food with Bruce Friedrich</title>
      <description>In Episode 109 I sit down with lawyer and Co-Founder of the Good Food Institute Bruce Friedrich to talk about two solutions to the current problems with our food system: these solutions being plant based meat and cultivated or 'cell-based' meat.

Specifically we cover:


What's wrong with the current food system and how it is impacting human health, planetary health and animal welfare

Specifics on climate change, COVID-19, antibiotic resistance, production inefficiencies and food security

What plant based and cultivated meats are

Specifics related to bio mimicking meat using cells collected via biopsy

Where these industries are currently and the projections

The companies leading the way in these industries

Why major meat companies are investing into this space

Barriers to entry

When we can expect to see cell based meat on shelf

How these types of products are likely to be perceived by customers

and much more


Resources:

Good Food Institute
Bruce's Ted Talk
Bruce on Twitter
Good Food Institute on Instagram

If you're a regular listener you will know I prefer to do these conversations in person. I apologise in advance for slightly tinny audio from Bruce's end - the recording software is a bit hit and miss compared to when you are in the same room! Nonetheless it's certainly not the worst audio I have heard and the information is tremendously insightful.

      <title>Can we say what diet is best for health with David Katz, MD</title>
      <description>In Episode #108 I sit down with Dr David Katz, MD who in my opinion, is one of the greatest voices of clarity in a space of science which let's be frank, is littered with confusion tactics, hidden agendas and bias. This is a great episode which reinforces many of the key principles that I have been sharing with you via social media and on this show for the past 2 + years. It also emphasises the 3 pillars that I look to when making my personal food decisions - the pillar of human health, planetary health and animal welfare.

In this episode we specifically talk about:


Why an infectious disease pandemic may be what we need to take chronic disease more seriously

The number one risk factor for chronic disease in developed countries

Why debating the little stuff is keeping us from making impact on the big stuff

The characteristics of an optimal diet

Can we say what the single best diet is

The importance of the replacement nutrient in nutrition science

The use of strawman diets in nutrition science

Should we eat fish? What are the considerations here?

Would adding animal products to an optimally planned vegan diet improve one's health

and much more


I really hope you enjoy the show. Of course, if you do, please share your feedback with David and I on social media. The best place to find David is on Twitter - you can also find me on Twitter and Instagram too.

Below is a few resources that we spoke about in this episode:


David's website

David's wife's recipes at Cuisinicity


David's books - How to Eat &amp; The Truth About Food


Why Two Pandemics are better than one

      <description>In Episode #107 I sit down with Doug Evans, Author of The Sprout Book, to talk about the magical process of sprouting seeds and why we should be eating more of them.

Specifically we cover:


Doug's personal journey from growing up in NYC to living in the Californian desert

Why Doug changed his own personal diet some 20 years ago

What sprouting is

Sprouts Vs Shoots Vs Microgreens

The nutritional benefits of sprouts including the anti-cancer molecules found in broccoli sprouts

The cost of sprouting

Sprouts and food sovereignty

The typical equipment needed to sprout

Choosing the right seeds

The typical sprouting process

The importance of water quality when sprouting

Eating sprouts

and much more


Resources:



The Sprout Book by Doug Evans- Booktopia - For Australian's or Amazon (If Amazon doesn't ship to you, just google 'The Sprout Book' to find a local book store that's selling it)

My blog 'Sprouting 101' to help you get started. Including specific information on sprouting broccoli sprouts and flaxseeds to help get you going. Flaxseeds are one of my favourites to sprout because it increases their Omega 3 content, which as you are most likely well aware, features in the Plant Proof Food Pyramid.

      <title>Our diet is destroying the planet with Environmental Researcher Nicholas Carter</title>
      <description>In Episode 104 I sit down with Environmental Researcher Nicholas Carter to chat about how our current food system is effecting the environment and what changes need to be made in order to meet climate goals and create a system that results in better food security, less water pollution, less land use, less freshwater use and greater production efficiency.

SPECIFICALLY WE COVER:

What is climate change?

What are the implications of a warming planet?

What are planetary boundaries?

Is climate change more than an energy issue?

What are greenhouse gases?

The major greenhouse gases - Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Nitrous Oxide

Human activity and greenhouse gases

Agriculture and GHG's

Importance of understanding land use, deforestation and carbon sequestration when land is left alone

Animal versus plant based foods and their environmental impact

Impact of transport on the footprint of our food compared to the type of food

Holistic grazing (form of regenerative agriculture proposed by Alan Savoury and Game Brown etc) - is it a climate change solution?

What a more efficient food system looks like

Animal manure vs green manure

Monocultures vs Polycultures and soil health

Access to food that has a lower environmental footprint to make it the easier decision for people (Default-Veg)

Top tips that we can implement on an individual basis to lower our environmental footprint

much more (wow - one of my favourite episodes yet)


RESOURCES:


Poore &amp; Nemecek 2018 study looking at the environmental impact of food from almost 40,000 farms across 119 countries.


2020 Drawdown Review by Paul Hawken and his team (shift to plant centric diets)


EAT Lancet report - the planetary health diet (88% or more calories from plants)


Meat the Future documentary (cellular agriculture - a potentially more sustainable way to produce meat in the future)

Why buying local is not as important as food source when it comes to the environmental footprint of your food

FCRN report that covers holistic grazing

White Oak Pastures

Why methane matters - https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2019/0213/1029274-why-methane-matters-so-much-in-climate-change-planning/


Blog on Climate change and our food system

GHGs in US are significantly underestimated: https://faunalytics.org/animal-agriculture-is-responsible-for-more-ghg-emissions-than-previously-thought/#


The need to measure carbon opportunity loss of land use change, and shows at least 42% of pastureland globally was forest: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30542169/

What is the role of our kidneys

What Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is and how many people it affects

Major risk factors for CKD

Different stages of CKD

Reversing/Managing CKD

Dialysis

Kidney transplants

Evidence based recommendations for nutrition for those with CKD

High versus low carbohydrate diets

Kidney stones

      <title>Where do most viruses come from and how can we stop them infecting humans with National Geographic science writer David Quammen</title>
      <description>In Episode 101 I was super fortunate to have the opportunity to sit down with well known National Geographic writer and author, David Quammen, to talk about zoonotic diseases and mitigating the risk of future pandemics. A fascinating area of science that gives birth to yet another reason to be mindful of our lifestyles. Given that predictions suggest there are over 1.5 million animal viruses yet to be discovered understanding what increases the likelihood that a virus passes from an animal to a human is incredibly important for human health.

Within this episode we specifically cover:


What zoonotic diseases are

The origin of zoonotic diseases

What a 'spillover' means

What reservoir hosts are

HIV, Ebola and other Zoonotic Diseases

Transmissibility and fatality rate

The likely origin of COVID-19

How human activity affects the risk of these emerging novel diseases

much more


Following this episode I get the feeling many of you will be inspired to read David's book 'Spillover' which you can find along with all of his other books on his website.

If you enjoyed the episode, or have follow up questions, be sure to let David know on twitter.

      <title>It's time for change with Drew Harrisberg</title>
      <description>In Episode 100 I sit down with Drew Harrisberg to talk about the first 100 episodes of this show and broadly speaking some of the most important learnings that I have taken away, particularly on human and planetary health. We also delve into the current circumstances that we all find ourselves in and reflect on our personal experiences and learnings thus far. While this free-flowing chat between two mates is exactly as I imagined and the perfect summary for the first 100 episodes, the unplanned nature of it means we do jump around a little bit.

      <itunes:summary>In Episode 100 I sit down with Drew Harrisberg to talk about the first 100 episodes of this show and broadly speaking some of the most important learnings that I have taken away, particularly on human and planetary health. We also delve into the current circumstances that we all find ourselves in and reflect on our personal experiences and learnings thus far. While this free-flowing chat between two mates is exactly as I imagined and the perfect summary for the first 100 episodes, the unplanned nature of it means we do jump around a little bit. But for those willing to look past that I think there is some thought provoking material inside for everyone.

      <title>Overcoming adversity &amp; seeking new challenges with Rich Roll</title>
      <description>In Episode 99 I sit down for a second time with ultra athlete Rich Roll to talk about the humble beginnings of his show, which is now one of the world's leading podcasts in the education and wellness space, and what it feels like to have now released over 500 episodes into the wild.

We cover a bunch of other topics too, including overcoming adversity and seeking out new challenges, that I think you will also find interesting. Of course anyone who know's Rich will be familiar with how beautifully he's able to articulate his experiences, thoughts and learnings for us all to benefit from. A craft of his that no doubt comes with decades of introspection and self work, and years behind the microphone conversing with a diverse range of interesting guests.

Please also note, as mentioned in the introduction this was recorded before LA went into social isolation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. So if you see videos of us online from this episode, they were shot well and truly before there was any advice to practice social distancing.

Hope you enjoy friends. Be sure to connect with Rich on Instagram or Twitter, thank him for taking the time to have this conversation and if you haven't already, grab a copy of his book 'Finding Ultra' here.

      <title>Slowing and reversing ageing with Dr David Sinclair, Phd</title>
      <description>In Episode 98 I sit down with Harvard Professor Dr David Sinclair, PHD to discuss the information theory of ageing and in particular how we can slow down and perhaps even reverse the ageing process.

In this episode we cover:


David's back story and how he found himself in the field of anti-ageing science

His information theory of ageing

Chronological age versus biological

The Horvath clock.

The role of genetics versus epigenetic in the ageing process

How long he thinks we can may be able to live to

How our nutrition affects the ageing process

Hormesis and ageing - including periods of hunger or 'intermittent fasting'.

Other lifestyle factors that affect the ageing process

NAD

NMN supplements and other medications/supplements that may slow down the ageing process

and much more


This is a deep dive into the underlying mechanisms occurring at a cellular level that take place as we age. An exchange that I thoroughly enjoyed and hope you do too. Of course, in two hours it's hard to cover the topic of ageing in entirety so I look forward to having David back on to dive even deeper in the future. You can also grab a copy of his book Lifespan online or in most book stores - it's a fascinating read.

Please also note, as mentioned in the introduction this was recorded days before NYC went into social isolation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. So if you see videos of us online from this episode, they were shot well and truly before there was any advice to practice social distancing.

Hope you enjoy friends. As always be sure to let David know how this one lands for you on Instagram or Twitter.

      <title>Rent is due for game changer Nimai Delgado</title>
      <description>In Episode 96 I sit back down for a catch up with Vegan PRO Bodybuilder Nimai Delgado. Having recently been in Los Angeles for almost 3 weeks it was great to catch up with Nimai and hear how things have been with him since our last episodes. We also managed to sneak in quite a few gym sessions at Gold's Venice which I thoroughly enjoyed.

This one's quite a casual conversation with no real direction as I have already covered his story back in 2018 in Episode 3. But if you know of Nimai, you'll be well aware his humble and gracious personality is a breath of fresh air. I certainly love catching up with him and am grateful to have him as a good friend.

Some of the things we cover in this relatively shorter episode are:


Bits and pieces on the Game Changers

His current training program

Paying the rent with cardio

His business interests

His daily rituals

Training Lewis Hamilton

and other bits and pieces


Hope you enjoy it friends. As always be sure to let Nimai and myself know how this episode landed for you. You can find us on Instagram at @nimai_delgado and at @plant_proof

Episode 76 - Q &amp; A we did together on common questions about a plant-based or vegan lifestyle.

      <itunes:summary>In Episode 96 I sit back down for a catch up with Vegan PRO Bodybuilder Nimai Delgado. Having recently been in Los Angeles for almost 3 weeks it was great to catch up with Nimai and hear how things have been with him since our last episodes. We also managed to sneak in quite a few gym sessions at Gold's Venice which I thoroughly enjoyed.

This one's quite a casual conversation with no real direction as I have already covered his story back in 2018 in Episode 3. But if you know of Nimai, you'll be well aware his humble and gracious personality is a breath of fresh air. I certainly love catching up with him and am grateful to have him as a good friend.

Some of the things we cover in this relatively shorter episode are:


Bits and pieces on the Game Changers

His current training program

Paying the rent with cardio

His business interests

His daily rituals

Training Lewis Hamilton

and other bits and pieces


Hope you enjoy it friends. As always be sure to let Nimai and myself know how this episode landed for you. You can find us on Instagram at @nimai_delgado and at @plant_proof

Episode 76 - Q &amp; A we did together on common questions about a plant-based or vegan lifestyle.

      <title>Plant Based nutrition during pregnancy, infancy and breast-feeding with Whitney English, RD</title>
      <description>In Episode 95 I sit down with Whitney English, Registered Dietician, to talk about plant-based nutrition during pregnancy, infancy and breastfeeding (lactation). Whitney, along with her partner Alex (also a Registered Dietician), are the founders of Plant Based Juniors - an online resource that brings evidence based nutrition information specific to these stages of life to the public.

Specifically in this episode we cover:


Benefits of a plant-based diet during pregnancy and infancy

Position of the American Dietetics Association (ADA)

Specific nutrients of focus during pregnancy including recommendations for supplementation

Specific nutrients of focus during breastfeeding including recommendations for supplementation

Breast milk versus formula and different formula options

Specific nutrients of focus during infancy including recommendations for supplementation

Introducing solids

Picky eaters

and much more


This is an episode I have wanted to do for a couple of years now. It's quite a comprehensive conversation so if it's a topic that's very relevant to you I highly recommend grabbing a pen and paper and listening in a quite comfortable space without distractions.

Resources:



American Dietetic Association position for vegan diets during pregnancy and infancy

Plant Based Juniors on Instagram

PB3 Plate

Predominately Plant-Based Pregnancy Guide

First Bites - Baby Led Weaning Guide

      <title>A plant-based ketogenic diet for Diabetes</title>
      <description>In Episode 94 I sit down with Cyrus Khambatta, PhD and Robby Barbaro, MPH for a second episode - this time for a deep dive into the Plant Based Ketogenic diet and whether or not it is a good option for patients with insulin resistance and Diabetes.

Specifically we cover:


The release of their new book Mastering Diabetes

Why a low carbohydrate diet is popular for diabetics and frequently recommenced by Doctors

Philosophy of the high carbohydrate Mastering Diabetes program

Improving both insulin resistance and your long term health at the same time

Weight loss and diabetes

Low carbohydrate diets are good at promoting weight loss but often negatively affect biomarkers of cardiovascular risk

A new 2019 study looking at a traditional Ketogenic Diet

Definition of reversing diabetes based on certain criteria

Can a Ketogenic diet truly reverse diabetes?

Difference between saturated fats and unsaturated fats when it comes to insulin resistance

A plant based ketogenic diet

Hegsted Equation and cholesterol

Medium Chain Triglycerides and cholesterol

Who may be well suited to a plant based ketogenic diet

and much more


Whether you have diabetes or not this episode I think you will still find this episode interesting. Plus, with rates of Diabetes skyrocketing, particularly pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes, it's highly likely that most people listening know someone who is affected by this disease. Stick around to the end for my summary where I bring together the take home messages.

Resources:


2019 Ketogenic Study we spoke about

Mastering Diabetes book

Mastering Diabetes on Instagram

Mastering Diabetes Pilot Study

Episode with Drew Harrisberg on his journey with Type 1 Diabetes and transition from a Ketogenic Diet to a Plant Based diet

      <title>Why your blood cholesterol levels are important with Sean Ryan</title>
      <description>In Episode 93 I sit back down with Sean Ryan to check in and see how he's been going with his transition to a plant based lifestyle. We pick up from where we left things in Episode 88, review his pre-transition baseline blood work and then spend the majority of the episode dedicated to the walking through cholesterol and how we can use diet to effect our cholesterol levels. At the end we also touch on meal prep, handling social conversations and a few other questions that Sean had since our last episode together.

Whether you are thinking about transitioning to a plant-based diet, are currently transitioning or already eat a plant-based diet I think you will take something away from both today's episode and Episode 88.

Episode Resources:

1 - 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk

2 - 2020 Consensus paper from European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel stating that LDL lipoproteins cause atherosclerosis (narrowing of the artery)

3 - ACC guidelines - 2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease. Recommends people adopt a Mediterranean or Plant-based diet for cardiovascular health.

4 - Garden of Vegan Meal Delivery Service (Australian based)


Nutrikynd Supplement

From time to time I am asked what supplements I take. The only supplement I currently take is the Nutrikynd Essential 3 which combines B12, Omega 3 and Vitamin D.

Plant Proof X Journey Retreat

For more information on the July 11-17, 2020 Plant Proof X Journey Retreat please visit here.The retreats are an incredible week - a mix of exercise, connecting with like-minded people, guest speakers, cooking demonstrations, delicious plant-based meals and snacks, massages and plenty of downtime to relax by the pool or explore the local area.

As always, I hope you do enjoy the listen. If you did please share your feedback on social media, both Sean and I would love to hear from you. And of course, share the episode link with anyone you know that could benefit from listening.

Finally, if you can take a minute or so to leave a review on the Apple podcast app it would be much appreciated.

Thank you for tuning in friends. I appreciate all of you. See you next week.

      <title>The lungs of our planet urgently need our help with Jimmy Halfcut</title>
      <description>In Episode 92 I sit down with Australian Environmentalist James Stanton Cooke, or 'Jimmy Halfcut', to talk about the role that our rainforests play in keeping our climate cool. I met James a few months back at a charity night in Bondi and with the fires currently burning across Australia I couldn’t help but think this was the perfect time to sit down and talk about mother nature.

In this episode we discuss:


The role of rainforests in keeping the climate cool

Preserving rainforests

Australian wildfires

Controlled burning, hazard reduction and circulation burning

Regenerative Agriculture

Australia's energy situation - coal and renewables

Animal agriculture and environmental considerations

Beeganism

Being an environmentalist

Practical things people can do to lower their environmental footprint

and much much more

      <title>Healthy weight loss is not a diet</title>
      <description>In Episode 91 it's you and me again for another Solo Episode of the Plant Proof Podcast. As usual this episode, focussed on weight loss, is about clearing confusion, breaking down the science and giving you practical tips to walk away with that hopefully allow you to lead a healthier, more sustainable &amp; happier lifestyle.

In this episode I cover:


Fat shaming versus educating about reducing disease risk

Social media and body image

What factors control weight gain or weight loss?

What dietary patterns are best for weight loss?

Why ultra-processed foods may affect your results?

Are high fat or low fat diets best for weight loss?

Ketogenic diets and weight loss - a few things to consider

Do carbohydrates promote weight gain?

How does exercise affect weight loss?

Is intermittent fasting useful for weight loss?

How quickly should we lose weight?

How to stay fuller for longer?

Importance of adherence

and much much more including plenty of what I hope are helpful tips


All in all friends this episode is not about obsessing over belly rolls or cellulite. My aim was to bring you the science minus any fads, quick fixes or any other strategies that get you reaching for your wallet - I simply want you to understand what factors affect your body weight so you can be empowered to take control of your health. I do need to acknowledge that there is an element of privilege associated with being able to implement the information I am sharing. I understand our food system is set up in a way that makes it hard to lose weight - it's called the obesogenic environment after all. Cheap, convenient foods are usually the most unhealthiest. With that said, you can only do the best in your circumstances and by no means do I want you to feel any less about yourself if you are simply doing your best and run off your feet with multiple kids, lots of bills etc, I totally get it - it's the thought and effort that matters most.


Resources/References:

Kevin Hall's study on Ultra-processed foods versus unprocessed
Low Fat vs High fat diets in metabolic ward setting - a systematic review of 32 controlled feeding studies
Plant Proof healthy plant based food pyramid

 
Hope you enjoy the episode friends.

      <title>The food we eat is killing us with Cardiologist Dr Kim Williams</title>
      <description>In Episode 90 I sit down with former President of the American College of Cardiology Dr Kim Williams to discuss the role that our diet plays in the preventing, suspending and reversing cardiovascular disease. If you want to know what foods are causing your arteries to 'clog' and how to avoid this then I highly recommend listening to this exchange. Kim is an absolute wealth of knowledge and unlike so much of what you see on social media these days, his stance is based on the totality of evidence - not anecdotes and not theories but hard evidence from all different levels of scientific investigation.

The simple fact is that many of us see heart attacks and strokes as 'inevitable' and a 'normal' part of getting old but this couldn't be further from the truth. Many populations who choose to eat differently to us are significantly less likely to develop cardiovascular disease. And it's not just observational science that points to a plant exclusive or predominant diet as the ultimate way to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, with several controlled trials reaching the same conclusion. Some of which we talk about in this episode.

Born and trained in Chicago, Dr Williams was a professional level tennis player and coach before choosing rather to pursue a career in cardiology. Since 2013, he has headed up the cardiology department of Rush University Medical Center - where many of his colleagues have also found their way to adopting a plant-based diet.

Dr Williams has served on numerous committees and boards at the United States national level, including - but certainly not limited to - the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American Medical Association. Among other presidencies throughout his distinguished career, Dr Williams was the 2016 President of American College of Cardiology.

Kim is the inaugural Editor in Chief of the International Journal of Disease Reversal and Prevention (IJDRP). This new journal has been created to document the science of nutrition and lifestyle to prevent, suspend and reverse disease.

Kim is also on the ‘International ​Advisory Council​’ for Doctors For Nutrition - a wonderful Australian organisation dedicated to helping equip healthcare practitioners, institutions and the public with evidence-based information and education on optimum human nutrition. As mentioned during this episode if you are from Adelaide or can get to Adelaide on Feb 2nd 2020 to listen to Dr Kim Williams, along with a host of other speakers, at the Doctors for Nutrition Symposium I highly recommend it - you can get tickets here.

Specifically we cover: 


The prevalence of cardiovascular disease

Kim's path to Medicine

Nutrition training during Medical School

Being elected President of the American College of Cardiology

The difference between the ACC/AHA guidelines and the USDA dietary guidelines

The role of industry in effecting guidelines

How he explains to patients the importance of changing their diet

What dietary components increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis (narrowing of the artery with plaque build up)

Why LDL cholesterol is an independent risk factor

What a heart healthy diet looks like

Changes he would like to see in the 2020 USDA dietary guidelines

Government policy changes he would like to see

The types of foods he likes to eat in his own diet

and much much more

Kim is the inaugural Editor in Chief of the International Journal of Disease Reversal and Prevention (IJDRP). This new journal has been created to document the science of nutrition and lifestyle to prevent, suspend and reverse disease.

Kim is also on the ‘International ​Advisory Council​’ for Doctors For Nutrition - a wonderful Australian organisation dedicated to helping equip healthcare practitioners, institutions and the public with evidence-based information and education on optimum human nutrition. As mentioned during this episode if you are from Adelaide or can get to Adelaide on Feb 2nd 2020 to listen to Dr Kim Williams, along with a host of other speakers, at the Doctors for Nutrition Symposium I highly recommend it - you can get tickets here.

Specifically we cover: 


The prevalence of cardiovascular disease

Kim's path to Medicine

Nutrition training during Medical School

Being elected President of the American College of Cardiology

The difference between the ACC/AHA guidelines and the USDA dietary guidelines

The role of industry in effecting guidelines

How he explains to patients the importance of changing their diet

What dietary components increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis (narrowing of the artery with plaque build up)

Why LDL cholesterol is an independent risk factor

What a heart healthy diet looks like

Changes he would like to see in the 2020 USDA dietary guidelines

Government policy changes he would like to see

The types of foods he likes to eat in his own diet

and much much more

        <![CDATA[<p>In <strong>Episode 90</strong> I sit down with former <strong>President of the American College of Cardiology Dr Kim Williams</strong> to discuss the role that our diet plays in the preventing, suspending and reversing <strong>cardiovascular disease</strong>. If you want to know what foods are causing your arteries to 'clog' and how to avoid this then I highly recommend listening to this exchange. Kim is an absolute wealth of knowledge and unlike so much of what you see on social media these days, his stance is based on the totality of evidence - not anecdotes and not theories but hard evidence from all different levels of scientific investigation.</p><p><br></p><p>The simple fact is that many of us see heart attacks and strokes as 'inevitable' and a 'normal' part of getting old but this couldn't be further from the truth. Many populations who choose to eat differently to us are significantly less likely to develop cardiovascular disease. And it's not just observational science that points to a plant exclusive or predominant diet as the ultimate way to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, with several controlled trials reaching the same conclusion. Some of which we talk about in this episode.</p><p><br></p><p>Born and trained in Chicago, Dr Williams was a professional level tennis player and coach before choosing rather to pursue a career in cardiology. Since 2013, he has headed up the cardiology department of Rush University Medical Center - where many of his colleagues have also found their way to adopting a plant-based diet.</p><p><br></p><p>Dr Williams has served on numerous committees and boards at the United States national level, including - but certainly not limited to - the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American Medical Association.

      <title>Adopting a new lifestyle to reduce the risk of heart disease with Sean Ryan</title>
      <description>In Episode 89 I sit down with a long time friend of mine, Sean Ryan. Sean and I recently caught up for dinner and he expressed interest in changing his lifestyle. Particularly given that cardiovascular disease runs in his family and he is ticking quite a few of the boxes when it comes to modifiable risk factors for having a heart attack or stroke.

In fact lifestyle changes are something that Sean has been embarking on for the better part of a year with mixed results. He cannot help but feel confused by all of the mixed messages that that exist across the internet and among health professionals in his community and in many respects has been left feeling disempowered and unsure what to do. As Sean and I got talking during our dinner I realised how valid his questions were and suggested we shared our conversations, and his journey to better health, as a series on this show to hopefully inspire others. He generously agreed and here we are - the first of a handful of episodes with Sean.

In this episode we cover:

1 - Why Sean wants to change his lifestyle
2 - We hear bit's and pieces about Sean's past and life growing up
3 - Why he is confused about what to eat
4 - Why some of the things I say are evidence based are different to what the Heart Association recommend
5 - Answers to questions he has about a plant-based diet
6 - A plan from here

Over the course of the next few months I will upload follow up conversations with Sean where we check back in, get an update, go through any questions he has and make plans for the next period. In the next episode we will be discussing his baseline blood tests, his first grocery experience, how he is feeling physically and mentally, what it's been like creating meals without animal products and of course any new questions that he has.

Slightly different format that I hope you enjoy. If you do, please share the episode on social media (I know Sean would love your support) and leave a review on the Apple Podcast app. Either or both would be greatly appreciated!

      <title>Victims of speciesism with Seb Alex</title>
      <description>In Episode 88 I sit down with Seb Alex to talk about the importance of animal welfare and what life looks like through the lens of an Animal Activist.

Specifically we cover:


Normalising veganism

The impossible burger: Does he eat it and what does he think about their practices?

Things to consider when supporting large chains like Hungry Jacks who have added vegan burgers onto their menu

What is a vegan?

What is a sentient being?

Different levels of sentience

Are oysters sentient beings?

What is speciesism?

Growing up in Lebanon and his transition to a vegetarian diet and then ultimately a vegan diet

Is veganism extreme?

Developing the courage to be an activist

The notion of 'humane' slaughter - does it exist?

Ag-Gag laws protecting the animal agriculture industry

and much much more


I completely understand this episode and the topic of animal welfare is often a little uncomfortable (I totally get it) and perhaps you have a stereotypical view of an animal activist being angry, weird and violent. I know I used to. Today’s guest, Animal Activist Seb Alex, is anything but that and I urge all of you, vegan or not, to listen to this conversation with an open mind. Even if you’re not interested in veganism it’s interesting to listen to what people from different walks of lives have to say…how they see the world. 10 years ago if I came across this podcast - I would probably keep scrolling. In fact I definitely would of. I often think about my early University days and why I never stopped to think about eating animal products. I grew up loving dogs and farm animals…but I never once fully appreciated the connection between my food plate with an animals life and how my consumption affected their happiness. The odd thing is I look back on myself a decade ago and I see the same person…the values and beliefs were there but I was closed. I was not in a place to allow new ideas to challenge the way I had been programmed.

Now that I understand the power of opening your mind I have discussions with people all the time who see things differently to me not just about nutrition but all things in life. I can escape the echo chamber that we so often comfortably find ourselves in. A place where there is the natural tendency to only surround yourself with people who share your thoughts. I always walk away from these conversations. Happy that they give me the opportunity to challenge my beliefs and think a little deeper. Happy they gave me an opportunity to learn something new. It’s these types of conversations that allow our minds to expand. You may find todays message resonates with you. You may find it takes you to places in your mind that you have never visited. You may find it doesn’t. The point is, you will be better informed with regards to how an animal activist sees the world, you will better understand their perspective and then with that you can do what you want! If this isnt an episode for you right now -thats completely fine, jump over to any number of previous episodes on nutrition and come back to this one when it feels right.

      <title>Eating more plants&amp; leading by example with Marie Fe and Jake Snow</title>
      <description>In Episode 87 I sit down with Marie Fe &amp; Jake Snow who are arguably two of the most inspiring individuals that I've come across using social media to build a powerful community with purpose. It was a pleasure to sit down with them, share their story, talk about various aspects of their life that they place great importance on and celebrate the positives of using social media.

Specifically we covered:


Both of their back stories

How they met

How they funded their first travels

The importance of a plant based diet &amp; their inspiration to change the way they eat

The evolution of their social media content

Why they feel the desire to share information about important global issues

Do Good Monday's

and much more

It was a pleasure to sit down with them, share their story, talk about various aspects of their life that they place great importance on and celebrate the positives of using social media.

Specifically we covered:


Both of their back stories

How they met

How they funded their first travels

The importance of a plant based diet &amp; their inspiration to change the way they eat

The evolution of their social media content

Why they feel the desire to share information about important global issues

Do Good Monday's

and much more

      <title>Being a Vegan professional footballer with Chris Mayne</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/being-a-vegan-professional-footballer-with-afl-player-chris-mayne/</link>
      <description>In Episode 86 I sit down with AFL player and vegan athlete Chris Mayne to talk about his transition to a plant-based diet as a professional athlete. Chris plays for the Collingwood football club, the largest club in Australia, and in the past few years despite immense pressure from the media has been able to take his game to the next level.

In this Episode we cover:


The Ups and Downs of his career

Why he left the Fremantle football club for Collingwood

When he changes his diet and why

The impact that changing his diet has had on his life and football

A typical day of eating

What his teammates, friends and family think of the way he eats

Advice for young players and the importance of a good support group

Raising a baby on a plant-based diet

and much more


Hope you enjoy this episode friends. It was great to sit down with someone like Chris who is living proof that you can eat a plant-only diet and perform optimally at the top level . Perfect timing with the Game Changers documentary having just been released.

      <link>https://plantproof.com/plant-based-athlete-catriona-bisset-is-australias-fastest-ever-female-800m-runner/</link>
      <description>In Episode 85 I sat down with plant based athlete Catriona Bisset, Australian track athlete who currently holds the national record for the 800m event. If you haven't heard of Catriona chances are you will very soon - seemingly coming out of nowhere she is destined to represent Australia at the 2020 Tokyo olympics.

Specifically we cover:

Catriona's days as a young track athlete and the pressures she felt

Her struggles with anxiety, depression and disordered eating

Adopting a plant based diet and her purpose for doing so

The ins and outs of her diet and how she has worked through specific aspects to improve her well-being and performance

Setting the Australian national record for the 800m event

Being an olympic hopeful and voice for positive change

and much more

      <title>What does a Healthy Plant Based Diet Look like?</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/what-does-a-healthy-plant-based-diet-look-like/</link>
      <description>In Episode 84 it's you and me again for another Solo Episode of the Plant Proof Podcast. As usual this episode is about clearing confusion, breaking down the science and giving you practical tips to walk away with that hopefully allow you to lead a healthier, more sustainable &amp; happier lifestyle.

Specifically I cover:


Recent headlines about the dangers of 'fake' or 'mock' meats

Formula 1 Driver Romaine Grosjean's comments about a vegan diet &amp; endurance performance

A recent article in the Environmental Change Journal that was covered in a somewhat misleading fashion by Huff Post

Tips for building a health plant based diet


Of course, I could talk about building a plant based diet for hours and hours so what was covered in this episode is a condensed version that really focusses on some of the top principles and myths about a plant based diet that I would like you to be across in order to set yourself up for success.

Article on Salt in Alternative Meats that I wrote on plantproof.com

      <title>Hidden agendas in science and the media with Drew Harrisberg</title>
      <description>In Episode 83 a very good friend of mine, Drew Harrisberg, returns to the show to talk about hidden agendas in science and the media with specific reference to a few somewhat dangerous trends we have noticed. In this rather fluid exchange Drew and I cover everything from the manipulation of science to produce favourable outcomes to confusing and oversimplified messages from people of influence on social media.

Specifically we cover:

How Drew's transition to a plant based diet has played out since Episode 62


Dr Mark Hyman's confusing promotion of an extremely conflicted study on the "reversal of diabetes"

Sarah Wilson's claims about methane and the impact of animal agriculture on climate change

Why the "If It Fits Your Macros" &amp; "Calorie Deficit" ideologies are an oversimplification and how it is possible to actually look and feel good at the same time (It's not one of the other)

Good and bad foods - have we become too soft?

The stigma associated with different types of Diabetes and associated sensitivity with regards to using 'diabetes' as an umbrella term.

and much more


I hope you found this to be an interesting episode - I certainly did. Literally a conversation Drew and I would have in private. An unscripted exchange with no holding back. As I allude to throughout in conversation I think it’s important to note that just because I may hold a differing opinion to someone that doesn’t mean I dislike them or want conflict. I am open to sitting down with any of the people mentioned, or others, to further discuss these ideas and flesh them out with the best available science we have. If we want to expand our minds we need to take these conversations to places where they are a little uncomfortable and I think we got there in this episode - I look forward to doing it in the future and hopefully having some of these proponents of diets like the Ketogenic, If It Fits Your Macros or the Carnivore Diet on the show. I realise some of you may be thinking don’t give them the platform but in a controlled manner, if they do not have the fundamental science to support their argument, which I certainly havent been able to find, then ultimately all I see happening is an agenda revealing itself.

      <itunes:summary>In Episode 83 a very good friend of mine, Drew Harrisberg, returns to the show to talk about hidden agendas in science and the media with specific reference to a few somewhat dangerous trends we have noticed. In this rather fluid exchange Drew and I cover everything from the manipulation of science to produce favourable outcomes to confusing and oversimplified messages from people of influence on social media.

Specifically we cover:

How Drew's transition to a plant based diet has played out since Episode 62


Dr Mark Hyman's confusing promotion of an extremely conflicted study on the "reversal of diabetes"

Sarah Wilson's claims about methane and the impact of animal agriculture on climate change

Why the "If It Fits Your Macros" &amp; "Calorie Deficit" ideologies are an oversimplification and how it is possible to actually look and feel good at the same time (It's not one of the other)

Good and bad foods - have we become too soft?

The stigma associated with different types of Diabetes and associated sensitivity with regards to using 'diabetes' as an umbrella term.

and much more


I hope you found this to be an interesting episode - I certainly did. Literally a conversation Drew and I would have in private. An unscripted exchange with no holding back. As I allude to throughout in conversation I think it’s important to note that just because I may hold a differing opinion to someone that doesn’t mean I dislike them or want conflict. I am open to sitting down with any of the people mentioned, or others, to further discuss these ideas and flesh them out with the best available science we have.

      <title>Why we need to be careful reading news headlines about nutrition</title>
      <description>In Episode 82 I return from a small break and record the first 'solo' episode of the Plant Proof Podcast. Yes, that's right, the first episode without a guest. Just you and me.

In this episode I cover:



Why I took a short break from the podcast

The first iteration of a new direction for the show

My time in Bali

Sydney's newest plant based restaurant Eden Bondi


The recent media headlines about vegans needing to be careful about choline deficiency and headlines about vegetarians and stroke risk. For both of these I walk through what was reported and what the science actually says.


This slightly new format which is something I intend to do between every guest episode going forward.

Full blog I wrote on Choline with references can be read here: Should vegans be worried about Choline deficiency and brain health?

If you are enjoying the Plant Proof podcast a great way to support the show is by leaving a review on the Apple podcast app. It only takes a few minutes and helps more people find the episodes.

      <title>Your gut health questions with Dr Will Bulsiewicz (Dr B) - Part 2 of 2</title>
      <description>In Episode 81 I sit down with Dr Will Bulsiewicz for Part 2 of the "Your Gut Health Questions" conversation that Will and I had while in New York. All of the topics that Dr B and I discuss were suggestions from the Plant Proof community - so firstly, thank you for contributing to this conversation by sending through such important questions.

For those of you who are regular listeners you will have probably tuned into previous episodes (17, 71 &amp; 80 ) with Dr B and therefore already know how much of a wealth of knowledge he is. Dr B is a Board Certified Gastroenterologist, having done over 16 years of medical training to become an expert in all things gut health. This is why he is perfectly positioned to help us navigate tricky gut health questions and clear up some of the confusion that exists on the internet.

In this episode we cover a lot of really interesting gut health topics (below). What's great about this episode, and all episodes with Dr B, is that throughout the conversation he refers to the clinical science to provide evidence for his recommendations:


The Ketogenic diet, including a vegan Keto Diet, and it's likely affect on the gut

Dairy, probiotics, prebiotics (lactose) &amp; gut health

Consuming whey protein with caution

Interpreting science &amp; understanding points of relativity


IBs and fasting

Prolonged juice or water fasting

Probiotics and gut health

Bloating - what's normal and what does it mean?

Breakfast &amp; gut health

How long before going to bed should your last meal be?

Smoothies &amp;/or juices for children

Breastfeeding, infant gut health including the role of human oligosaccharides

Donor milk &amp; infant formula

Antibiotics and gut health - how to minimise their damage?

Should we avoid gluten?

What are dangers of eliminating gluten if you are not intolerant?

Wheat sensitivity vs gluten sensitivity - have we over diagnosed gluten intolerance?

Should we be scared of phytate's &amp; anti-nutrients

Benefits of soaking oats

Alcohol and the microbiome

and much more


Hope you enjoy the episode friends. If you have any comments or questions, Dr B (@theguthealthmd) and myself (@plant_proof) would love to hear from you.

      <title>Your gut health questions with Dr Will Bulsiewicz (Dr B) - Part 1 of 2</title>
      <description>In Episode 80 I sit down with Dr Will Bulsiewicz, or Dr B, to go through some of the most common gut health questions out there! If you have tuned into the Plant Proof podcast before you have no doubt come across my previous conversations with Dr B - he is incredibly knowledgeable and has a unique ability to break complicated science down and turn it into simple practical tips.

If you haven't listened to the previous episodes with Dr B I highly encourage you check them out - Episode 17 (How to build a healthy gut) and Episode 70 (Ex vegans &amp; their gut health issues). With so many bloggers and unqualified people providing advice on gut health these days it's refreshing to hear from a Gastroenterologist who genuinely understands the science inside out.

In this episode we cover:


Heavy bloating and gut health

How our mind can affect digestion

How to identify if your gut needs repair

The role of Archaea in our gut

Preparing food to improve digestion

Are there benefits to supplementing with food enzymes or drinking bone broth

Seasoning food

      <itunes:summary>In Episode 80 I sit down with Dr Will Bulsiewicz, or Dr B, to go through some of the most common gut health questions out there! If you have tuned into the Plant Proof podcast before you have no doubt come across my previous conversations with Dr B - he is incredibly knowledgeable and has a unique ability to break complicated science down and turn it into simple practical tips.

If you haven't listened to the previous episodes with Dr B I highly encourage you check them out - Episode 17 (How to build a healthy gut) and Episode 70 (Ex vegans &amp; their gut health issues). With so many bloggers and unqualified people providing advice on gut health these days it's refreshing to hear from a Gastroenterologist who genuinely understands the science inside out.

In this episode we cover:


Heavy bloating and gut health

How our mind can affect digestion

How to identify if your gut needs repair

The role of Archaea in our gut

Preparing food to improve digestion

Are there benefits to supplementing with food enzymes or drinking bone broth

Seasoning food

Juicing &amp; gut health

What do we need to know about TMAO

IBS &amp; 'leaky gut'

What does a regular bowel routine look like

and much much more

      <title>How to get more out of your brain with Neurologist's Dean &amp; Ayesha Sherzai</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/how-to-get-more-out-of-your-brain-with-neurologists-dean-ayesha-sherzai/</link>
      <description>In Episode 78 I sit down with Neurologists, Drs Dean &amp; Ayesha Sherzai for a second episode on brain health (previously guests for Episode 64). I cannot even begin to describe how brilliant these guys are.

In this information packed 2 hour episode we talk about:


Creating an environment to help kids flourish

The importance of sleep for brain health

Tips for optimising sleep

Why it's important to be able to hyper focus

How to improve focus

Removing inhibitions and the practice of 'fearless' living

What we should be eating

and much more.


What makes these two qualified to speak about brain health? 

Dean Sherzai, MD, PhD, is co-director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Program at Loma Linda University. Dean trained in Neurology at Georgetown University School of Medicine, and completed fellowships in neurodegenerative diseases and dementia at the National Institutes of Health and UC San Diego. He also holds a PhD in Healthcare Leadership with a focus on community health from Andrews University.

Ayesha Sherzai, MD is a neurologist and co-director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Program at Loma Linda University, where she leads the Lifestyle Program for the Prevention of Neurological Diseases. She completed a dual training in Preventative Medicine and Neurology at Loma Linda University, and a fellowship in Vascular Neurology and Epidemiology at Columbia University. She is also a trained plant-based culinary artist.

Hope you enjoy the episode friends.

If you have any comments or questions, the Sherzais (@teamsherzai) and myself (@plant_proof) would love to hear from you. Please tag us on social media or leave a quick review on iTunes. To learn more about the Sherzai's visit their website. And be sure to keep an eye out for their own Podcast launching soon - I personally cannot wait for it.

      <title>Eating plant strong foods &amp; living in alignment with Rip Esselstyn</title>
      <description>In Episode 77 I sat down with Rip Esselstyn to talk about his journey as a plant strong athlete, health activist and author. Rip is well known for the 'Engine 2 Diet', a book he authored in 2009 on a whole food plant based diet, which was inspired by his fathers work. Dr Caldwell Esselstyn Jr, and his time as a fire fighter. If you are looking for inspiration from someone who has been a long term whole food plant based athlete than look no further than Rip - in fact just this weekend at age 56 he set ANOTHER world record in the 200m backstroke.

In this episode we cover:


Rip's early years of life

The inspiration that led him to change his diet in 1987

His Dad's work

Being a swimmer and triathlete

Becoming a fire fighter

The inspiration behind The Engine 2 Diet

The Engine 2 brand in whole foods

His children's diet

and much more


Hope you enjoy the episode friends - Rip is a super interesting guy. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions for future Q &amp; A's, Rip (@ripesselstyn) and myself (@plant_proof) would love to hear from you. Please tag us on social media or leave a quick review on iTunes. To learn more about the Engine 2 Diet and brand visit the Engine 2 website.

Bali October Retreat:

In case you are looking for a week away - I have decided to host a second plant based retreat this year with Journey Retreats October 4-10 in Bali. For now if you are interested in receiving more information about the retreat please email me (simon@plantproof.com) or send me a DM on Instagram with your email and I will have the right people get in touch. The retreats are an incredible week - a mix of exercise, connecting with like minded people, guest speakers, cooking demonstrations, delicious plant based meals and snacks, massages and plenty of down time to relax by the pool or explore the local area.

      <title>Reasons for not adopting a plant based diet with Nimai Delgado</title>
      <description>In Episode 76 I sit down with a good friend of mine, and PRO Vegan Body Builder, Nimai Delgado. In this episode we chat about some of the more common concerns and barriers that stop people from wanting to adopt a plant based diet or vegan lifestyle. This episode is also available on Nimai's podcast - Generation V which is an incredible show that I highly recommend you subscribe too.

Specifically we cover:


Nutrient Deficiencies

Carbohydrates &amp; body fat

Sugar &amp; diabetes

Soy foods &amp; oestrogen

Taste buds

Giving up cheese

Fitting in as a vegan

Meal prepping

Making a difference as just one person

Where to start

Food for brain health

Randomised Controlled Trials

Eating enough calories

Gaining muscle with a plant based diet

and much more


Hope you enjoy the episode friends - I think we covered some pretty commonly discussed topics that you will find quite interesting. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions for future Q &amp; A's, Nimai (@Nimai_delgado) and myself (@plant_proof) would love to hear from you. Please tag us on social media or leave a quick review on iTunes.

In case you are looking for a week away - I have decided to host a second plant based retreat this year with Journey Retreats October 4-10 in Bali. For now if you are interested in receiving more information about the retreat please email me (simon@plantproof.com) or send me a DM on Instagram with your email and I will have the right people get in touch.

      <itunes:summary>In Episode 76 I sit down with a good friend of mine, and PRO Vegan Body Builder, Nimai Delgado. In this episode we chat about some of the more common concerns and barriers that stop people from wanting to adopt a plant based diet or vegan lifestyle. This episode is also available on Nimai's podcast - Generation V which is an incredible show that I highly recommend you subscribe too.

Specifically we cover:


Nutrient Deficiencies

Carbohydrates &amp; body fat

Sugar &amp; diabetes

Soy foods &amp; oestrogen

Taste buds

Giving up cheese

Fitting in as a vegan

Meal prepping

Making a difference as just one person

Where to start

Food for brain health

Randomised Controlled Trials

Eating enough calories

Gaining muscle with a plant based diet

and much more


Hope you enjoy the episode friends - I think we covered some pretty commonly discussed topics that you will find quite interesting. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions for future Q &amp; A's, Nimai (@Nimai_delgado) and myself (@plant_proof) would love to hear from you. Please tag us on social media or leave a quick review on iTunes.

In case you are looking for a week away - I have decided to host a second plant based retreat this year with Journey Retreats October 4-10 in Bali. For now if you are interested in receiving more information about the retreat please email me (simon@plantproof.com) or send me a DM on Instagram with your email and I will have the right people get in touch. The retreats are an incredible week - a mix of exercise, connecting with like minded people, guest speakers, cooking demonstrations, delicious plant based meals and snacks, massages and plenty of down time to relax by the pool or explore the local area.

      <title>Preventing heart disease with Dr Caldwell Esselstyn</title>
      <description>In Episode 75 I sit down with Dr Caldwell Esselsytn Jnr, or 'Essy', to chat about his journey in Medicine &amp; the specifics of the findings from his clinical trials on preventing cardiovascular disease.

It was a great pleasure to join Essy at his home in Cleveland with his wife Ann - they welcomed me with open arms and a delicious lunch. I am very grateful that I was able to spend that time with them and even more grateful to have been able to record Essy's wisdom to share with you. Huge thanks to Ann - you are an absolute joy to be around and the food you prepared was incredible.

Within the episode we cover:


Essy's life as a kid

His involvement in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics

His journey to Medicine

Why he became interested in cardiovascular disease

His clinical trials on patients with end stage cardiovascular disease

What causes coronary artery disease

Preventing cardiovascular disease with nutrition

The bigger picture and future of healthcare to move from a model fo disease management to disease prevention

and much more


One of the absolute pioneers of Lifestyle Medicine - clear distractions, Essy is an absolute wealth of knowledge. If you know anyone with cardiovascular disease (a history of stroke, palpitations, arrhythmia's, heart attacks or angina) please share this episode with them.

Finally, if you have any comments or questions, Essy (@dresselsytn) and myself (@simonhill) would love to hear from you. Please tag us on social media or leave a quick review on iTunes.

      <title>Truly reversing insulin resistance &amp; Type 2 Diabetes with Robby and Cyrus from Mastering Diabetes</title>
      <description>In Episode 74 I sit down with Robby &amp; Cyrus from Mastering Diabetes to chat about Diabetes (Type 1, 1a, Pre, and Type 2) and the role that nutrition plays on insulin resistance. We go through the body of scientific literature and explain what causes insulin resistance and how to actually reverse it.

Specifically we cover:

Their personal journeys with Type 1 Diabetes

Pathophysiology of Insulin Resistance

Difference between low carb ketogenic type diets for Insulin Resistance and High Carb Low Fat diets

Why Keto diets can promote insulin resistance (poorer ability to handle carbohydrates)

What truly reversing insulin resistance actually means - specifically the the difference between reversing insulin resistance and managing blood glucose control

Common diabetic complications and why reversing insulin resistance is so important

Nutrition for reversing insulin resistance &amp; diabetic complications (the practical stuff)

and so much more


Strap yourselves in this is a long one (2.5 hours) but I guarantee by the end of it you will have learned so much about Diabetes and finally understand the mechanism that causes insulin resistance and how to reverse it and improve health outcomes. Not only is this understanding important for people with Diabetes but really anyone looking to better their health, particularly anyone who is overweight (millions of people have undiagnosed pre diabetes). Insulin resistance is a spectrum and eating to promote optimal glucose tolerance means you will be able to enjoy some of the most healthful food groups in the world associated with longevity.

If you any comments or questions, Robby, Cyrus (@masteringdiabetes) and myself (@plant_proof) would love to hear from you. Please tag us on social media or leave a quick review on iTunes.

      <title>Diet, Acne and Bodybuilding with Brian Turner</title>
      <description>In Episode 73 I sit down with Brian Turner (a.k.a Brock Lee) and talk about his experience with acne. We delve into the reasons why he is grateful to acne, how his acne improved with dietary changes, bullying, body building, eating a pound of tofu a day for a month and so much more.

I've got to say I have a real soft spot for Brian and there's a fair chance after this episode you will too. His energy is contagious and he really is an absolute breath of fresh air, bringing light moments to an often very dark and negative conversation, in order to spread his message of compassion for all.

Hope you enjoy the listen friends. Remember, one of the best ways that you can explore any of the ideas you hear in this episode is by talking to others about them and where possible applying them to your own life. Or alternatively finding a quiet space to just think by yourself. This is something I regularly practice in my own life after I listen to a podcast or finish a chapter of a book - it's really incredible how much more you walk away with when you take the time to consolidate the new information you've encountered.

If you do, or have any comments, Brian (@brianturnerofficial) and I (@plant_proof) would love to hear from you. Please tag us on social media or leave a quick review on iTunes.

      <title>Being unapologetically you with Sjana Elise Earp</title>
      <description>In Episode 72 I sit down with Plant-Based Yogi Sjana Earp to chat about yoga, healing, transformation and living with purpose. This is a different exchange to the more scientific episodes on this show, yet equally as informative and thought provoking in its own unique way.


Where Sjana grew up and what life was like as a kid

Her struggles with mental health - bullying, anxiety and depression

Healing

Strategies to overcome negative feelings

The importance of knowing your core values

Kindness

Finding Yoga &amp; what yoga means to her

Her relationship with food

When and why she transitioned to a plant-based lifestyle

What a typical day looks like

The role social media plays in her life

How she wants her 1.6 million followers to feel

What she feels purpose is

Breaking the stigma associated with mental health issues

The most important things in life

Sustainability and looking after our planet

and much more

      <description>In Episode 71 I sit down with one of the pioneers of Lifestyle Medicine, Dr Dean Ornish.

His very first clinical trial

The Lifestyle Heart Trial and what we can learn from the intervention and results

What's causing cardiovascular disease in the first place - why do some people refute the findings associating saturated fat &amp; LDL cholesterol with cardiovascular disease?

The Atkin's, Keto &amp; Paleo diets

TMAO &amp; cardiovascular disease

Healthy eating habits

Weight loss - what various approaches fail to address

Joy of living versus fear of dying

His research on Alzheimer's &amp; lifestyle interventions

and much more

      <title>Ex Vegans &amp; their Gut Health issues with Gastroenterologist Dr Will Bulsiewiscz, MD</title>
      <description>In Episode 70 I sit down with Gastroenterologist Dr Will Bulsiewicz to talk about Ex Vegans. Specifically we discuss the typical journey of these folks who have bailed on Veganism and the gut health issues they have described. Dr B and I drill down on what is happening with the aim of helping you if you ever find yourself in a similar position.

By way of background this episode was inspired after a handful of Vegan influencers bailed on Veganism and reintroduced animal products back into their diet. One after the other, in what seemed like a 3-6 month period, it became a ripple effect where some of the most prominent influencers jumped on board and also reintroduced animal products into their diet. I listened to all of their stories and noted many similar patterns. I also noted that despite none of them being qualified in Medicine or the field of Nutrition/Dietetics many people in the comments were second guessing their own diet. It became apparent that the size of their following almost made their qualifications irrelevant. I'm all for influencers and I don't think everyone needs a degree to talk about a subject. However, the devil is in the detail of what's being spoken about and with life threatening eating disorders absolutely rife, we need to be careful how certain information is shared and who we, as individuals, go to for qualified information. I realised the vulnerability of these people and the vulnerability of their community, who had unknowingly been getting advice about nutrition from people who were privately going through pretty significant battles with food &amp; their health.

So with that in mind I thought it was really important for me to get a world leading Gastroenterologist on the show to make sense of what's going on here. Its really important to note that the case study we discuss in this is 100% hypothetical. It's the typical journey spoken about by these influencers but isn't specifically about any single person in particular and I think you will see by the way the conversation goes that we both have absolute empathy for anyone struggling with their diet.

To kick things off Dr B and I recap Episode 17 where we did an in-depth conversation on the importance of the microbiome for our overall health. If you haven't listened to that episode I highly recommend you jump back and listen to it - it's the most listened to episode of this show to date.

All episodes with Dr Will Bulsiewicz

Episode 17 - Building a health gut
Episode 70 - Ex Vegans &amp; their Gut Health issues
Episode 80 - Part 1 of our Gut Health Q &amp; A
Episode 81 - Part 2 of our Gut Health Q &amp; A
Episode 102 - A Healthy Gut is Fiber Fueled

Hope you enjoy the episode friends.

      <title>Finding the Flow State with Red Bull Athlete Patrick Seabase</title>
      <description>In Episode 69 I sit down with Red Bull athlete, Patrick Seabase, who cycles over mountain passes involving gruelling climbs and steep descents on a bike that has 1 gear and NO brakes often reaching speeds near 100 Km/hr (62 mph). Yes - mind blowing!

This is the first time Patrick has told his story on a Podcast - so I was very honoured to have him on the show and am incredibly grateful to have this platform to share our conversation with you.

In this Episode we cover: 


The type of bike he rides and what's unique about it

Where Patrick grew up &amp; what his life was like as a kid

Being kicked out of home

Why the passion for riding

How his diet has changed over the years and why he was inspired to remove animal products from his plate

The attraction to cycling the first mountain stage of the 1910 Tour de France in a single day

What cycling means to him

The concentration required to ride this bike and finding the flow state

and much more

      <itunes:summary>In Episode 69 I sit down with Red Bull athlete, Patrick Seabase, who cycles over mountain passes involving gruelling climbs and steep descents on a bike that has 1 gear and NO brakes often reaching speeds near 100 Km/hr (62 mph). Yes - mind blowing!

This is the first time Patrick has told his story on a Podcast - so I was very honoured to have him on the show and am incredibly grateful to have this platform to share our conversation with you.

In this Episode we cover: 


The type of bike he rides and what's unique about it

Where Patrick grew up &amp; what his life was like as a kid

Being kicked out of home

Why the passion for riding

How his diet has changed over the years and why he was inspired to remove animal products from his plate

The attraction to cycling the first mountain stage of the 1910 Tour de France in a single day

What cycling means to him

The concentration required to ride this bike and finding the flow state

and much more

      <title>Why Kieran De Visser is running, cycling and kayaking across Australia</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/you-cant-deny-plastic-pollution-with-kieran-de-visser/</link>
      <description>In Episode 64 I sit down with Kieran De Visser, founder of the not for profit organisation Endurothon Oz that has the aim of stopping plastic pollution at its source. Kieran will be cycling, kayaking and running 25,000 Km across Australia to raise awareness for this campaign and raise 1 million dollars to clean our oceans.

What I find really interesting about Kieran's story is not just his desire to help the planet but the fact much of his inspiration came from a time of his life where he could have easily put his own best interests first.

IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:


Kierans back story and his passion for making positive change

How Kieran became inspired to raise awareness about plastic pollution

Why this is such a big problem and something we need to act on now

The Endurothon Oz event - what the 25,000 km across Australia looks like and how he is preparing

What education Kieran will be providing along the way (more info here)

Why Kieran transitioned to a vegetarian and then plant based diet

The ultimate goal for Endurothon Oz

and a whole lot more


I love celebrating stories of young people doing inspirational things to help better our home - and thats what this episode is all about.

      <title>Why Drew Harrisberg Quit Keto</title>
      <description>In Episode 62 I sat down with Exercise Physiologist, Type 1 Diabetic and lover all things health and wellness. In this conversation we discuss Drew's journey with Type 1 Diabetes and how various dietary frameworks have affected his blood sugars, insulin requirements and overall well-being.

This episode is for absolutely everyone, not just folks with Diabetes. Drew is a wealth of knowledge and through his regular blood glucose monitoring has so much objective insight into how food affects our bodies at the cellular level each and every day. Above all, he's a super honest fella, articulate and just wants to help people realise true health.

Specifically we covered:

Drew's early years growing up including his health, diet and interests

The symptoms Drew experienced in the lead up to being diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes

Being diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes - how he felt mentally and what advice he was given by health professionals

What Type 1 Diabetes is and how it differs to Type 2 Diabetes

How Drew monitors his blood glucose and administers exogenous insulin

Role of exercise and insulin resistance

Drew's experience with the Paleo Diet and how it affected his insulin requirements and carbohydrate tolerance

Drew's experience with the Keto Diet and how it affected his insulin requirements and carbohydrate tolerance

How a Keto diet can help with blood glucose control but why there is more to consider

Drew's experience with a low fat Plant Based diet and how it affected his insulin requirements and carbohydrate tolerance

The mechanisms behind the change in insulin resistance that Drew experienced across these dietary frameworks

Why sugar shouldn't be blamed for Type 2 Diabetes

Myths and misconceptions about the Keto diet

Importance of keeping healthy carbohydrates like unrefined grains and legumes in the diet

Large population studies and diabetes incidence - what can we learn from these people?

What the Diabetic Association diets are like and why plant-based nutrition for people with insulin resistance/Diabetes isn't mainstream yet

Stress &amp; Sleep and how they affect insulin resistance

Resources for anyone wanting to understand how to transition to a plant-based diet to reduce insulin resistance

and much more

      <itunes:summary>In Episode 62 I sat down with Exercise Physiologist, Type 1 Diabetic and lover all things health and wellness. In this conversation we discuss Drew's journey with Type 1 Diabetes and how various dietary frameworks have affected his blood sugars, insulin requirements and overall well-being.

This episode is for absolutely everyone, not just folks with Diabetes. Drew is a wealth of knowledge and through his regular blood glucose monitoring has so much objective insight into how food affects our bodies at the cellular level each and every day. Above all, he's a super honest fella, articulate and just wants to help people realise true health.

Specifically we covered:

Drew's early years growing up including his health, diet and interests

The symptoms Drew experienced in the lead up to being diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes

Being diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes - how he felt mentally and what advice he was given by health professionals

What Type 1 Diabetes is and how it differs to Type 2 Diabetes

How Drew monitors his blood glucose and administers exogenous insulin

Role of exercise and insulin resistance

Drew's experience with the Paleo Diet and how it affected his insulin requirements and carbohydrate tolerance

Drew's experience with the Keto Diet and how it affected his insulin requirements and carbohydrate tolerance

How a Keto diet can help with blood glucose control but why there is more to consider

Drew's experience with a low fat Plant Based diet and how it affected his insulin requirements and carbohydrate tolerance

The mechanisms behind the change in insulin resistance that Drew experienced across these dietary frameworks

Why sugar shouldn't be blamed for Type 2 Diabetes

Myths and misconceptions about the Keto diet

Importance of keeping healthy carbohydrates like unrefined grains and legumes in the diet

Large population studies and diabetes incidence - what can we learn from these people?

What the Diabetic Association diets are like and why plant-based nutrition for people with insulin resistance/Diabetes isn't mainstream yet

Stress &amp; Sleep and how they affect insulin resistance

Resources for anyone wanting to understand how to transition to a plant-based diet to reduce insulin resistance

and much more

      <title>Ziggy Alberts on using your voice for good</title>
      <description>In Episode 60 I sat down with fellow Australian and ocean lover Ziggy Alberts (@ziggyalberts). At just 24 years of age Ziggy has quickly forged his way to recognition as one of Australia's leading young artists in the music industry. The coolest thing? Ziggy's voice is just as powerful, if not more, off the stage where he shares his love and passion for protecting the environment and being a positive role model for the youths of today.

In this episode we chat about:

Ziggy's early days including being home schooled

When and why he started making music

His journey as an artist from busking up and down the East Coast of Australia to selling out 34 shows across Australia including 5000 people at Festival Hall in Melbourne

The ins and outs of touring

How he manages stress &amp; nerves

Why he is passionate about the environment and in particular the ocean

The Great Australian Bite and proposed oil drilling

and much much more


Friends this conversation is a little different to previous episodes of the Plant Proof podcast with a real focus on how Ziggy has forged his career and why he is passionate about protecting the environment.

      <title>Forget diet fads, how do the longest living people eat?  Featuring Dr Renae Thomas, MD</title>
      <description>In Episode 59 I sat down with Dr Renae Thomas, MD who is is a Physician working in Loma Linda California, one of the Blue Zone populations that display incredible longevity and high quality of life. This is a really important podcast - sometimes in nutritional science we can become too reductionist and zoom in on potential mechanisms without appreciating the complexities of human-beings. Observational data from people displaying longevity, happiness and a high quality of life serve as a reminder that sometimes we need to Zoom Out and look to those who are living proof of what it means to be healthy.

If you want to hear from an actual expert (a qualified Medical Doctor) talk about longevity and how to eat to avoid disease then you will love this episode.

IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:


Where Renee grew up

Her journey to Medical School

Why she developed an interest in the role of food and medicine

Why it's like working in Loma Linda, California

What the Blue Zones are?

Seventh Adventist's and the AHS studies - how vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians and omnivores compare in terms of health outcomes and mortality

Typical clinical patient presentations in this population of Seventh Adventist's

Contrasting populations nearby who have different lifestyles

The type of diet that seventh adventists eat

Renee's thoughts on the Ketogenic/High fat style diets and whether they are supported by science

and much much more


RESOURCES:

Blue Zones website &amp; books
Renae's website
AHS population studies:
Vegetarian diets in the Adventist Health Study 2: a review of initial published findings
Vegetarian Dietary Patterns and Mortality in Adventist Health Study 2
Beyond meatless, the health effects of vegan diets: findings from the Adventist cohorts.

      <itunes:summary>In Episode 59 I sat down with Dr Renae Thomas, MD who is is a Physician working in Loma Linda California, one of the Blue Zone populations that display incredible longevity and high quality of life. This is a really important podcast - sometimes in nutritional science we can become too reductionist and zoom in on potential mechanisms without appreciating the complexities of human-beings. Observational data from people displaying longevity, happiness and a high quality of life serve as a reminder that sometimes we need to Zoom Out and look to those who are living proof of what it means to be healthy.

If you want to hear from an actual expert (a qualified Medical Doctor) talk about longevity and how to eat to avoid disease then you will love this episode.

IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:


Where Renee grew up

Her journey to Medical School

Why she developed an interest in the role of food and medicine

Why it's like working in Loma Linda, California

What the Blue Zones are?

Seventh Adventist's and the AHS studies - how vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians and omnivores compare in terms of health outcomes and mortality

Typical clinical patient presentations in this population of Seventh Adventist's

Contrasting populations nearby who have different lifestyles

The type of diet that seventh adventists eat

Renee's thoughts on the Ketogenic/High fat style diets and whether they are supported by science

and much much more


RESOURCES:

Blue Zones website &amp; books
Renae's website
AHS population studies:
Vegetarian diets in the Adventist Health Study 2: a review of initial published findings
Vegetarian Dietary Patterns and Mortality in Adventist Health Study 2
Beyond meatless, the health effects of vegan diets: findings from the Adventist cohorts.

      <title>Protecting the innocent with Carly Taylor &amp; James Aspey</title>
      <description>Kindness is the language the deaf can hear and the blind can see. In Episode 57 I sit down with Carly Taylor &amp; James Aspey to talk about animal activism and talk about the importance of being patient, kind and understanding when communicating the 'vegan' message. For those of you who may be more interested in the health aspects of a plant-based lifestyle, or perhaps see 'vegan's as extreme, I urge you to listen to this conversation - I think it just may give you a different view of veganism.

IN THIS EPISODE WE COVER:

Carly's personal story - where she grew up, what life was like, why she transitioned to a plant based diet and why veganism is so important to her

Carly's typical day on a plate

Supplements Carly takes

Carly's idea of Pre-Vegans

Strategy for talking to others about the ethics of veganism

Human Rights, Mental Health, Animal Health/Rights and Planetary Health

The idea of 'humane' slaughter, organic, free-range, cage-free etc

Packaging of animal products on shelf &amp; marketing angles

Fuelling yourself on plants in 2019 - options for everyone (junk food versus whole food)

Importance of the Lifestyle Medicine Doctor's encouraging plant based nutrition

A plethora of resources to refer to for more information &amp; inspiration

Plans James &amp; Carly have for 2019 and beyond

and much much more during this 2.5 hour conversation


*NOTE: although this podcast doesn't go into as much detail about factory farming as my previous podcast with James Aspey when he shared his story, there is still some talk about what happens to animals. So with that in mind, perhaps one parents want to listen to first before deciding if it's ok for their juniors to listen. I personally think there are so many powerful messages in this for our children to hear - whether via directly listening or being given a summary appropriate to their age and personality etc

      <title>Addressing gut health issues with leading Gastroenterologist Dr Alan Desmond, MD</title>
      <description>In Episode 56 I sit down with Gastroenterologist Dr Alan Desmond to talk about restoring and maintaining good digestive health with healthy eating habits. With digestive health issues like IBS, IBD, Coeliac and SIBO on the rise globally understanding how to take control of your own gut health is enormously important.

In this episode we specifically covered:

How Alan ended up in the Medical world &amp; what his training was like

Why he has a passion for gut health and what fascinates him about this area of medical practice

Lots and lots of scientific evidence to support health eating habits

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Chron's &amp; Ulcerative colitis), colon cancer, IBS, SIBO

Specific studies on IBD and a Whole Food Plant Based Diet

What foods he recommends his patients and the general population eat more of and what he recommends people eat less of

What the typical western diet looks like compared to optimal diet for gut health

What he makes of various mainstream eating trends like paleo &amp; keto and what scientific evidence supports these methods of eating from a gut health perspective or other

Veganism and gut health issues

Lectins and the 'Plant Paradox'

Low fibre diets

Artificial sweeteners and emulsifeiers

Probiotics &amp; prebiotics

Tips for healthfully transitioning to a diet richer in plants and managing an increase in fibre

Bowel movements &amp; frequency: what is indicative of good health

and loads more


It's a jam packed episode friends. I always say this but either bring a note pad to your first listening session or come back with a notepad when you listen to it for a second time. If you haven't already please connect with Alan on Instagram. He posts loads and loads of science and helpful tips every week that you will greatly benefit from (I know I do!).

If you enjoyed this episode and want further info on gut health I highly recommend Episode 17 that I recorded previously with my good friend Dr Will Bulciewisz.

Resources:

Here is a bunch of studies and other resources that Alan and I spoke about in this episode.

1 - EAT Lancet Report on eating for human health &amp; planetary health
2 - Health Canada's 2019 food recommendations
3 - 2019 Lancet study on fibre and health outcomes
4 - Happy Gut course with Happy pear (Use the code PLANTPROOF20 which will give you 20% off their course)
5 - 2019 BMJ study on fat intake and gut microbiome diversity (spoken about in outro)

      <title>Turning life challenges into life purpose with Adidas Trainer Tanya Poppett</title>
      <description>In Episode 55 I sat down with superstar Adidas trainer Tanya Poppett about her journey into the world of health &amp; fitness, and in particular how challenges with body image in her teenage years spurred her into the woman she is today.

Specifically we covered:


Her life as a child including what her interests were, what she ate, where she grew up etc

Her relationship with food and exercise with specifics around a time in her teenage years where she felt a lot of pressure around the way she looked

Her diet - how and why this has changed over time

What she thought about vegans before making changes to her plate

How her change in diet was received by her partner and family

Her philosophy on exercise, training and creating healthy habits

Creating sustainable exercise habits

The importance of being open minded when it comes to the way we live our lives and in particular training and different forms of exercise

and much more


If you haven't connected with Tanya you can find her on Instagram

      <title>PRO bodybuilder Torre Washington has built his body with plants</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/pro-bodybuilder-torre-washington-has-built-his-body-with-plants</link>
      <description>In Episode 53 I sat down with Torre Washington to talk about his journey and in particular how he got into Body Building and what it's like being a vegan bodybuilder.

Torre and I were meaning to do this episode in the USA however our world's collided a little earlier so we recorded it in Byron Bay whilst hanging out and producing some really cool content for Centr which is Chris Hemsworth's new health &amp; fitness program. If you are looking for some new motivation for your fitness, mindfulness and eating then you will absolutely love Chris' program - it's extremely well put together and I feel very lucky to be a part of it as one of his handpicked experts. Of course my focus is on plant based food!

Anyway, we digress. 

In this conversation we cover:


Bit about some of the places we ate during our time in Byron Bay

Torre's childhood years (what life was like for him etc)

His blood lines and what the Rastafari culture means to him

What his diet was like growing up

What his diet is like now (and yes I ask the infamous question about protein)

When and why he got interested in working out

His journey to becoming a PRO bodybuilder

Why a vegan diet is important to him

Coexisting with non vegans

and much much more

      <title>Why Pop Star Benny Cristovao changed the food on his plate</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/Benny_Cristo</link>
      <description>In Episode 51 I had the absolute privilege of sitting down with European Pop sensation Ben Cristovao or "Benny Cristo" as he goes by.

On surface level Ben is a man with an extreme amount of raw talent and a strong work ethic and steel like determination that allows him to fulfil his potential. But despite his impressive resume of achievements, what left a lasting impression on me from this conversation, is Ben's thought processes and overall state of consciousness. He has an incredible story and where many would be sidetracked by the notoriety of the pop music industry, Ben is using his influence to leave a positive mark on the world.

IN THIS EPISODE WE COVER:

Where Ben grew up in Europe and his blood lines

What his diet was like as a kid

How he got into singing

His achievements as a music artist and athlete

The moment he decided to change what was on his plate

Typical foods he eats

Social media and how he uses it to spark conversations and promote positive change amongst his community

and much much more

      <title>How much of your belief system is made up of your own beliefs with Will Dalton</title>
      <description>In Episode 50 I sat down with good friend Will Dalton to chat about aspects of my life including what inspired me to transition to a plant based lifestyle and ultimately start Plant Proof.
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
For those of you who have followed the Plant Proof journey over the past 12 months, and become part of what is a really incredible community that continues to inspire me daily, you will know that I don't actually like to share a whole lot about myself. I've never been one to want to over share on social media but given the growth of Plant Proof I appreciate that many of you will want to get to know me better, and rightly so!
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
When Will and I sat down we literally started recording with zero format, plans or notes. Everything you hear is completely off the cuff... just how we normally would chat over a coffee after some soft sand lands and a swim at North Bondi. So here it is, a very raw and somewhat unique episode for this show (I much prefer leading the conversation than being asked questions) - I hope it gives you a bit more insight into how I think. Be sure to listen all the way to the end including my outro at the very end of the episode after Will and I finish talking where I offer some more insight into a few things to close out the conversation.
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Reviews are really important:
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you enjoyed the episode and have a spare 1-2 minutes please leave a review on iTunes so the Plant Proof podcast ranks higher and becomes more discoverable for other listeners. And if you have any friends that you think will benefit from listening to this episode or any of the other Plant Proof episodes please share the link – together we can make this world a healthier place.

      <title>Popular Vegan influencer Tess Begg on her journey to Veganism &amp; creating content online</title>
      <link>https://Plantproof.com/popular-vegan-influencer-tess-begg-on-how-she-discovered-her-own-values-beliefs</link>
      <description>Episode 48 with Tess Begg is perhaps one of my favourite conversations to date. Tess is in her early 20's and isn't afraid to tell it how it is. Her life so far has been anything but rosy and I love the fact she owns these hardships and openly talks about how they led her to where she is now. In this episode Tess speaks candidly about how she navigated her way through through her teenage years and despite having instability at home and getting caught up in the wrong social circles was able to seperate her true values &amp; beliefs from those 'handed' to use by society.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Specifically we covered:

Where Tess grew up

What family life was like and her childhood diet

What her teenage and high school years were like

Hanging out in the wrong crowds

Smoking and drugs

Why she transitioned to a vegan diet

What her vegan diet was like initially and how it has changed

Blood test results

Supplements with some specifics around Iron, B12 and Iodine

Why Tess creates content for social media

How long it takes her to create content

Generating an income from social media

Her thoughts on separating social media from her own personal life and 'offline time'

Tess' vegan treat business

What Tess would like to do in the future

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you haven't connected with Tess you can find her on Instagram and You Tube - her posts are sure to provide you with further inspiration for the plant based meals you create at home!

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Episode 48</strong> with <a href="instgram.com/tessbegg"><strong>Tess Begg</strong></a><strong> </strong>is perhaps one of my favourite conversations to date. Tess is in her early 20's and isn't afraid to tell it how it is. Her life so far has been anything but rosy and I love the fact she owns these hardships and openly talks about how they led her to where she is now. In this episode Tess speaks candidly about how she navigated her way through through her teenage years and despite having instability at home and getting caught up in the wrong social circles was able to seperate her true values &amp; beliefs from those 'handed' to use by society.</p><p>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀</p><p><strong>Specifically we covered:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Where Tess grew up</li>
<li>What family life was like and her childhood diet</li>
<li>What her teenage and high school years were like</li>
<li>Hanging out in the wrong crowds</li>
<li>Smoking and drugs</li>
<li>Why she transitioned to a vegan diet</li>
<li>What her vegan diet was like initially and how it has changed</li>
<li>Blood test results</li>
<li>Supplements with some specifics around Iron, B12 and Iodine</li>
<li>Why Tess creates content for social media</li>
<li>How long it takes her to create content</li>
<li>Generating an income from social media</li>
<li>Her thoughts on separating social media from her own personal life and 'offline time'</li>
<li>Tess' vegan treat business</li>
<li>What Tess would like to do in the future</li>
</ul><p>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀</p><p>If you haven't connected with <strong>Tess</strong> you can find her on<a href="https://www.instagram.com/tessbegg/?hl=en"><strong> Instagram</strong></a> and<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBCiDM0WrCAvTHmdVz_GDzQ"><strong>You Tube</strong></a> - her posts are sure to provide you with further inspiration for the plant based meals you create at home!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p><p>Want to know more about supplement and blood tests?

      <title>The damage caused by ocean plastics and what we can do with Environmentalist Tim Silverwood</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/global-plastic-pollution-is-ruining-our-planet-with-take-3-co-founder-tim-silverwood</link>
      <description>In Episode 47 I sat down with Environmentalist and fellow Aussie ocean lover Tim Silverwood.

Tim is the Co-Founder of Take 3 an organisation that encourages people to collect rubbish and dispose of it correctly. He has also recently featured in the documentary ‘Blue’ and is an absolute wealth of knowledge when it comes to where we are going wrong in terms of damaging this planet and what we can all do to fix it! Get ready folks... some of the statistics around the damage we have caused is mind blowing!

In this episode we covered:


Tim's childhood

How he found a love for protecting the planet

How he got involved with Take 3 and became a Co-Founder of this charity

The documentary Blue including information about the key topics it covers

What are ocean plastics and what is the REAL problem we are faced with?

Is the damage reversible?

What are micro plastics?

Is ingesting micro-plastics dangerous?

Plastics in drinking water and soil

Banning single use plastics in Australia

Statistics about the destruction ocean plastics have caused and what they are projected to cause

Are there certain areas of the world who are contributing more to the industrialisation of the ocean

What we can ALL do to help the planet regenerate, perhaps even reverse damage, and prevent further destruction

The Take 3 charity and what it's mission is

and much much more


If you care about the ocean and the entire planet earth ecosystem then you need to kick up a chair and listen to this. Speaking personally this conversation got me thinking about a number of things that I can do to help our planet. If you know anyone else in this space that has an important message to share around the preservation of our planet please shoot me a DM on Instagram (@plant_proof) or email simon@plantproof.com - this is a topic I am very passionate about and am going to continue discussing on the show.

      <description>Episode 44 I caught up with Andrea, or Earthy Andy as you may know her as, on the North Shore of Oahu. Andy was in the final few weeks of her pregnancy (has since had baby Nalu) so it was such an amazing effort for her to sit through quite a long recording!

In this episode we covered:


What its like to live in North Shore, Hawaii

Where she grew up

What her early years were like including her family, sports &amp; what she ate

How and where she met Shem

When and what inspired her to make changes to the food she was eating

How she hid her instagram account initially from anyone she knew including her family

What Shem thought of her moving to a plant based lifestyle

How her pregnancy is going as a vegan mother

Breastfeeding

What's a normal day look like for her family now including the types of foods they eat

Whether their doctors are supportive of the way they live

If they take any supplements

The role of social media in her life and setting boundaries

Her kids and technology/gadgets

Her kids and the foods they eat.

How she teaches them about the foods they eat to hopefully prevent them rebelling

How she has encouraged her kids to try new foods

Being a parent and tips for raising conscious, loving kids

and much much more


And if you want to get some reusable coconut bowls and cutlery etc checkout my good friends business Coconut Bowls

      <title>Improving America's health with Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams</title>
      <link>http://plantproof.com/improving-americas-health-with-brooklyn-borough-president-eric-adams</link>
      <description>In Episode 43 I sat down with Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams to chat about his personal health journey, including being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, and the work he is doing at the Brooklyn community level. Eric is a former NYPD Police Officer and New York State Senator. An extremely well versed man who I am truly grateful that I got to connect with while I was in New York recently.

In this episode we cover:

Eric's childhood including his diet

Eric's time in the New York Police Department

When he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and what he was told regarding his prognosis

What his typical diet was in his adulthood before being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes

Why he changed his diet and how this affected his diabetes management and quality of life

The medications he was told he had to take for life and what he's been able to do with these since changing his eating habits

The work he is doing at a community level in Brooklyn, including his work with Dr Michelle McMacken, and how this can be used as a blueprint for other parts of the USA and communities globally

      <title>Adopting a positive mental attitude with Punk Rocker,  Author &amp; Plant Powered Athlete John Joseph</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/adopting-a-positive-mental-attitude-with-punk-rocker-author-plant-powered-athlete-john-joseph/</link>
      <description>Episode 40 is certainly not for the faint hearted. Legendary punk rocker, author &amp; plant powered athlete, John Joseph, takes us through his life and what it was like to grow up in Manhattan in the 60's, 70's and 80's with no money &amp; little family support while being surrounded by some truly bad influences.

If you do not like swearing or have young kids listening this is not the episode for you. John grew up in some crazy times and did some crazy things to basically stay alive. Despite the colourful language though John has an extremely powerful message and one thing that rang true for me which stood out from our conversation was “its not what happens to someone in life…its what they do about it”.

In this episode we cover:

John's childhood years in Manhattan

What trouble he got up to as a teenager &amp; how drugs impacted his life

What the punk rock scene was like and how he found himself amongst it

Why he changed his diet to plant based

Why he joined the Hare Krishna's

His time in the navy

Being on the run from police and using fake identification so he wasn't caught

The work he is doing with correctional facilities and inmates

His memoir and his other two books (Meat is for Pussies &amp; The PMA effect)

Hope you enjoy the listen.

      <title>Preventing heart attacks with Cardiologist Dr Rob Ostfeld</title>
      <description>In Episode 39 of the Plant Proof Podcast I sit down with Cardiologist, Dr Rob Ostfeld, to talk about preventative medicine and how he treats his patients to improve their quality of life and promote longevity.

If you are wanting to understand more about the types of foods you should be eating and others that you should be avoiding this is the perfect episode. As Dr Ostfeld walks you through the science around cardiovascular disease he offers a tonne of practical information and tips for choosing foods in your own lifestyle.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In this episode we delve into:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Where Dr Ostfeld grew up and what life was like including his diet

How he ended up specialising in Cardiology

When and why his own diet changed

His own experience with asthma

What medical training he has completed and how much nutrition her learned at University

How did he become interested in preventative medicine

How he treats his patients clinically

Saturated fat, cholesterol &amp; damaged endothelial cells

What statins do (cholesterol medications)

How a blocked artery is fixed surgically with a stent ("Snow plow" analogy)

His recommendations for foods to eat more of and foods to eat less of and what science supports these recommendations

What supplements (if any) that he recommends to his patients

What happens if you replace animal protein in a diet to plant protein

How much change do his patients have to make to experience significant benefits

What the future of Medicine is looking like in the USA

His favourite places to eat in New York City

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Below are some of the references that were mentioned in this episode:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The American Journal of Medicine 2017 130, 1298-1305. (Nutrition education)
Journal of Geriatric Cardiology issue 5, 2017: (There are about ten articles in this special issue regarding a plant based diet)
N Engl J Med 2016; 374:1332-1343 (Fruit consumption)
JAMA Intern Med. 2016;176(10):1453-1463. (The study that replaced 3% animal protein with 3% plant based protein)
Circulation. 2015; 132: 1990-1998 (F&amp;V consumption in youth)
Diabetes Care 32:791-796, 2009 (Seventh Day Adventist Data)
Nat Med. 2013 May;19(5):576-85. N Engl J Med. 2013;368:1575-84. (TMAO)

JAMA 1998;280:2001-2007 (Ornish data)
J Fam Pract. 2014:63(7) 356-364. (Esselstyn data)

Diabetes Care 29:1777-1783, 2006 (ADA vs PBD, RCT)

      <title>Making self love a priority with Mental Health &amp; Vegan advocate Bianca Taylor</title>
      <description>In Episode 38 of the Plant Proof podcast I sit down with Bianca Taylor to talk about her journey from a seemingly lost, sad &amp; powerless soul to a vibrant, inspirational &amp; empowering woman taking charge of her life &amp; understanding her purpose.

Mental health &amp; helping people understand that it's ok to feel down is something very close to my heart.

In this episode we cover:

Bianca's childhood and teenage years and her mental health

What happened when her father was shot outside their home &amp; how this affected her

How a toxic relationship affected her ability to manage her mental health

The deepest of lows where she felt like "what's the point of life"

The moment that may have saved her life and helped her find a path towards working out her purpose and no longer suppressing her negative thoughts

Why Bianca gave up eating animal products and is a proud vegan advocate

Tips for self love and working on your mental health to maintain a positive outlook on life

How Bianca meet her partner Nimai Delgado (Vegan Bodybuilder you may remember from episode 3 of the Plant Proof podcast)

Bianca's business veganfitness.com and what's on the horizon for her in the coming years


If you are experiencing any sort of mental health battle I really recommend you reach out to one of the resources below local to you. If you are from a country that's not listed below google search your country name and "helpline" or "suicide hotline" and you will find a local organisation that offers phone support. If you are not sure who to call please ask a friend or family member - it's completely ok not to feel good so please don't feel embarrassed to talk about it.

USA:
https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org 
https://www.thetrevorproject.org

UK/Ireland:
https://www.samaritans.org

Canada:

I also strongly recommend that everyone has a look at the "R U OK" website for helpful tips on how to ask your friends and family members how they are going. As their slogan says "A conversation could change a life". https://www.ruok.org.au/

Hope you enjoy this episode. If you do I would love to hear your feedback either via a share on social media (tag @plant_proof so I can see) or a private message.

      <title>Clearing the confusion around saturated fat, cholesterol, paleo &amp; keto with Dr Michelle McMacken</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/clearing-the-confusion-around-saturated-fat-cholesterol-paleo-keto-with-dr-michelle-mcmacken</link>
      <description>In Episode 37 I sit down for the second time with Dr Michelle McMacken (previous guest on Episode 2) to talk about where the science lies in terms of eating for longevity.

We talk about a plethora of fascinating topics including:


Michelle's project with Bellevue Hospital which is now offering out-patients with chronic disease the option of participating in a plant based food program

Where the science lies in terms of saturated fat &amp; cholesterol and their contributions to disease

The particular type of fat &amp; cholesterol we need to be worried about when it comes to atherosclerosis (narrowing of our arteries) and cardiovascular disease

Sources of healthy fats

The Paleo &amp; Keto diets and where the science sits in terms of these diets being helpful or harmful from a longevity &amp; disease point of view

What Type 2 diabetes is and helpful nutritional information for managing and reversing this disease

and much much more


This is an absolute cracker of an episode, one of my favourites so far in terms of breaking down the science, clearing the confusion and helping us all understand what we should be eating more of and what we should be eating less of. Despite the headlines, the science is very clear and in this episode Michelle offers agenda free insight into exactly what it means. Grab a pen and paper...you're going to want to take notes and more than likely listen 2-3 times!

To connect with Michelle you can find her on Instagram @veg_md- I strongly suggest following her page as she often posts really helpful information directly from the many lifestyle medicine conferences she attends and speaks at.

For extra information from Michelle explaining Cholesterol, LDL-C &amp; HDL-C please read here

As always folks I hope you enjoy the episode and find it thought provoking. I definitely did! If you did enjoy it please share your feedback by leaving a review on iTunes or posting on social media and tagging Michelle and Myself (@plant_proof) (I re share a lot of the feedback posted on my own story).

      <title>Rich Roll on turning his life around and serving others</title>
      <link>https://www.plantproof.com/vegan-athlete-rich-roll-on-turning-your-life-around-and-serving-others</link>
      <description>Episode 35 I sat down with Vegan Dad, author, endurance athlete and podcast host Rich Roll to go through is journey from an unhealthy man in his 20's &amp; 30's who battled with addiction &amp; poor food choices to a man in his 50's that is thriving physically and mentally while living a life of purpose that offers far greater fulfilment.

I realise Rich's story is very well documented and going into this conversation I was contemplating whether or not to even delve into it. However, given this is his first time on the Plant Proof podcast, and that we plan to record future episodes together, I thought it was important that those who may not know his story get a chance to hear it. It's easy to forget just how much of a transformation Rich has had so even for those that do already know his story I think you will still benefit greatly by listening to this episode - I know I certainly have!

In this episode we cover:

1- Rich's childhood including his passions growing up
2- What is lawyer days were like including drugs and alcohol.
3 - Rich's battle with Alcohol and how this affected his swimming career, legal career and social life.
4- Rich's time in a rehabilitation clinic and what he learned about himself
5 - Rich's transition to a plant based lifestyle and what inspired it
6 - Rich's leap into the world of Ultra Endurance competitive racing including Ultra Man, Epic 5 &amp; Ötillö races.
7 - Typical foods that Rich eats in a day
8- What Rich thinks about climate change
9- The evolution of the Rich Roll podcast including his favourite episodes
10 - and much more

Connect with Rich on Instagram @richroll and to find his podcast just search The Rich Roll Show on any podcast app.

As always, hope you enjoy the episode.

      <title>Truly connecting with nature and maximising nutrient density &amp; bioavailability with raw food expert Ben Richards</title>
      <description>Episode 34 I caught up with Ben Richards, owner of Seeds of Life Cafe in Ubud Bali, to chat about his story and what raw or 'living' foods are all about. It's a 3 hour episode, so a bit of a marathon ep, but full of golden nuggets to get you thinking about life at a deeper level, particularly why we eat what we do.

IN THIS EPISODE WE COVER:


Ben's childhood and how he discovered a passion for food and hospitality

Ben's experience with plant medicines including mushrooms and ayahuasca

What 'raw food' means by definition

Is raw food for everyone

What soaking, sprouting and fermentation is

How to soak, sprout and ferment foods

The question that society should be asking in order to get back on track and plug into nature for a truly fulfilling experience on this planet

Resources to learn more about raw foods

Ben's raw food workshops

What durian is (I try it for the first time at the end of this episode)

and much more


Some of the resources we spoke about are:

      <itunes:summary>Episode 34 I caught up with Ben Richards, owner of Seeds of Life Cafe in Ubud Bali, to chat about his story and what raw or 'living' foods are all about. It's a 3 hour episode, so a bit of a marathon ep, but full of golden nuggets to get you thinking about life at a deeper level, particularly why we eat what we do.

IN THIS EPISODE WE COVER:


Ben's childhood and how he discovered a passion for food and hospitality

Ben's experience with plant medicines including mushrooms and ayahuasca

What 'raw food' means by definition

Is raw food for everyone

What soaking, sprouting and fermentation is

How to soak, sprout and ferment foods

The question that society should be asking in order to get back on track and plug into nature for a truly fulfilling experience on this planet

Resources to learn more about raw foods

Ben's raw food workshops

What durian is (I try it for the first time at the end of this episode)

and much more

      <title>Inventive cooking with Avant Garde Vegan Chef Gaz Oakley</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/inventive-cooking-with-avant-garde-vegan-chef-gaz-oakley/</link>
      <description>Episode 32 of the Plant Proof podcast I sat down with world-renowned vegan Chef Gaz Oakley to discuss his story and rise to stardom over the past 3 years. Since early 2016 Gaz has taken social media by storm with his avant-garde cooking displays on You tube and Instagram, amassing a combined following of over 700,000 people. Gaz and I crossed over while both traveling through Bali and took some time to get to know one another and record what we envisage will be the first of several podcasts together. This guy has phenomenal talent, a huge future ahead and is as humble and genuine as they come.

Folks you're going to absolutely love this episode as Gaz takes us through his journey so far and I'm sure by the end of it, if you haven't already, you will track him down on social media to his delicious cooking with your own eyes.

In this episode we discuss:


Gaz's early childhood years

How he developed a passion for cooking

What his interests are outside of cooking

Where he crafted his skills

Why he walked away from the cooking industry at one stage and took up a job in labour and sales

His transition to a plant based diet and what inspired that

How he comes up with the inspiration for his recipes

His growth journey on social media and how he handles the relatively new attention he is getting

Insight into the production requirements for his You Tube videos

His two cook books

A secret collaboration with a huge restaurant...yes he drops the secret on air!

What his plans are for the future

and much more


You can connect with Gaz on Instagram @avantgardevegan &amp; You Tube (Avant Garde Vegan).

As always if you do enjoy the show and share the episode on social media tag @plant_proof - I love seeing your feedback! And of course if you think any of your friends or family members would enjoy the listen please share the link.

Enjoy plant friends!

      <title>From sick &amp; tired to thriving with vegan mother Loni Jane</title>
      <description>Episode 31 of the Plant Proof podcast I sat down with vegan mother Loni Jane. Loni Jane is perhaps one of the most well known online vegan influencers having started sharing her journey pretty much as soon as Instagram was launched. In the last 9 years Loni has become symbolic of someone who was in very poor health that adopted a plant based lifestyle and was able to turn their life around both mentally and physically to create a life of love, prospertity, growth and wellness … a life that is in her control and on her terms as opposed to her previous life where she battled with excessive drinking, low self awareness, poor nutrition and essentially a depleted physical body. Loni and I have been wanting to sit down and record this podcast for a while now and finally we were able to do it in her amazing home in Queensland Australia….we spoke for almost 2 hours but really could of spoken for many more. I hope you enjoy this episode…I think it really sums up Loni well and opitimizes why she has built such a loyal community on line… raw, candid and authentic Loni!

Specifically in this episode we cover:


Loni's childhood years

Her battle with deteriorating health and what factors contributed to this

How and why she transitioned to a plant based lifestyle

The difficulties associated with moving away from her previous habits

Her partners support during her pursuit to better her physical and mental self

How she has raised her children so far

Tips during pregnancy from her personal experience including how she worked with her Doctor's

Some high level information on supplements for women, children and during pregnancy from her personal experience

Specific foods her children eat

and much much more (nearly 2 hours of chatting)


As always you can find the Plant Proof podcast on pretty much all podcast apps including Spotify, iTunes, Google Play, Stitcher, Soundcloud, Overcast and also directly on the plantproof.com website for everyone to enjoy absolutely free of charge!

If you enjoyed this episode please share it with any friends or family members who may benefit from listening to Loni's story and if you use iTunes and have 1-2 min spare time please leave a review on the show. If you don't use iTunes shoot me a direct message on Instagram @plant_proof with your review and I will share it for the community to see.

Hope you enjoy the listen

Plant Based News has quickly grown to become one of, if not the, most visited websites on the internet for the latest plant based &amp; vegan news. The entire platform is aimed at making people more conscious with regards to the environment, their health and the other living beings that we share the planet with. Their mission and goals are so well aligned with Plant Proof's that I couldn't miss out on the opportunity to have Robbie on the show to hear just how things have unfolded for him personally and for this amazing media company he founded with his business partner Klaus Mitchell.

In this episode we discuss:


Robbie's childhood in Zimbabwe &amp; why he moved to London

Robbie's passion for media

Robbie's transition to a vegan lifestyle

The inspiration &amp; team behind Plant Based News

What the future holds for this company

and much much more

      <title>Discovering true health for the long term. One mans journey from Keto to Plant Based with Jeremy Butler</title>
      <description>At a glance Jeremy Butler is your everyday Aussie bloke who for many years has focussed, with the best of intentions, on being the healthiest version of himself. What's fascinating is that beneath the surface Jeremy has gone through a tremendous amount of trial and error to ultimately discover a dietary lifestyle that aligns with his deepest of inner values. A diet that causes less harm &amp; promotes longevity. He has tried both the paleo and ketogenic diets &amp; while he looked great he isn't afraid to talk about some of the inner health effects that he noticed behind closed doors. For years Jeremy ignored these signs and symptoms because he was so committed to the movement, until he had a shift in priorities.

In this episode we cover:

Jeremy's childhood life and diet

A pivotal point in Jeremy's life that made him look at his health more deeply

His journey through various diets including paleo and keto

How he felt on these diets

Why he transitioned to a plant based lifestyle

What it felt like to become more compassionate towards other life

How he encourages healthy eating habits at home with his two children &amp; wife

and much much more

      <title>James Aspey on the horrors of factory farming &amp; why he gave up meat</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/why-james-aspey-gave-up-meat-and-you-could-too</link>
      <description>Episode 21 with Animal Activist James Aspey on the horrors of factory farming and why he gave up meat.

James Aspey is an Australian Animal Activist &amp; Vegan who incredibly took a year long vow of silence to raise awareness for the animal cruelty that takes place within our food system. He has since become one of the worlds most well known, if not the most well known, Animal Activist having given over 500 free speeches across the globe. He lives and breathes this and is well equipped to explain to us how big of an issue the consumption of animal products is and why everyone should at least consider reducing or eliminating such foods from their plate.

In this episode we covered:

Where James grew up and the types of foods he ate as a child

His own health journey and in particular a pivotal time of his life that led to him becoming more conscious about his health

His transition to a vegan diet &amp; what sparked this

Why he took a year long vow of silence and what that was like

How James makes money &amp; manages to dedicate his entire life to activism

What is happening behind the closed doors at factory farms

Resources to go away and watch to educate yourself further

Factory farming statistics so we can understand the size of this issue

Solutions to eating less meat, or cutting it out altogether and reducing animal suffering

What Vegan Utopia looks like to him

and much more


As James does go into detail about what's happening inside the 'abattoirs' please make sure you listen to this at an appropriate time. Whether that is in the company our your children in the car or at home by yourself I'll leave that in your hands but just a pre warning.

      <title>Osher Gunsberg, Australian celebrity TV host &amp; Vegan,  shares his battle with depression &amp; addiction</title>
      <link>https://plantproof.com/mental-illness-addiction-with-osher-gunsberg-australian-tv-host-celebrity</link>
      <description>Episode 20 I sat down with Osher Gunsberg (@osher_gunsberg), celebrity Australian TV host, who shares his story and in particular his battle with mental illness &amp; addiction. You may also know him as Andy G or Andrew G which he previously went by.

With the gift of the gab, blonde locks and contagious smile it would seem Osher was always destined to entertain or find his way into the world of television but just how did a kid with anxiety end up hosting live TV in front of millions of viewers? What toll did that take on his mental and physical health and what learnings does he have to share? Well, that's exactly what this episode is all about. Osher came over to my place in Bondi and we had a really open and honest conversation over a Turmeric Latte (haha) about what he went through behind the scenes including some terrible lows as well as some hugely positive learnings and life-changing experiences. The timing of this episode is absolutely perfect with Osher's book 'Back after the Break' launching next week. If you are an Australian and know Osher I think this episode will give you insight into the actual man behind the man the microphone that you have seen on TV for so many years. If you are from overseas, I'm sure you will still find this episode tremendously interesting with many take-home messages.

In this episode we cover:

Where Osher grew up &amp; what his childhood was like

What drew him towards a career in Television &amp; radio which ultimately saw him hosting some of the most viewed shows ever in Australia (Australian Idol, The Bachelor)

When alcohol crept into his life &amp; how it became a problem

How he has learned to deal with Mental illness (paranoia, OCD, anxiety etc)

How he has handled alcohol addiction

His battle with weight, why he went vegan &amp; how he ended up on the cover of Men's Health

much much more


Oh, I forgot to mention Osher is vegan and has been for essentially over a decade...and he's hugely entertaining, so naturally, so as a good host should I let him do a lot of the talking! Also, Osher kindly had me on his show a little while back - if you haven't listened to that episode you can here.

      <title>Using science to support a healthy diet with Frank Cusimano</title>
      <link>https://www.plantproof.com/practical-nutrition-information-with-frank-cusimano</link>
      <description>Episode 19 of the Plant Proof Podcast with Frank Cusimano is all about using science to make objective &amp; informed food choices.

With a host of science degrees under his belt, a PHD in Nutrition and Medical Degree underway, and an absolute passion for reading scientific literature, Frank is perfectly suited to help us navigate through many commonly asked questions about healthy eating and where the science sits. Whats cool, which Frank goes into, is that he doesn't specifically label himself as 'Vegan', rather he just eats a certain way because it is supported by science as the healthiest way, and it just so happens to mean it does not include animal products and is therefore labelled by society as 'vegan'.

In this episode we cover:

Frank's story and transition to a plant-based diet

Optimal times to eat meals and should we fast?

BCAA's

How much Protein do we need?

Eating for longevity

Losing weight with Longevity in mind

Keto &amp; Paleo Diets

Is Soy healthy?

Omega 3's - are they important and where can we get them from? Do we need to supplement Omega 3?

An overview of the gut microbiome and the enteric nervous system

Is Coconut Oil beneficial?

Should we cook with oil?

and much much more


Regarding Soy you can see post's that both Frank and I have previously done on this topic below:

Can Soy prevent Prostate Cancer?

Is Soy Healthy?

Is Soy Testosterone Lowering?

      <description>Episode 18 of the Plant Proof podcast with Zanna Van Dijk (@zannavandijk) is all about leading a conscious life to leave the world in a better place than we found it.

As you can see in the episode content below Zanna leads a very busy life and does an amazing job inspiring people through so many different channels. I had a real 'hoot' recording this episode with Zanna in Wimbledon. She is absolutely hilarious - there are many themes throughout this light-hearted conversation which I hope provoke further thought by all who listen. I know I walked away from this conversation reviewing many aspects of my life - and yes I watched A Plastic Ocean! In this episode we discuss: Where Zanna grew up in the UK and her diet as a kid Her time at University studying Speech Pathology and when/why she started her Instagram Her Role as Ambassador for Adidas The Girl Gains movement and the Fit &amp; Fearless podcast on BBC which Zanna co-hosts Her passion for reducing single-use plastic and waste that ends up in the ocean affecting the marine environment. Her swimwear brand Stay Wild which is made from recycled ocean plastic. Her transition to a vegan diet Her typical workout routine/ways to stay fit and much much more Listen Now: REVIEW/SHARE: If you enjoyed the episode and have a spare 1-2 minutes please leave a review on iTunes so the Plant Proof podcast ranks higher and becomes more discoverable for other listeners.

      <description>Episode 17 of the Plant Proof podcast with The Gut Health MD also known as Dr B or Dr Will Bulsiewicz is all about how to cultivate a healthy gut microbiome and what this actually means. Dr B, as he prefers to be called, has a fun and agenda-free way of bringing the latest in gut health science to his clinical practice, website and social media (@theguthealthmd) for us all to benefit from.

Dr B's resume speaks for itself - here is just a short list of some of the things he has already achieved in his career:

Qualified MD, a graduate of Georgetown University School of Medicine Board-certified in internal medicine and Gastroenterology Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI) from Northwestern University and a certificate in nutrition from Cornell University At UNC he received the highest clinical award and was Chief Gastroenterology Fellow He has published more than 20 scientific articles and given more than 40 presentations at national meetings On top of this Dr B continues to practice clinically.

IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSSED:

      <title>Running For The Animals With Vegan Marathon Runner Fiona Oakes</title>
      <description>Episode 16 of the Plant Proof Podcast with Vegan Marathon Runner Fiona Oakes talking about her path to becoming a marathon runner who holds 3 world records Fiona Oakes is a British Marathon runner who holds three world records despite losing her knee cap (patella) to an illness when she was 17. The really fascinating thing about Fiona's story for me is not that she has holds these records but that among a non vegetarian family she personally chose to eat a vegetarian diet at age 3 and a completely vegan diet by age 6 due to her undeniable love for all animals. After school Fiona held an office job in London before eventually starting an animal sanctuary in Essex which still exists today and provides a loving home to over 400 animals. Between marathon running and the sanctuary Fiona puts every last bit of her energy into raising awareness for animal cruelty and showing the world that veganism is not only a compassionate way to live but a healthy way which can fuel you to achieve amazing athletic performance beyond your wildest dreams. In this episode we cover: Why Fiona made a conscious decision at such an early age to not eat animals Fiona's struggles with her knee in her teenage years How Fiona was 'different' to many of her peers growing up Her early career in London and how the animal sanctuary came to life Her typical routine at the animal sanctuary and how she trains for marathons Whether she actually loves running or simply runs for the animals What Fiona eats and much much more Connect with Fiona: @oakes.fiona on Instagram Play now: REVIEW/SHARE: If you enjoyed the episode and have a spare 1-2 minutes please leave a review on iTunes so the Plant Proof podcast ranks higher and becomes more discoverable for other listeners. And if you have any friends that you think will benefit from listening to this episode or any of the other Plant Proof episodes please share the link - together we can make this world a healthier place.

He has a motto to live with "compassion above all else" and uses this to effectively communicate his message to people from all walks of life including those who have different opinions &amp; belief systems. In this episode we chat about: Where Matt grew up and why he was inspired to change to a vegan diet? Why he has moved to Bali &amp; how he's finding it Why he is an animal activist How he communicates to effectively spread his message What he has seen first hand at factory farms His tips for young parents and educating children on where animal products come from What he see's as the future and much much more Connect with Matt on Instagram.

      <description>Episode 13 of the Plant Proof podcast with Max La Manna talking about his story &amp; how to live a no waste life Max La Manna is the perfect example of a typical kid that grew up in the late 80's and 90's in America thinking eating an Italian American style diet, including animal products like meats and cheeses, was normal and healthy. Despite always being slightly more conscious about the environment than his peers, which he credits to the way he was raised, there was a pivotal moment in Max's life where his consciousness went to a new level. To an extent this moment redefined who he was and helped him work out his true purpose. Today Max is an all round great guy, a passionate vegan and an advocate for living a no waste life. In this episode we sat down to discuss: His personal story and transition to a plant based/vegan lifestyle Why he cares about the environment How he lives a no waste life Tips we can implement to reduce the levels of waste we produce from our own lives and much more You can connect with Max on Instagram @eatingwithmax and also on his own website Play now: REVIEW/SHARE: If you enjoyed the episode and have a spare 1-2 minutes please leave a review on iTunes so the Plant Proof podcast ranks higher and becomes more discoverable for other listeners. And if you have any friends that you think will benefit from listening to this episode or any of the other Plant Proof episodes please share the link - together we can make this world a healthier place.

      <title>Ben Abstacker - Building A Positive Mindset, Exercise For Weight Loss And Developing Rock Hard Abs</title>
      <description>Episode 12 of the Plant Proof podcast with Ben Abstacker talking about his story &amp; building a positive mindset Ben Handsaker (better known as Abstacker) is an Australian champion fitness model, cover model, international motivational speaker and top performing coach. He is hands down the most motivational inspiring guy I have met. You only have to be in his presence for a short period of time to pick on his positive vibes and really 'make your day'. At the 2014 Musclemania Australian championship Ben won 1st place in Men's physique and 1st place overall. As a result he was awarded the 1st ever prestigious Australian Mens physique model pro card. He has since landed 4 covers in large global fitness magazines and has appeared in 50 fitness magazines around the world. Despite all this success in the fitness industry, Ben's journey has not been without insecurity, failure and adversity. Ben was once an overweight party boy who had little regard for his health &amp; wellness. He found himself in a corporate job he didn't love. In a twist of fate, Ben was able to turn his life around thanks to a certain girl who inspired him, through humiliation, to take more pride in his physical condition. Ben has a very special way of maintaining a positive mindset and waking up every single day with a 'winning' mentality. Sit back &amp; relax as Ben and I cover his journey to date and some very practical take home messages for anyone wanting to improve their mindset , become a more positive &amp; composed person and get more results in the gym In this epsiode Hear Ben's story from early childhood days, to university and how he went from an overweight party boy to a fitness model and health coach Learn Ben's morning rituals Learn how Ben maintains a positive mindset and handles stress Hear Ben's top tips for weight loss &amp; building rock hard abs Play now: REVIEW/SHARE: If you enjoyed the episode and have a spare 1-2 minutes please leave a review on iTunes so the Plant Proof podcast ranks higher and becomes more discoverable for other listeners. And if you have any friends that you think will benefit from listening to this episode or any of the other Plant Proof episodes please share the link - together we can make this world a healthier place.

        <![CDATA[<p>Episode 05 of the Plant Proof Podcast with Peter Cervoni Chef Peter Cervoni is a veteran of the food service industry, and brings with him well over 30 years of proven, professional culinary experience to the realm of plant-based, health-supportive cuisine. Peter graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in 1993, and after an apprenticeship at The Breakers Resort in Palm Beach, FL, Peter worked at some of New York City's finest restaurants, including The River Café and La Cote Basque. After experiencing what can only be described as an epiphany leading to his paradigmatic switch to become vegan 21 years ago, Peter devoted all his talent and energy to plant-based and health supportive cuisine. Since that time Peter has worked at the helm of top New York City vegan restaurants, such as Angelica Kitchen, Quintessence and Organic Avenue in addition to consulting for many others. Besides being a chef, Peter has held almost every job imaginable in the culinary world from food writer for Vegetarian Times, to food stylist and culinary educator.

      <title>Professional USA boxer Mike Rashid King </title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/mike-rashid-king-an-inspiring-story-from-being-surrounded-by-drugs-and-violence-as-a-kid-to-becoming-a-professional-usa-boxer-and-successful-businessman/</link>
      <description>In Episode #4, I’m joined by Mike Rashid King. He’s a professional American boxer, body builder, and successful businessman. From an early age, Mike was surrounded by drugs and violence in Brooklyn NYC, where he grew up. He went through what can only be described as a crazy and unimaginable roller coaster ride to get to where he is today. A story of someone who shows true grit to overcome adversity.
Enjoy, friends.

      <link>https://theproof.com/nimai-delgado-professional-body-builder-and-vegan-athlete/</link>
      <description>In Episode #3, I’m joined by Nimai Delgado, a professional men’s physique bodybuilder and vegan athlete from the USA. Raised in Mississippi as a vegetarian from birth, Nimai made the move to a 100% vegan diet in 2015. That’s right, he has never eaten meat in his life. It wasn’t until Nimai won his first bodybuilding competition that he no longer suppressed his identity, began to understand who he was, and learned to own it. 
Enjoy, friends.

      <title>Start-ups and perseverance | Jake McKeon</title>
      <link>https://theproof.com/plant-proof-podcast-01-talking-start-ups-and-perseverance-with-entrepreneur-jake-mckeon-founder-of-coconutbowls-com/</link>
      <description>In Episode #1, I sat down with Jake Mckeon, the founder of coconutbowls.com. Jake's story is one of both perseverance and dedication and offers insight into how you can use failed start-ups to build something truly great. From working a 9–5 office job and following a string of 'failed' or 'semi-failed' start-ups, Jake has gone on to create an astronomical business that has reclaimed and sold hundreds of thousands of Coconut Bowls in just the first two years of operating.  
Enjoy, friends.
