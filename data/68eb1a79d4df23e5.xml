    <description>WELCOME to Chrissy Chaos! 
 
Chrissy Chaos is broadcasting for the last time from his Brooklyn apartment. We talk conspiracy theories about the Taliban. Chris ALREADY has some pool issues. We chat with Ti Ti's parole officer. How should we celebrate Ti Ti's birthday in Florida? Sound off in the comments. Vinny chimes in and talks about how hard moving is with Mr.Chaos. We answer a few fan questions. One fan has some WILD ideas about what's really going on in the world right now. CHAOS!

You decide if it was..... Mike Tyson can't fight Joe list though, he trains as a MMA and Jiu Jitsu fighter, DON'T MESS WITH JOE!-- check it out! Boys close it out with Joe giving Chris some advice on how to do Joe Rogan's podcast. WHAT SHOULD CHRIS TALK ABOUT WITH JOE ROGAN!?

      <title>Mermaids, Ghosts &amp; PU$$Y | Chris Distefano Presents: Chrissy Chaos | EP 58</title>
      <description>WELCOME to Chrissy Chaos! 
 
Chrissy Histories is here to start the episode and let us know what NATO is, little histories on the Cold War, Berlin Wall and what Putin is doing today. Chris is having a rant but listen in and learn about Ukraine vs. Russia. We are team Ukraine especially because Putin, if you accidentally hurt someone that is transgendered, that helps boost American morale and then Biden will interfere! Is Putin the richest and strongest man in the world? He records all this content, seems a bit like the Michael Scott of dictators, no?! The Chaos crew takes a break from World War III to talk about what's happening with Kanye and Kim and Pete. Kanye West, well known now as Ye, released a new music video with The Game called Eazy. In the video he kidnaps, decapitates and buries a cremation version of Pete Davidson. But at the end of the video says, JK. Oh okay.. still pretty chilling. Anyways, are mermaids real? Is Mark Cuban a good billionaire? We go back to thinking about Kim's power and let's just be honest, pussy power is real! Happy Women's month guys! Listen just try to be a good person, ignore Trump supporting Putin (yikes) and be happy that one of Chris' friends is growing up! Also Bubbas stop drinking Diet coke as it may tie to ADHD and try to find Chris' dissertation.

      <title>Sexuality is a HOAX with Ian Fidance | Chris Distefano Presents: Chrissy Chaos | EP 45</title>
      <description>WELCOME to Chrissy Chaos! 
 
Chrissy Chaos is joined by COMEDIAN  Ian Fidance  this week! Chrissy needs to stay fresh and will be getting a haircut during todays episode. Shout out Jeremy from Cartel Hair Studio in SoHo. We get to the bottom of sexuality and what it means to be bisexual. When was your first time fooling around with a guy. What makes you gay? Is lust a negative thing? Alec Baldwin is in bad trouble, him and his wife delete their social media. The cuomo's are taking a BEATING. Elon Musk's new haircut is WILD. Social media and porn has ruined everything. Addiction is the root of humanity. WE find out what Ian's rockbottom was. How to know you have a drinking problem. The worst day Ian has ever lived. Being in jail before a job interview. Chris is LIT off his new David Goggins book! LETS GO! Everything is in your head. Most of life is just a reflection of what you fill your head with. Stay in the FOG. People need to be more open with themselves and their point of views. WE HAVE A BIG SURPRISE FOR IAN!!!!!

Shout out MagicSpoon! 48 laws of COMEDY! Syphilis is insane. Is America built on bullying? WE NEED IT! Shout out Ryan Reynolds! The boys talk about their open mic days. Jerry Seinfeld ghosted Chris and got mad at Mark Normand. Chris talks about the time he read texts he had sent Jerry on his Patreon! Mark talks about his worst bombs in comedy and how it haunts your memory after. Quarantine saved Mark's relationship with JERRY!
