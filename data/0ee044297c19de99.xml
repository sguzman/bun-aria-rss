   <media:description>Head to https://actnow.climeworks.com/futurology to start removing CO₂ from the air today!

Climate change is the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. And, while efforts are in place to reduce emissions and eventually reach carbon neutrality, we will be releasing billions of tons of carbon dioxide in the meantime. To help lower emissions and eventually bring them back to normal, we must also start removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Fortunately, there is technology that does exactly that. With its innovative technology, the company Climeworks has become the leader in direct air capture technology. By taking part in one of their monthly subscriptions, you can remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and help in the fight against climate change.

Thank you to Climeworks for sponsoring this video!</media:description>

China is quickly rising to influence in Africa. Over the past two decades, China has begun investing deeply in the continent. Through loans for large-scale infrastructure projects and economic integration, the Asian giant has made a large footprint in Africa. As a result, African nations have begun politically leaning towards China over western nations. In response, western nations have begun their own programs to increase relations with Africa and reestablish strong diplomatic ties. Over the coming decades, Africa will certainly serve as an arena between China and the West, with both sides seeking to gain allies and increase their global influence.

   <media:description>Canada is building a $6.3BN new railway network across the Montreal metro area. Called REM, the network will dramatically improve Montreal’s commuter rail infrastructure by establishing a new, 67 kilometer long light-rail line across the city. It will feature autonomous, spacious and ventilated train carriages from the Alstom Metropolis family of rolling stock. It will also have 26 stations with a modern and green design, featuring platform screen doors that will open only when trains arrive. The new system will provide jobs, cut commute times across Montreal and contribute billions of dollars to the local economy. While delayed and over budget, it is planned to fully open in 2024. When opened, it will serve as a 21st century evolution to Montreal’s expansive transport network.

The UK just opened a new £18.8 BN underground railway line in London. Since the 1940’s, dreamers have imagined a new underground rail line linking the Paddington and Liverpool Street stations in London, connecting the east and west. Then, in 2008, under the name Crossrail, the project was approved. Between 2009 and 2022, the enormous project was constructed. Over 40 kilometers of underground tunnels were bored, 10 new stations were excavated and constructed, and 50 kilometers of new tracks were laid. Then, on May 24th, 2022, the new line opened. Named the Elizabeth Line, it has increased London’s rail capacity by 10% and is expected to add £42 BN to the UK economy. It is a new favorite of London residents and will help commuters move across the city for the next 120 years.

   <media:description>Congo is considering building the largest hydropower station in the world, the Grand Inga Dam. The project, which would cost $80 billion USD and generate 40 GW of power, would sit along the Congo river just 220 kilometers from Kinshasa. If built, it would provide green power to millions of Africans, increasing the standard of living and positively affecting the environment. However, there are several issues with its construction. Currently, infrastructure and demand issues make it very impractical to build. Nevertheless, a smaller project could benefit the region and be worth building. And eventually, once the demand is in place, a Grand Inga Dam could finally come to fruition.

   <media:description>The US is planning to construct a $29.5 billion dollar rail infrastructure project in New York City. Currently, there is only one northeast corridor train link between Manhattan and New Jersey. Running at full capacity, the link transports 200 thousand commuters to and from New York City every day, serving as an essential lifeline for the metropolis. However, it is deteriorating very rapidly and frequently breaks down, causing commuter chaos. In the near future, when it inevitably will have to be shut down for repair, the closure would seriously harm the regional economy, causing billions of dollars of economic damage. To fix this problem, NYC is building the Gateway Program, which will include numerous rail infrastructure projects between Manhattan and New Jersey, including a new Hudson Tunnel and Portal Bridges. Planned to be finished by the 2030’s, the project will provide a list of benefits and boost the city’s economy.

   <media:description>In the future, the Sahara Desert will turn green. Due to the Earth’s slightly elliptical shape and the gravitational pull of other planets in our solar system, the Earth’s orbit, tilt and wobble gradually fluctuate over time in a process called the Milankovitch cycles. By affecting how much and where sunlight hits Earth, these cycles have a significant impact on the long-term climate of Earth. One of these effects impacts the climate of northern Africa. Every 26,000 years, more sunlight hits northern Africa, causing a positive feedback loop that spreads vegetation across the region. While we are currently in a dry period, in about 13,000 years, it is expected that the Sahara will enter a humid period and turn into a green, lush region. To speed up this process though, there are ways to artificially green the desert while also harvesting green, renewable energy.

   <media:description>Indonesia is quickly growing into a global superpower. Over the past 50 years, its population and economy have grown rapidly, projecting it onto the global stage. Nowadays, it is expanding as fast as ever and is expected to be the fourth largest economy in the world by 2050. However, this growth will not come without its challenges. Currently, Indonesia has many internal problems to deal with, such as corruption, separatism and economic inequality. And, from the exterior, it has to deal with the dangerous implications of climate change. However, Indonesia is working to manage these issues and is still on track to become a future global superpower.

   <media:description>For over a century, the idea of building a tunnel across the Atlantic ocean has fascinated the minds of visionaries. However, due to cost and feasibility concerns, the idea was always dismissed. Then, in 2003, engineers announced that a transatlantic tunnel was within the realms of possibility. Using a submerged floating tunnel, a connection across the northern Atlantic could potentially be built, linking New York City and London. If constructed, a transatlantic tunnel would be the largest construction project in world history. It would cost approximately 12 trillion dollars, take a century or more to build, and require thousands of workers. It would unite the Old and New Worlds, increasing tourism, business and international cooperation. Unfortunately though, it would come with a list of problems. Construction difficulty, safety hazards and cost issues would make the project incredibly challenging. Despite these issues, one day, a transatlantic tunnel may finally be built.

   <media:description>China is building a $580 billion USD city of the future south of Beijing. Named Xiong’an, the city will help alleviate pressure from Beijing by absorbing its non-essential capital functions. Designed as a green, smart city, it will also hopefully fuel innovation and improve the quality of life of Chinese citizens. The city will cover over 1,000 square kilometers of land in Rongcheng, Xiong and Anxin counties. Eventually, it is hoped Xiong’an will add 298 billion dollars to the region’s GDP and host 1.5 million people. Since construction started in 2017, the project has progressed significantly. A train station, huge neighborhood, schools, and business/citizen service centers are all finished. Many other projects are underway or in planning. In the future, Xiong’an will certainly rise from the rural farmland of northern China. Whether it will succeed and become a world-class smart city, we will just have to wait and see.

   <media:description>By 2050, global transportation will be vastly different than today. Vehicles will go electric and fully autonomous, transporting people around with no human interaction. Meanwhile, autonomous semi-trucks, vans and robots will deliver packages. In cities, buses and electric robotaxis will shuttle people around on streets and in underground tunnels. In the skies, eVTOL’s will also fly passengers around. On the ground, high speed trains and hyperloop systems will quickly transport people across continents. Across oceans, supersonic jets and hydrogen airplanes will move passengers around. In domestic markets, electric planes will do the same. In the oceans, electric boats and super containers will move people and cargo around. Lastly, in space, rockets, space elevators and space catapults will get people and cargo into orbit and across the solar system.

   <media:description>Spain is building an $8.7 billion USD new urban development in northern Madrid, called Madrid Nuevo Norte. Madrid is the heart of Spain. However, in its north, train tracks and the urban void surrounding them cut the city right in half, creating traffic and connectivity issues. To solve this issue, Spain is building a new urban development with sparkling skyscrapers and affordable housing on the land. It will host the tallest building in Spain, countless office buildings, world-class infrastructure, and 10,500 new housing units. The project, called Madrid Nuevo Norte, is planned to boost Madrid’s GDP by 18.3 billion euros and help alleviate the city’s housing shortage. However, it also does come with some controversy. Some criticize it as a private, profit-motivated scheme that will increase Madrid’s income gap. In addition, some are unhappy with the construction the project will bring. Nevertheless, it is advancing quickly and construction is set to begin in late-2021.

   <media:description>Texas is considering constructing a $26.2 billion seawall south of Houston. Houston, the fourth most populous city in the USA, hosts the largest petrochemical complex in the country. It refines 27% of the nation’s gasoline and 60% of its aviation fuel. However, this complex is threatened by hurricanes and the storm surges they bring. If a hurricane directly hit the complex, it would result in an estimated $100 billion in damage. To help prevent this, professor William Merrill and the US Army Corps of Engineers have proposed a massive, 58 mile long seawall along the southern coast of Houston, nicknamed Ike Dike. The proposed seawall would protect national security and prevent a wildlife disaster. However, it would also be extremely expensive, could lower property values and disrupt local fish and oyster populations. As of 2021, the proposal is gaining momentum and is planned to be presented to Congress soon.

   <media:description>Denmark is planning to construct a $2.4 billion island off the coast of Copenhagen, called Lynetteholm, which will protect the city from rising sea levels while also providing new land for developments. Copenhagen, the largest city and capital of Denmark, has a very low elevation. Because of this, it is at risk from rising sea levels. In the future, it is feared that storm surges could flood the capital’s city streets. To solve this problem, Denmark is building Lynetteholm, a reclaimed island that will have housing for 35,000 people and new infrastructure developments. Despite its benefits, the island has gained opposition from protesters who fear its environmental repercussions and its impact on the residents of Copenhagen. Nevertheless, the project is advancing. On June 4th 2021, the Danish parliament approved the project. In the coming years, it is expected to rise from the harbor, serving as a grand new expansion of Copenhagen.
