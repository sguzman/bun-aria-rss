Lyrics

All this time I've been hanging on
To an edge I caught when we both were young
That the world I won wasn't near enough
Always distant, always all
In all that war, I'd forgotten how
Many men might die for what I'd renounced
I was staging life as a battleground
No, I let that grasping fall

May the last long year be forgiven
All that war left within it
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to
And we've only made it together
Feel some change in the weather
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to

And though it's all so uncertain, cold
All the rafters cracked, all the copper sold
There's a ration back in a manifold
If you need it or forgot

May the last long year be forgiven
All that war left within it
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to
And we've only made it together
Feel some change in the weather
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to

And somehow I see
It's free

And with love and hate in the balance
One last way past the malice
One warm day's all I really need
And with love and hate in the balance
One last way past the malice
One warm day is all I really need

Lyrics

I was raised up believing I was somehow unique
Like a snowflake distinct among snowflakes
Unique in each way you'd conceive
And now after some thinking, I'd say I'd rather be
A functioning cog in some great machinery
Serving something beyond me
But I don't, I don't know what that will be
I'll get back to you someday soon, you will see

What's my name, what's my station
Oh, just tell me what I should do
I don't need to be kind to the armies of night
That would do such injustice to you
Or bow down and be grateful and say
&quot;Sure, take all that you see&quot;
To the men who move only in dimly lit halls and determine my future for me
And I don't, I don't know who to believe
I'll get back to you someday soon, you will see

If I know only one thing, it's that everything that I see
Of the world outside is so inconceivable
Often, I barely can speak
Yeah, I'm tongue-tied and dizzy
And I can't keep it to myself
What good is it to sing helplessness blues?
Why should I wait for anyone else?
And I know, I know you will keep me on the shelf
I'll come back to you someday soon myself

Lyrics 

Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?
Can I
Ever know your mind?
Am I handing you mine?
Do we both confide?

I see it, eat through every word I sow
See what you need to, do you doubt it's yours?
Now I’m learning the ropes
Never get this close
I've been wounded before
Hasn't let me go

It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face
If I don’t, well, nothing will change
Staying under my weather all day

Can I believe you when you say I'm good?
I didn't need to when I wished you would
No, it isn't enough
Never held that much
Now another way up
Been a row too rough

It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face
If I don't, well, nothing will change
Staying under my weather all day

Lately, I'm wondering too
What type of desire I can break
When I'm one way with them, one with you
What half is it of me rearranged?

Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?
I want to need you
I want to need you
Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?

Lyrics

Monday night
Loud in the road outside
I saw the gate coming down
And smoke all around
The south hill
These last days
Con-men controlled my fate
No one is holding the whip
And the oil won't stick
But I will

Now that a light is on
Now that the water runs
And the heartless are nearly gone
No time to get it wrong

Sunday end
Ache for the sight of friends
Though I've been safe in the thought
That the line we walk
Is the same one

Now that a light is on
Now that the water runs
And the heartless are nearly gone
No time to get it wrong

Sometimes it comes to this, no it's true
This time, what comes of it, call it due
I do
I do, I do, I do

Now that a light is on
Now that the water runs
And the heartless are nearly gone
No time to get it wrong

Lyrics

Why in the night sky are the lights hung?
Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun?
Floating in the vacuum with no purpose, not a one
Why in the night sky are the lights hung?

Why is life made only for to end?
Why do I do all this waiting then?
Why this frightened part of me that's fated to pretend?
Why is life made only for to end?

In the city only for a while
Here to face the fortune and the bile
I heard you on the radio, I couldn't help but smile
In the city only for a while

Why in the night sky are the lights hung?
Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun?
Floating in the vacuum with no purpose, not a one
Why in the night sky are the lights hung?

Lyrics

In the morning, when the moon is at its rest
You will find me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold night
In the morning
It's the morning of my life

And in the daytime I will meet you as before
You will find me waiting by, waiting by the ocean floor
Painting castles in the shifting sands
Pools of water, nobody understands
In the morning
It's the morning of my life

It's the morning of my life
The minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

In the evening I will fly you to the moon
To the top right hand corner of the ceiling in my room
Where we'll wait until sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold night
For another day
It's the morning of my life

Lyrics

More than I had in mind
More than I wish I knew
And now it’s near on me
Some rush of red fear
And my worst old times look fine from here

I know you walked this route
And you might help me out
You said what's done is done
I can't turn the hand 'round
But still it looks a long way down

Oh man, was it that much better then?
We were left alone, we were proud of our pain
And so I want to walk out in the night
See the wide young river flood rain

We're not on one straight line
I made my own way through
And when the track goes cold
I'll know that it's true
That rebirth won't work like it used to

Oh man, was it that much better then?
We were left alone, we were proud of our pain
And so I want to walk out in the night
See the wide young river flood rain

And I can't let go
Of a lot I've left
I'm holding nothing
But what I kept
And it all got dimmer
Each passing step
And I need you with me
And you read the writ
Are you now insisting
Is it not worth it?
But I've got no option
I inherited this and I'm overcome

That's that, we're a long way from the past
I'll be better off in a year or in two

Lyrics

Don't sing love songs, you’ll wake my mother
She's sleeping here, right by my side
And in her right hand, a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride

&quot;All men are false,&quot; said my mother
&quot;They’ll tell you wicked, loving lies
And the very next evening, they'll court another
Leave you alone to pine and sigh&quot;

My daddy, he's a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long
And on every link, a heart does dangle
Of another maid he's loved and wronged

So court another tender maiden
And hope that she will be your wife
For I have been warned and I've decided
To sleep alone all of my life

Lyrics

Wanderers this morning came by
Where did they go, graceful in the morning light?
To banner fair, to follow you softly
In the cold mountain air

Through the forest, down to your grave
Where the birds wait, and the tall grasses wave
They do not know you anymore, more, more, more

Dear shadow alive and well
How can the body die?
You tell me everything
Anything true

Into town one morning I went
Staggering through premonitions of my death
I don't see anybody that dear to me

Dear shadow alive and well
How can the body die?
You tell me everything
Anything true

Jesse
I don't know what I have done
I'm turning myself to a demon
I don't know what I have done
I'm turning myself to a demon

Lyrics

For Richard Swift
For John and Bill
For every gift lifted far before its will
Judee and Smith
For Berman too
I've met the myth hanging heavy over you
I loved you long
You rose to go
Beneath you, songs, perfect angels in the snow
So time to stage
Forget reserve
The type of great coronation you deserve

I'm going out for a weekend
I'm gonna borrow a Martin or Gibson
With Either/Or and The Hex for my Bookends
Carrying every text that you've given

I'm gonna swim for a week in
Warm American Water with dear friends
Swimming high on a lea in an Eden
Running all of the leads you've been leaving

I'm overmatched (For Arthur Russell)
I'm half as wise (Duncan and Curtis)
If this is flat, brother, I apologize (Jimi and David, for Nick and Otis)
No one alone (For Bell and Buckley)
Can leave the cave (Marvin and Adam)
And all you've loaned won't be kept inside a grave (For Arthur Russell, for Arthur Russell)

I'm gonna swim for a week in
Warm American Water with dear friends
Just intending that I would delight them
Swimming high on a lea in an Eden

So I dream, dream
So I dream, dream

I'm gonna swim for a week in
Warm American Water with dear friends
Swimming high on a lea in an Eden
Running all of the leads you've been leaving

And in your rarified air I feel sunblind
I'm looking up at you there high in my mind
Only way that I made it for a long time
But I'm loud and alive, singing you all night, night

Lyrics

[January 20th, 2017]

How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

Who knows what State is in store?
If they all turn, will you run?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

When I need to, I'll keep time on you

[Wide / white] oceans roar
A frightened fool stokes
[Heedless/heatless] fire

But if you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

Lyrics

Summer all over
Blame it on timing
Weakening August water
Loose-eyed in morning
Sunlight covered over
Wading in sight of fire

And we're finally aligning
More than maybe I can choose

Soon as I knew you
All so wide open
Wading inside of fire
As if I just saw you
Cross Second Avenue
Wading in waist-high water

And I love you so violent
More than maybe I can do

Now we're finally aligning
More than maybe I can choose

Lyrics

Blood of my blood
Skin of my skin
You're in roundelay water again
I want to face the condition you're in
The old wrenches hardly turn me
Can you catch a thrown line?
Tied around neat
Circle once about, please allow me
I see the pall coming off of our cheeks
We're weak but a leaf is turning

And I move lightly in the dawn
Try to, lightly ever on the lee

Though I liked summer light on you
If we ride a winter-long wind
Well time's not what I belong to
And I'm not the season I'm in

Holding on close
Holding on to
Any kind of ring I can bring you
And at the beachwood pyre good news
It's wet but it's catching easy

And I move slightly in the dawn
Try to, gently ever on the lee

Though I liked summer light on you
If we ride a winter-long wind
Well time's not what I belong to
And you're not the season you're in
