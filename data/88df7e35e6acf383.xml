            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?

Adam Gołębiewski describes how he has extended the drum kit to include mysterious and unusual objects; outlines the pleasures and difficulties of collaboration; and reflects on his recent performance at The Oratory Abbotsford Convent for Liquid Architecture’s Ritual Community Music series.

Adam Gołębiewski is an experimental musician, composer and musicologist who uses drums and self-made objects to explore the basic characteristics of sound: volume, timbre, register and time, as well as their relationship to the performer’s body.

            <itunes:subtitle>Audible Edge</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Thinking and listening to place emerges as a thematic of 'Where and How to Gather' - a collection of texts published on Disclaimer and edited by Josten Myburgh. These works consider technology and humanity as being in the world, rather than as tacet mediators or observers of it, with the writing investigating the processes by which meditation is obscured, or how presence is made difficult.

Aisyah Aaqil Sumito and Noémie Cecilia Huttner-Koros talk through the ideas and processes behind their respective pieces, ‘The sound of my own voice butchering transliterated quaranic arabic’ and ‘What are the things that climate can’t change’.

            <itunes:subtitle>Machine Listening</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Alex Ahmed talks to artist Sean Dockray, legal scholar James Parker, and curator Joel Stern about Project Spectra, an online, community-based, free and open source software application for transgender voice training. We discuss speech pathology and the politics of pitch, along with the importance of grass-roots led tech projects and community-centred design.

Our devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. It demands critical and artistic attention.

            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?

Alexandra Spence expands on her relationship to objects and how she translates their textures and histories into sound; the development of her practice and its relation to landscape; and shares reflections on her new album Blue waves, Green waves.

Alexandra Spence is a sound artist and musician attempting to reimagine the intricate relationships between the listener, the object, and the surrounding environment. Her aesthetic favours field recordings, analogue technologies and object interventions. She holds the belief that electricity might actually be magic.

            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages? Across two nights, Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week present a program of electronic music genealogies, featuring artists whose works span the 1970s to today and represent multiple generations of Melbourne’s experimental scene.

Alsi is a sound artist and musician drawing heavily from bass music continuums and occasionally drifting towards sound collage and ambient spaces. Ahead of her performance for Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week, Alsi discusses working with machines to create rhythmic dialogues, the differences in approaches and personas when making music in collaboration and solo, and the communities that allowed for her initial experimentations with noise.

            <itunes:subtitle>Histories and Theories of Sound</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>As a material index of acoustic activity, the term ‘sound fossil’ has gained currency in the fields of paleosonics and contemporary art both as a means of accounting for the appearance of the past in the present, and as an embodiment of cosmic time. Drawing upon audible and not so audible projects, art historian Amelia Barikin presents her lecture: Sound Fossils and Arche-Fossils: Towards a mineral ontology of contemporary art.

            <itunes:summary>As part of the exhibition Site &amp; Sound: Sonic art as ecological practice at McClelland Sculpture Park and Gallery, Liquid Architecture was invited to stage a project critically responding to themes of sonic art, acoustic ecology, field recording, deep listening, and spatial sound, all understood in the context of profound environmental crisis and instability.

A Hanley’s practice is interested in listening as an affective practice and the possibilities of sound as an expression of human and non-human exchange. This comes through in their piece SUNKLAND.XYZ, in which field recordings of the Carrum Carrum Swamp and surrounding areas of the McClelland site uncover the history of the movement of water.

            <itunes:summary>The dissonance of democracy; sum of an irreducibly complex combination of notes. We attune, celebrate, make difference audible, amplify disobedience, choreograph dissonance, enact alternative rituals and harmonies, open new horizons of possibility. 

Today on the podcast we revisit Mono-Poly-June with a Japanese ghost story told by Amy May Stuart, a performance of improvised violin by Lily Tait, and a selection of poems from Ender Başkan.

Live on air, online and irl a program of live performances, radio plays, spoken words, archive recordings, and meta-mixes was broadcast in collaboration with Crawl Space Radio, an artist-led experiment in techno-institutional broadcasting from Samm Sutton and Lucy Dodd.

            <itunes:summary>Our devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. It demands critical and artistic attention.
André Dao talks to artist Sean Dockray, legal scholar James Parker, and curator Joel Stern about UN Global Pulse, the UN’s big data initiative, and in particular one program which “uses machine Learning to analyse radio content in Uganda”. They discuss the increasing entanglements of big tech, the UN and human rights discourse more broadly, as well as an emergent “right to be counted”.

            <itunes:summary>Angie Abdilla talks to artist Sean Dockray, legal scholar James Parker, and curator Joel Stern about Old Ways, New, the Indigenous owned and led social enterprise she founded, based on Gadigal land in Redfern, Sydney. We discuss Decolonising the Digital, Country Centered Design, a methodology which applies Indigenous design principles to the development of technologies for places, spaces and experiences, and how this contrasts with the ‘placelessness’ on which so many machine learning/listening systems are based.

            <itunes:summary>Listening to the Anthropocene: Sound and ecological crisis explores imaginations of the natural world at a time of accelerating global environmental crisis; in an era currently being defined as the Anthropocene. Mapping out a range of eco-acoustic practices from field recordings to data and geo-sonifications, Anja Kanngieser investigates how such practices seek to delineate, highlight, and/ or overcome, distinctions between natural and social, urban and rural, exceptional and everyday.

            <itunes:summary>Since 1982, Anna Homler has incanted the character of Bread woman - an ancient storyteller housed in bread that emerged out of the downtown Los Angeles performance art scene. Kneading language into music; toys into instruments, Homler’s vocal, visual and performance practice explores alternative means of communication and the poetics of ordinary things. This performance with special guests Samuel Karmel and Lilian Steiner was recorded at M Pavillion on the 28th of January 2018.

            <itunes:summary>An earhole is an open meatus into the body, through which sonic subjectivities are digested and recomposed. Sound and vibration leak in and out from all orifices, connecting and entangling in the folds of bodies, disturbing those boundaries.

Today on the podcast Archie Barry and V Barratt join Frances Barrett and Debris Facility for a conversation that dissects their performances for  Object Oriented Ontology, a performance program for 'Meatus’ at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art.

Object Oriented Ontology focuses on fleshy void spaces, rather than materialist objects, moving with queer dis/embodiements; worm as method, digestion and intimacy; and a haptic force of the guttural. The performances respond to the conceptual and spatial prompts in France Barrett’s exhibition Meatus

An Object Oriented Ontology digital collection – Worm (w)hole:
Orifice Oriented Ontologies – is published in Liquid Architecture’s online journal Disclaimer with works from the performing artists Sage Pbbt, Allison Gibbs, Archie Barry and V Barrett alongside Ander Rennick, Ivan Cheng, Jared Davis and Frances Barrett: https://disclaimer.org.au/contents/orifice-oriented-ontologies

            <itunes:summary>Armour Group are experimental, atmospheric and conceptual, their music rooted in the traditions of the power electronics/death industrial genre. Through their use of extreme minimal electronics accented by samples drawn from cult cinema, broadly referencing serial killings, murder, disaster, misanthropy, immoral acts, relationships, love and betrayal, they aim beyond brutality to incite feelings of euphoria and affirmation, as well as evoking the impending demise of our current culture and natural surroundings.

            <itunes:summary>Revisiting the first Ritual Community Music event of 2020, Vienna-based, post-classical noise artist Battle-ax performed between Eartheater and V for a night of subversive beauty.

With her viola, Battle-ax fills the room with relentless chains of reverb and distortion, generating a strong and emotional soundscape. Her sound attributes itself to the richness of late romanticism, clipped by the emergence of atonalism in all its immediacy and resolve.

This performance was recorded at Colour Club on the 19th of January 2020.

            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?

Bhairavi Raman reflects on her early love for the violin, the questions that push her musical practice to new parameters, and expands on her inquiries into the space between Western and Carnatic classical music.

Bhairavi Raman is an Indian-Australian violinist, classically trained in Western and Carnatic forms. She merges concepts and techniques to express her bicultural identity, representing a formidable blend of traditional knowledge honed in India, technical mastery, musical boldness and an authentically Melbournian voice.

            <itunes:summary>Artist and organiser Bridget Chappell talks through the experiments, research, and activities that have formed their exhibition No Comment. With particular attention paid toward their investigations into the science of phase-cancellation as bringing forward an acoustic insurrection through “phase-canceling the cops”, Chappell presents anti-police sound technologies through material research together with theoretical articulations of ungovernable space, tactical defence and silence as a means of political enunciation.

            <itunes:subtitle></itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>How can we wrap our heads around the inevitability of planetary and civilisational collapse? What can the history of experimental electronic music and the fate of an extinct alien species teach us about living with chaos and destruction? 

Bringing together performative musicology and electronic music synthesis, Ryan addresses a pressing feeling that structures our age: the existential terror many of us feel when we contemplate how human-made climate change is transforming the regular cycles of life on our planet, rendering a familiar world unfamiliar.

Catherine Ryan expands on the converging influences that informed Krell and the Destruction of Worlds, how humour can open up conversations around confronting topics, and the possibilities that emerge through the multidisciplinary structure of performance lectures.

This episode features music by Bebe and Louis Barron from the film Forbidden Planet and Catherine Ryan.

            <itunes:author>Liquid Architecture</itunes:author>
            <itunes:subtitle>Artist Profile</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>In September and October 2016 the Chilean artist and poet Cecilia Vicuña visited Australia for a series of performances, readings, interviews and collaborations. Cecilia had been invited, on behalf of Liquid Architecture, by fellow Chilean artist and curator Camila Marambio. 
Listening With Fingers, published on Disclaimer, brings together a material archive of Cecilia’s activities in Australia. Documentation, recordings, transcripts, and interviews are collected alongside a new recording of the artist reading poems, sent via voice message to the editors in late 2020. 

Presented here are excerpts from this collection including moments from Cecilia and Camila’s performance in an abandoned limestone quarry in Queenstown, Tasmania intersected with extracts from an Interview with Miyuki Jokiranta for Unconformist Radio. We then hear moments of conversation between Cecilia and editor Autumn Royal in which Cecilia speaks to the importance of oral culture, the under valuing of her work in the past, and her friendship with Leonora Carrington. Following this is a segment of Vicuna’s performance for Liquid Architecture’s project Why Listen to Animals? in which she presented a set of ten ‘answers’ sung-spoken in the form of a poetic decalogue with collaborators Bryan Phillips, Sarita Gálvez and Camila Marambio. Closing this sampler is a reading of the poem Word and Thread from Vicuña’s appearance on the radio program Parallel Lines hosted by Sara Savage on Triple R.

            <itunes:summary>Over the last two decades, Clare Cooper has brought together thousands of people to collaborate on community initiatives, creative approaches to governance, collaborative composition, speculative design, and critical listening.

Here, in line with Jim Denley’s profile on Clare, published on Disclaimer, Clare talks through memories of sound and listening, the beginnings of playing the harp and guzheng, futuring, and the multitude of organising and improvising that has been present throughout her career. Spanning disciplines, countries and communities, Clare’s work is rooted in the sociability of improvisation and it’s capacity to encourage compassion and radical acts of trust.

            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?

Rare performances from CS + Kreme, Maria Moles and efp will reignite our Ritual Community Music series for 2022. Circling bodies, hallucinatory sounds and luxury systems will take place at the Meat Market Pavilion on the 11th of February. 

CS + Kreme is Conrad Standish and Sam Karmel’s deeply romantic and stealthily addictive music characterised by heavy dub processing and sweeping patterns of melody and noise.  Anchored by Standish’s dexterous bass and Karmel’s skewiff electronics they record slow, hallucinatory experimental music. Ahead of their performance for Liquid Architecture, Sam Karmel talks through how the duo started  working together, how they use improvisation and slowness in their music, and what to expect from their live performance.

Daniel Jenatsch talks through the expansion of his universe ‘The Close World’; the affects of working with the program GPT-3 to generate dialogue; and his relationship to science fiction.

Daniel Jenatsch combines hyper-detailed soundscapes, music and video to create multimedia documentaries, installations, radio pieces, and performances. Reaching back into the research of a now little known Professor William A. (Bill) Martin, a computer scientist who worked on early natural language processing at MIT in the 1970s called OWL (One World Language), Daniel Jenatsch has expanded his universe of The Close World. OWL was based on the philosopher Wittgenstein’s theory of knowledge that the meaning of any concept in language is linked to the totality of all other concepts. A singular and mysterious figure in computer programming, Jenatsch reformulates some of Martin’s methods, presenting a creative fiction about Martin as a traveller between this world and the establishment of OWL, and The Close World. Written in collaboration with an AI trained by Jenatsch, the methods of production of this work become a form of time travel, blurring artistic, scientific, artificial and historical voices.

            <itunes:summary>Del Lumanta is an artist, musician, DJ, educator and organiser living and working on Eora Country. Their expansive practice moves between genres and mediums, explored under pseudonyms and collaborative projects. 

Fellow DIY and experimental musician Emma Ramsay takes a deep dive into the internal and lateral workings of Del Lumanta's sonic practice in Out of Field: The Sonic Practice of Del Lumanta published on LA’s online journal Disclaimer. Ramsay's profile traces Lumanta’s experimental roots within Sydney's community radio and DIY communities and underscores the way in which their incessant development of band projects and collaborations provides a freedom of movement in process and approach, to discard and pick up new creative processes at whim.

Today on the podcast, Del Lumanta talks through how field recordings became a part of their music production, the affect of performance contexts within both institutions and the diy scene, and their work within community projects such as New Age Noise and Radio Skid Row.

            <itunes:summary>Douglas Kahn presents his lecture, Sound Matters: One Energy Among Others. Based on his most recent book, Earth Sound Earth Signal: Energies and Earth Magnitude in the Arts, Kahn reworks the histories of science, communications, music and the arts to account for the incursion of electromagnetism into culture from the nineteenth century to the present. Investigating the trade between acoustics and electromagnetism in aesthetics and the arts, Kahn poses questions for new approaches in the arts, ecology and media where sound is but one energy among others.

Kahn is a Professor at the National Institute for Experimental Arts (NIEA) at the University of New South Wales and is best known as an historian and theorist of sound and the media arts. When invited to speak, Kahn said: “This is the first time anyone has asked me to talk about my own work. There are three or four decades pent up…”

            <itunes:summary>Transience, improvisation and collaboration form the basis of Dylan Martorell’s music-based art practice. Housed within the conceptual framework of a musical diaspora, his work is drawn to ways in which music travels through space and is affected by changes in geography, climate, culture and materials to become an agent for cross-cultural reciprocation.

Published on Disclaimer are a series of music scores using the growth structures of plants found within the City of Yarra and the City of Moreland. Here, Dylan talks through the processes, techniques and concepts behind these scores that form the basis of a series of sound recordings and interactive walking maps.

            <itunes:summary>Revisiting the first Ritual Community Music event of 2020, we hear a viscerally emotive live performance from Eartheater that closed a night of subversive beauty with Battle-Ax and V. 

Eartheater distills foley-filled digital production, a three-octave vocal range, and classical composition into works suspended between obsessively detailed sonic tapestries and almost recklessly romantic and gestural electronica. 

This performance was recorded at Colour Club on the 19th of January 2020.

            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages? 

Rare performances from CS + Kreme, Maria Moles and efp will reignite our Ritual Community Music series for 2022. Circling bodies, hallucinatory sounds and luxury systems will take place at the Meat Market Pavilion on the 11th of February.

efp is the performance moniker of Yuin artist and musician E Fishpool, whose highly crafted compositions are at once intensely expressive and also beautifully open-ended in their abstraction. Grounded in First Nations oral and sonic pedagogies, and the unbreakable obligation to listen to land and Country, efp’s work communicates across many layers, inviting the listener into complex worlds of sound and knowledge. Ahead of their performance for Liquid Architecture, efp talks through their process of collecting sound, finding rhythm within themself and their environment, and what to expect from their live performance.

            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?

Eva Birch talks through her shift into sound poetry; the parallel influences of Dada and psychoanalysis on her practice; and reflects on her recent performance with J, at The Oratory, Abbotsford Convent for Liquid Architecture’s Ritual Community Music series.

Eva Birch is a poet living in Melbourne on Woiwurrung country. She has published her work in Cordite Poetry Review, Sick Leave, and Un.

            <itunes:summary>Jarrod and Nisa of Fabulous Diamonds talk through how their sound has changed over their two decade collaboration with instrumentation and genre; the influence on line music and techno-feudalism; and their delayed production flow that keeps them moving into new musical territories.

Fabulous Diamonds are the long-running duo of Nisa Venerosa and Jarrod Zlatic producing uneasy and understated chamber songs for the neo-feudal age. While in the past their music has drawn from a wellspring of dubby post-punk and bubblegum-minimalism their current approach takes its cues from twentieth century art song and contemporary sound design; tenor vocals and choralesque keyboards play atop sparse, muffled rhythms and ambiguous soundscapes.

            <itunes:summary>Beirut-based artist Haig Aivazian works in a range of media, including performance, video, sculpture, and installation to unpack the of power and the hidden ideological flows within histories such as music, sports, street lighting, and predictive policing. Based on extensive research, his practice is at once exactingly precise and at the same time is an avalanche of sensory information. In conversation with writer Noah Simblist, Aivazian dissects a selection of his works that revolve around music and its relationship to nationalism and colonialism.

            <itunes:summary>Halcyon Lawrence talks to artist Sean Dockray, legal scholar James Parker, and curator Joel Stern about some of her work on the politics of voice user interfaces: in particular accent bias, ‘Siri discipline’ and the ways in which smart speakers reproduce and hardwire longstanding forms of linguistic imperialism.

Our devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. It demands critical and artistic attention.

Here we hear work from Jessica Feldman, Mattin, and Lee Gamble.

            <itunes:summary>Investigating listening practices and extractive industries in Australia, Quandamooka artist Megan Cope’s ‘Untitled (Death Song)’ comprises of sound sculptures constructed from discarded mining and industrial equipment accompanied by a soundtrack made in collaboration with musician and instrument builder Isha Ram Das. It takes its first note from the haunting cries of the yellow-eyed Bush Stone-curlew, an endangered species within New South Wales known for its distinctive call, a ghost-like “weer-lo” sound.

            <itunes:summary>Jenny Hickinbotham is an artist working across writing, video, sculpture, and songs. Sticks and Stones will break my bones, But Words Can Totally Destroy My Mind! took place at Blindside Gallery for Liquid Architecture’s Sound Series exhibition in April 2022. The exhibition featured a series of experimental song-poems, performed unaccompanied by the artist in her home, in Gisborne, regional Victoria, and presented in video form in collaboration with Joel Stern and Carmen Sibha-Keiso. In these performances Hickinbotham inhabits multiple voices, perspectives and temporalities as she explores the epigenetic impacts of trauma, and the narratives of individuals swept up by the force of history, institutions, and the places in which they live. 

Here, Hickinbotham reflects on the exhibition and performances, the influence of childhood experiences and hearing voices, and the freedom that song writing provided. Throughout this episode Hickinbotham’s songs also feature the musicians Steph Treesea, Mish Szhekelyhidi, James Rushford, and Sam Pankhurst.

            <itunes:summary>Thinking and listening to place emerges as a thematic of Where and how to gather - a collection of texts published on Disclaimer and edited by Josten Myburgh. These works consider technology and humanity as being in the world, rather than as tacet mediators or observers of it, with the writing investigating the processes by which meditation is obscured, or how presence is made difficult.

Jim Denley, as part of the group Sounding Together, and Jasmine Guffond talk through the ideas and processes behind their respective pieces, ‘Meelup (Moonrise), Boranup (Sunrise)’ and ‘Surveillance Lifestyles’.

            <itunes:summary>In Rorschach Audio: Art &amp; Illusion for Sound, British sound artist and writer Joe Banks offers a critical account of Spiritualistic and allegedly supernatural Electronic Voice Phenomena (ghost­voice) recordings, tracing the uncanny phenomena back through the histories of art, literature and the little-known audio monitoring work by UK wartime intelligence agencies. Via a series of fascinating and bizarre psychoacoustic illusions Banks argues that ‘the earliest form of sound recording technology was not a machine but was written language’.

            <itunes:summary>Terms such as “fake news” and “alternative facts” have become common vocabulary in the so-called post-truth era. But there is a sense in which these are just contemporary iterations of a familiar phenomenon: propaganda. Propaganda is not merely concerned with sending messages – its aim is to construct reality as such. In this episode visual artist Jonas Staal elaborates on what he describes as today’s arena of the propaganda (art) struggle.

            <itunes:summary>A Creek Story is a newly commissioned moving image and concrete poetry work by artist Joy Zhou. Collaging text, images, and audio in a series of moving image works and gifs, Zhou builds on their interest in visually and sonically mapping the plurality of encounters one may have with such waterways and creeks on Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung land.

Inspired by the hidden waterway of Williams creek that runs underneath Melbourne’s CBD, Zhou has thought up a fictional story that follows two cities — one above ground, the other buried deep underground — that are connected by The Waltzing Creek.

Joy Zhou talks through their process of active listening to form knowledge; the exploration of the Williams Creek that inspired the fictional narrative of A Creek Story; and the links formed between language, sound and environment as an action to give voice to those often unseen. 

Joy Zhou is a China born emerging artist and design practitioner based in Naarm/. Informed by their background in Interior Design, Joy’s practice entails gestures of queering which unfold encounters and events that draw relationships between people, places, and spaces.

            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages? Across two nights, Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week present a program of electronic music genealogies, featuring artists whose works span the 1970s to today and represent multiple generations of Melbourne’s experimental scene.

Knotting is the collaborative project of electronic artist Matt Sabbadini and experimental vocalist Georgia Gamper. Born of an urge to explore the contrasts and similarities of both artist’s music, the duo create works of manipulated voice complemented by electro-acoustics and synthesis.

            <itunes:summary>How can sound and listening be mobilised for understanding questions of power, capture, and extraction under networked capitalism and data colonialism?

Capture All is a multiyear collaboration between Liquid Architecture and Sarai, featuring artists, scholars, and writers based in India and Australia contributing to a series of critical intensives and dialogues, public programs and publications.

Capture All curator Laura McLean and artists, Suvani Suri, Thomas Smith, Aasma Tulika, and Shareeka Helaluddin talk through the works developed through Capture All in relation to cross-cultural exchange, scale, and technologies as well as reflecting on the shared experience and learnings that took place.

This project is contextualised by Sarai’s pioneering work on media and information, urbanism, infrastructure, media archaeology, data and law, the commons, and the public domain in South Asia, and in Liquid Architecture’s ongoing research projects, including ‘Machine Listening’, a constantly evolving platform investigating the effects of algorithmic, machinic, networked and technologised listening on our social and political lives.

Led by research curators Laura McLean (Liquid Architecture) and Mehak Sawhney (Sarai), Capture All considers Australia and India’s complex relationships to coloniality and extraction across physical and digital spaces. 

A Capture All digital collection has been published in Liquid Architecture’s online journal Disclaimer featuring works from Tom Smith, Shareeka Helaluddin, Uzma Falak, Aasma Tulika, and Suvani Suri.

            <itunes:summary>Lauren Lee McCarthy talks to artist Sean Dockray, legal scholar James Parker, and curator Joel Stern about some of her many works concerned with smart speakers, machine listening and social relationships in the midst of surveillance, automation, and algorithmic living. They discuss: LAUREN, for which she attempted to become a human version of Alexa, SOMEONE, which won her the Prix Ars Electronica 2020 / Interactive Art +, and a range of related works and political questions.

Our devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. It demands critical and artistic attention.

            <itunes:summary>Luciano Chessa examines the work of Italian Futurist, painter and musician Luigi Russolo, presenting a reading of the mechanical sound synthesizers, the intonarumori, that he began to create in 1913. It traces the roots of Russolo’s instrument to Leonardo da Vinci’s noisemakers, and then reestablishes the previously unacknowledged prominence of occultism, including theosophy, in early twentieth-century Italian culture.

            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?

Rare performances from CS + Kreme, Maria Moles and efp will reignite our Ritual Community Music series for 2022. Circling bodies, hallucinatory sounds and luxury systems will take place at the Meat Market Pavilion on the 11th of February. 

Maria Moles uses drums, percussion, electronics and everyday objects to weave hypnotic, layered webs of sound that pulse freely while slowly transforming with subtle textures and movements. One of the finest and most imaginative musicians in the Melbourne experimental scene, Moles has performed everywhere and with everyone, but it is her solo performances that are, arguably, the most powerful expression of her work. Ahead of her performance for Liquid Architecture Maria talks through the influence of Kulintang music on her album For Leolanda, how she blends live drums with electronics, and what to expect from her live performance.

            <itunes:summary>Mark Andrejevic’s recent book Automated Media considers the politics of automation through the “cascading logics” of pre-emption, operationalism, and “framelessness”. Together with artist Sean Dockray, legal scholar James Parker, and curator Joel Stern, Mark talks through some of these ideas, along with the limits of “surveillance capitalism” as an analytic frame, “touchlessness” in the time of Covid, “operational listening”, what automation is doing to subjectivity… and how all this relates to reality TV.

            <itunes:summary>Thinking and listening to place emerges as a thematic of Where and how to gather - a collection of texts published on Disclaimer and edited by Josten Myburgh. These works consider technology and humanity as being in the world, rather than as tacet mediators or observers of it, with the writing investigating the processes by which meditation is obscured, or how presence is made difficult.

Michael Terren and Joee Mejias talk through the ideas and processes behind their respective pieces, ‘The Hegemony of the DAW’ and ‘1111 Typhoon’.

            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?

Mirasia and Kuya Neil talk through the cross over of influences that led them to collaborating, the practice of sampling and how that impacts genre, and their involvement in community music groups such as The House of Silky and Sound School.

Exploring the depths between music, dance and community, Mirasia is well regarded as an artist and community leader. Kuya Neil is a heavyweight of Melbourne’s underground hip-hop scene who’s production style blurs the lines of contemporary club and electronic music.

            <itunes:summary>As Puce Mary, the Danish artist Frederikke Hoffmeier tests the established limits of noise music through sustained experimentation and risk driven by emotive gusto. Puce Mary’s music is harsh, but its aggression is necessary. Her performances are easy to be dragged into but brutally hard to get out of. The underhand of control as censurable nurture—this dialectic is a perennial tonic in sound. Dominance against submission. Artist against audience. Both take turns dealing blows.

            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?

Today on the podcast Raja Kirik talks through the origins of their collaboration, the practice of bringing traditional Jaranan trance dance into a modern context, and their way of embodying music.

Raja Kirik is a venture through trance dances from east and central Java, Indonesia. Hand built instruments fuse with high energy programmed sounds, producing hammering, transcendental walls of rhythm and texture. With frantic, seemingly endless forward momentum, the music of Raja Kirik inhabits a wide emotional breadth, cycling from disappointment to anger to loneliness.

On Friday the 10th of June, Raja Kirik will play live at The Toff alongside Rama Parwata, Female Wizard and special guests for Liquid Architecture's Ritual Community Music series.

Rama Parwata is a Naarm/Melbourne-based musician, composer, and curator who has a distinguished reputation for his audacious and technical aural explorations in sound, texture and rhythm on the drum-kit.

Female Wizard’s reach is far and wide, working across choreography, dance, djing, event management and her unique take on electronic music. Exploring the weirder sides of techno, industrial, and IDM, Female Wizard creates a new collective transcendence through powerful sonic immersion.

            <itunes:summary>English singer and guitarist Richard Dawson is a skewed troubadour at once charming and abrasive. His shambolically virtuosic guitar playing stumbles from music-hall tune-smithery to spidery swatches of noise-colour, swathed in amp static and teetering on the edge of feedback. His songs are both chucklesome and tragic, rooted in a febrile imagination that references worlds held dear and worlds unknown.

            <itunes:subtitle>Histories and Theories of Sound</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Seth Kim-Cohen places rock and roll next to conceptual art, poststructualism and politics, foregrounding it as an active participant in a wider social conversation. Focusing on 1965 to 1985, rock and roll is no longer just a soundtrack to a generation but is equally responsible for greater transformations of the time.
Seth Kim-Cohen is an artist, musician, and writer who makes as little distinction between these categories as he can get away with.

            <itunes:summary>Our devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. It demands critical and artistic attention.
Leading off from Shannon Mattern’s essay “Urban Auscultation; or, Perceiving the Action of the Heart”, which addresses machine listening in the pandemic, artist Sean Dockray, legal scholar James Parker, and curator Joel Stern discuss with Shannon the stethoscope, the decibel and other histories of machine listening, along with its epistemic and political dimensions and artistic deployments.

In this lecture Sheridan Palmer considers problems of inclusion and exclusion and why a talented artist like Tony Woods became peripheral. Palmer is an art historian, curator and biographer, who has published extensively in art and literary journals.

Across two nights, Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week present a program of electronic music genealogies, featuring artists whose works span the 1970s to today and represent multiple generations of Melbourne’s experimental scene.

Tangerine is the project from musician Clementine Girard-Foley. Stepping away from the rigidity of her training as a classical pianist, Tangerine produces textural, bouncing compositions with precise clarity.
Ahead of her performance, Clementine discusses what to expect from her live set, the communities that formed her approaches to music making, and the duality of the piano and synthesiser.

Todd Anderson-Kunert is an artist working with sound to explore themes of psychological and emotional human existence. His work attempts to communicate emotions, experiences, and situations that words can often fail to describe. Ahead of his performance for Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week Todd discusses the freedom and creative limitations that mono-synthesis allows, the possibilities for spatial and temporal emotional responses through live performance, and his documentary, A Conversational Exploration of Sonic Practice, that reveals the immense learning that emerges from community conversations.

            <itunes:summary>TERRA: Memory &amp; Soil is a collaboration between Victoria Pham and Joel Spring that transforms West Space gallery into an immersive garden by  combining sound, biological-sculpture, architecture and projection. The project interrogates how we remember our past landscapes, bringing vastly different insights into notions of the built environment, history and legacies of colonialism.

Archeologist and composer Victoria Pham talks through the elements that make up TERRA; the practice of archeo-acoustics; and the mission of placing indigenous knowledge at the centre of knowledge production, cultural exchange and story-telling. 

Victoria Pham is an Australian installation artist, composer, archaeologist and evolutionary biologist. She is a current PhD candidate for Biological Anthropology at the University of Cambridge where she seeks to expand her interdisciplinary work into a broader exploration of acoustic perception as a basis into modes of bio-acoustic material development and construction. Her artistic and musical work is driven by explorations into the sonic connections between second-hand memory, examining modes of decolonisation, communal story-telling, intertwining electronic sound with acoustic instrumentation, and ecological expressions of construction

            <itunes:author>Liquid Architecture</itunes:author>
            <itunes:subtitle>Ritual Community Music</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?

YL Hooi talks through the convergence of genres that influence her sound, her collaborative relationship with Tarquin Manek and how her songs have evolved over time.

YL Hooi is the project of Valya Ying-Li Hooi, inhabiting a subtle and mysterious realm of furtive, dubbed-out song, sparse electronic percussion, and distant winds. Moving seamlessly from angelic song to gritty tape gunk, Hooi’s work opens onto a multitude of genres and directions while retaining a distinctly personal stamp through her obsessively zoned-out dub production tactics.
