Sheen Fellow of Popular Culture at the Word on Fire Institute, also a former Episcopal priest who converted to Catholicism.</p> <p>Andrew takes you inside several important texts that express how the Church thinks about Protestants and explain how they belong with us in the Catholic Church. You’ll look at works by St. John Henry Newman, Pope Pius IX, the Second Vatican Council, and Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.</p> <p>In this first lesson of the course, Andrew shares a little about his personal journey and encourages Catholics to support any Protestant friends or family members who may be discerning coming into full communion with the Catholic Church. He also draws on the particular experience of St. John Henry Newman. Andrew sees Newman as a role model for all our Protestant brothers and sisters who are considering making this step.</p> <p>To watch the other lessons in this course, sign up for the <a href="https://wordonfire.institute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Word on Fire Institute</a> today!</p> <h2 id="h-links"><strong>Links</strong></h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://wordonfire.institute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Word on Fire Institute</a></strong></li> </ul>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Friends, today we share a talk I recently gave to the service men and women at the United State Air Force Academy.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Friends, I recently had the privilege of speaking with Fr. Mike Schmitz, host of the popular “Bible in a Year” podcast.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In today’s episode, Bishop Barron fields questions from people all over the world, including:</p> <ul> <li>How do we reconcile love as willing the good of the other with more exclusive love, such as the love between a husband and wife?</li> <li>Some Protestant theologians say that John 6 is not talking about transubstantiation because this dialogue took place before the institution of the Eucharist. What do you think?</li> <li>What does the Catholic Church say about predestination and free will?</li> <li>Why does God need to be worshipped and glorified, and need sacrifices? On human terms, this sounds like his love is conditional and he is insecure.</li> <li>Can dogma be changed or overthrown?</li> <li>Was Jesus a socialist?</li> <li>What are the essential qualities/qualifications needed for evangelism?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What do we mean by religious liberty? Why should all people, including non-religious people, care about protecting religious liberty?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>At Mundelein Seminary you'll find a statue of St. George slaying a dragon below which reads, "Athleta Christi Nobilis" —The Noble Athlete of Christ.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today (September 18), Bishop Barron will be speaking to Facebook employees at their headquarters in Menlo Park, CA, on "How to Have a Religious Argument." (The talk will be livestreamed on <a href="http://facebook.com/bishoprobertbarron">Bishop Barron's Facebook page</a> from 6:00pm-7:00pm ET.)</p> <p>Every day, millions of people argue about religion on social media. The comboxes of religious and atheist sites are among the most visited and the most heated in the virtual space.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v16Alm20K0o">The Case for Christ</a></em> is a film adaptation of Lee Strobel’s best-selling book of the same name, one that has made an enormous splash in Evangelical circles and beyond. It is the true story of a young, ambitious (and atheist) reporter for the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, who fell into a psychological and spiritual crisis when his wife became a Christian. In an attempt to bring his wife back to atheism, Lee used his considerable analytical and investigative skills to debunk the resurrection of Jesus. If Jesus didn’t rise, Strobel realizes, all of Christianity crumbles like a house of cards. In this episode, Bishop Robert Barron walks alongside Strobel through many of the common claims against the Resurrection of Jesus and explains why each lacks credibility in the face of real historical evidence.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Truth, beauty, and goodness are the three transcendentals that draw people to belief in God.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Is it ever necessary to label ourselves? Is it ever ok to label anyone else? Not according to internet celebrity and spoken-word poet, Prince Ea, whose viral video entitled "I Am Not Black, You Are Not White" claims that labels are the root of all social ills and that our identity is entirely separate from our physical reality. The video has reached over 100 million views on Facebook and over 11 million views on Youtube with an overwhelming approval rating (300 to 1 like to dislike ratio). The most liked comment on Youtube reads, "They showed this to us in school."

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On the first day of the calendar year, the Church celebrates The Solemnity of Mary, the Holy Mother of God.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>St. Luke’s telling of the Christmas story, which is read at Midnight Masses all over the Catholic world, commences by invoking the first-century’s most powerful man: “In those days Caesar Augustus published a decree ordering a census of the whole world.” Then the story continues by introducing a new King, one born in straw poverty, wrapped in swaddling clothes and placed in a feeding trough. This is the poetry by which God enters into our world, not as a tyrant surrounded by powers of earthly violence but as a fragile baby surrounded by an army of heavenly angels set to usher him to the cross.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bishop Robert Barron recently had the privilege of speaking to around nine thousand students from the Catholic middle schools and high schools of the Los Angeles Archdiocese. Encouraged by their enthusiasm, he invited them to internalize three spiritual truths as they come of age.

			<title>WOF 045: Why Young People are Leaving the Church</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>After perusing <a href= "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/24/why-americas-nones-left-religion-behind/"> the latest Pew Study</a> on why young people are leaving the active practice of Christianity, Bishop Barron noticed that (once again) the reasons they offer for abandoning Christianity are entirely not compelling. That is to say, any theologian, apologist, or evangelist worth his salt should be able easily to answer these objections to faith and hopefully encourage the youngster to reconsider the Truth of the Church.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We are taking the next few episodes of the show to discuss each of the great men and women featured in Word on Fire's epic new film series, <em>CATHOLICISM: The Pivotal Players</em>.

With this goal in mind, Bishop Barron leads listeners down five different avenues of prayer that range from informal dialogue to the mass itself.

A listener asks whether, according to Thomas Aquinas, God loves everyone the same or has a special hatred for sinners.</p> <p><em>NOTE: Click here to <a href= "https://www.wordonfire.org/catholicism-the-pivotal-players/">donate to our new Pivotal Players series</a> and receive your free gifts!</em></p> Topics Discussed <ul> <li>0:26  - Bishop Barron's new film series, <em><a href= "https://www.wordonfire.org/catholicism-the-pivotal-players/">CATHOLICISM: The Pivotal Players</a></em></li> <li>1:34 - What does "beatitude" mean?</li> <li>4:35 - How the beatitudes of Jesus are different than other religious teachings</li> <li>6:25 - How can the "poor in spirit" be blessed?</li> <li>7:32 - How will those who mourn be comforted?</li> <li>9:15 - The future promise of comfort for those who mourn</li> <li>10:06 - What does it mean to be "meek"?</li> <li>11:21 - How will the meek "inherit the land"?</li> <li>12:12 -  How God satisfied those who "hunger and thirst for righteousness"</li> <li>13:49 - What "blessed are the merciful" means</li> <li>15:09 - How the mercy we express is tied to the mercy we receive</li> <li>16:55 - How do we become "clean of heart"?</li> <li>18:39 - Pornography and the "clean of heart"</li> <li>19:37 - Why peacemakers will become children of God</li> <li>20:55 - Cardinal George and the eschatological dimension of peacemaking</li> <li>22:51 - Why religious persecution can be a form of blessing</li> <li>25:27 - Question from listener: Does God love everyone the same or hate sinners?</li> </ul> Bonus Resources <ul> <li>DVD <ul> <li><a href= "http://www.wordonfire.org/resources/dvd/catholicism-series-individual-discs/4419/"> <em>CATHOLICISM</em> series, Episode 2 - "Happy Are We: The Teachings of Jesus"</a> (Bishop Barron)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Books <ul> <li><em><a href= "http://www.wordonfire.org/resources/book/catholicism-a-journey-to-the-heart-of-the-faith/2370/"> Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith</a></em> (Bishop Barron)</li> <li><em><a href= "http://www.wordonfire.org/resources/book/and-now-i-see-a-theology-of-transformation/2368/"> And Now I See: A Theology of Transformation</a></em> (Bishop Barron)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Homily <ul> <li><a href= "http://www.wordonfire.org/resources/homily/the-beatitudes-a-spiritual-program/658/"> The Beatitudes: A Spiritual Program</a> (Bishop Barron)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Find bonus links and resources for this episode at <a href= "http://wordonfireshow.com/">http://WordOnFireShow.com</a> and be sure to submit your questions at <a href= "http://askbishopbarron.com/">http://As</a><a href= "http://askbishopbarron.com/">kBishopBarron</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As Bishop Barron shows in his new book, <em><a href=

celebrates the union of contraries—grace and nature, faith and
reason, Scripture and tradition, body and soul—in a way that the
full energy of each opposing element remains in place. In this
episode, Bishop Barron explores several examples of this
both/and embrace. A listener asks about the difficult passage in
Acts 5 involving Ananias and Sapphira.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Baker Academic released a new hardcover edition of Bishop Barron's book, <em><a href="http://WordOnFire.org/priority">The Priority of Christ: Toward a Postliberal Catholicism</a></em>. Bishop Barron discusses the book's main ideas including the problem with liberalism, how Jesus Christ is the proper foundation of knowledge and ethics, and how the saints unveil the good life.
