			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery is joined by Patrick McGuire and Matt Borders of "The History Things Podcast" for the first fictional battle episode in a long time; Avery, Pat & Matt tackle perhaps one of the most monumental battles in all of fantasy literature. From the pages and scenes of "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King", the guys travel to Middle Earth to discuss the Battle of Pelenor Fields aka Minas Tirith, which was one of the final climactic battles of the infamous War of the One Ring. Using mostly their experiences from viewing the film and some material from the book (don't get your hopes up, none of them have read it), the trio walk through the fight and banter about some of the key players such as Aragorn, Gandalf, Faramir, Theoden, Eowyn and even Lord Denethor. Strap in for a hilarious ride into the Pelenor Fields! Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by recurring guest host and Civil War historian Ryan Quint to discuss the 160th anniversary of one of the bloodiest battles from the American Civil War; a battle that set the tone for how horrific the battles would become for the rest of the conflict. Along the west banks of the Tennessee River, the Confederate Army of Mississippi under General Albert Sidney Johnston attacked the U.S. Army of the Tennessee under Major General Ulysses S. Grant while they were encamped in the woods around Pittsburg Landing. The two-day engagement fought on April 6-7, 1862 would become better known by the name of a small, wooden Methodist church on site, which translated to "Place of Peace" in Hebrew. The guys discuss the battle and its far-reaching consequences not only on the war itself, but in the larger context of Civil War memory. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this solo episode of Battles & Banter, Avery takes on one of the most important engagements to come out of the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. Fought on March 7-8, 1862, the Battle of Pea Ridge would end in a major Union victory that would secure the border state of Missouri as a bastion for Federal forces against Confederates in the area for the rest of the war. Avery would also like to take this time to send kind regards to any listeners in Ukraine who are living through the current conflict. We here at Battles & Banter Podcast stand with Ukraine and will be covering the conflict at a later date to be decided. In the meantime, enjoy this episode on the 160th Anniversary of Pea Ridge!</p>]]></description>

In the midst of a rainy, cold and snowy winter, U.S. General Ulysses S. Grant launched an ambitious campaign to open Tennessee to Federal invasion by capturing two forts on the Tennessee & Cumberland Rivers. Coordinating with U.S. "brown-water navies", Grant's plan was a smashing success and the joint victories at Forts Henry & Donelson made him a national hero, especially in the eyes of President Abraham Lincoln. The guys discuss the major significances of the campaign and how it impacted how the rest of the way played out from there. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On the first Battles & Banter episode of 2022, Avery takes a solo look at one of the more overlooked and significant U.S. victories from the American Civil War: The Battle of Mill Springs. Also known as the Battle of Logan's Crossroads, the engagement that took place in southeastern Kentucky on that rainy day of January 19th, 1862, marked the first major land victory for the North. Not only did it put General George H. Thomas on the map as a reliable U.S. commander, but it opened the gates for the Federal forces to invade Tennessee and led to the more famous battles of Forts Henry and Donelson a few weeks later. Join Avery as he summarizes the battle and its significance and lays out the upcoming plan for the 2022 BnB schedule. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

On December 20, 1861, the Confederate forces under General J.E.B. Stuart collided with a brigade of Pennsylvania Reserves at the small village of Dranesville in Fairfax County, Virginia. While the engagement was brief, and small in terms of troops engaged, it was the first time that U.S. forces had defeated the Confederates in Northern Virginia. For a victory-starved North, Dranesville was a light in the darkness as the first year of the war came to a close. Join Avery, Codie & Ryan in exploring this engagement and its significance to the larger context of the Civil War. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Battles and Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony reunite after a brief hiatus to discuss one of the smaller engagements of the American Civil War that ended up having deeper repercussions for how the Union high command conducted themselves during military campaigns, specifically the heavily politicized Union Army of the Potomac. Fought on October 21, 1861, the Battle of Ball's Bluff occurred along the banks of the Potomac River near Leesburg, Virginia when a Union reconnaissance under Brig. Gen. Charles P. Stone triggered a larger engagement with a brigade of Confederate soldiers under Nathan "Shank" Evans. The small battle ended in disaster for the Union and led to the formation of the Committee for the Conduct of War. The guys evaluate the fight and the consequences it had on the overall war, while making an abundance of "ball" jokes throughout that'll just drive ya nuts. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Returning with another solo installment of the Korean War 70th Anniversary Series, Avery discusses another battle during the "Attrition Period" of the conflict that followed the fighting on Bloody Ridge: the more renowned Battle of Heartbreak Ridge. After a month of fighting on a 7-mile long mass of hills that towered over the Mundung-ni & Sat'ae-ri Valleys of Gangwon Province, South Korea, the United Nations forces were successful in destroying the North Korean and Chinese defenses at the cost of 3,700 men killed, wounded, captured or missing. Avery walks us through the battle and points out some of the reasons why the ridge earned it's ominous nickname. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this retrospective episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie and Tony take a look back on their personal experiences and thoughts from the day of September 11, 2001. On that tragic day, over 3,000 people lost their lives due to the heinous terrorist attacks inspired by Osama Bin Laden. Two planes flew into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, one plane hit the Pentagon, and a final plane went down in the quiet fields outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The country and the world changed that day, and the last two decades of war came to a somber end for the United States and its Afghan allies this past August. The guys reflect on 9/11 from their personal memories of that day and the following weeks, months, years that shaped the world we now live in today. Released on the 20th anniversary, this episode is a retrospective commemoration to a world event that has impacted our lives and our society since. So strap in and join your the B&B fellas as they take a look back on the day the world never forgot.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this solo episode of Battles & Banter, Avery briefly discusses the Battle of Bloody Ridge that was fought during the Korean War. 70 years ago today, the battle began on August 18, 1951 between the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division/35th ROK Infantry Regiment and conglomerated North Korean units on a massive ridgeline located in the Gangwon Province of South Korea. The battle was fought due to the North Koreans having observation posts too close to the UN lines, and the big brass decided that the hill and ridge formations in the vicinity needed to be secured as the infamous Peace Talks took place many miles away in Kaesong. By September 5th, nearly 1,000 South Korean and almost 3,000 American soldiers had been listed killed/missing, wounded, or captured; the North Koreans sustained roughly 15,000 casualties, 4,000 of which were killed outright. Avery highlights the battle as the beginning of the "Attrition" period of the Korean War, where warfare would resemble something more out of the 1910s rather than the 1950s; Bloody Ridge would be the first of many fruitless battles to come before the war would end so stay tuned for more!</p>]]></description>

Not only was the battle Meade's first time commanding the Army of the Potomac, but he also took command just two days before the bloodiest battle of the American Civil War. Avery & Codie discuss Meade's highlights throughout the battle while they take on the old romanticized narrative of the campaign and how Meade was depicted.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony dive into a multi-episode analysis of the extremely significant Petersburg Campaign of the American Civil War. In June 1864, Union General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant began to shift his focus toward the city of Petersburg, Virginia. Acting as the supply hub south of Richmond, Petersburg's railroad lines kept men and material flowing to the Confederate capital of Richmond and Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia still entrenched in their Cold Harbor defenses. Due to it's strategic value, Petersburg would become the setting of the major climax of the eastern theater of the war. The guys talk about the Union crossing of the Chickahominy and James Rivers, and the first initial assaults on Petersburg that resulted in the beginning of a ten-month siege of the city. The guys also discuss what constitutes as a success in relation to the Union failures to take the city while it was at it's most vulnerable. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Battles and Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony take on one of the most decisive naval battles in U.S. military history: The Battle of Midway. Fought between June 4-7, 1942, the United States Navy squared off with the best the Imperial Japanese Navy had to offer. The same Japanese aircraft carriers that participated in the battle were the same ships that had delivered the devastating blow at Pearl Harbor nearly seven months prior. At Midway Atoll, just a few miles west of Hawaii, American sailors and airmen gained their first decisive victory against the Japanese Empire, marking a significant turning point in the Pacific Theater of World War II. The guys discuss the most significant aspects of the battle amid the usual banter, so strap in for a good time. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On another solo installment in the "Korean War 70th Anniversary" series, Avery picks up with the second part of the Chinese Spring Offensive that took play in April-May of 1951. After the intense Chinese assaults at the end of April, there was a temporary lull in the fighting between May 1-14 where both sides consolidated their forces and defenses for the next phase. 175,000 Chinese and North Korean troops struck at the right flank of the U.S. Eighth Army on the eastern front of the peninsula. Those six days of fighting saw the Communist forces have initial success, but eventually smash against hardened U.N. defenses, especially those of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division. By the end of May, the Chinese and North Korean forces were in full retreat and the steps toward the truce talks beginning were finally taking shape. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

So for this episode, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by their friend, Rebekah Ryer, to discuss the first military engagement of the "War Between the States" and how it all played out. This episode not only delves into the battle, but the events that led up to it and the lasting ramifications of Fort Sumter not just in the context of the rest of the Civil War, but in our collective American Past as well. This was a good time for the BnB team and were happy to drop this on the 160th anniversary of the battle itself. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As 2020 winds down, the Battles & Banter team dish out their final episodes of the year. Avery & Codie are joined by Patrick McGuire of the "History Things Podcast" and Rich Condon of "Civil War Pittsburgh" to talk about the climax of one of the most overlooked campaigns of the American Civil War: The Battle of Nashville. Part of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign of 1864, the fighting around the famous Tennessee city between December 15-16 signaled not only an end to the campaign, but the end of John Bell Hood's Confederate Army of Tennessee as an effective fighting force. It was perhaps the most devastating military defeat for the Confederacy during the entire Civil War, which is probably why it is one of the least preserved major Civil War battlefields in the country next to Franklin just a few miles away. The guys talk about the campaign and the lasting consequences of the Union victory that marked the beginning of the end for the Southern Confederacy. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone! Hope Thanksgiving went safe and smoothly for all of you out there. On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery and Codie discuss one of the most harrowing and incredible battles in American military history: The Battle of Chosin Reservoir. 70 years ago on the shores of a man-made lake in North Korea, 15,000 U.N. forces, most of which were U.S. Marines, were attacked and surrounded by over 60,000 Chinese soldiers of the 9th People's Liberation Army. From November 27th to December 17th, the UN X Corps troops had to fight for survival in subzero temperatures against an enemy who attacked at night and outnumbered them almost 4 to 1. Avery & Codie discuss the fighting around the reservoir itself, the breakout of the UN X Corps from encirclement and one of the most successful military evacuations in history at the port of Hungnam. This battle would become noted for its extraordinary circumstances and along with the debacle at the Ch'ongch'on River, would change the war in Korea forever. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As we move into Thanksgiving 2020, many of us might find it difficult to be thankful for anything in this dumpster fire of a year while others might be the exact opposite. However, 70 years ago in North Korea, many soldiers of the UN forces would be in the same boat in more ways than one. Thanksgiving Day 1950 was followed by a massive onslaught from the Chinese 13th Army as they smashed into the U.S. Eighth Army at the Ch'ongch'on River (Nov. 25 - Dec. 2, 1950). This marked the beginning of the Chinese Second Phase Offensive, the result of which saw the Chinese deal the UN forces a decisive defeat and transform the Korean War into an entirely new conflict. Join Avery for his solo presentation of one of the most chaotic blunders in American military history. Enjoy and stay safe out there!</p>]]></description>

On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery & Tony pine for an absent Codie but keep the ship level nonetheless by tackling the Battle of Britain, which was fought from July 10th to October 31st, 1940. 80 years ago, the skies over Great Britain were a battleground between the British Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe. The battle would mark a significant turning point for the Allied forces as the British held their own against the might of the German war machine. However, the battle also marked the beginning of 'The Blitz', which was the devastating bombing of London & other civilian targets by the Germans. Avery & Tony highlight the layout of the fight, and talk the pros & cons of both the British defense and German attack. They also talk A LOT about planes so hang in there. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Join Avery on another solo episode that's part of Battle and Banter's Korean War 70th Anniversary Series, detailing the Battle of Unsan. Taking place between October 25th and November 4th, 1950, the fighting that took place around the North Korean village of Unsan, some 50 miles north of the Ch'ongch'on River, marked the beginning of hostilities between the United Nations forces and the Communist Chinese Forces (CCF) during the Korean War. It was also the first time during the war that a significant group of Chinese and American forces engaged each other in a major battle. The battle would prove to be one of the first Chinese victories of the Korean War, and signaled that the tide was about to turn again...against the U.N. forces in country. Next episode will be our 50th Episode Special so in the meantime, enjoy!</p>]]></description>

It was also the first time during the war that a significant group of Chinese and American forces engaged each other in a major battle. The battle would prove to be one of the first Chinese victories of the Korean War, and signaled that the tide was about to turn again...against the U.N. forces in country. Next episode will be our 50th Episode Special so in the meantime, enjoy!</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In what could be described as the scariest year yet (for some of us anyway), the Battles and Banter family still tries to celebrate Halloween 2020 right! On this year's special, Avery is joined by horror movie expert Mary Challman of the "Monster Movie Happy Hour Podcast" to talk about a movie that used to scare the living daylights out of him as a child: <em>DOG SOLIDERS</em> (2002). Written and directed by Neil Marshall (<em>The Descent</em>, <em>Hellboy</em>), this film tells the story about a squad of British Army soldiers who do battle with a pack of werewolves in the Scottish Highlands. Avery and Mary dive into a SPOILER-heavy review of the film, as well as the events of the battle that would take place in Uath's Glen, named for the family that lived there...and who just happened to be the ones indulging in certain <em>lunar</em> activities. It's a heck of a good time so strap in for BnB's 2020 Halloween Special on a movie that truly is a horror-war hybrid. Enjoy and Happy Halloween!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On another solo episode of Battles & Banter, Avery dives into the brief but significant battle around the North Korean capital of Pyongyang that took place between the diminished forces of the Korean People's Army and the recently victorious United Nations forces that made up the U.S. Eighth Army. Between October 17-19, the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division and ROK 1st Infantry Division pushed into and conquered the North Korean capital, with many soldiers believing it meant the end of the war. Then between Oct. 20-22, a U.S. airborne operation took place to try to cut the North Koreans off from retreat, and resulted in a heated battle around the village of Yongyu between North Korean and Australian soldiers in an apple orchard. These U.N. victories would be the last bit of good news that Gen. MacArthur and his commanders received before the game changed again. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony discuss one of the most dramatic events of the Second World War: the "Miracle at Dunkirk". Taking place between May 26-June 4, 1940, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from the European mainland (codenamed Operation Dynamo) was one of the most successful military undertakings in world history. However, it came on grim tidings as France began to fall to Nazi Germany at the same time. By July 1940, Great Britain would stand alone against the Axis Powers. The guys discuss the significance of Dunkirk, while also comparing it to Christopher Nolan's 2017 film of the same name. Also, Tony possibly gets abducted by Harry Styles of One Direction, Codie sings a song that Jonathan Groff would either love or hate, and Avery effectively butchers various European accents with the help of IPAs. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery returns to the Western Front of WWI with recurring regular Justin Voithofer and historian/author Ryan Quint to discuss the vicious fighting and legacy of Belleau Wood, the battle that earned fame for the United States Marine Corps in June 1918. Today, Belleau Wood is the location of the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and the resting place of nearly 2,300 Americans who gave their lives for their country, and ultimately other countries as well. Avery, Ryan & Justin highlight the significance of the battle, and why people should care about it today outside of the Marine Corps', who have immortalized it as beginning of the USMC as we know it today. Unfortunately, ignorance is prevalent right now in the U.S., and we here at Battles & Banter want to make it clear that men who gave the last full measure of devotion at Belleau Wood ARE NOT LOSERS. So if you have never heard of Belleau Wood and want to know more, this episode is a good place to start. Enjoy.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today is the 75th Anniversary of the announcement of the Japanese surrender ending WWII, which became heralded as Victory in Japan Day or V-J Day. On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by Justin Voithofer to talk about the events that seemingly led to that announcement: the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima & Nagasaki. Perhaps one of the most hotly debated events in world history, these bombings were the first and (hopefully) last instances of nuclear weapons being used on people. The guys talk about the popular history around these bombings and dissect the #1 question that has haunted historians for years: was there any other alternative?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery once again is solo for his third installment of the Korean War series. Currently in its 70th Anniversary, the Korean War was only a few weeks old by this point in July of 1950. Things were not going well for United Nations forces on the ground who were fighting against the North Korean People's Army. For the American units arriving on the Korean Peninsula, they were unprepared, poorly trained and ill-equipped for what awaited them. As August loomed closer, the American & South Korean forces had to fight more delaying actions to buy time for a massive defensive line to be set up in the valleys and mountains around the southeastern port city of Pusan (present-day Busan). Avery briefly describes the events that led to the climactic battle at the Pusan Perimeter, and points out some of the more overlooked aspects of that dark summer month of July 1950. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

Avery was joined by fellow Star Wars nerds Julia Wall, Mary Challman and Jeff Martin as they helped him celebrate his 28th with a four-hour long Skype call and the subsequent discussion about all things Star Wars that followed. The gang dissects the Battle of Naboo from all angles: the diversionary role of the Gungan Grand Army, the incredible leadership of Padme Amidala, the craziness of a 9-year-old Anakin Skywalker in a space battle, and the "Duel of the Fates" itself, Darth Maul vs. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Tune in if you're a fan of a galaxy far far away as this was a good time! Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony conclude their Overland Campaign series by discussing the final battle before the transition to the Petersburg Campaign: the Battle of Cold Harbor. Perhaps the most misunderstood battle of the campaign, popular history has heralded Cold Harbor as Robert E. Lee's last great battlefield victory and the clash that gave Ulysses S. Grant the moniker of "BUTCHER" in both southern and northern newspapers alike. The guys take a stab at these myths while also dissecting this crucial engagement and it's larger importance in context with the Civil War. Also, Codie has perhaps the greatest introduction in BnB history...so far...so strap in for an awesome ride. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

The Korean War is currently in it's 70th Commemoration and Avery wants to cover as much as possible to help bring attention and awareness to one of the most overlooked and bats**t crazy military conflicts in U.S. history.

The guys discuss this mostly overlooked engagement of the Overland Campaign and why it is so important to the bigger outlook of things in 1864.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this unique episode of Battles & Banter, Avery goes solo on this one to complete a spur-of-the-moment episode on the 70th anniversary of the United States' first battle with North Korean troops during the Korean War: the Battle of Osan. On July 5th, 1950 an infantry battalion of the 21st U.S. Infantry Regiment and a howitzer battery of the 52nd U.S. Field Artillery Battalion took on nearly 5,000 North Korean troops & 34 tanks just outside the South Korean village of Osan, 25 miles south of Seoul. Avery discusses the groundwork that led to the conflict on the Korean Peninsula and eventually, Task Force Smith fighting for their lives outside of Osan. Since this is the first solo episode, we'll treat it like an experiment; if you like it, there will be more and if not...well that's not up to you! Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

On this episode, the guys talk about the horrendous scene of combat that took place at the "Mule Shoe" Salient at the center of the Confederate line. Between May 12-13, 1864, the Union Army of the Potomac & Confederate Army of Northern Virginia engaged in 22 hours of sustained hand-to-hand combat in the pouring down rain! The guys try to make sense of such a harrowing display of carnage on the battlefield, while keeping calm and carrying on. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this special episode of Battles & Banter, Avery is joined by recurring guest host Jeff Martin to discuss a piece of American history that has not been heavily examined until recently: the 1985 raid and bombing of the MOVE Black Liberation group by the Philadelphia Police Department. In these uncertain times, it is important to examine the past and hopefully learn the lessons it can teach us. In this episode, Avery & Jeff discuss the forgotten standoff between police and MOVE, and examine what led to the police dropping an aerial bomb on a Philadelphia neighborhood. DISCLAIMER: the point of this episode is not to get political or offend certain parties out there, but to bring this topic to light and relate it to current events. It's an emotional and sensitive subject, but we still hope you enjoy.</p>]]></description>

The guys discuss the shifting of the armies as they began the fighting in the more open terrain around Spotsylvania, as well as various foods, drink and Codie's seemingly flawless transformation into Michael McDonald.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On May 5-6, 1864, the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia clashed in the thick, dense woodlands of Spotsylvania & Orange Counties; an area that was known as "The Wilderness" (the site of the previous year's battle at Chancellorsville). This engagement was also the first time that Robert E. Lee was pitted against Ulysses S. Grant, and it marked the beginning of the bloodiest military campaign of the entire American Civil War. On this episode, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by Rebekah Ryer and Jeff Martin to hash out the beginning of the 1864 Overland Campaign, and Avery's favorite Civil War clash. The gang discusses the horrors of the battle, the role of leadership on both sides, and how the Union achieved a larger success at the Wilderness than history has given them credit for, as well as Grant's big ol' d**k! Strap in for one of our most fun episodes yet! Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

He's joined by the World Champion of Frederick, Maryland himself, Patrick McGuire of "History Things with Pat", to discuss one of the most appalling battles of World War I: Passchendaele. Known for it's thick rains and death-dealing mud, the battlefield of Passchendaele was one of the most heart-wrenching and horrific settings for the British Expeditionary Force during the First World War, especially for the Canadian and ANZAC forces that also participated in the battle. Avery & Pat also discuss the upcoming war film "1917" and speculate how Passchendaele could tie into it, considering that the battle took place that year. Enjoy & Happy Holidays!</p>]]></description>

First of all, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by the one and only Rich Condon of "Civil War Pittsburgh" and "Pennsylvania in the Civil War" to talk about the Battle of Fort Necessity. Not only known for being the first major battle with George Washington in command, Fort Necessity was also the beginning of the first large-scale world war: The Seven Years War, or more locally known as the French & Indian War. Just a disclaimer that this episode will sound a little different because Audacity sucks sometimes and audio issues hit hard. Hence, the entire episode is shot from Rich's perspective, who single handedly saved the podcast from annihilation. It was still a good time and hope you all enjoy the ride. If you don't, sorry not sorry. Cheers!</p>]]></description>

On the very first Halloween special of Battles & Banter, Avery is joined by Patrick McGuire of "History Things with Pat" to have some fun celebrating the spooky season with a Fictional Battle special episode. On the docket for this episode: The Battle of Hadley's Hope, a terraforming colony built by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation on the planet of LV-426. In other words, we're doing "Aliens" tonight. Avery reenacts the entire movie pretty much as Pat sits back in awe and recounts his fear of little, gray aliens and close encounters. It's a good time so enjoy! And Happy Halloween!!!</p>]]></description>

On this episode, the guys cover the Battles of Titan & Wakanda, as seen in the movie "Avengers: Infinity War". Avery was emotionally scarred the first time he saw that movie in May 2018, and is still recovering from "Avengers: Endgame" this year, so Jeff offered to come on the show and help talk Avery through their experiences. Hence, the two friends sit down, discuss the battles that took place in Infinity War, what their favorite moments were, what their MARVEL 'All-Star Team Up' looks like, and how all this nerdy banter relates to real-life military situations. Strap in for a good time!</p>]]></description>

Over the course of six weeks, the American Expeditionary Force lost over 26,277 soldiers killed in action, and over 95,786 wounded. The casualties for the French, Siamese & German forces engaged in the battle were equally as high. Justin gives his perspectives on the battle and recollects his personal experiences of visiting the World War I battlefields during the Centennial Events last year in 2018, all of which Avery reacts to with a mixture of amazement and jealousy.

The guys debate the question of whether or not South Mountain was just a skirmish that led up to the bloodiest single day at Antietam, or was actually a decisive victory of the Union Army of the Potomac. Justin tries to get promoted to series regular, Codie starts hearing things, and Avery pines for Tony's return from the wonderful world of Disney. All in all, an excellent episode!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Another bonus episode has dropped featuring Battles & Banter's very own Codie Eash, who gave a lecture on Union General Alexander Hays & the rise of Anti-Confederate Sentiment. The audio is taken from Codie's lecture of which he gave at the 2019 History Symposium at the Gettysburg National Military Park Visitor Center. This will be a continuation of the "Battles for Civil War Memory", which the guys hope to return to soon in a larger, feature-length episode. For now, Codie examines precisely what happened on the day of July 3, 1863 at Gettysburg, how it was remembered by those who observed and participated, and the ways it impacted many veterans' reflections on Gettysburg's status as a site of a United States triumph, as well as a major Rebel defeat. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

The episode will be the audio of a lecture given by B&B's very own Codie Eash titled 'The Old Keystone State Speaks Today': Gettysburg's Pennsylvania Veterans Reunion of 1889. Listen as Codie discusses what those PA veterans present at the reunion said and did 26 years after the costly Battle of Gettysburg, as emotional memories flowed through speeches about combat, death, union, treason, slavery and emancipation. Along the vein of the 'Lost Cause' episode, Codie's lecture touches on the 'Battle of Civil War Memory', and how it was an ongoing conflict in the years following the war. This will hopefully be the first of many specials that will be interspersed between the regular formatted episodes! Enjoy!</p>]]></description>
