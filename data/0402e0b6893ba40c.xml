The concept of narrative is a very powerful tool when applied to photography. In this video I explore three different examples of photographers using narrative to communicate visually in book form.

   <media:description>My NEW film simulation presets are 40% off! https://tedforbes.sellfy.store/

I've been shooting with the new Sony A7r V for the last week - this is a very interesting camera with one of the most advanced autofocus systems of any mirrorless to date. Cameras like the Canon R5 and Nikon Z9 have had expanded subject detection for a while, but Sony has now incorporated a dedicated processor. This processor acts as a neural engine for autofocus and subject recognition using AI.

   <media:description>This year I was invited to the iPhone 14 keynote at the Steve Jobs Theater. Afterwards I had a rare opportunity to  go inside Apple Park to test the new iPhone 14 Max Pro and talk to Francesca Sweet, Worldwide iPhone Product Line Marketing Manager and Jon McCormack, Vice President of Camera Software Engineering about the camera system, 48 megapixel sensor and the Photonic Engine in the new iPhone 14.

Check out Jon McCormack on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/jonmccormackphoto/

Special thanks to Apple for inviting me to come make this video!

   <media:description>Now - even deeper pixels. I’ve been using the iPhone 14, Pro and Pro Max models for the last week and I want to share my experience with you so far in this video.

00:00 Intro
01:21 iPhone 14 Models Pro and Pro Max
02:09 Build Quality
02:27 differences between models
03:00 Dynamic Island
03:53 Customizable Lock Screen and Always On Display
05:02 OLED displays and brightness
05:23 Emergency Features SOS and Crash Detection
05:37 iPhone 14 Cameras
06:49 Photonic Engine
07:39 Video and Action Mode
08:26 New 48 Megapixel Sensor
11:07 My thoughts on the new cameras

Watch more iPhone videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlnfZ3NGRro&amp;list=PLGEE7pGLuppRc3M5ncslcBqCR2yHScNqy&amp;ab_channel=TheArtofPhotography

The new iPhone 14 models feature brand new camera systems and faster processors enabling much better imaging performance. The new Photonic Engine allows for Deep Fusion before the compression stage. This allows a higher level of image quality with efficient processing speeds.

With new emergency features, the new A16 processor, the new dynamic island and better battery life - is the iPhone 14 worth the upgrade? Depends on what your needs are but so far I’ve been very impressed with these phones.

I’ve been shooting the new Hasselblad X2D for a few weeks now and I’m really excited to share my initial impressions in this video. Hasselblad has finally announced the new X2D as well as three “V series” lenses - a 38mm f/2.5, 55mm f/2.5 and a 90mm f/2.5 - all are considerably lighter and much quieter than the first generation lenses.

The X2D features a new 100MP, BSI sensor with phase detection autofocus. There is a new top level screen, high resolution EVF, tiltable rear touch screen, in-body image stabilization, a built in 1TB SSD drive and other new features discussed in this video.</media:description>

   <media:description>My NEW film simulation presets are 40% off! https://theartofphotography.tv/presets/

I've been shooting on the Canon EOS R7 for about a month. I think its probably my favorite option for an APS-C camera on the market right now. Canon have really done a nice job on this. The Sony a6600 and Fujifilm X-T4 are really nice options as well, but I think when you factor in the features vs price point - the R7 is tough to beat. This is my full review with image and video samples.

1:45 How good are Canon Mirrorless Cameras?
